<HEADLINE> Cards' Plummer Says Thumb's Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Three days after what he called one of the  
worst performances of his young career, Jake Plummer said Wednesday 
that his sore right thumb has improved and he's ready to forget 
that dreadful Sunday afternoon in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, who sprained the thumb in the preseason, was able to  
take the most snaps yet in practice on Wednesday as the Arizona 
Cardinals prepared for their home opener Monday night against the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get the reps,'' Plummer said, ``especially on the  
blitz drill. It's not as fast a game, but it's the fastest we have 
during the day. It's good to be able to see that stuff happening in 
front of me. It felt good to be able to get out there again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin had said it was more a lack of practice time  
than the injured thumb that has led to Plummer's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jake did more today,'' Tobin said. ``It's still got some  
soreness to it, but I think it's better and we expect him to be 
ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 19-16 loss to Miami, the third-year quarterback threw  
four interceptions. He completed 11 of 27 passes for only 112 
yards. The last interception, on a ``Hail Mary'' pass on the final 
play of the game, could be excused. Plummer had no excuses for the 
other three. 
</P>
<P>
	In two games, he has seven interceptions and one touchdown pass.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm not throwing how I was in camp or how I was last  
year,'' he said. ``I have an injury. You have to deal with it. My 
main thing is I don't want there to be an excuse. I don't want that 
to be the reason I threw three picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was throwing to a wide-open guy, and it came out  
fluttering and it went high and it was intercepted, then yeah, I 
could blame it on my thumb and say my grip wasn't right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't what happened last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a couple of poor decisions,'' Plummer said. ``The thumb  
has nothing to do with the decision-making process. That was my 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said he was trying to force things.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we'd have a shot to make big plays against the defense  
last week,'' he said. ``What happened with me is I thought every 
play was a big play. It's over, though. We're going to get over it 
and come into this week ready to make some big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said he has to shrug off his bad afternoon or he won't  
be ready for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have bad games and I'm going to have great  
games,'' he said. ``If I come in after a great game and think I'm 
so high and mighty, that's when you get knocked down the next week. 
If I come in with a bad attitude and moping and have a chip on my 
shoulder, sad and mad about this throw and that throw, then I'm not 
going to play up to my potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, Plummer has been bothered by a sore  
groin, which has hampered his trademark scrambling ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you think about it, the more apt it is to hurt,'' he  
said, ``and if you don't think about it, it kind of goes away.''

<HEADLINE>  Dutch Journalist Killed in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- As international peacekeepers worked to  
restore order to East Timor, a Dutch journalist was killed and two 
other Western reporters escaped an armed attack without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The attackers in both incidents remained unidentified Wednesday,  
although they appeared to be linked to pro-Indonesian militias that 
began rampaging across the territory after East Timorese voted 
overwhelmingly for independence in an Aug. 30 referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Sander Thoenes, 30, a correspondent for the London-based  
Financial Times, had been in Dili less than two hours Tuesday when 
he hired motorcycle driver Florindo Araujo for a tour of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Araujo said he took Thoenes to the suburb of Becora, where they  
approached a roadblock staffed by at least six armed men wearing 
the gray uniforms of the Indonesian police. 
</P>
<P>
	The two turned around, but some of the armed men gave chase,  
firing warning shots and eventually shooting out the motorcycle's 
rear wheel. Araujo, who fled, last saw Thoenes lying in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes' mutilated body was found later. His death was believed  
to be the first killing of a foreigner since the intervention began 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen have vowed to kill Westerners, whom they accuse of  
helping East Timor break free of Indonesian occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Federation of Journalists expressed outrage  
Wednesday over Thoenes' death, calling it a blatant attempt to stop 
journalists from reporting from East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Lambert, editor of the Financial Times, called Thoenes  
``one of the FT's finest foreign correspondents and a wonderful 
friend and colleague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also issued a statement, calling Thoenes' death  
``a tragic reminder of the dangers'' faced by East Timor's people, 
the international peacekeepers and the journalists there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international media must have the freedom and security to  
shine a spotlight on events in East Timor,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes was the newspaper's Jakarta correspondent, and  
previously had worked as its Central Asia correspondent based in 
Almaty, Kazakstan. He also worked for The Christian Science Monitor 
and the Dutch news magazine Vrij Nederland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's spokesman,  
Fred Eckhard, said Thoenes ``died in the act of seeking the truth 
about the calamity that has been inflicted on East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister, said he knew Thoenes  
well because the journalist had interviewed him several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very, very sorry to hear this news. And I very much  
regret this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second incident, in the hills near Becora, a car carrying  
London Sunday Times correspondent Jon Swain and Chip Hires, an 
American photographer for the Gamma agency, was attacked by men in 
military uniforms, armed with M-16 rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hires said the men shot out the tires of their car.  
</P>
<P>
	``They say, `Get out of the taxi,' and we think OK, that's  
really it,'' Hires told Associated Press Television News. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed men began hitting their driver with their rifle butts,  
Hires said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took one good shot and basically his eye came out of the  
socket,'' Hires said. The armed men then started shooting in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them told the journalists to run away, so they fled to a  
nearby forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The two waited until dark and called the Sunday Times on Swain's  
cell phone. Australian troops eventually rescued them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hires said the armed men were wearing Indonesian military  
uniforms and appeared to be Indonesian soldiers, who have backed 
the pro-Indonesian militias. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they're rogue units, because if that's the overall  
politics it's a rogue army,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pharmaceutical Chief Survives Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milan Panic, the former leader of Yugoslovia,  
has beat down a shareholder revolt that tried to oust him from the 
drug company he founded in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	But Panic can't relax yet.  
</P>
<P>
	The flamboyant, outspoken businessman still faces a civil  
lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
alleges he misled investors about the prospects of an experimental 
drug. The suit seeks to prohibit Panic (pronounced PAHN-eech) from 
running any public company. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic has sidestepped turmoil for years. He paid $600,000 to  
settle a federal securities charge in 1991 and millions more over 
the last few years to settle six sexual harassment suits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Panic won his latest confrontation to remain  
chairman of ICN Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	About 37 percent of shareholders who cast ballots voted to  
remove Panic as chairman, far short of the two-thirds majority 
needed. The revolt was led by the company's largest shareholder, 
Heartland Advisors of Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic, a Serb-born American businessman who served as Yugoslav  
leader for eight months in 1992 and 1993, on Wednesday faced many 
of his biggest critics at the annual meeting of his ICN 
Pharmaceuticals held in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Heartland president William Nasgovitz said Panic's many legal  
problems and his arrogant style has hurt ICN's stock, which has 
fallen more than 37 percent since July. Nasgovitz said the Costa 
Mesa, Calif.-based company needs new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic, who charged that Nasgovitz is trying to hurt ICN with his  
attack, said the company's sales and profits are at record levels. 
Panic said he does not know why the stock has slipped so badly. 
</P>
<P>
	ICN said Wednesday's its second-quarter results fell below  
analyst forecasts. The company, which sells more than 40 percent of 
its drugs in Eastern Europe, has been hurt by a currency collapse 
in Russia, where it sells many of its products. About half of ICN's 
$439 million in sales last year came from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should spend more time selling the stock than building  
profits,'' Panic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokerage firm officials and securities analysts at the meeting  
also expressed frustration with Panic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your feigning ignorance implies a lack of responsibility,''  
Patricia Loepker, portfolio manager with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, told 
Panic. She said ICN's stock is down because the company's 
performance has fallen short of Wall Street projections, and Panic 
has done poorly at communicating with investors about changes 
affecting the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic said the SEC's lawsuit, which followed a 4 1/2-year-long  
investigation, has no merit. The SEC initially accused Panic of 
insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation targeted Panic's sale of $1.24 million of ICN  
shares in December 1994, after the company allegedly learned its 
bread-and-butter product, the antiviral drug Ribavirin, would not 
be approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hepatitis 
C. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news wasn't revealed to investors until February 1995.  
ICN's stock fell 41 percent in six days, to $13.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC eventually dropped the insider trading allegation, but  
on Aug. 11 of this year, the commission filed suit in California 
alleging that Panic and other top executives made fraudulent 
statements about Ribavirin. The suit seeks a $500,000 fine and try 
to prohibit Panic from serving as an officer of a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ribavirin, sold under the name Virazole, is now used in more  
than 40 countries including the United States to treat herpes, 
influenza, chicken pox, hepatitis, and AIDS. In June 1998, the FDA 
approved a potent drug cocktail that includes Ribavirin to treat 
hepatitis C patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic acknowledges his company has a reputation problem. ``The  
problem is investor relations and what you perceive of us not what 
we are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic has settled six sexual harassment suits including one for  
$3.5 million from his former secretary. Last year, a court ordered 
him to pay child support for a son he fathered with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Panic paid $600,000 without admitting wrongdoing to  
settle an SEC charge of making false and misleading statements 
about Virazole for treating AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Schott Pleased With Shaniowa's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chuck Schott was pleased when Shaniowa won the Iowa Breeders'  
Oaks at Prairie Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott wasn't the breeder, nor does he own, train or ride the  
3-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
	What he did was save her life at birth by giving her  
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Actually, it was mouth-to-nostril. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Aug. 21 at Prairie Meadows at Altoona, Iowa, Shaniowa  
won the Iowa Breeders' Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58-year-old Schott, the horseman's liaison for the track,  
was manager at Bruce Thoroughbred Farm at Perry, Iowa, when the 
filly was foaled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the middle of the night,'' he recalled. ``I had  
closed-circuit television in my room and I saw the mare (Southern 
Myth) go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he went to the barn. There, he found a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``The foal was hip-locked,'' Schott said. ``She was stuck. So I  
pulled her out. She had suffocated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, who worked at the farm of Doug and Mary Bruce before  
retiring two years ago, had seen this ``happen four or five times 
before. Generally, it doesn't work. I can think of two I saved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott ``blew in one nostril while I held (blocked) the other  
nostril. It's better than blowing air into the mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first foal Schott saved didn't turn out to be much of a  
racehorse. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaniowa, owned by Dr. Philip Burford of Wichita, Kan., did not  
win in two starts as a 2-year-old last year. She earned $580. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, she seemed to get an her second wind. She opened her  
campaign with a 9-length win April 29, and she has four wins, two 
seconds and a third in 10 starts this year, with the biggest 
victory coming in the Iowa Breeders' Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaniowa, who had made all of her starts at Prairie Meadows,  
paid her own way with earnings of $83,324. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of fun to see her run so well,'' Schott said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schott got a chance to come to her aid because Burford wanted  
the filly, who was conceived in Kansas, to be foaled in Iowa so she 
could be eligible for the Iowa-bred purse supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	Often there is criticism of horsemen and horse owners because of  
fatal injuries -- especially to horses such as Ruffian, Go For Wand 
and Prairie Bayou on national television -- and to career-ending 
injuries to such stars as General Challenge and Victory Gallop, 
also on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsemen might often seem callous because death and injury are  
quickly put behind them, at least publicly. Racing, however, is a 
risky business, and if you're in it, you best look ahead every day 
-- or get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuse of horses, of course, does occur.  
</P>
<P>
	But Schott's successful effort is just one example of thousands  
of professionals -- from hot walkers to the top level -- who are 
dedicated to the welfare of horses ranging from a second-chance 
filly such as Shaniowa at Prairie Meadows to a superstar filly such 
as Silverbulletday at the nation's major race tracks.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Suspended Nebraska wingback Shevin Wiggins  
pleaded innocent Wednesday to a charge of sexual assualt of a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, accused of fondling a 14-year-old girl in July,  
appeared briefly with his lawyer, Terry Dougherty, and entered his 
plea in Lancaster County District Court. Judge Paul Merritt set a 
tentative trial date of Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, who will turn 25 on Monday, is accused of fondling the  
girl outside a foster home where she lived late July 25 or early 
July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, Floyd Brown III, 22, is accused of touching the  
girl and her twin sister. He pleaded innocent Wednesday to two 
counts of sexual assault of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexual assault of a child is a felony punishable by up to 5  
years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins and Brown are free on $10,000 bonds.  
</P>
<P>
	University rules bar Wiggins from the team while the charge is  
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, who was listed as a starter before his suspension, was  
part of Nebraska's ``miracle catch'' that led to a victory at 
Missouri two years ago and kept the Huskers' undefeated record 
intact. Wiggins kicked Scott Frost's pass in the end zone and Matt 
Davison made a diving grab before the ball hit the ground to send 
the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskers return to Missouri for the first time since the  
famous catch on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, a native of Palmetto, Fla., graduated in May with a  
degree in consumer science. The NCAA granted Wiggins another year 
of eligibility in April. Wiggins, who has a reading disability, was 
recruited in 1994 but sat out while gaining academic eligibility. 
He redshirted in 1995 and played the last three years.

<HEADLINE> Senate Overhauls Energy Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With only five dissents, the Senate voted  
final approval Wednesday of a $288.9 billion defense bill that 
would overhaul the Energy Department and tighten security at 
nuclear weapons labs. It also contains the biggest military pay 
raise since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, viewing the proposed energy  
reorganization as a congressional overreaction to allegations of 
Chinese nuclear spying, has said he might recommend a veto of the 
bill to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But other administration officials said such a veto could be a  
problem, given the 4.8 percent across-the-board pay raise and other 
politically popular military readiness increases embedded in the 
huge bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There're obviously things in the bill that we like -- the pay  
raise, some readiness things,'' said White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. ``So we're going to look at this; and when we have a 
decision, we'll let you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, margins of passage in both House and Senate were  
far above the two-thirds needed to override a veto. Wednesday's 
Senate vote was 93-5. The House approved the measure 375-45 last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would set up a separate, semiautonomous agency  
within the Energy Department -- the National Nuclear Security 
Administration -- to oversee the government's nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said it would undermine the authority of the energy  
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first overhaul of the Cabinet agency since it was  
created 22 years ago during a time of long gasoline lines and other 
energy shortages prompted by an Arab oil embargo. The department at 
that time also became custodian of the government's three nuclear 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent pay raise, which would take effect next Jan. 1  
for the nation's 1.4 million active-duty military, is 0.4 
percentage points higher than a military pay increase President 
Clinton proposed in the fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also improves pension programs and increases retention  
benefits in an effort to help the Pentagon ease severe problems in 
recruitment and re-enlistment. Overall, the bill earmarks $8.3 
billion more in spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 
than Clinton had recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure ``would do more for our men and women in uniform  
than any other bill considered by Congress in at least a decade,'' 
said Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin agreed with criticism that the bill could undermine  
efforts by Richardson to manage nuclear research programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Levin added, ``I believe that a strong secretary of  
energy may be able to overcome these difficulties and address the 
department's problems in an effective manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson plans to meet with Clinton to discuss shortcomings in  
the bill, said Energy Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress had the right idea, it passed the wrong  
reorganization plan,'' she said. ``This proposal damages 
environmental protection, threatens worker health and safety and 
jeopardizes national security and counterintelligence reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, said later that, given the lopsided vote in both 
chambers, ``Secretary Richardson should cease and desist running 
around saying the sky is falling in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of this country have spoken through their elected  
representatives, and they want this tough legislation,'' Warner 
said in an interview. ``In my judgment, the president will not veto 
this bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., a sponsor of the  
reorganization, said the change would enhance national security, 
not blur lines of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said Clinton should sign it ``so we can soon look back  
on this day and say we finally did something to move DOE and our 
national security in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization plan grows from months of controversy about  
lax security at the Energy Department and the alleged theft by 
China of nuclear warhead secrets from U.S. weapons labs, dating 
back 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure say the new agency would streamline  
control over nuclear weapons programs and provide increased 
accountability for security and counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has argued the new agency would be given too much  
autonomy and would interfere in security and counterintelligence 
improvements he already has made in response to Chinese espionage 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting against the defense bill were Sens. Barbara Boxer,  
D-Calif.; Russ Feingold, D-Wis.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Herbert Kohl, 
D-Wis.; and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., did not vote. Sen. Slade Gorton,  
D-Wash., voted ``present.''

<HEADLINE> Green Bay's Young Secondary Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mike McKenzie isn't well-known around the  
NFL just yet. If he helps the Green Bay Packers stop Randy Moss and 
the Minnesota Vikings, the rookie cornerback will get noticed in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not the only one. Last spring, the Packers spent their  
first three draft picks on Antuan Edwards, Fred Vinson and 
McKenzie, three defensive backs who played with underachieving 
college programs in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	GM Ron Wolf hoped the trio could quickly mature into defensive  
backs capable of contending with Moss, Randall Cunningham and the 
Minnesota Vikings' high-flying offense, which beat Green Bay twice 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew they wanted us in here to try and slow (Moss) down,''  
McKenzie said. ``My confidence is up, but we've been getting up for 
this weekend for a while now. You just want to do your job when it 
matters the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie has emerged as a starter for the Packers, while Edwards  
and Vinson both made solid contributions in Green Bay's first two 
games. But all their early success won't mean much if the Packers 
can't stop Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed, the task for which they 
were acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to scare these guys by telling them how great  
(Moss) is,'' veteran safety LeRoy Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told (McKenzie), 'If you want to be an elite corner, go out  
Sunday and have a great game, and you'll be on the cover of every 
newspaper and every television in America if you go out and shut 
Moss down.' So he likes that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before their 37-24 loss to the Vikings on a blustery Monday  
night last October, the Packers were rolling toward their third 
straight NFC title with a 4-0 record and the league's top-ranked 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings proceeded to embarrass Green Bay. Cunningham threw  
for 442 yards, more than any opponent in the Packers' 80-year 
history, and Moss, Carter and Reed torched an undermanned and under 
prepared Packers secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss snapped Green Bay's 25-game home winning streak, but  
more importantly, it illuminated the Packers' weaknesses in the 
defensive backfield. They surfaced again and again throughout the 
season, until San Francisco's Terrell Owens caught a game-winning 
touchdown in the heart of the Green Bay defense during the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Diminutive Packers cornerbacks Tyrone Williams and Rod Smith  
were abused by the rangy Moss and Carter. Williams is back for 
another try, but Smith and former starter Craig Newsome are gone, 
and Green Bay's trio of rookies is in their place. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the star of the draft has been McKenzie. While nagging  
foot injuries severely limited the amount of time Edwards and 
Vinson could participate in minicamps and training camp, McKenzie 
has been throwing his weight around since the week after he was 
drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie even played with a broken hand during training camp,  
and his hard-hitting tactics were so impressive that Wolf didn't 
have qualms about trading Newsome to San Francisco and handing 
McKenzie his starting spot days before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Moss) looks real amazing on tape, but I haven't played  
against him,'' McKenzie said. ``I'm going to go out there and press 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards and Vinson have played more on obvious passing downs,  
and both are progressing the way coach Ray Rhodes hoped they would. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young guys have been working hard, and I feel good about  
the young guys,'' Rhodes said. ``This is going to be on-the-job 
training all year for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students' midterm exam comes up on Sunday. Edwards can't  
wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the reason we're here. That's what you live for, big  
games and big players coming in,'' Edwards said. ``That's the type 
of player I am.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Beuerlein Taking Pounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Steve Beuerlein's numbers do not bode  
well for the final 14 weeks of the Carolina Panthers' season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two games. Eleven sacks. Seventeen other knockdowns in the  
pocket. Several crushing shots on scrambles outside the pocket. One 
piece of torn cartilage in his left knee. Countless bumps, bruises 
and scrapes on his arms, legs and torso. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not exactly an ideal existence for an NFL quarterback. It's  
even less desirable when you're 34 and in your 13th season in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk to Beuerlein, however, and the impression is he doesn't  
really mind all the pounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason,'' he said with a shrug and a smile,  
``I've been blessed with a body that can take a beating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, what has happened in the first two weeks of the season  
is nothing unusual for Beuerlein, as evidenced by the Ed Block 
Courage Award. Voted on each year by the players, the award goes to 
someone who displays perseverance in overcoming adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three years of the franchise, the Panthers voted  
the award, in order, to Brett Maxie, Lamar Lathon and Tshimanga 
Biakabutuka -- all for battling back from serious knee injuries that 
required surgery. Last year the award went to Beuerlein simply for 
surviving the constant onslaught he faced while starting at 
quarterback over the final 12 weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve takes a pounding. He's one tough cookie,'' wide receiver  
Muhsin Muhammad said. ``But I'll tell you what. You see him take 
some of those hits and you know he's got to be in serious pain, but 
he comes back in the huddle and he's relaxed and calm. He's a real 
leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By his own admission, the 6-foot-3, 220-pound Beuerlein is not  
the most agile quarterback to ever play the game, so he has grown 
somewhat accustomed to getting knocked around in the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``My style is I'm going to take a lot of hits,'' he said. ``It's  
me. It's the way I play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also plays the game with a high degree of efficiency.  
Beuerlein has started 21 games for the Panthers and completed at 
least 50 percent of his passes in 19 of those contests, including 
the last 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Beuerlein completed 63 percent of his passes last year, tying  
him for the best mark in the NFL, and he's hitting at a 55-percent 
clip in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	He has thrown at least one touchdown pass in a club-record eight  
consecutive games, and has yet to get intercepted more than twice 
in a game with Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach George Seifert said he has no reason to be overly  
concerned about the health of Beuerlein, who suffered torn knee 
cartilage in Carolina's season-opening loss to New Orleans. 
Beuerlein said he felt he could play the rest of the season with 
the injury before getting it surgically repaired, and he got off to 
a good start, throwing for three touchdowns in last week's 22-20 
loss to Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a veteran,'' Seifert said. ``He knows how to handle  
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What does concern Seifert, however, is the Cincinnati Bengals  
(0-2). Seifert said Sunday's home game against the Bengals and 
their active defense represents another stiff test for Beuerlein 
and the offensive line charged with protecting him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got another crew coming in here that disrupts,'' Seifert  
said of the Bengals. ``In fact, they might be more disruptive than 
the other two teams we've played.''

<HEADLINE>  Justice Dept. Sues Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department sued the nation's  
tobacco industry Wednesday, seeking billions of dollars from 
cigarette makers it accused of waging a 45-year campaign ``to 
preserve their enormous profits whatever the cost in human lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They placed profits above the public health,'' Attorney  
General Janet Reno said as her department filed a civil suit in 
U.S. District Court here against the major cigarette-makers and 
research and public relations institutes they funded. ``The 
cigarette companies realized -- at least since 1953 -- that the truth 
poses a mortal threat to their businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged the companies have conspired since the 1950s  
to defraud and mislead the public. The industry concealed data that 
showed nicotine is addictive and smoking causes disease, sponsored 
and publicized biased research and suppressed development of safer 
cigarettes in violation of federal anti-racketeering law, the suit 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoking is the nation's largest preventable cause of death and  
disease, and American taxpayers should not have to bear ... the 
staggering costs,'' Reno said. Federal health plans spend more than 
$20 billion a year treating smoking-related illnesses, which take 
400,000 lives a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said ``the tobacco companies should answer to  
the taxpayers for their actions. The taxpayers of our country 
should have their day in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesmen questioned the government's legal arguments  
and motives. They promised to fight in court rather than settle, as 
they did in agreeing last year to pay state governments more than 
$200 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This blatantly political lawsuit is ... the height of  
hypocrisy'' given how long ago the government warned of health 
dangers from smoking, said Greg Little, associate general counsel 
of Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette-maker. 
</P>
<P>
	The state lawsuits involved Medicaid payments the states made to  
the poor. The federal suit involves Medicare for the elderly and 
military and veterans health insurance paid directly by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also formally announced the closing, without  
charges, of a nearly 5-year-old criminal investigation of whether 
tobacco companies lied to Congress or regulatory agencies about the 
addictiveness of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names Philip Morris Inc.; Philip Morris Companies;  
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; American Tobacco Co.; Brown &AMP; Williamson 
Tobacco Corp.; British-American Tobacco P.L.C.; British-American 
Tobacco (Investments) Ltd.; Lorillard Tobacco Co. Inc.; Liggett and 
Myers Inc.; the Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Inc., and the 
Tobacco Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing company documents, acting Assistant Attorney General  
David W. Ogden alleged the conspiracy began with a meeting of 
cigarette chief executives at the Plaza Hotel in New York in 
January 1954. They ``agreed there to wage a long-term public 
relations campaign based on fraud and based on deception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades, they repeatedly and consistently denied that  
smoking cigarettes causes disease despite their knowledge that it 
does ... denied that cigarettes are addictive even though they have 
long known and deliberately exploited the addictive properties of 
nicotine,'' Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their goal was to create doubt in the minds of the American  
public and to maintain an open controversy in public debate,'' 
Ogden said. ``If they could raise false doubts in addicted smokers 
about the risks of smoking, few would muster the strength to 
quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 131-page lawsuit quoted Brown &AMP; Williamson general counsel  
Addison Yeaman as stating in 1963 that ``we are in the business of 
selling nicotine, an addictive drug.'' But it said Brown &AMP; 
Williamson decided to withhold its research on nicotine 
addictiveness from the U.S. surgeon general when he was preparing 
his first warning about smoking and health in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	When the surgeon general finally concluded in 1988 that nicotine  
is addictive, the Tobacco Institute attacked the report saying the 
``claims that cigarettes are addictive contradict common sense,'' 
the suit noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden said the lawsuit could only recover amounts proven to have  
resulted from illegal conduct. He said the federal civil 
racketeering statute places no limit on how far back in time the 
government could go in forcing the companies to disgorge any 
ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Lung Association applauded Reno's move as overdue.  
But the National Association of Manufacturers said it set a bad 
precedent for industries ``that fall out of political favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading cigarette producers traded down Wednesday on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris Cos. was off more than 3 
percent, or by $1.12 1/2, at $34.50 a share and RJR Reynolds Tobacco 
Holdings was off more than 4 percent, or by $1.31 1/4, at $27.18 3/4 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not settle,'' said Little, of Philip Morris. ``This  
lawsuit is much weaker than the state lawsuits.'' Ogden, however, 
said the federal suit followed the same legal principles as the 
state suits and was based on internal company documents those 
lawsuits forced the companies to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Manufacturers issued a statement  
supporting the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NAM is very concerned that this lawsuit is being brought  
for all of the wrong reasons,'' said Michael E. Baroody, senior 
vice president, policy and communications. ``It appears to be 
motivated mostly by a desire for revenue and changes in industry 
practices that could not be reached through the free market or the 
normal legislative or regulatory process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said Reno told a 1997 Senate hearing  
that the federal government does not have an independent case 
against the tobacco companies, but Reno said she was talking only 
about the state-administered Medicaid program.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on a crowd of students as  
they walked home from a South Side high school, injuring two 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the wounded students was seriously hurt in the attack  
Tuesday afternoon outside Fenger High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said today no one had been arrested. Witnesses said the  
gunman was a 17-year-old boy who had been expelled from the school, 
said Lt. Joe Murphy. Police did not say why the student had been 
expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said the shooting took place as members of one large  
group of students began arguing with a smaller group. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman was in the smaller group and fired six to 12 shots  
from a handgun into the larger group, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if the gunman was aiming at, or even knew, the  
students who were shot, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 14-year-old girl was hospitalized today in good condition with  
a wound to her foot. A 15-year-old boy was released after treatment 
for an abdominal wound.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted for Phony Memorabilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A sports memorabilia dealer has been convicted of  
defrauding collectors by selling thousands of dollars of goods 
bearing the forged autographs of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Austin, 42, of Newport Beach, Calif., was convicted  
Tuesday of eight counts of mail fraud by a federal jury. Sentencing 
was set for Dec. 10. Each count carries a maximum sentence of five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses against Austin included Anthony Alyinovich, one of 11  
people who had pleaded guilty earlier in the federal government's 
Operation Foul Ball crackdown on sports memorabilia forging. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyinovich, of Chicago, acknowledged that he was the boss of a  
staff of forgers who signed the names of Michael Jordan and other 
big-time sport luminaries to jerseys, basketballs and other sports 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stars whose phony signatures ended up on items included  
Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, Troy Aikman 
and Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, an owner of Overtime Prowear Inc., insisted that he had  
done nothing wrong and had not realized the items Alyinovich sold 
him were forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyinovich was accused of creating and selling more than $2  
million worth of bogus goods. He was placed on five years of 
probation and fined $30,000.

<HEADLINE> Oracle Unveils New Portal Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. (AP) -- Oracle Corp. today introduced  
technology that helps companies quickly build corporate intranet 
Web sites that are viewed by employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle will use what it calls ``portlet'' technology, a standard  
method for assembling the components that make up a corporate Web 
site, such as company information, search features and software 
applications used by employees. The technology also makes it easier 
to produce corporate Web sites that have a common look and feel, 
the company said in a statement. The portlet technology is designed 
to work with Oracle's database applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies such as Microsoft Corp., Lotus Development  
Corp., and SAP AG are promoting their own standardized corporate 
portal technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., is the leading producer  
of database software for businesses using computers or desktop 
machines linked in networks.

<HEADLINE> Bikers Blend Leather, Mormonism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- They don't drink, they don't smoke, and  
they carry extra copies of the Book of Mormon in their saddlebags. 
</P>
<P>
	The Temple Riders are mostly Mormon, but they're as proud of  
their big bikes and black leather as any other motorcycle gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just a part of the motorcycling community,'' says Ted  
Gregory of Plain City, 40 miles north of Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't be fooled, though. There are some major differences  
between your local Hell's Angels and Utah's most orthodox 
motorcycle gang. 
</P>
<P>
	First of all, the Temple Riders don't ride on Sunday. They don't  
drink, smoke or curse. But the mostly over-60 members do wear 
traditional motorcycle garb, plus gray-blue dress vests. And they 
keep their duds -- and their bikes -- immaculate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group is very clean, very well groomed,'' said Gregory,  
62, who joined the group about 10 years ago. ``They just stand out; 
they've got that glow about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the group's rides, including one or two cross-country  
trips a year, make a stop at the Mormon temple, and some of the 
bikers wear hats bearing the image of Salt Lake City's most famous 
landmark. The group's biggest rides include 95 bikes, almost all 
ridden by couples who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	For most, the fellowship is what's important.  
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is they're just a good bunch of LDS people,''  
said president Cliff Beattie, a Salt Lake architectural consultant 
who at 55 is one of the group's youngest members. He joined about 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're way over on the other side from the Hell's Angels,''  
Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple Riders was founded in 1987 by Frank and Catherine Reese,  
avid bikers who were frustrated because so many groups rode on 
Sundays. By the following spring, they had a handful of couples and 
a regular newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Missionaries on motorcycles are nothing new. The Christian  
Motorcyclists Association was formed in 1975 and has about 60,000 
members preaching the word around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Temple Riders -- who claim members in Idaho, Texas and  
California as well as all over Utah -- are more about lifestyle than 
gospel. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Beattie said, more non-Mormons are also turning out.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to be LDS to ride,'' he said. ``All we ask is  
that when people ride with us they keep to the same standards we 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the group is not sanctioned by the church, members say  
Mormon leaders are well aware of their activities. Many members 
have been members of the faith's lay clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do mission work on the trips,'' but it's not the main goal  
of the group, said Ted May. 
</P>
<P>
	May, 64, took up motorcycling shortly before he retired from  
banking. He joined the Temple Riders about a decade ago. Members 
sometimes have playful competitions to see how many copies of the 
Book of Mormon they can hand out at rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't try and push it, but if people come up and ask who  
we are, we tell them. And they always do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	May remembered one time when their ``hogs'' almost got them in  
trouble when they pulled up to a Mormon temple. 
</P>
<P>
	``They called the police on us!'' he said. ``They were worried  
this big motorcycle gang was rolling in to the temple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, a group member had already notified local police  
that the Temple Riders were in town, May said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police said don't worry about them, they're just a group  
of old Mormon high priests. They won't cause any trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Info in Tripp Case Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A prosecutor does not have to release a  
summary of documents and witnesses he used to persuade a grand jury 
to indict Linda Tripp on wiretapping charges, the state's highest 
court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Appeals on Tuesday overturned a judge's order  
involving State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, had argued for the  
material to be made public alleging that political pressure from 
the Clinton administration drove the grand jury to investigate 
whether Ms. Tripp broke Maryland law by recording phone 
conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	However, public information law ``does not trump or override the  
traditional rule of grand jury secrecy,'' according to the opinion 
written by Chief Justice Robert Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp was indicted in July on charges of illegally taping a  
December 1997 phone conversation with Ms. Lewinsky and for 
illegally directing her attorney to disclose its contents to 
Newsweek magazine. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation  
into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Extends Veterans' Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Veterans Affairs Department would be  
required to extend long-term care to some veterans and reimburse 
veterans for emergency treatment at non-VA facilities under a bill 
passed Tuesday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, approved 369-46, directs the VA to increase  
home and community-based care options and the percentage of the 
medical care budget directed to such care. The six-month limit for 
providing adult day health care would be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, said its author, Veterans Affairs' health  
subcommittee Chairman Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., is ``a bold step 
forward for our veterans in terms of long-term care, emergency care 
and putting the health-care system on a sounder footing.'' It now 
goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the VA must provide extended-care services to  
veterans judged to have 50 percent or greater service-connected 
disability. Such veterans get the highest priority for placement in 
VA nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis on long-term care reflects a veterans population  
that is decreasing in numbers but increasing in age. The VA 
projects it will serve 3.6 million patients in the coming fiscal 
year, up from 2.7 million in fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	VA Undersecretary for Health Kenneth Kizer told Stearns' panel  
earlier this year that the department is ``generally supportive'' 
of the extended-care program, and the bill ``would serve to clarify 
eligibility for VA long-term care services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would  
cost $141 million in fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, and $1.4 
billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also allows the VA to make up some of the lost revenue  
by increasing co-payments on prescription drugs for illnesses not 
related to military service. It encourages the VA to foster ties 
with the private sector by extending from 35 to 75 years the length 
of time the VA can lease facilities to private renters. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, supported by major veterans groups, would  
improve the health-care access of those injured in combat, giving 
them the same priority as former prisoners of war. It extends a VA 
program providing counseling for veterans who were subject to 
sexual harassment while in the service. 
</P>
<P>
	It bars the VA from closing more than 50 percent of the beds  
within a particular section of a facility without justifying that 
decision to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2116.

<HEADLINE> Brown's Sentencing Reset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown's sentencing on a  
misdemeanor conviction for vandalizing his wife's car was reset 
Wednesday to Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing originally was scheduled for Thursday, but Brown's  
lawyer, William Graysen, asked for time to prove that the vandalism 
conviction should not fall under domestic violence guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, was acquitted in Hollywood Municipal Court on Sept.  
10 of a misdemeanor charge of making terrorist threats against his 
wife, 25-year-old Monique Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a man is found not guilty of domestic violence, he should  
not be given a domestic violence punishment,'' Graysen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cleveland Browns running back faces a maximum of six  
months in jail. Prosecutors have said that, because domestic 
violence was involved, other conditions could be imposed, including 
probation, restitution and domestic violence counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was prosecuted on the terrorist threat charge even though  
his wife recanted allegations that she made to police on June 15, 
saying he had threatened to snap her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown had gone to a neighbor's house, called 911 and  
reported that her husband had threatened her life and that there 
was a gun in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	She said later that she had made the call and lied to get  
attention because she believed her husband was having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown never denied that he smashed the car windows with a  
shovel.

<HEADLINE> Phil Collins To Tour With Big Bands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Phil Collins makes it clear that while he was  
inspired by Buddy Rich to put together a big jazz band and play 
drums, he is not equating himself with that great drummer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was exposed to the sound of the Buddy Rich Band in 1966,''  
Collins recalled. ``It was a live album from Las Vegas. It had a 
`West Side Story' medley. I just fell in love with that whole sound 
-- the idea of a drummer pushing the band along like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he heard the record, ``I went out and tried to find as  
much as I could of his stuff,'' Collins said in an interview. ``On 
the way, I discovered Count Basie. I was yet to join Genesis. I was 
in a blues band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins met Rich in 1986. ``He asked me to produce a big band  
album for him. I was going to do it. A year later he died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, he took singer Tony Bennett and a 20-piece big  
band on a tour of Europe. The tour came about because the Montreux 
Jazz Festival, near where Collins lives in Switzerland, offered him 
one night to do whatever he wanted. ``That pushed me to say to 
myself, `Stop talking about it. Let's do it.' It led to me getting 
a band together at last and led to us doing the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things come to you in your life. You say, `Do I get scared and  
back away from this or see if I can have a go?' I had to invent my 
own phonetic notation. I don't read music. I play by ear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Collins toured with a big band throughout America and  
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be doing this on and off for the rest of my  
life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Hot Night in Paris,'' released by Atlantic in August, is  
from shows recorded in Europe, mainly Paris. Included on the album 
are songs from Genesis and Collins' solo CDs, plus ``Pick Up the 
Pieces'' from the Average White Band and ``Milestones'' by Miles 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to learn an awful lot. That was part of the enjoyable  
challenge of it. Playing with brushes was a first. You play with 
much more dynamics in a big band than you do in rock 'n' roll. 
Sometimes you have to be so quiet. Other times you have to be 
shouting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said he practiced harder before going out the second  
time, trying to make what he had thought was a light touch still 
lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to tour with a big band next summer. ``My music  
director, trumpeter Harry Kim, comes out on tours. He has got a 
good sense of who's the right arranger for each song. On the new 
album, we've got arrangements by Sammy Nestico, who used to arrange 
for Basie, and John Clayton Jr., another well-known jazz 
arranger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing songs is ``sort of hit or miss,'' Collins said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You take a song you think will lend itself to a big band  
arrangement. For some reason it doesn't quite live up to 
expectations. Sometimes it goes into the area the music has to 
avoid at all costs -- elevator music. Usually the arranger will say, 
`This isn't going to be what you want.' We don't go through the 
expensive exercise of arranging something that's not going to make 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins admits he should be thinking about composing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did a couple of tunes for big band we've got in the book.  
There's a lot of room for improvement,'' he said. ``Benny Goodman, 
Glenn Miller, Basie had to find a voice that was original and 
suited them. It takes a bit of time to find your own individual 
style. You don't want to be derivative.''

<HEADLINE> Some Tips for Avoiding Y2K Scams / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's something a little scary about the year  
2000, and it has nothing to do with the remote possibility of 
elevators malfunctioning, planes disappearing off radar screens or 
banks losing track of customers' life savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest fear right now, at least among government officials  
and consumer groups, is not any Y2K computer bug, but scam artists 
bugging unsuspected consumers and playing on concerns that the 
nation's computers might crash. (The fear is that computers may 
mistake ``00'' for 1900 instead of 2000.) 
</P>
<P>
	Some scams that have surfaced recently: someone pretending to  
represent a bank calling to ``confirm'' credit card or bank account 
numbers; someone selling bogus magnetic strips to make credit cards 
immune from computer problems; someone offering to hold individuals 
savings and investments in a ``safe place'' until after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one scam has targeted the elderly. Someone posing as a  
government employee claims senior citizens will no longer get their 
Social Security checks and that paper money will be useless, then 
persuades his victims to send in their cash so he can turn it into 
gold and mail it back to them. Of course, he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered reports of such incidents have even prompted Donna  
Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to write 
a letter to syndicated columnist Ann Landers warning consumers to 
be ``skeptical, careful and vigilant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Y2K presents a perfect opportunity for criminals to cash in on  
fears of the unknown...,'' she wrote this month. ``No bank would 
ever ask for your credit card number over the phone, but a scam 
artist would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With several weeks to go before the new millennium, 99 percent  
of the nation's federally insured banks, thrifts and credit unions 
have successfully completed Y2K preparations, according to the 
FDIC. The Securities and Exchange Commission also estimates that 99 
percent of the brokerage firms and securities transfer agents are 
Y2K compliant. And the same percentage of the nation's power 
companies are ready, according to U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet that hasn't stopped the scam artists from attempting to  
incite fears and to cash in on them -- even at this late date. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups and government agencies have issued warnings  
about Y2K fraud and have put out publications to educate consumers 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the many publications still available: ``Year 2000 and  
You,'' which features Y2K preparedness information compiled from 
the FDIC, Federal Trade Commission, the President's Council on Year 
2000 Conversion, the American Red Cross and the Council of Better 
Business Bureaus. It's available through the BBB Web site 
(www.bbb.org/library/y2k.html) or by writing the BBB at 4200 Wilson 
Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22203. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC's consumer advisory is available by calling  
1-800-934-3342 or visiting its Web site (www.fdic.gov/about/y2k). 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC's Y2K fraud advisory, ``Y2K? Y 2 Care: Protecting Your  
Finances from Year 2000 Scam Artists,'' is available on FTC Web 
site (www.ftc.gov or www.consumer.gov/y2k/) or by calling the FTC 
at 1-888-USA-4-Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forum for Investor Advice, a nonprofit organization of  
financial institutions, offers a free brochure, ``Keeping a Cool 
Head About Y2K,'' through its Web site (www.investoradvice.org) or 
by calling 1-800-200-1819. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the many suggestions offered by these groups:  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't give out personal information over the telephone or on  
the Internet unless you're familiar with the business or initiated 
the contact. 
</P>
<P>
	--Contact your financial institution immediately to report any  
suspicious request for confidential account information. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be alert for any unauthorized charges to your credit card as  
well as unauthorized debits to your checking or savings account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Review all account statements on a timely basis.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Farmers Struggling After Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Willie Joyner's farm is soggy and  
rotting. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two thousand dead chickens lie deteriorating in heaps of  
wet, stinking sawdust -- the remnants of a chicken house deluged by 
Hurricane Floyd. Seventy percent of the farm's cotton crop is 
mangled. The top leaves of the tobacco plants -- the ones Joyner 
counted on for his profit -- hang limp and bruised as his workers 
slog through knee-deep mud to salvage what they can. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of it's hit to some point or another,'' the Nash County  
farmer said as he drove his battered pickup from field to soggy 
field Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And he may be one of the lucky ones, North Carolina agriculture  
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring counties, entire fields along with machinery and  
curing barns brimming with tobacco remain submerged, the tobacco 
leaves inside destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials estimate at least 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million  
chickens and 500,000 turkeys died in eastern North Carolina 
floodwaters. More than $243 million in crop damage and $90 million 
in farm structural damage has been reported statewide, and 
officials say that's just a sliver of Floyd's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was the latest blow after a summer of heatwaves,  
drought and the plunge of commodity prices for everything from 
cotton to turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	``You add this flood on top of it, and it's a pretty critical  
situation,'' said Blake Brown, an agricultural economist at North 
Carolina State University. ``It just comes at a time that was 
already difficult for farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many, tobacco was to be the saving grace.  
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Tyson, Nash County's agricultural extension agent for  
tobacco, said about 25 percent of the tobacco in his area was still 
in the fields when Floyd hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaves that did not blow down and rot were battered and bruised  
to the point they won't cure properly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco that's in the field is ripening and deteriorating  
prematurely at a very rapid rate -- faster than it can be 
harvested,'' Tyson said. ``Most of that will be lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner 44, planted 53 acres of tobacco to supplement the income  
from his 350 acres of soybeans and 150 acres of cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	Migrant workers had already pulled the first two levels of thin  
bottom leaves, the kind the cigarette companies usually buy from 
overseas. Joyner was looking forward to a nice harvest of the top 
leaves, where most of the valuable nicotine resides. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fields across from Joyner's house, workers in knit hats  
and gloves trudged through mud to strip the remaining leaves 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're going to lose is that cream of the crop profit,''  
Joyner said, shaking his head as he pulled off one spotted, wilted 
leaf after another. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of his tobacco crop was still in the field when  
the hurricane hit. The summer drought had damaged his other 
operations; Joyner lost 4,500 chickens in one day to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad situation,'' he said. ``It really keeps you not  
knowing what to do next. Do you try it another year? And, really, 
that's the only choice you have. You try it another year or you 
give up.''

<HEADLINE> Moreni Wins Tour of Spain Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Spain (AP) -- Germany's Jan Ullrich kept his lead in  
the Tour of Spain Wednesday when the 17th stage of the cycling race 
was won by Italian Cristian Moreni. 
</P>
<P>
	With four stages left, Ullrich was 49 seconds ahead of his  
nearest challenger, Igor Galdeano Gonzalez of Spain. Roberto Heras, 
another Spaniard, was third, 2:35 behind Ullrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreni went for the victory with a surprise breakaway from the  
front-running pack of 11 cyclists about a mile from the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took advantage of the fact that they were not expecting me  
to attack,'' Moreni said. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered the 140 miles from Los Bronchales to Guadalajara in 5  
hours, 33 minutes and 12 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Utah Doctor Charged With 5 Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A doctor has been charged with killing  
five elderly Utah patients by giving them massive doses of morphine 
and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Weitzel was arrested on five first-degree murder  
charges Tuesday night as he got off his private plane in Bay City, 
Texas. He was booked into the Matagorda County Jail early Wednesday 
morning and posted $100,000 bond 30 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	The five elderly patients died between December 1995 and January  
1996. At the time, Weitzel was the director of a 
geriatric-psychiatric unit run by Houston-based Horizons Mental 
Health Management Inc. at the Davis Hospital and Medical Center in 
Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other patient died in the two years the unit was open.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was our determination that five of the six deaths were the  
direct result of the administration of the drug morphine, which was 
administered or caused to be administered by Dr. Weitzel,'' Davis 
County Attorney Melvin Wilson said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel's attorney, Peter Stirba, said his client is innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that difficult questions of medical judgment  
are now the subject of a criminal prosecution,'' Stirba said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel now practices primarily at Matagorda General Hospital in  
Bay City, a city about 75 miles southwest of Houston. He also 
shares an office at the Red Butte Clinic near the University of 
Utah.

<HEADLINE> Passion, Putting May Be Difference  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- They eat dinner together, wear the same  
color shirts and play for the same goal: to break the Europeans' 
hold on the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But do the Americans have the passion some said they lacked in  
1997 in Spain, when they lost the glamor event for the second 
straight time? And does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it's that we are less passionate than they  
are,'' said Tiger Woods, the world's top-ranked golfer. ``We try 
just as hard as they do. I don't go to a tournament to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Desire and determination are important. So are driving the ball  
in the right spot and pitching it close to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, ranked second, said when Americans lose, people go  
on an often misguided search for reasons -- perhaps they weren't as 
united or didn't care as much as the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer might be more obvious.  
</P>
<P>
	``You play golf, and whoever plays the best wins,'' he said  
Tuesday. ``A lot of stuff is made up in the case and I think it 
does a disservice to the European team of the past, past several 
teams that have won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a bit disrespectful to their good play.''  
</P>
<P>
	With the 33rd Ryder Cup starting Friday at The Country Club, the  
favored and more experienced Americans are saying all the right 
things -- they've developed team chemistry in an individual sport 
and want to win for their country. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, they ate together at a downtown Boston  
restaurant. On Tuesday, they practiced and wore the same blue 
shirts. On Friday, they'll be rooting for players they compete 
against on a weekly basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to have to reach down inside, decide how bad  
we want it, and then go do whatever it takes,'' Hal Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans have even put behind them the issue of greater  
compensation for their efforts, which flared briefly last month and 
is now in the hands of the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about money, and it's not about anything else but  
`Let's see if the American players can beat the European 
players,''' Jeff Maggert said. ``There's a lot of pride in your 
country. It's a big motivation factor for me and for all the 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member European team is drawn from Spain, Scotland,  
England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, France, Finland and Sweden. 
That doesn't mean they have any less desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great team spirit, fantastic team spirit,'' said  
Colin Montgomerie, one of only two members of the European team who 
have played in more than one Ryder Cup. ``We flew over (from Europe 
on Monday) and we had a lot of fun on the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Jarmo Sandelin of Finland and Jesper Parnevik of Sweden,  
the Europeans seem more happy-go-lucky. And European captain Mark 
James brings a dry wit in contrast to the more businesslike public 
image presented by his American counterpart, Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's serious golf,'' James said, ``but at the end of the week,  
I'll be able to shake Ben warmly by the throat and we'll sit down 
and have a beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considering their recent failures in the Ryder Cup, the  
Americans probably have more pressure to win. A loss on their home 
turf to an underdog team that includes seven Ryder Cup rookies 
would be tough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terribly important for us,'' Crenshaw said. ``The players  
have asked themselves over a long while about what sort of effort 
they were going to put forth. It's wonderful seeing that come 
together, and it has for a pretty good while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the event will be determined by how each player  
performs as an individual. And, at this point, no one is performing 
better than Woods, who has won five of his last eight tournaments, 
including the PGA Championship at Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case two years ago when he played in his first  
Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know when you're not playing well,'' Woods said. ``You  
always hope you can find it on the range, but I didn't. I wasn't 
playing very well, and unfortunately it carried over into the Ryder 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first match with Mark O'Meara, then lost three and  
tied one as the Americans lost the event 14 1/2-13 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year I'm coming into the tournament with more of a  
positive attitude,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger at the moment is playing some of the best golf in his  
career,'' Crenshaw said. ``He's a very, very smooth engine right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one hot golfer cannot win the event by himself. It takes a  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``All one player can do is win five points, and it takes 14 1/2  
points to win,'' Montgomerie said. The last player to go 5-0 in the 
Ryder Cup was Larry Nelson in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome is likely to be determined more by how close to the  
pin a player hits the ball than by how close he is to his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans in '97, I believe, outplayed us,'' Woods said.  
``If we can make those putts at the crucial times, who knows, we 
could turn it around and get the Cup back.''

<HEADLINE> Thompson Winning Penn St. Fans Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Kevin Thompson stopped reading his  
e-mail once the ugliness started last season. Fans, already dubious 
of his talent, piled on viciously as Penn State lost big game after 
big game. 
</P>
<P>
	With one perfect pass to save the Nittany Lions' unblemished  
record (4-0) Saturday, Thompson is officially redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
	So maybe it's time to respond to a few of the more vitriolic  
e-mails? Maybe just a note that says, What do you think of Kevin 
Thompson now? 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, that's not Thompson's style. He's apparently even too  
classy to look at the congratulatory e-mails that certainly fill 
his box right now, let alone revel in them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still won't check my e-mail,'' he said. ``There's nothing  
there on the e-mail for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he did take a look, he would probably find alumni and  
students thanking him for throwing a 79-yard TD with 1:41 left to 
lead the No. 2 Lions past No. 9 Miami 27-23. Thompson put the ball 
right on Chafie Fields' hands on the first play -- despite standing 
on the sidelines for the entire fourth quarter while Joe Paterno 
played Rashard Casey, the other half of his two-quarterback system. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, and Thompson took a hit on the play, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even see the pass,'' he said. ``Either he made a  
great catch or it was an interception. After I saw white pants 
running down the field, I knew it was a touchdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as he sprinted downfield screaming, didn't he feel just a  
touch of vindication? 
</P>
<P>
	``Uh, no. Not at all. I was just happy for my team, the fans and  
the coaches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson may not admit feeling satisfaction about proving wrong  
everybody who said he couldn't win the big game, especially after 
his mediocre performances in the Lions' three losses in against Top 
25 teams last year. He finished the season with eight interceptions 
and six TDs, and the howling continued in the spring when Casey 
outplayed Thompson in the Blue-White game. 
</P>
<P>
	His father is happy to say what his son won't.  
</P>
<P>
	``At what point does somebody finally say, `Hey, maybe this guy  
is a good quarterback?''' Vince Thompson said. ``I mean, he is 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the play against the Hurricanes, the 6-foot-5,  
221-pound senior from Damascus, Md., was making his case. 
</P>
<P>
	He had completed 60 percent of his passes, thrown for four  
scores, and connected with Eddie Drummond for a 51-yard bomb that 
set up a tiebreaking field goal in the Lions' victory over 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Miami game, he moved into fifth place nationally  
in quarterback efficiency. He is 36-of-60 for 702 yards with five 
TDs and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	If those numbers seem modest, consider that he splits time with  
Casey, who hasn't been too shabby himself: 19-of-26 for 323 yards, 
three TDs and one interception, plus 71 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they both have done a great job,'' Paterno said. ``We  
would have trouble without them right now. If I didn't have that 
kind of confidence in them going into this year, we would not be 
doing a lot of the things we are doing and we would rely a little 
bit more on our running game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a lot of passing to go around -- and that 4-0 record -- the  
two-quarterback system has been easier to swallow for Thompson, who 
had a lock on the job for most of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have to work together if things are going to work  
for our team,'' Thompson said. ``We're mature. We know it's going 
to take two of us to win football games, not one or the other.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia Banking Probe Called Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators are working strenuously  
to ``uncover the full story'' behind an alleged huge 
money-laundering scheme involving the Russian mob and the Bank of 
New York, a top Justice Department official told Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been and will continue to be a complex and  
painstaking investigation,'' James Robinson, assistant attorney 
general in charge of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, 
testified at the House Banking Committee's second day of hearings 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Significant investigative resources have been and will  
continue to be expended in an effort to ensure that we uncover the 
full story behind those transactions and bring any merited criminal 
charges,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian gangsters allegedly channeled as much as $10 billion  
through the Bank of New York, the nation's 15th-largest bank. No 
one has been charged in the suspected scheme. On Tuesday, 
Switzerland's government announced that Swiss banks have frozen 
$16.8 million in accounts suspected to be linked to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the investigations in the United States and  
Switzerland, authorities in Britain, Russia, France and Austria 
also have been examining the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson noted that he could not discuss specifics of the case  
because the investigation by the FBI and federal prosecutors in New 
York City was ongoing. The investigators need to prevent people who 
are subjects of the inquiry from learning the progress of the 
investigation against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson did discuss, however, the power and scope of Russian  
organized crime and its activities in the United States. Russian 
criminal groups, which often have close ties with corrupt Russian 
businessmen, are seizing upon ``the opportunities offered by 
Russia's brand of 'Wild West' capitalism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few years, we have seen with increasing frequency  
suspicious financial transactions emanating from (Russia and the 
other) countries of the former Soviet Union, which naturally raise 
the question of money laundering,'' Robinson testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred to action by the alleged money-laundering scheme, the  
Clinton administration and key lawmakers are proposing new measures 
to fight laundering of criminal profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's package of proposals includes requirements  
that storefront check cashiers, brokerage firms and casinos notify 
authorities of suspicious activities the way banks must do. It was 
disclosed during testimony at Tuesday's hearing by the Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the banking panel's chairman, said he  
also will introduce legislation to tighten laws and ``pierce the 
veil of secrecy that for too long has made it possible'' for 
offshore financial institutions to skirt U.S. laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering may seem like a relatively modest crime, but  
it is a window into greater crimes'' that create the illegal funds, 
Leach said. He cited Russian government estimates that criminal 
groups control 40 percent of the country's economy and half its 
banking assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the Senate Banking  
Committee, said he was proposing parallel legislation to Leach's 
bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the Justice Department and the FBI have been  
dissecting the complex case for months. Last week, FBI Director 
Louis Freeh promised his agency's full cooperation to Russian 
investigators who met with him and other U.S. officials in 
Washington to discuss the suspected money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York's chairman, Thomas A. Renyi, also was  
appearing before the panel, making his first public statements on 
the alleged money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``No charges have been filed against the Bank of New York,'' he  
said in testimony prepared for the hearing. ``Neither the bank nor 
any of its customers have lost any money as a result of the 
activities in question. We have cooperated fully with the ongoing 
investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renyi said the bank had provided federal investigators with tens  
of thousands of documents and ``millions of electronic bits of 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-level executives of the bank's Eastern European  
Division, Natasha Kagalovsky and Lucy Edwards, were suspended, and 
Ms. Edwards was subsequently fired for alleged falsification of 
bank records and failure to cooperate with internal investigators. 
The two have denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis-Infected Bugs in Conn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSSINING, N.Y. (AP) -- A third case of St. Louis encephalitis has  
been confirmed north of New York City and mosquitoes carrying the 
potentially deadly virus have been found in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 12 confirmed cases of St. Louis encephalitis in  
New York City since late August. Three were fatal, all involving 
elderly victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano said Tuesday that an  
80-year-old Yonkers man has the disease. Two victims were confirmed 
a day earlier and another person likely has the virus. All are 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut officials identified the virus in mosquitoes trapped  
on a Greenwich golf course and in a crow's brain found in Westport. 
There have been no reported cases in humans in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials planned to spray both locations with insecticides  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the pesticide malathion has been used. Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani defended that choice Tuesday after Westchester 
officials said they would use a less toxic substance known as 
Anvil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is more a reaction to public relations than it is  
science,'' Giuliani said. ``Both substances are safe. There may be 
certain applications of one that are better than the other, but 
both are equally safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester's spraying will be done by helicopter over the  
southern third of the county, which includes the cities of Yonkers, 
Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Port Chester and most of White Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Spraying in Connecticut will be conducted by truck, using  
resmithrin. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis encephalitis can cause seizures, paralysis and  
swelling of the brain. It can be fatal, especially to infants, the 
elderly and people with immune deficiencies. Its symptoms include 
fever, headache and lethargy. Humans are infected through mosquito 
bites.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Banking Probe Called Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators are working strenuously  
to ``uncover the full story'' behind an alleged huge 
money-laundering scheme involving the Russian mob and the Bank of 
New York, a top Justice Department official told Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been and will continue to be a complex and  
painstaking investigation,'' James Robinson, assistant attorney 
general in charge of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, 
testified at the House Banking Committee's second day of hearings 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Significant investigative resources have been and will  
continue to be expended in an effort to ensure that we uncover the 
full story behind those transactions and bring any merited criminal 
charges,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian gangsters allegedly channeled as much as $10 billion  
through the Bank of New York, the nation's 15th-largest bank. No 
one has been charged in the suspected scheme. On Tuesday, 
Switzerland's government announced that Swiss banks have frozen 
$16.8 million in accounts suspected to be linked to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the investigations in the United States and  
Switzerland, authorities in Britain, Russia, France and Austria 
also have been examining the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson noted that he could not discuss specifics of the case  
because the investigation by the FBI and federal prosecutors in New 
York City was ongoing. The investigators need to prevent people who 
are subjects of the inquiry from learning the progress of the 
investigation against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson did discuss, however, the power and scope of Russian  
organized crime and its activities in the United States. Russian 
criminal groups, which often have close ties with corrupt Russian 
businessmen, are seizing upon ``the opportunities offered by 
Russia's brand of 'Wild West' capitalism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few years, we have seen with increasing frequency  
suspicious financial transactions emanating from (Russia and the 
other) countries of the former Soviet Union, which naturally raise 
the question of money laundering,'' Robinson testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred to action by the alleged money-laundering scheme, the  
Clinton administration and key lawmakers are proposing new measures 
to fight laundering of criminal profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's package of proposals includes requirements  
that storefront check cashiers, brokerage firms and casinos notify 
authorities of suspicious activities the way banks must do. It was 
disclosed during testimony at Tuesday's hearing by the Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the banking panel's chairman, said he  
also will introduce legislation to tighten laws and ``pierce the 
veil of secrecy that for too long has made it possible'' for 
offshore financial institutions to skirt U.S. laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering may seem like a relatively modest crime, but  
it is a window into greater crimes'' that create the illegal funds, 
Leach said. He cited Russian government estimates that criminal 
groups control 40 percent of the country's economy and half its 
banking assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the Senate Banking  
Committee, said he was proposing parallel legislation to Leach's 
bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the Justice Department and the FBI have been  
dissecting the complex case for months. Last week, FBI Director 
Louis Freeh promised his agency's full cooperation to Russian 
investigators who met with him and other U.S. officials in 
Washington to discuss the suspected money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York's chairman, Thomas A. Renyi, also was  
appearing before the panel, making his first public statements on 
the alleged money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``No charges have been filed against the Bank of New York,'' he  
said in testimony prepared for the hearing. ``Neither the bank nor 
any of its customers have lost any money as a result of the 
activities in question. We have cooperated fully with the ongoing 
investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renyi said the bank had provided federal investigators with tens  
of thousands of documents and ``millions of electronic bits of 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-level executives of the bank's Eastern European  
Division, Natasha Kagalovsky and Lucy Edwards, were suspended, and 
Ms. Edwards was subsequently fired for alleged falsification of 
bank records and failure to cooperate with internal investigators. 
The two have denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Doug and Darren Flutie Stay Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) -- Doug and Darren Flutie are very close  
and so far apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug plays to packed NFL stadiums and national TV audiences.  
Just across the border, hardly more than an hour's drive away, 
Darren toils in the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	With smoke rising from the steel mills behind Ivor Wynne Stadium  
and the crowd of 17,157 leaving plenty of room for more fans, 
Darren helped the Hamilton Tiger-Cats rout the Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers 65-15 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The next evening, Darren watched Doug lead the Buffalo Bills to  
victory over the New York Jets. Doug connected with five different 
receivers in the game, then found Darren. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk all the time; we talk about the games,'' Doug said.  
``He talks about what's going on with them on the offense. 
Sometimes I throw out suggestions. Sometimes I'm down or he's down. 
We can both relate to winning and losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, both of whom are supposedly too short at  
5-feet-10, have followed similar paths. Doug's finally has led to 
riches in the NFL. But Darren is happy in the CFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's usually a high-scoring affair,'' Darren said. ``With  
three downs, you throw the ball a lot, and there's the 20-second 
clock, so you get a lot of plays in. There's a lot of passing, a 
lot of scoring, a lot of yards, a great game -- a little lopsided 
tonight. It's a fun league to play in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darren is now in his ninth season in the CFL. In a typical year  
last season, he was second in the league in both yards receiving 
with 1,386 and catches with 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Doug cheered as receiver Darren followed him through  
high school stardom and the Boston College record books. Doug would 
like to see Darren take one more step to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if it got down to the end of the season and somebody  
needed help, maybe they could bring him in,'' he said. ``If he was 
a free agent and available ... he's not going to hold his breath 
over that. But I believe he could have a great career in this 
league, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darren doesn't think so. ``It's a done deal now,'' said Darren,  
who joined his brother in British Columbia in 1991 after stints 
with the San Diego Chargers and Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking to go back to the NFL. Maybe three or four  
years ago when I was in my prime I would have liked to have gone 
back there, just for the money, but I'm past that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug won the Heisman Trophy in 1984, spent eight years in the  
CFL after the USFL went bust and the NFL rejected him. Last season, 
he played his way to the Pro Bowl and was voted NFL Comeback Player 
of the Year after leading the struggling Bills to the playoffs. In 
the offseason, he signed a $22 million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren, after setting Boston College records for receptions  
(134), yardage (2,000) and TDs (14), played one year in San Diego, 
catching 18 passes for 208 yards and two touchdowns in 1988. He was 
released by the Chargers in September 1989 and signed as a free 
agent with Phoenix in May 1990. But he broke his foot and spent the 
year on injured reserve. The Cardinals released him at the end of 
training camp in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the brothers who played for BC wound up together at  
B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just said come up here, and we played together in British  
Columbia,'' Doug said. ``Right away we changed our offense and he 
was a big part of it. We had eight games together that season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their only CFL season together, in British Columbia in 1991,  
Darren caught 52 of his brother's passes for 860 yards and six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I signed as a free agent in Calgary, and we tried to hook  
up, but we were free agents in different years. It just never 
worked out,'' said Doug, selected as the CFL's Most Outstanding 
Player for the first of six times that season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two played against one another in the 1996 Grey Cup between  
Doug's Toronto Argonauts and Darren's Edmonton Eskimos, won by the 
Argos. 
</P>
<P>
	Now their playing days together are limited to their rock band --  
Doug on drums, Darren on guitar. They won't be mistaken for 
Creedence Clearwater Revival, but they do raise money for a charity 
established in the name of Doug's autistic son.

<HEADLINE>  Diana Ross Arrested at Heathrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Singer Diana Ross was arrested Wednesday after a  
confrontation with a security guard who searched her at Heathrow 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop diva was detained at a police station for more than four  
hours before being given a warning and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary, I was scared, I'm worried about my children and  
I want to go home,'' she told BBC-TV just before she caught the 
Concorde evening flight to New York, some eight hours after she had 
been scheduled to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old star was not charged. Police said no further  
action would be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems started shortly before Ms. Ross was to board the  
10:50 a.m. Concorde flight to New York. She passed through the 
metal detector and something she apparently was wearing activated 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensuing body search by a female guard was humiliating, she  
said through her spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reporters' questions in New York on Wednesday  
night, Ms. Ross said the guard ``was rubbing up and down my leg. I 
felt very uncomfortable. ... The woman did not apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, she issued the following statement: ``I have  
been through all the airports of the world and never been subjected 
to such an intrusive search. ... I am a huggy person, I don't mind 
being touched, but not in this way -- it was far too personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Symes, of publicists Cowan and Symes, said: ``The whole  
issue for Ms. Ross is the indignity of women when they are 
subjected to this kind of personal body search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had tried to complain to airport security staff immediately  
after the search, but had been given a leaflet about complaints 
procedure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She felt that was not good enough. She felt she had not had a  
chance to make her point,'' Symes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She then went back and approached the girl again and said,  
'How would you feel in this situation?' and actually touched the 
girl. She said it was a natural instinct to want to fight back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guard made a complaint to the police, accusing Ms. Ross of  
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The star had already boarded her flight, but was led off in  
tears. She was detained until 3:30 p.m., then released after being 
cautioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking subdued, she was escorted through waiting ranks of  
journalists and photographers and into a chauffeured limousine, 
flanked by five police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about her treatment in custody, she said: ``The police  
here are wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to Heathrow in time for the 7 p.m. Concorde flight  
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ross ran through the terminal accompanied by police and  
British Airways staff. She made no comment, the metal detector did 
not sound and, unimpeded, she ran the 150 yards to the waiting 
supersonic jet. 
</P>
<P>
	When she finally arrived in New York around 6 p.m. EDT, the  
weary-looking star was greeted by more than two dozen swarming 
members of the media. She walked directly to her limousine through 
the crowd, short-circuiting a longer route thanks to special 
provisions made by airport security.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Finish Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Wednesday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade in a lackluster session marked by investors' 
caution over the ongoing harvests. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans edged higher but volume was light amid uncertainties  
over the current crop. 
</P>
<P>
        Investors also were reluctant to trade actively in corn futures,  
with the biggest harvest weekend of the year upcoming. By the first 
of the week, the crop size will be better known. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat prices were buoyed initially by overnight export sales  
but fell back, pressured by the hard spring wheat harvest. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.69 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.10 1/4 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.12 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1/4 cent to 
$4.85 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .40 cent to 66.35 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 79.32 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose .73 cent to 45.55 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies 
rose 2.88 cents to 59.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Dell Targets Consumer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. took another step  
Wednesday in its targeting of the consumer market, unveiling a new 
advertising campaign, high-speed cable Internet access and a line 
of colorful notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Round Rock, Texas-based direct seller of computers is trying  
to branch out beyond its core market of selling PCs to business 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Mountain, Dell vice president and general manager of its  
consumer business, said the new campaign is designed to convince 
consumers the giant computer maker can handle all of their 
computing needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new television and print advertisements will begin running  
Saturday. They are short on machine specifications and long on 
generalities of benefits from using computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a new line of Inspiron notebook  
computers with more color -- blue or gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell joined with Excite@Home to offer the high-speed cable  
Internet service. It will use products from MusicMatch and Diamond 
Multimedia to offer a new digital music PC jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell calls the new campaign Dell4me. In July, the computer maker  
announced a new Internet service, called Dellnet. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, Dell has moved up from seventh to fourth in  
its share of the consumer market, according to Ziff Davis 
Infobeads.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Giles Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Center fielder Brian Giles, enjoying one of  
the best seasons by any Pittsburgh Pirates player in the last 
quarter-century, has a broken right middle finger and will miss the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles, batting .315 with 39 homers and 115 RBIs, will return to  
his California home on Thursday and won't accompany the Pirates on 
their season-ending 10-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles' 39 homers are the most by a Pirates player since Willie  
Stargell's 44 in 1973. His overall statistics are better than 
either of Barry Bonds' two NL MVP seasons with Pittsburgh, in 1990 
and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first season as a regular -- he previously was a part-time  
outfielder with Cleveland -- Giles needed one more homer to join 
Stargell and Ralph Kiner as the only Pirates to hit 40 in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm missing out on 40 homers, but it's just another number to  
me,'' Giles said. ``I didn't get all caught up in it. Still, when 
you're that close to it, you want to go ahead and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles was injured sliding into second base as he tried to break  
up a double play in the ninth inning of the Pirates' 6-3 loss to 
Houston on Tuesday night. He was 8-for-13 with two homers and six 
RBIs in his final three games and had 14 homers and 36 RBIs in his 
final 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only good thing about this is I'm only to going miss 11  
games,'' Giles said. ``It's still disappointing to not be able to 
finish out the season. You always want to be able to finish what 
you started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles' injury cripples the Pirates' bid for their first winning  
season since 1992. They were two games under .500 at 74-76 and were 
in third place in the NL Central going into Wednesday night's game 
with Houston, their final home game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles turned out to be one of the steals of the offseason,  
having cost the Pirates only left-hander Ricardo Rincon, who has 
had an off year with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been a good year for me. I had the chance to be  
an everyday player for the first time in my career and I feel I 
proved I can do that,'' Giles said. ``I had a lot of fun this year. 
I like it here, this situation is a lot better than I thought it 
would be before I got here. I don't think we're far away from 
contending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles is the fourth Pirates regular to sustain a serious injury  
this season. Catcher Jason Kendall dislocated his right ankle and 
was lost for the season on the Fourth of July, shortstop Pat Meares 
has missed all but 17 games with damaged tendons in his left hand 
and third baseman Ed Sprague broke his left hand earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's injury was the most serious. Batting .332 at the time  
of his injury, he still hasn't resumed running and probably won't 
be allowed to hit again until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's injury visibly deflated the Pirates for several days  
and they have worn his nickname, ``Kid,'' on their hats in tribute 
to him since he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players questioned how good the Pirates would have been  
if Kendall had played the whole season -- his replacements have 
barely hit .200 -- and if Meares had played more than 2 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is real close to being good,'' Sprague said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Giles, ``With all of the injuries we've had, I think we  
would have been a lot closer this year if we had stayed healthy, 
and I think we would have contended in the division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have had 20 players on the disabled list, or  
four-fifths of a normal 25-man roster. They had 13 players on the 
DL at one point, and have had players lose 1,233 games to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the season is nearly over, the Pirates won't bother  
putting Giles on the disabled list. They did activate Meares, who 
may play several games in Milwaukee and Chicago to test his injured 
hand.

<HEADLINE> Dole Wants School Locker Searches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELROSE, Mass. (AP) -- Reminiscing about her student teaching  
days while addressing harsh concerns of today, Elizabeth Dole said 
Wednesday that order must be restored to classrooms -- even if it 
means parent-approved locker and backpack searches and drug-testing 
of students. 
</P>
<P>
	``For drugs and weapons, I say: there will be no place to  
hide,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate detailed her education  
platform at Melrose High School outside Boston where she was a 
student teacher in the 1959-60 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
	She said parents should be able to choose from a ``rich  
smorgasbord of educational choices'' in deciding where to send 
their children to school 
</P>
<P>
	Dole proposed a new tax credit to encourage private support for  
public and private schools and also recycled proposals from the 
Republican Congress for ``education savings accounts'' and for 
freeing up federal education funds from federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take a look at this unwieldy stack of paper,'' Dole said,  
painting to a more than 600-page copy of the ``Clinton-Gore'' 
Elementary and Secondary Education reauthorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a joke if our system were working, but it's no  
joke,'' Dole told about 150 students, school officials and senior 
citizens in the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in her speech, she underscored her point, saying: ``The  
federal government has become a truly intrusive regulatory presence 
sapping state authority, local control and parental responsibility. 
Every hour spent on complying with regulations is time not spent 
helping teachers and students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said that if she is elected president, she would let states  
and local school districts choose how most federal money is spent, 
as long as students' performance is measured and attained. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike her rival for the GOP nomination, Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, Dole did not spell out exactly how she would leverage federal 
dollars against failing schools. Bush, earlier this month, detailed 
a formula for measuring student performance, rewarding good 
schools, and stripping bad schools of federal support. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole also wants to reinforce parents' control of their  
children's education and suggested that school-by-school results be 
posted on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	`We should allow competition to foster a rich smorgasbord of  
educational choices,'' Dole said. ``Whether it's opportunity 
scholarships for students in failing schools, or charter schools or 
home-schooling, we should empower parents to make choices as long 
as their choices get results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said schools must be made safe for students and kept  
drug-free. To attain that, she called for parent-approved locker 
and backpack searches and drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lives and bright futures of all students depend on our  
watchful care, at home and at school,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students warmly welcomed Dole to their school, where she was an  
11th grade history student teacher while earning a master's degree 
at Harvard University. They gave her a key to the city, a ``We are 
Melrose'' button and a football jersey saying ``President Dole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always looking forward to seeing the first female  
president,'' said Liz Perkins, a 15-year-old sophomore who has high 
hopes for Dole's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	During a tour of the old brick high school -- which is located in  
the same complex as a newer high school and is now used as a middle 
school -- Dole made a surprise visit to the classroom where she had 
taught. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the room,'' she said to the sixth grade English  
students who appeared shocked to see Dole with several dozen 
reporters in tow. ``It's been a few years, but it's good to be 
back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole based her education plan on her own three R's: returning  
control of schools to states and local school districts, restoring 
discipline in classrooms and reinforcing parental control over 
their child's education. 
</P>
<P>
	In advocating more local control of schools, Dole recalled  
picking through dusty police department files to assemble a lesson 
plan on the Boston police strike of 1919. ``I didn't choose this 
lesson because it was mandated by the state or by Washington,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing student population and teacher retirements over the  
next decade will necessitate the recruitment of some 2 million new 
teachers, Dole said. She called for merit pay for teachers and said 
states should ``broaden their uses of alternative teacher 
certification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's give mid-career professionals, academics, and our best  
college graduates a clearer path to working and excelling in our 
public schools,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	In what aides described as the first installment of her  
education platform, Dole also proposed: 
</P>
<P>
	--Creating a $1,000 per-year tax credit for individuals who  
donate to educational foundations helping low-income students in 
public and private schools through grade 12. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increasing tax-free contribution limits for education savings  
accounts to $3,000 a year to help middle- and low-income parents 
pay for a child's private school tuition or college education.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Sues Publishers Clearing House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida's attorney general has sued  
Publishers Clearing House, accusing the company of not doing enough 
to change the way it runs its magazine promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit charges that Publishers Clearing House preyed on  
senior citizens by sending personalized mailings with disclaimers 
that were too small to read and letting consumers think they had to 
buy magazines or merchandise to win a prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Months of negotiations with Publishers Clearing House have  
failed to produce any meaningful changes to the deceptive 
solicitations mailed out by the company,'' Florida Attorney General 
Bob Butterworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida suit seeks $40 million for Florida consumers plus  
civil penalties against the Port Washington, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana, Washington and Wisconsin also  
have sued the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth has urged Florida residents not to participate in a  
proposed national settlement, which would cover everyone who bought 
something from the company between 1992 and 1999. A hearing on the 
settlement is scheduled Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Publishers Clearing House said the company has  
been addressing Butterworth's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now contacts people who frequently buy magazine  
subscriptions to make sure they understand they don't have to buy 
something to win a prize, said Christopher Irving, the company's 
director of consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Publishers Clearing House speaks to them on the phone and, if  
they are confused, removes them from our mailing list,'' Irving 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Chips Fall; Dow Ends Off 74.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell again Wednesday, extending  
Tuesday's 225-point plunge by the Dow Jones industrial average and 
pushing the index to its lowest level in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	But strength among technology shares and smaller-company issues  
bolstered the broad market, with the Nasdaq composite index rising 
back toward record territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 74.40 to 10,524.07, about 800 points below its  
record-high close of 11,326.04 set Aug. 25. Yet even with the slide 
from record levels, the barometer of 30 major companies still holds 
a gain of 14.6 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indicators were mostly negative. But the strength  
in technology stocks helped lift the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
index by 2.93 to 1,310.51, while the Nasdaq composite rose 37.06 to 
2,858.16, about 30 points shy of a new high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.03 to 427.53.  
</P>
<P>

down 1 7/8 to 45 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com rose 1 5/16 to 28 5/8 as the most active Nasdaq issue after  
the maker of computer network products and Palm Pilot organizers

32 7/8, after the Internet service provider announced an alliance with 
Ceridian, a business services technology company. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction to a Wednesday afternoon report by the  
Federal Reserve saying ``moderate-to-brisk rates of growth'' in the

review the central bank's stance on interest rates. Investors have 
been worried that the Fed will raise interest rates for a third 
time this year to fight inflation, a move that would raise 
borrowing costs and erode corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	More worrisome Wednesday was another weak day for the dollar on  
foreign exchange markets. The dollar fell for a third straight 
session against the Japanese yen, spiraling back toward last week's 
3 1/2-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak dollar can be inflationary by making imports more  
expensive in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	With no major economic reports due until late next week, ``The

<HEADLINE> Titans' Kearse Admits Embarrassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Former Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse  
says he was embarrassed by accusations, and his eventual sworn 
admission, that he took money from a sports agent while he was 
still with the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of embarrassed after I left the University of  
Florida,'' the Tennessee Titans' linebacker said Wednesday in a 
telephone interview. ``It's something that shouldn't have happened, 
and if I went back, I wouldn't do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a sworn affidavit, Kearse has admitted to taking payments  
from Professional Management Inc., the South Carolina company owned 
by agent Tank Black, while he was playing for the Gators last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Black has denied wrongdoing. The NFL Players Association has  
recommended revoking his license for three years. University police 
at Florida are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Gators coach Steve Spurrier has banned Kearse and two other  
players implicated in the case, Johnny Rutledge and Reggie McGrew, 
from campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse said he has not tried to talk to Spurrier since the  
allegations surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the story broke, I was busy with camp and things up  
here,'' Kearse said. ``I think Johnny Rutledge went back to the 
school to try and work out and he was told not to be down there. 
I've never even tried to go down there and talk to him. Because it 
would be in the middle of their minds and it may not have made a 
difference if I go try to talk to him or whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans play the Jaguars in Jacksonville on Sunday, marking  
Kearse's first public appearance in Florida since the accusations. 
He said he still wants Gator fans to appreciate his contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have very strong feelings for the Gators,'' Kearse  
said. ``I always will. I watched them on Saturday after I got out 
of our media event. I was like, man, I miss that. I wish I was out 
there. I'm still a Gator and I always will be.''

<HEADLINE> Businesses Funding Back-Up Daycare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Deland loved her job at J.P. Morgan, but  
as her first maternity leave wound down, she couldn't find a good 
nanny. The day she called to resign, her company stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	Her employer offered a spot for her son in a backup day care  
center, where children can go if a sitter is ill, their school has 
a snow day or if the child is sick and can't go to group daycare. 
That solution gave Ms. Deland time to find a sitter, and saved 
Morgan from losing a talented worker. 
</P>
<P>
	A hot trend in child care, backup care is growing fast. Thirteen  
percent of employers now provide it, up from 5 percent in 1993, 
according to Hewitt &AMP; Associates consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton praised the idea Wednesday  
after touring a Manhattan backup center used by more than 30 
companies, from Morgan to Sony Music Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	She stood for a minute watching 13-month-old triplets who'd been  
dropped off that morning because their father -- their primary 
caregiver -- was busy with the family's move to a new house. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fills a real need that exists in the child care world,''  
Mrs. Clinton told a gathering of business leaders and work-family 
researchers. ``Productivity goes up and turnover goes down when 
employees know that their child is well taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center she visited is run by ChildrenFirst Inc., a  
Boston-based company that runs 18 backup programs nationwide, all 
for well children. A large daycare chain, Bright Horizons Family 
Solutions, runs 38 backup centers, including some that take mildly 
ill children. Fourteen of those opened in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with helping retain workers, companies find that it's  
often cheaper to buy slots in a backup center that many employees 
take turns using, than to build a costly day care center for just a 
few children. 
</P>
<P>
	Fees vary, but it generally costs companies with 300 or fewer  
employees $28,000 a year and up to buy a slot at a ChildrenFirst 
center. Building an on-site child care center can cost millions, an 
impossible price tag for small companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of ChildrenFirst's corporate clients charge their employees  
nothing for the care, while half charge a nominal $10 to $20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there are the staff-hours saved.  
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan Bank, one of the pioneers in the field, says it  
saved $820,000 in reduced absenteeism in 1996 alone by offering 
backup care for its New York employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the bank has three of its own centers nationwide and plans  
to add eight more by 2001. Some of the centers also offer separate 
rooms for mildly ill children, who can't attend group care. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to offering 20 free days a year of backup care, the  
company offers eight extra weeks to workers returning after the 
birth or adoption of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a critical juncture for people,'' said Christine  
Fossaceca, work-life director at Chase. ``They're making a decision 
about whether to return to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Deland, a lending officer at J.P. Morgan, called her nanny  
search last spring a ``show-stopper,'' saying she couldn't bear to 
leave her new baby unless she found a caregiver she completely 
trusted. 
</P>
<P>
	She even visited the backup center with a critical eye, saying  
``I went looking for problems.'' But the quality of care convinced 
her to try the stopgap solution, and after six weeks, she found a 
nanny she loved. 
</P>
<P>
	While initially created in the early 1990s by law firms for top  
attorneys, backup care is increasingly offered to lower level 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend is to offer the situation in manufacturing or call  
centers, where employees also have child care that breaks down a 
lot,'' said Roger Brown, president of Bright Horizons. 
</P>
<P>
	For Janette Hartman, who takes telephone orders for the Lands'  
End catalog, the company's backup center in Dodgeville, Wis. has 
been a godsend. Before the center was created a year ago, she had 
few options when her 4-year-old's daycare broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to leave early, or not go to work. Occasionally I could  
find a friend,'' she said. ``Now I don't have anxiety over what's 
going to happen to my child.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Bank To Be Liquidated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Creditors of the defunct Russian bank Menatep  
voted to liquidate the institution, one of the country's largest 
banks, a newspaper reported Wednesday, quoting the bank's temporary 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Menatep was dealt a crippling blow in last year's financial  
crisis, then had its license revoked in May and had all but ceased 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Menatep's current financial situation gave  
creditors no other option than to call for bankruptcy,'' temporary 
manager Alexei Karmanov told the Moscow Times, adding that 99 
percent of creditors had approved the motion in a meeting last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The creditors' decision must be considered by a Moscow  
arbitration court, which still hasn't decided the bank's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmanov said that temporary administrators would have trouble  
finding all of Menatep's assets because the bank's former managers 
withheld information on its foreign bank accounts, according to the 
Moscow Times. Menatep denied holding back any information. 
</P>
<P>
	The ailing bank's reported assets stand at the equivalent of  
$1.57 billion, which is the same amount the bank owes its 
creditors, Karmanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	But temporary managers said the bank's actual assets could be as  
low as the equivalent of $175 million, with the rest consisting of 
loans that probably won't be paid back. 
</P>
<P>
	Menatep was one of several big banks that collapsed in the wake  
of the August 1998 economic crisis, when the government defaulted 
on $40 billion of treasury debt and devalued the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Menatep account holders lost their savings after the  
bank, like many others, failed to pay out depositors, or offered 
them only a small fraction of their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Menatep is also reportedly being investigated as part of a U.S.  
probe into whether billions of dollars were laundered by Russians 
through a New York-based bank. According to some reports, Menatep 
funneled much of its money through the bank. Menatep has denied any 
wrongdoing.

``has been resolved amicably and the terms of that resolution are 
confidential by agreement of all parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, Richard Beckman acknowledges some inappropriate  
behavior on his part and is seeking counseling to address that 
issue,'' it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckman reportedly also apologized Tuesday to senior Vogue staff  
members for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, citing Conde Nast executives familiar with  
the agreement, reported Wednesday that the company would pay 
between $1 million to $5 million to Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	A company executive said told the Times that Matthews claimed  
she needed surgery for the injury to her nose, suffered during a 
meeting in June, and alleged that Beckman's actions were part of a 
pattern of questionable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurie Perl, a company spokeswoman, said the incident has not  
affected Beckman's position as Vogue publisher. She declined to 
comment on published reports that Matthews had resigned.

<HEADLINE> Circuit Board Maker Heads to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAMPA, Idaho (AP) -- Idaho circuit board manufacturer MCMS will  
open a 112,000 square foot plant early next year in Monterrey, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Downing, president and chief operating officer of MCMS,  
said Tuesday the expansion makes economic sense because labor costs 
are lower in Mexico and potential buyers in Silicon Valley are 
comfortable with products from there. 
</P>
<P>
	MCMS, based in Nampa, Idaho, the company quadrupled the size of  
its Malaysia operations this year. The company also has 
manufacturing operations here, in North Carolina and in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexico site probably will open with about 50 employees,  
Downing said, and will do simple manufacturing processes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company employs about 1,150 people in Nampa and about 2,050  
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	MCMS formerly was known as Micron Custom Manufacturing Services.

<HEADLINE> Utah Doctor Charged With 5 Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A doctor has been arrested and charged  
with killing five elderly patients by giving them massive doses of 
morphine and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Weitzel was arrested on five first-degree murder  
charges Tuesday night as he got off his private plane in Bay City, 
Texas. He was booked at the Matagorda County Jail and posted 
$100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The five patients died between December 1995 and January 1996.  
At the time, Weitzel was the director of a geriatric-psychiatric 
unit run by Houston-based Horizons Mental Health Management Inc. at 
the Davis Hospital and Medical Center in Layton. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other patient died in the two years the unit was open.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was our determination that five of the six deaths were the  
direct result of the administration of the drug morphine, which was 
administered or caused to be administered by Dr. Weitzel,'' Davis 
County Attorney Melvin Wilson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel's attorney, Peter Stirba, said his client is innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that difficult questions of medical judgment  
are now the subject of a criminal prosecution,'' Stirba said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitzel now practices primarily at Matagorda General Hospital in  
Bay City, a city about 75 miles southwest of Houston. He also 
shares an office at the Red Butte Clinic near the University of 
Utah.

<HEADLINE> Feds Set To Probe Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress will ask the president of the  
International Olympic Committee to testify next month at hearings 
on the ``culture of corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's bid for the 
1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said Tuesday the House commerce  
subcommittee on oversight and investigation will subpoena IOC 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch if he declines to appear 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said a report on the Atlanta bid, submitted to Congress  
last week by former Attorney General Griffin Bell, shows that IOC 
members often expected gifts and favors and that Atlanta bid 
committee officials willingly accommodated them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, votes were for sale, and it's got to stop because it  
muddies the whole name of the Olympics,'' he said. ``That's why 
we've got to get to the bottom of this and we've got to do whatever 
we can to restore the faith and confidence of everyone'' involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents from Atlanta's bid committee show that Samaranch  
personally received gifts that exceeded the $100 limit specified in 
IOC rules. Upton said Samaranch should explain why the rules 
weren't enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said his panel will consider ending the IOC's exemption  
from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as a possible way to stop 
the longstanding practice of gift-giving to IOC members to 
influence the selection of host cities for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	And he suggested that American businesses that provide much of  
the financial support for the Olympics through advertising might be 
willing to pressure the IOC to clean up the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials welcomed the hearings. Bell said in a  
statement that he hopes they will `encourage new discussion about 
what is good about the games and how to keep it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton's panel began looking into the Atlanta bid last summer  
following the Salt Lake City Olympics bidding scandal that resulted 
in two federal indictments and the resignations or forced 
expulsions of 10 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials submitted an initial report on their bid to  
the subcommittee last June, then agreed to revise it after 
questions were raised. Upton said he's convinced that the Bell 
report is ``thorough and final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said gifts and perks the Atlanta committee lavished  
on IOC members and their families included college scholarships, 
medical care, job offers, a metrobus, training for athletes from 
other countries, golf clubs, and pewter dishes, as well as meals 
and first class airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the Atlanta officials also violated U.S. laws on  
several occasions, by providing a firearm to a foreign national and 
by bringing more than $10,000 in cash into the country. But he said 
the statue of limitations has expired on those violations. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing with Bell's assessment that Atlanta was operating  
within an IOC bidding culture that condoned such practices, Upton 
said Atlanta officials should have ``blown the whistle'' on that 
culture rather than joining it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have to give some of these sweet gifts which under  
any normal layman's definition one would view as bad,'' he said. 
``Would they have gotten the games if they hadn't done so? I don't 
know. Maybe that's something we'll ask Samaranch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members have criticized the Bell report for suggesting  
that Atlanta was drawn into a corrupt climate that already existed. 
Italian IOC member Mario Pescante, who led Rome's losing campaign 
for the 2004 Games, accused the Americans of ducking 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't the Americans take the responsibility for the people  
who organized this strategy of bribery and corruption? Who started 
this? They did,'' Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the issue for Congress and the IOC is to ensure that  
in bidding for future games, ``cities will be chosen based on the 
merits of the games they can provide and not on the quality of the 
gifts that instead are offered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee has said it plans no further  
investigation of Atlanta's bid. The USOC forwarded a copy of Bell's 
revised report to the IOC last week and said in a cover letter that 
no further USOC action is planned.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Focus on Africa Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The annual gathering of world leaders at  
the United Nations is focusing rare but welcome attention on the 
problems that plague Africa -- and prompting criticism that a double 
standard exists when the world responds to a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents and diplomats from Africa and elsewhere decried the  
bloody conflicts this year in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone and 
challenged the United Nations to mount a response similar to its 
ambitious efforts to rebuild Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen in the past few months the kind of resources that  
the world has been willing and able to mobilize in the Balkans at 
short notice,'' Ghana's foreign minister, James Victor Gbeho, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see the same response to the tragedies of Africa,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton addressed many African concerns in his speech  
to the General Assembly, calling for an all-out battle to fight 
poverty, the spread of AIDS on the continent and mass killings and 
displacement around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next 10 years in Africa, AIDS is expected to kill  
more people and orphan more children than all the wars of the 20th 
century combined,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced he was seeking another $100 million for AIDS  
prevention, counseling and care in Africa and would convene a 
special White House meeting to try to accelerate the development 
and delivery of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and other 
diseases that disproportionately affect the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country can break poverty's bonds if its people are  
disabled by disease and its government is overwhelmed by the needs 
of the ill,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, said African development  
depended on its liberation from debt and increased overseas aid, as 
well as private investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Africa's debt is essentially nonpayable and certainly  
unsustainable under any sensible growth-oriented macroeconomic 
scenario,'' he told the assembly Tuesday. ``There is an urgent need 
to release more resources from debt servicing to financing 
development and creating conditions that encourage inflows of 
private foreign investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a special briefing Tuesday to members of the Security  
Council on the situation in Congo, Zambia's President Frederick 
Chiluba said the warring parties ``have so far complied'' with a 
cease-fire agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Chiluba, who helped negotiate the cease-fire that  
ended a yearlong civil war between rebels and President Laurent 
Kabila, urged the council to dedicate adequate money and manpower 
and to mandate for a U.N. peacekeeping force to move into Congo to 
monitor the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict drew in a half-dozen African countries, displaced  
tens of thousands of people and threatened the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
	``In other regions of the world where conflicts have occurred,  
no expense has been spared in the pursuit of peace,'' Chiluba told 
council members. ``This body needs to do the same now for the 
(Congo) and for Africa.''

<HEADLINE> Breast-Feeding Said Linked to IQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The bonding between breast-fed children  
and their mothers is partly responsible for higher intelligence, 
but a new study finds most of the children's IQ gain comes from 
breast milk's nutritional value. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by University of Kentucky nutritionist James Anderson  
looked at 20 different studies comparing the brain development of 
infants who had been breast-fed with that of infants who had been 
given formula. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study confirms that breast-feeding is accompanied by about  
a five-points higher IQ than in bottle-fed infants,'' Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within that increase, Anderson said, he and his associates were  
able to separate the benefits from mother-infant bonding from the 
purely nutritional benefits of human milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our best estimates are that maternal bonding and the decision  
to breast-feed account for about 40 percent of that increase, but 
that 60 percent -- 3.2 points -- are related to the actual 
nutritional value of the breast milk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's study is being published in next month's edition of  
the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	An accompanying editorial by Ricardo Uauy and Patricia Peirano  
cautions that none of the studies examined by Anderson were 
randomized, meaning they may not sufficiently account for the fact 
that breast-feeding mothers tend to be wealthier, better-educated 
and more concerned about infant development. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Anderson's study, intelligence is benefited by  
breast-feeding for up to six months. Children who are breast-fed 
for less than eight weeks show no IQ benefit, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was partially funded by Martek Biosciences Corp., a  
Winchester-based company that manufactures plant versions of two 
fatty acids found in breast milk, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
arachidonic acid (AA). 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who subscribes to the theory that DHA and AA promote  
lasting brain development, said he sought funding from Martek. 
</P>
<P>
	Martek has a strong interest in seeing DHA and AA approved by  
the Food and Drug Administration for use as a supplement in 
U.S.-made infant formula. Formulas sold in 60 countries contain DHA 
and AA but they are not approved for use here. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said his pregnant daughter is taking a daily supplement  
of DHA at his urging. If she were unable to breast-feed, he said, 
``I personally would recommend she give DHA to her infant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A scientist who has studied DHA and an infant formula maker  
cautioned that studies have not shown a clear link between DHA 
consumption and increased IQ. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people deserve to understand that while breast-feeding  
has been linked to cognitive functions, DHA has mainly been linked 
to effects which are not cognitive, like (increased) attention and 
other behavioral effects,'' said Susan Carlson, a professor in the 
school of nursing at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Finn, nutrition director at Ross Products, the Columbus,  
Ohio-based maker of Similac infant formula, said the company's 
studies have not shown a benefit to adding DHA and AA to infant 
formula.

<HEADLINE> Hero Officer's Suicide Puzzles N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRANFORD, N.J. (AP) -- He was a bona fide hero, a decorated  
police officer, a loving father, a loyal friend. By most accounts, 
Lt. Russell Wilde had it all. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the police chief's son and a 14-year veteran honored more  
than a dozen times with citations for bravery, including the 
prestigious Carnegie Medal for heroism in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was surprised when he worked 36 consecutive hours plus  
another full shift overseeing the emergency response to severe 
flooding caused by rains from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	But they can't explain what happened next.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilde worked from Thursday morning through Friday night, then  
got a few hours rest before returning to work for a Saturday shift. 
That night, he took his wife, Tracy, to the wedding of rookie 
Patrolman Ed Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	When they returned home, Wilde walked into his bedroom, pulled  
out his .45-caliber police-issue pistol and shot himself. Dead at 
33. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, about 350 mourners filled the pews of St.  
Michael's Roman Catholic Church to pay tribute. Wilde's coffin was 
escorted into the church by uniformed officers as the skirl of 
bagpipers outside mingled with the organ. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde's suicide stunned this tranquil bedroom community of  
22,600 some 15 miles west of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just devastating,'' said Loretta Honeywell, 66, a  
crossing guard who has known Wilde since he was a teen-ager. ``He 
had it all. I can't imagine the strain that would get the poor kid 
to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide experts say it might have been triggered by deeper  
problems that Wilde kept hidden from others. Co-workers believe the 
exhausting work session pushed Wilde over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a model husband, a model father, a model policeman,''  
said police Lt. Robert Schafer. ``An intelligent man, a logical 
man. We have 50 people in our department. He would be No. 52 that I 
would expect this from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up, Russell Scott Wilde aspired to be just like his  
father, Police Chief Harry Wilde. He got a two-year degree in 
criminal justice and joined the force in 1985 at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he was vacationing on Long Beach Island when he  
and two other men heard the screams of 11-year-old Amy Meissner and 
her 18-year-old sister Bonnie. They had been pulled out to sea by a 
riptide and were struggling to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde and the other men swam 300 feet out, managed to load the  
girls onto a surfboard and return them to shore. Wilde ``wouldn't 
leave the girls alone to try to save himself,'' then-Police Chief 
Robert Guertin wrote in an application for the Carnegie Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde and the others each won $2,500 and a bronze medal.  
</P>
<P>
	On the job, he built a similar reputation. His personnel file at  
the Cranford Police Department is a 2-inch thick testimonial to his 
bravery, street smarts and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	He solved killings, foiled carjackings, twice saved people's  
lives applying CPR, broke up a prostitution ring and arrested a 
burglary suspect believed responsible for a series of thefts, 
according to letters of citation in the file. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the kind of guy who wouldn't ask you to do anything he  
wouldn't do,'' said Capt. Eric Mason. ``He didn't sit behind a desk 
and give orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde was right there when Hurricane Floyd's wrath spilled into  
the Rahway River, causing it to overflow. More than 350 people had 
to be evacuated from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were working all-out, from Thursday on. He was the incident  
commander and he was the point man in the rescue and recovery 
efforts. Any complaints came to him. There was no rest,'' Mason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, he did rest. But maybe not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Tracy that day,'' said neighbor Kathleen Davis, the wife  
of a fellow officer. ``She was saying how he was really tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the wedding, Wilde and his wife returned to their neatly  
kept $170,000 home. He pulled out his gun and shot himself. The 
couple's sons, Russell Jr., 7, and Hayden, 4, were not home at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a psychologist, but you go long hours without taking  
time off, that's got to be a contributing factor,'' Mason said 
Tuesday at police headquarters, where purple and black bunting hung 
over the entrances and officers wore black bands across their 
silver badges. 
</P>
<P>
	John Violanti, a University of Buffalo professor who has written  
books about police suicides, said Wilde may have been frustrated by 
his inability to help flood victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have people out there who think they have to be perfect  
cops,'' Violanti said. ``If in some way they feel they've failed 
that image of themself, it's devastating. Sometimes, those hero 
standards are hard to bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologist Lanny Berman, executive director of the American  
Association of Suicidology, said family problems and alcohol abuse 
are among the most prevalent factors in police suicides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suicides don't just happen. There's more to the story. The  
long hours of work may have shifted his coping ability. He may not 
have been thinking real clearly. But that doesn't explain a 
suicide,'' Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family wasn't talking. A man who answered a knock at the  
door of Wilde's home waved off a reporter Tuesday. In a brief 
interview with The Star-Ledger of Newark, Wilde's father could shed 
no light on what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying he was a model son doesn't do him justice,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Is a Woods-Duval Pairing in Works?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- David Duval and Tiger Woods have spent a  
lot of time with each other this week at The Country Club -- in 
their press conference, but more significantly inside the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Duval have been in the same foursome for two straight  
days of practice for the Ryder Cup, and captain Ben Crenshaw has 
been toying with the idea of sending out the top two players in the 
world as a formidable team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a possibility,'' he said. ``I don't know that  
you're going to see that pairing in the first round. But it's very 
safe to say that both of them are going to play a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods only smiled and said, ``We'll see,'' when asked he might  
be paired with Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	One school of thought is that a Woods-Duval team might send a  
message that the United States wants to come out with both guns 
blazing. Then again, it could backfire, since there are no greater 
scalps than the top two players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	European captain Mark James doesn't subscribe to either.  
</P>
<P>
	``If two of our guys beat them, that's a fantastic win,'' he  
said. ``But I don't think it's going to be affecting the end result 
of the matches. If a pair wins or loses one match, I don't think it 
will reduce one team to tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams must submit pairings Thursday afternoon for the first  
round of alternate-shot matches. Crenshaw was still wrestling with 
possibilities, although Jeff Maggert and Hal Sutton have been 
together three times now -- including the practice session last 
month -- and Payne Stewart played an alternate-shot match with Davis 
Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	The European side appears much more clear. The most likely  
possibilities are Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie, Lee Westwood 
and Darren Clarke, Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik, and Jose 
Maria Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both captains say their teams are playing well and that they are  
having a tough time figuring which four players to bench Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROOKIE RUMBLINGS:* Having seven Ryder Cup rookies is no big  
deal to captain Mark James. One look at recent history is enough to 
suggest that Europe always has a rookie or two who rises to the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, five rookies accounted for eight points in the  
victory at Valderrama. In 1995, David Gilford won a key singles 
match and Philip Walton won the decisive match. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want it badly,'' James said. ``They want to do well, want  
to win points. They want to be the next Ryder Cup superstars. 
Motivation is not a problem. I've got to de-motivate them so their 
heads don't explode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lone American rookie is Duval, who happens to be a four-time  
winner this year and No. 2 in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He a rookie in one sense, but I think it helps that he's  
played in Presidents Cups before,'' captain Ben Crenshaw said. ``I 
think he's got a game that would be extremely effective on this 
golf course -- pretty darn well on any course.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUSPICIOUS SIGHTING:* The bomb squad was called out when a blue  
knapsack was found unattended by the 16th tee. Brookline police 
chief Daniel O'Leary said the bag was examined by an 
explosive-sniffing dog and found to be innocuous. 
</P>
<P>
	The area around the tee was closed off 10-15 minutes, but most  
spectators and all of the golfers had no idea there was a potential 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be prepared for everything,'' O'Leary said. ``This  
is a major event, and we've got a lot of contingency plans. We're 
looking for a happy, safe event.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PATE'S BACK:* Steve Pate was asked Wednesday about his most  
anxious Ryder Cup moment. Davis Love III answered it for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't that a limo crash?'' he cracked.  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Pate played only one match in his only Ryder Cup, 1991  
at Kiawah Island, when he was injured in an accident. He managed to 
play the first match, losing in best-ball with Corey Pavin, but had 
to withdraw from singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure my most anxious moment is going to be the first tee  
shot I hit this week because that last time, I was not in the same 
frame of mind,'' he said. ``I was wondering how long my body was 
going to hold up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goods new, Love said, was he hasn't seen any limos this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, we've got buses,'' Pate said. ``I can take the whole team  
down with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HE'S NO SERGIO:* Colin Montgomerie's drive came to rest behind  
a tree on the 13th hole Wednesday during a best-ball practice 
session. He studied the shot and considered the options, as the 
gallery waited to see how he would escape such a mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple. With a swift swing of the leg, Montgomerie kicked his  
ball out of trouble and played his next one to the green, laughing 
all the way. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CAPTAIN STEWART:* Payne Stewart always spends a week in Ireland  
to get ready for the British Open, and this year said he had become 
so popular in Waterville that he could run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to settle for the next best thing.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Stewart was named an honorary captain at  
Waterville Golf Club for 2000. It's the first time the club has 
bestowed such a title, and the first time a captain has come from 
the U.S. Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``On each visit he has won the hearts of our small village,''  
said Jay Connolly, managing director of the Waterville House and 
Golf Links. ``This is the highest honor we can bestow to thank him 
for his friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention whether the honor would be rescinded if  
Europe doesn't return home with the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Mark O'Meara came up with the shot of the day  
Wednesday, holing an 8-iron from 142 yards for eagle on No. 8. 
``That was one of my few good shots,'' said O'Meara, who concedes 
that his confidence is not sky-high. ... While Boston Red Sox 
pitcher Derek Lowe has been out to The Country Club this week, 
manager Jimy Williams acted like he didn't know anything about the 
Ryder Cup. ``I saw a couple of their trucks. They rent trucks, 
don't they?'' he said. ... Samuel Ryder donated the gold chalice 
that bears his name in 1927, it was valued at about $400. Today it 
is worth $13,900. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	 *QUOTE OF THE DAY:* ``The last hole ... well, when the French go  
down, they go down in flames.'' -- Mark James, on Jean Van de 
Velde's play in the British Open.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Change Little in Quiet Market / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices moved little Wednesday in an  
uneventful session. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/16  
point, or 62 1/2 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.08 percent from 6.09 
percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, while intermediate maturities rose 1/32 to 3/32 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar and United States stock markets again drove what  
little activity there was in the bond markets. The dollar slipped a 
little more against the yen, and U.S. stocks fell for a third 
straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors tend to seek the safety of fixed income securities  
such as bonds when stocks are sliding. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.81 percent, up from 4.77 percent Tuesday. The discount 
rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields rose to 5.06 percent with a discount of 4.86  
percent, up 0.01 percentage point. One-year yields slipped to 5.22 
percent as the discount fell to 4.95 percent, down 0.01 percentage 
point from Tuesday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.25 percent from late Tuesday's 5.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 112 13/32. The average 
yield to maturity was also unchanged at 5.89 percent.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Instrument Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Archaeologists in China have found what is believed to be the  
oldest still-playable musical instrument: a 9,000-year-old flute 
carved from the wing bone of a crane. 
</P>
<P>
	When scientists from the United States and China blew gently  
through the mottled brown instrument's mouthpiece and fingered its 
holes, they produced tones unheard for millennia, yet familiar to 
the modern ear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reedy, pleasant sound, a little thin, like a  
recorder,'' said Garman Harbottle, a nuclear scientist who 
specializes in radiocarbon dating at Brookhaven National Laboratory 
on New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbottle and three Chinese archaeologists published their  
findings in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The flute was one of several instruments to be uncovered in  
Jiahu, a excavation site of Stone Age artifacts in China's Yellow 
River Valley. Archaeologists have also found exquisitely wrought 
tools, weapons and pottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dated to 7,000 B.C., the flute is more than twice as old as  
instruments used in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and other early 
civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, researchers have found some three dozen bone flutes at  
Jiahu. Five were riddled with cracks; 30 others had fragmented. The 
flutes have as many as eight neatly hollowed tone holes and were 
held vertically to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jiahu flute is considerably more recent than a flutelike  
bone discovered in 1995 in an excavation of Neanderthal tools in a 
cave in Slovenia. That artifact was believed to be more than 43,000 
years old, but musicologists question whether it is an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, there is no doubt among researchers that the Jiahu  
artifacts are instruments capable of playing multinote music. 
</P>
<P>
	Music historians and archaeologists were intrigued by the find.  
</P>
<P>
	``You would never have one of these flutes in a symphony. But  
clearly, these people knew what an octave sounded like,'' Harbottle 
said. He said the flute can make what sounds like a ``do-re-mi'' 
scale. It even has a tiny hole drilled near hole No. 7, apparently 
to correct an off-pitch tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars said the bone flutes provide further proof that  
prehistoric Chinese culture was not crude. Music played an integral 
role, perhaps combined with astronomical observations and other 
rituals that helped to rule their society, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	That the flutes were made of durable bone rather than bamboo, as  
later flutes were, also suggests they were culturally important, 
and not mere amusements. In fact, some scholars believe the Chinese 
written character for ``sound'' is a stylized representation of a 
vertical flute held in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``That they would go to the trouble of constructing such  
instruments suggests a certain importance was placed on sound, and 
an attention to aesthetic concerns,'' said Jonathan Stock, an 
ethnomusicologist at the University of Sheffield in England, and a 
specialist in Chinese musical history. 
</P>
<P>
	The flutes were uncovered at Jiahu in the 1980s. Their tonal  
qualities initially were tested in 1987. The intact Jiahu flute 
remains locked in a laboratory in China, but replicas may be 
constructed for more tonal tests.

<HEADLINE> Spanish GDP Growth Rate: 3.6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The Spanish economy expanded at a yearly  
rate of 3.6 percent in the second quarter, the same as in the first 
three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Statistics Institute said Tuesday that domestic  
demand soared 5.3 percent in the April-June period from a year ago 
while foreign demand for Spanish goods remained sluggish, cutting 
1.7 percentage points from overall GDP growth levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has said the  
economy may end the year with a GDP growth rate as high as 3.7 
percent. That compares to 2.0 percent forecast by the European 
Union for the 11 countries that have adopted the euro. Spain is 
among those 11 countries.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Wash Away Small Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) -- Pelican Spit, a 37-acre chunk of sand  
dunes off the Georgia coast, was reabsorbed into the Atlantic Ocean 
as hurricanes Dennis and Floyd swept through. 
</P>
<P>
	The spit was an important nesting habitat for shore birds, but  
nature often creates and destroys sand bars, spits and even barrier 
islands, said Brad Winn, a biologist with the Georgia Department of 
Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Georgia's coastline was spared from the most serious  
hurricane damage and Pelican Spit probably will re-emerge, Winn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelican Spit was worn down by Hurricane Dennis earlier this  
month, leaving it as a few sand dunes above the Atlantic's lapping 
waves. After Floyd last week, the dunes disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelican Spit historically supported colonies of nesting royal  
terns and black skimmers. This summer, the state labeled Pelican 
Spit as a critical bird habitat, prohibiting people from visiting 
nesting areas.

<HEADLINE>  Connors Not Big Fan of Agassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Andre Agassi can't count Jimmy Connors as one of  
his big fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors said Agassi, the world's No. 1 player, doesn't belong  
``in the same breath'' with him and other tennis greats. 
</P>
<P>
	During a conference call with British tennis reporters, Connors  
criticized Agassi, the 1999 French and U.S. Open champion, for 
squandering his talent for so long before a resurgence this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Agassi deserved to be linked with Pete Sampras and  
retired greats like himself, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg, Connors 
was quick to shoot down the notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't mention his name in the same breath,'' Connors was  
quoted as saying in Wednesday's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors also didn't appreciate suggestions that Agassi had  
modeled his game after him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imitation is the greatest form of flattery but I think they  
broke the mold when I finished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who plummeted to No. 141 in the world rankings two years  
ago, became the fifth player to win all four Grand Slam titles when 
he captured the French last June. Later in the summer, he also 
reached the final at Wimbledon and swept to another U.S. Open 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors, who spent 268 weeks as No. 1, compared with Agassi's  
current total of 37, is less than impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to be staging a comeback at the age of 29 is not the  
right thing,'' Connors said. ``There have been too many dips in his 
career and he hasn't been consistently at the top of his game like 
Pete Sampras. With his talent, he should never have allowed himself 
to drop out of the top four or five.''

<HEADLINE> DJs Compete for Champion Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget microphones, or even words. For the disc  
jockeys competing at the DMC/Technics World DJ Championships, all 
talking was done with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an art form,'' said Tony Prince, founder of DMC, a global  
organization that deals with DJs and DJ culture. ``Turntables are 
an instrument because when DJs use them, they create rhythms. ... 
You hear music that's not in the original song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven contestants each used six minutes on two record  
turntables and a mixer last Saturday night at the Hammerstein 
Ballroom in hopes of dethroning Miami's 21-year-old DJ Craze. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the titleholder took his turn at the tables, attempting to  
keep the challengers at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	For a hip-hop DJ, or turntablist as some call themselves,  
performing doesn't mean just playing somebody else's music. It's 
about scratching on records, cutting on tracks, separating a song 
into its musical elements, and manipulating those elements to 
create a totally new sound. 
</P>
<P>
	DMC has been sponsoring the event since 1986, and this was the  
first year the world championships were held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	To get to the world event, DJs must win their national DMC-run  
competitions. More than 20 countries sent finalists. P-Trix, from 
Los Angeles, won the American nationals in July. DJ Craze was an 
automatic entrant as title defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Scratch from the Philippines caused an uproar when he  
created a chirping sound from one of his records. Morocco's DJ 
Mouss moved his hands so fast they blurred. England's Tony Vegas 
held up an index finger to show where his skills ranked. 
</P>
<P>
	P-Trix got the loudest fan response.  
</P>
<P>
	But this night belonged to Craze. He took the stage to a roar of  
approval from the crowd, and clearly overshadowed his competition. 
Unlike the others, he incorporated body movements into his 
performance, not missing a beat even as he turned around in a 
circle behind the turntables. He won in a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	For Craze, who has been on the turntables for eight years, it  
makes perfect sense to see hip-hop culture spreading to all corners 
of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something for the youth to express how they feel,'' he  
said. ``Anyone can relate to hip-hop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feniksi, a member of the French hip-hop troupe Saian Supa Crew,  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip-hop is coming from the streets,'' he said. ``In any  
country, there is always a street culture. Even if it's not the 
same words, it's the same emotions.''

<HEADLINE> Weather Helping With Calif. Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Scattered thunderstorms on Wednesday  
helped firefighters battle a series of fires that forced dozens of 
people to flee remote areas of a scenic national forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms dropped less than an inch of rain along California's  
central coast, where fires have burned more than 32,000 acres in 
Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters welcomed relief from 80-degree temperatures inland,  
and more rain was predicted on and off into the night, although 
accompanying wind gusts up to 25 mph could make the fires 
unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain is ``not going to put it out, but it's going to slow it  
down,'' said Alan Queoff, a spokesman for the California Department 
of Forestry, which was using infrared aircraft to map the hottest 
fires deep in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters who were backburning -- setting blazes ahead of the  
fires to eliminate new fuel sources -- were forced to stop Wednesday 
morning by the damp weather. But they were mopping up some areas 
and making direct attacks on fires near Tassajara Hot Springs, 
where vacationers and residents of a Zen center were still under a 
voluntary evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires burning in canyons still threatened to climb over a ridge  
and onto the New Camaldoli Monastery, where eight monks had defied 
an evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north in Trinity County, firefighters battling wildfires  
that have consumed 51,707 acres also were aided by weather 
conditions. Although it remained hot and dry, much of the smoke had 
cleared out.

<HEADLINE> Browns-Ravens: New Rivals, Old Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Art Modell is afraid to come back to  
Cleveland, and swears he'll never again set foot in the city he 
once called home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's wise of him,'' Browns offensive right tackle  
Orlando Brown said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Cleveland is coming to Modell as the expansion Browns  
visit Modell's Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Browns left on a trip to Baltimore they never  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	That was three years ago. Modell, upset with Cleveland city  
officials over their reluctance to build the former Browns owner a 
new stadium, made good on his threat and moved his team to 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Once there, Modell got everything he wanted. His team got a new  
nickname, the Ravens, who got new purple and black colors. 
Baltimore built him a new stadium, and before his team even played 
one game, Modell had a new rival -- the entire city of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Ravens Week in Cleveland. Actually, it's been Ravens Week  
in Cleveland since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the NFL announced that Cleveland would be getting an  
expansion team this season, Browns fans began dreaming about the 
day the new Browns would get a shot at Modell. And this week the 
Browns play at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	One game ordinarily does not make a rivalry, but this rivalry  
was born before the game was even scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Cleveland has a hatred for Art Modell,'' Browns  
defensive tackle John Jurkovic said. ``So our fans will be in a 
frenzy. I don't know if Cleveland hates Baltimore as much as it 
hates Modell. I don't know if people in Baltimore hate Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do know that since I've been here I've heard a lot of  
fans say they knew we would have a tough season, but as long as we 
beat Baltimore, we'll be in good shape. Needless to say, it would 
be nice to get our first win in Baltimore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Modell, there are other subplots to Browns-Ravens I.  
</P>
<P>
	Five former Browns remain from the team Modell took with him --  
safeties Benny Thompson and Stevon Moore, kicker Matt Stover and 
defensive linemen Lenny Webster and Rob Burnett. There are two 
former Browns, cornerback Antonio Langham and Brown, who are now 
former Ravens back in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are the coaches. Ravens coach Brian Billick  
appeared to be the front-runner for the Cleveland job before 
rankling Browns officials by saying he wanted to go on other 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought everyone was a candidate for that job,'' joked Chris  
Palmer, who wound up as Cleveland's coach after interviewing with 
Modell in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	From the moment he arrived back in Cleveland, Brown said he has  
heard one thing over and over from Browns fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all have got to get Baltimore, you've got to get  
Baltimore,'' said Brown, who was building a new home in Cleveland 
when Modell announced he was moving the team. ``I've heard that 
from 100 fans since I got here. I'm pumped to play against my old 
teammates and my old boss. I've got a new boss now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he understood Modell's decision and why Cleveland  
fans felt heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to move,'' Brown said. ``A lot of the other guys  
didn't want to move. But you got to go where your job takes you. 
But, like I said, if he was moving the team to Alaska, then I was 
going to Alaska. I had to get a paycheck. It was a business 
decision for him, I guess.''

	Brown said he has no animosity for Modell or the Ravens. After  
signing with the Browns as a free agent, he said he stopped by to 
thank his old boss and wish him luck.

	``Maybe he should have handled it more professionally, but I  
don't have anything to do with that. I had no problem with him,'' 
he said. ``He gave me my first chance to play.''

After all, Modell figured, it had been three years and football was 
back.

was your name,'' he said. ``And it wasn't good.''

<HEADLINE> Bruins Sign P.J. Axelsson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Left wing P.J. Axelsson signed a two-year contract  
with the Boston Bruins on Wednesday, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad this has been resolved prior to the season's start,  
and we expect P.J. in Boston in the next couple of days to join his 
teammates for practice,'' Bruins president and general manager 
Harry Sinden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins gave no other contract details.  
</P>
<P>
	Axelsson, 24, is entering his third season with the Bruins. The  
6-foot-1 Swede was the Bruins' seventh pick, and the 177th overall 
pick, in the 1995 NHL entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	He played four seasons with Frolunda Goteborg of the Swedish  
Elite League, scoring 36 goals and 21 assists in 105 games before 
joining the Bruins in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	During his rookie year, Axelson was eighth in scoring among  
rookies with eight goals and 19 assists. Last year, he had seven 
goals and 10 assists in 77 games.

<HEADLINE> Pipe Bomb Shakes Black College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A pipe bomb exploded Wednesday in a  
building at Florida A&AMP;M University, the second blast at the 
historically black school in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported and damage was minor in blasts that  
were accompanied by the warning it was ``just the beginning, 
brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's explosion, a caller to a Tallahassee television  
station used racial slurs and said the students at Florida A&AMP;M 
didn't need a university. WTXL-TV received a second call laced with 
profanity and racist remarks after the bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
	``FAMU has seen the beginning of this ... they got no business  
having a college where there ain't nobody ... smart enough to get a 
degree .... This is just the beginning, brother,'' the station 
quoted the caller as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Aug. 31 blast, a caller told the same station he wanted  
to ``get rid of some of them niggers.'' No one was hurt and there 
was little damage from that blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also received a call Wednesday warning of a bomb in  
another campus building, but a search turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are obvious, commonsense connections you could make,''  
said Byron Price, FBI supervisor in Tallahassee. But he added that 
authorities have no concrete evidence linking the two explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have offered a $10,000 reward for information  
leading to an arrest and conviction in the first bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb that went off Wednesday exploded in a first-floor  
restroom of Perry Paige Hall, which has four floors of 
laboratories, offices, classrooms and the Navy ROTC office. The 
building and several others were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were called off for the day and scheduled to resume  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Eddie Jackson said the school, which has 12,000  
students and 119 buildings on campus, stepped up security after the 
first bomb and will tighten it even more now. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they no longer feel safe on campus.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' Olevia Robinson said. ``The next time someone  
might definitely get hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Takes On Pop Persona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- There is a long pause on the other end  
of the telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Garth Brooks takes a deep breath and defends himself  
from the perception that his new album is a thinly disguised 
attempt to abandon country music for the glories of pop stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you tell me what I'm looking for that I don't already  
have?'' he asks in measured tones. ``Has anybody sold more?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Brooks has sold 95 million albums, dwarfing most  
pop stars. His two-CD live album has sold 6 million and has been on 
the pop album charts for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garth Brooks in ... the life of Chris Gaines'' is -- follow  
closely now -- a greatest hits CD of fictional singer Chris Gaines. 
Gaines is a character Brooks will play in ``The Lamb,'' a film 
expected to be released next year. The pop-rock music of Gaines was 
created by Brooks, in collaboration with producers Don Was and 
Babyface. 
</P>
<P>
	The album has Beatles-like pop tunes, one that sounds a bit like  
Fleetwood Mac and some that veer toward Prince-variety funk. 
Nothing on the album rises to the level of those inspirations, but 
Brooks doesn't fall on his face, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've ever been into a fight, or you've ever been into an  
athletic thing, once you're in it, you better start giving it 
everything you've got to survive,'' Brooks said. ``I surrounded 
myself with people that knew what hip and cool was, since I 
don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks will promote the new album on a television special to air  
Sept. 29 (8 p.m.-9 p.m. EDT) on NBC. A separate soundtrack of 
Gaines' music will be released next year to accompany the film. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two albums and movie are hits, Brooks will have launched  
a parallel pop career alongside country music superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is literally either going to make him or break  
him,'' said singer Kenny Rogers. In 1980, at the height of his 
popularity, Rogers took a chance by recording with R&AMP;B balladeer 
Lionel Ritchie. ``Lady'' became a smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either (Brooks is) going to be the biggest thing that's ever  
happened in the music business, or I think he's burned a lot of 
bridges that are going to hurt him in the long run at country 
radio,'' Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Brooks, 37, needed a new challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm burning a bridge with the format of country radio, I  
don't know it,'' Brooks said. ``And if I am, then I'll pay for that 
on the next thing, I guess, that I bring to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks ended a phase of his career with last year's release of  
``Double Live.'' Critics carped that he was recycling old hits like 
``Friends in Low Places'' too much. There were two hits collections 
and a box set in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you, having been pretty much in the position he's  
in, that you get there and you realize that you're not doing 
anything new,'' Rogers said. ``You know you can only go downhill 
from there. So you step out and you take chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the film, which came from an idea that Brooks' Hollywood  
production company sold to Paramount, Gaines is an Australian rock 
star. The character is expected to be an elusive figure in the 
movie, seen mostly in concert performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines is ``very much like the `Braveheart' of music,'' Brooks  
said. ``He believes and fights for his stuff and his fans so hard 
that it will eventually cost him his life. That's what I think I 
grew to love about this guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he was reluctant when the studio asked him to do the  
pop-rock music for the film. ``I told them, `I don't know if I 
can.' They said, `Would you try?' So we did four cuts and Babyface 
was there to keep me from falling and so was Don (Was), and we 
turned in the first four cuts ... and they loved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks will release a Christmas album this year. He is also  
producing a country album for former band member Ty England. But he 
won't release a new album for the country music market until the 
fall of 2000 -- at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, fans have a choice of embracing Chris Gaines or waiting  
for Garth Brooks to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's yet another page of Garth, and if it's a page people  
choose to sit out on, like always, that's their choice,'' Brooks 
said. ``If it's a page they tune into, then I hope they find 
something in there that's very cool for them.''

<HEADLINE> Defending Champs Enter NY Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Kagwe of Kenya and Franca Fiacconi of Italy  
will defend their titles in the New York City Marathon Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Their entries, along with that of 1995 world champion Martin Fiz  
of Spain, were announced Wednesday by race director Allan 
Steinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagwe, also the 1997 champion, will be trying to become the  
first to win the 26.2-mile race three consecutive years since 
Alberto Salazar in 1980-82. Bill Rodgers holds the men's record 
with four victories, from 1976-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagwe is the only man to twice run under 2 hours, 9 minutes on  
the five-borough course, winning in 2:08:12 in 1997 and 2:08:45 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiacconi finally broke through to win the women's divison last  
year in 2:25:17, the second-fastest women's time ever for the race. 
She finished second in 1996 and third in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiz finished seventh at the 1996 New York City Marathon, his  
only appearance in the race. He also won the 1996 Rotterdam 
Marathon and was eighth at this year's World Championships.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Pledges Holy Land Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian youths won from Pope  
John Paul II something that so far has eluded their political 
leaders -- a firm pledge that he plans to visit the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that, if God wills, I plan to go to the Holy Land on  
a pilgrimage tracing the stages of the history of salvation,'' John 
Paul said in a written message he gave to a group of three young 
people Wednesday. ``God willing, therefore, we shall have the 
chance to meet again on your own soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, John Paul has spoken of such a trip as a hope more  
than a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	A stop in the Holy Land -- in both Israel and  
Palestinian-controlled territories -- is on a proposed itinerary the 
pope has sketched for pilgrimages across the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The trips could begin as early as December with a visit to Ur,  
the Biblical birthplace of Abraham in what is now Iraq, although no 
date has been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and the Iraqi opposition have expressed  
misgivings, claiming the trip would be a propaganda coup for Iraqi 
Saddam Hussein. John Paul insists no political significance should 
be attached to any of the trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Three young people representing the Christian, Muslim and Jewish  
faiths met with John Paul during his general audience in St. 
Peter's Square. They represented the Peres Center for Peace, 
founded three years ago to promote peace and reconciliation among 
Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	A stop in the Holy Land will be ``a big step for us and for  
him,'' said Reem Shadid, 15, a Muslim. ``We are all waiting for him 
to come in March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has never given a date, but there are expectations  
the trip will take place in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In his message, the pope encouraged the youth in their efforts  
at reconciliation. By the time he visits, the pope said, ``I trust 
that ... you will have begun your venture and that together we will 
be able to see its first fruits. Good-bye until then.''

<HEADLINE> Jury To Decide Fate of Supremacist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- Jurors today were considering whether to  
levy the death penalty against a white supremacist they had 
convicted of mutilating and killing a black man by dragging him 
behind a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence R. Brewer, 32, faces life in prison or death by  
injection for the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr., who was chained by 
his ankles to the truck and dragged for three miles over a country 
road outside the East Texas town of Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at this man's life, if you put his life in a  
capsule, based on the evidence, he is not a future danger to 
society,'' Brewer's attorney, Lane Walker, said today in closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said Brewer, a convicted burglar, had no history of  
violence while he was in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, that's the only place on this earth since he  
was 14 years old where he's been able to function,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Byrd's death  
shows Brewer is dangerous and should be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Brewer) had no reason on earth to hurt him except for the  
color of his skin,'' Gray said. ``There can't really be any 
question ... sometime in the future, when they get a chance, when 
Russell Brewer gets a chance, he would hurt another person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must answer three questions: whether Brewer intended to  
kill Byrd, whether he is a future danger to society and whether any 
mitigating circumstances about him should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	If the jury unanimously answers ``yes'' to the first two  
questions and ``no'' to the third, Brewer goes to death row and 
joins former prison buddy John W. King, 24, who in February was 
condemned for killing Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	A third man, Shawn A. Berry, 24, is to be tried next month in  
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution said  
Brewer never reformed despite several chances, and would be a 
future danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike those of us who wonder what our own potential for  
violence might be, Mr. Brewer answered that question,'' said Dr. 
Edward Gripon. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution has contended Brewer was the racist ideologue  
who taught King and Berry his views, and that his position as 
leader of a white supremacist prison group, the Confederate Knights 
of America, showed the depth of his commitment to racism. 
</P>
<P>
	A clinical psychologist, Dan Roberts, testified for the defense  
that Brewer was a failure as the leader, or ``Exalted Cyclops,'' of 
the supremacist group because he was socially incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to be the leader, but it was like Fred Flintstone  
wanting to be the Grand Poobah of the Water Buffalo Club,'' Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's father and Brewer's father met outside the courtroom  
Tuesday, shook hands and embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we'd met under different circumstances,'' Lawrence  
Brewer Sr. told James Byrd Sr. ``I want you to know I'm awful 
embarrassed by this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Verrett, James Byrd Jr.'s sister, comforted the defendant's  
mother, Helen Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize you're in pain, too,'' Ms. Verrett said. ``You did  
all you can to raise him and taught him. And that's all you can 
do.''

<HEADLINE> NFL's Final Four of 1998 Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos, Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings lost a  
total of five games last year. They've already equaled that after 
Week 2 of the NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos and Falcons, who played in the Super Bowl, both are  
0-2 after going 14-2 in 1998. Minnesota, the only NFL team to go 
15-1 and not make the Super Bowl, is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in the New York Jets, who've thrown away their first two  
games, and the final four from '98 is a collective 1-7. And the 
only victory came when the Vikings beat the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is put our rings away, put them in the safe  
and just go out and play,'' linebacker Glenn Cadrez said of the 
two-time defending champion Broncos. ``What we did in the past is 
what we did in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What they did in the past came with John Elway at quarterback.  
Elway's retirement seems to have torn out the soul of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help when coach Mike Shanahan benched Bubby Brister as  
Elway's replacement late in the preseason for second-year 
quarterback Brian Griese. Brister never was told he was playing for 
his starting position -- his poor work on exhibition games made him 
vulnerable -- and Shanahan's move annoyed some veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	As Griese stumbled in the first two games, defenses for Miami  
and Kansas City stacked the line. Terrell Davis, not only the prime 
threat, but perhaps the only offensive weapon in Denver, was held 
to 140 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	To compound Denver's woes, linebacker John Mobley wrecked his  
knee and is out for the year. The Broncos appear to be reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you lose a little confidence when you are 0-2?'' Shanahan  
said. ``When you don't lose a little confidence is when something 
is wrong with you. There's nothing like winning football games to 
help our confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only the Vikings would know that of the '98 final four.  
But their record-setting offense of a year ago has disappeared, 
along with coordinator Brian Billick, who now is the head coach in 
Baltimore. The Vikings scored 17 points in each of their two games; 
they averaged more than 34 points last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the NFL,'' Randy Moss said. ``Running game, passing  
game, anything can be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Moss and the Vikings were unstoppable throughout last  
season. And even with a new coordinator, the already beleaguered 
Ray Sherman, calling plays, the players are the same: '98 rookie of 
the year Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed at receiver; Robert Smith 
and Leroy Hoard at running back; Randall Cunningham at quarterback; 
and a solid offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I think I got the ball off quicker, and I think I'm  
going to have to get back to dropping back and letting go a little 
quicker because that's our style of offense,'' Cunningham said. 
``Last year I would drop, and as soon as I would make a fake, I 
would come out of my fake and let the ball go. And it was a lot of 
built-in stuff that I've got to get back in the groove of doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not because or our line, but it's just that I've got to  
get into my rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons might not find that rhythm again. The surprise of  
the NFL season last year, they are back to their more accustomed 
ways -- Atlanta never has had consecutive winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson is gone for the year with a  
non-contact knee injury. Quarterback Chris Chandler, the other 
indispensable member of the offense, has a bad hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have bad karma.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have nowhere to go but up,'' backup QB Tony Graziani said.  
``We're playing so bad right now, it's not even funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing is funny with the Jets. They've combined the shoddy play  
of the Broncos with the injury woes of the Falcons, and doubled it. 
</P>
<P>
	New York doesn't have quarterback Vinny Testaverde and running  
back-kick returner Leon Johnson for the rest of the year. Gone 
until mid-October, at least, is receiver Wayne Chrebet. Nose tackle 
Jason Ferguson, a rising force on the Jets defense, has knee and 
ankle problems. Tight end Eric Green is bothered by a disc injury 
in his neck. Cornerback Otis Smith (collarbone) might be back in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The fortitude and resourcefulness the team displayed in '98 is  
gone. So is much of the emotion that helped carry the Jets to their 
first division crown in the NFL. All of that seemed to disintegrate 
when Testaverde ruptured his Achilles' tendon in the second quarter 
of the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows we miss Vinny,'' safety Victor Green said.  
``That's a big hole in our hearts. But he's not here anymore and 
we've got Rick (Mirer) to take us where we want to go. We have to 
find other ways to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, none of last year's title games participants have found  
the answer.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Tumble / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices posted their biggest one-day  
drop in nearly a year today following the Bank of Japan's decision 
to keep its monetary policy unchanged. The U.S. dollar fell against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 607.03  
points, or 3.39 percent, to close at 17,325.76. On Tuesday, the 
average closed up 357.53 points, or 2.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was the largest one-day drop for the Nikkei since  
Oct. 8, 1998, when the index fell 799.55 points to close at 
13,026.06. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.28 yen in late trading, down 0.48 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 104.87 
yen. The dollar traded in a relatively narrow range between 104.13 
yen and 105.37 yen in today's dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, shares of export-driven and high-tech  
companies like Sony and Toshiba were the hardest hit after the 
BOJ's decision prompted speculation the yen will head higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unexpected move that shocked financial markets, the  
central bank said Tuesday that it would not use monetary policy to 
weaken the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are amazed,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the  
quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had said an easing could curb upward pressure on the  
yen by lowering long-term interest rates. A lower yen would help 
Japanese exporters by making their products more cost-competitive 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	A fall in U.S. stock prices Tuesday also weighed on Tokyo  
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen rise and New York's fall prompted selling among  
dealers, although foreign investors weren't seen selling 
particularly heavily,'' said Ken Yamano, general manager at 
Taiheiyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
225.43 points to 10,598.47, pulled lower by factors including 
growing concerns about the weakening dollar and the rising U.S. 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 591 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 561.76 million shares 
on Wednesday. Decliners far outnumbered advancers by 1044 to 206, 
while 91 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 50.05 points, or 3.27 percent, to close at 
1,479.28. The index closed up 10.05 points, or 0.66 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar slid against the yen but traded  
in a narrow range ahead of a Japanese holiday Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said players were also wary following volatile  
dollar-yen movements on Tuesday, as well as from a sense of 
uncertainty over possible joint intervention in the currency market 
by U.S. and Japanese authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus for dealers now is whether the United States will  
decide at the Group of Seven meeting of financial authorities in 
Washington on Saturday to aid the Japanese government in its 
attempt to curb the yen's rise, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.57 yen, down  
from 110.79 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark Japanese government bond rose to  
1.8100 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7600 percent. Its price 
fell 0.09 point to 99.05.

<HEADLINE> Tire Co. Settles Suit for $17.7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- A tire manufacturing company will pay  
$17.7 million to a boy who survived a van crash that killed his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. will pay the money to Matthew  
Jensen, who was 4 when his parents died in a 1993 accident that 
happened after a tire on their van fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginny Jensen, 47, was a copy editor at the Sarasota  
Herald-Tribune and her husband, 45-year-old Al Jensen, had once 
worked as a copy editor there as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew was not seriously injured in the crash that followed a  
day at Walt Disney World one week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirelli made the spare tire that Jensen installed on the van  
three days before the accident. The tread on the tire separated, 
and Jensen lost control of the van, which flipped over and was 
rammed by another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirelli agreed in July to settle the lawsuit filed by Mrs.  
Jensen's sister. A federal judge signed the settlement order last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Tampa awarded $5.4 million to Matthew in 1995  
in another lawsuit filed by the estate of his father. Matthew, now 
10, was adopted by his father's niece and her husband. He lives 
with them in New York.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Partner Talks Hit Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Europe's efforts to streamline its aerospace and  
defense industry suffered a setback Wednesday when partners in 
Airbus Industrie failed to draft proposals to turn the group into a 
private company. 
</P>
<P>
	The four partners were due to report this week to their  
respective governments about their plans for restructuring the 
consortium that competes with U.S. aerospace giants Boeing and 
Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aerospatiale Matra, one of four companies in the Airbus  
consortium, said that round table negotiations among the partners 
were reduced to bilateral talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government reacted swiftly, saying it would consult  
its German, Spanish and British counterparts on the report's delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will see with my colleagues what we can do'' to press the  
partners to move ahead, Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus is made up of Aerospatiale Matra, British Aerospace,  
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (Dasa) and Spain's Construcciones 
Aeronauticas (Casa), which is to merge with Dasa. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale and Dasa both hold a 37.9-percent stake in Airbus,  
British Aerospace has 20 percent and Casa has 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts seemed unfazed by the setback.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been talking for a long time. There was a deadline set  
for 1999, but it is likely that will be pushed back now,'' said 
Nicolas Baudouin of the research concern Standard &AMP; Poor's in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they are in bilateral talks but it's very difficult to  
imagine that anyone will want to be left out. It's not in anyone's 
interest to remain isolated,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Antoine Nodet, a financial analyst at Pinatton, a Paris  
brokerage firm, said the partners likely felt no pressure to link 
up. ``At this point there is no need. There is no urgency,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been working this way for 25 years. There is no proof  
that being a company would bring more capability to Airbus. Boeing 
is a company and is having trouble. Airbus is a success,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale Matra's own merger this year was seen as part of  
the European restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	The French state had been reluctant to give up its majority  
ownership but finally agreed, retaining a stake of nearly 48 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the arguments in favor of privatization was that  
Aerospatiale's status as a state-owned company was obstructing 
moves to turn Airbus into a private concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Philippe Camus said Aerospatiale Matra was  
determined to ensure Airbus press ahead with its plans to build a 
``super-jumbo'' airplane, the A-3XX. 
</P>
<P>
	The four governments have said previously it would be easier for  
them to provide financial support to develop the ``super-jumbo'' 
once Airbus became a private company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Aerospatiale Matra reported a loss of 105  
million euros, or $109.02 million, for the first half of the year 
compared with a profit of 285 million euros a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half loss was in line with market expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to 5.75 billion euros, or $5.97 billion, from for  
the first half from 5.62 billion euros a year earlir. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects a better performance in the second half of  
the year although operating profits for the full year would be 
below 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale's helicopter, missiles and services divisions all  
registered operating losses while sales of Airbus and other 
aircraft remained strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half loss included 401 million euros (dlrs 416.35  
million) in foreign exchange charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospatiale said orders in the first half of the year were down  
three percent from the first six months of last year.

<HEADLINE> Congress, Feds Examine Pension Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics of ``cash-balance'' pension plans say  
they can be used without prejudice to older workers by disclosing 
the plans' financial details and allowing employees to choose 
whether to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of Americans are rightly feeling pension anxiety  
because under current law there is no guarantee that their pension 
benefits will not be cut tomorrow,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., sponsor of a bill to permit worker choice and require the 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders spoke after the Senate Health, Education, Labor and  
Pensions Committee held a hearing Tuesday on the growing concerns 
over the cash-balance arrangements, which change the way pensions 
are calculated and can reduce benefits 30 percent or more for 
millions of older workers. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 325 companies with more than $330 billion in pension  
assets have adopted cash-balance plans recently, including such 
large companies as IBM, AT&AMP;T, Eastman Kodak Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Nine of those largest companies employ more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	While companies contend the switch yields numerous advantages,  
the complaint for older workers boils down to simple math. 
</P>
<P>
	In cash-balance plans, employees accrue benefits at a steady  
rate throughout their careers instead of having retirement payments 
based on later, peak earnings as in traditional pensions. In 
thousands of cases, this translates into a cut in projected 
benefits of 30 percent to 50 percent for older workers, government 
experts estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Midcareer workers with long years of service are most likely  
to be hurt,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., the committee 
chairman. ``Those midcareer workers are the ones who were counting 
on the traditional plan for most of their retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was the latest in a series of recent federal actions  
on cash-balance pensions, including an age discrimination 
investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a 
halt by the Internal Revenue Service of automatic approval of the 
plans. Several bills that would regulate the plans are pending in 
Congress, and a case concerning the plans is before the U.S. Tax 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's switch this summer is quickly becoming a national  
barometer for the debate. After triggering a very public employee 
revolt that has yet to subside, the company announced changes last 
week to provide more older workers with a choice between the 
traditional plan and the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	But many feel permanently betrayed and say laws should be  
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM management has broken a bond of trust with all of their  
U.S. employees,'' Bill Syverson, a 19-year IBM employee from 
Vermont, told the Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Like dozens of other companies, IBM executives say they had good  
reasons for converting their pension plan -- not the least of which 
was that 75 percent of its high-tech competitors, such as Microsoft 
Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., don't even offer pensions and have 
more money for other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM human resources chief J. Thomas Bouchard told the Senate  
committee that the cash balance plan, more flexible, allows 
employees to receive lump-sum payouts if they change jobs or get a 
deferred annuity beginning at age 65. And IBM was able to offer 
employees more stock options and salary increases with the pension 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to compete to retain and attract the people required  
to succeed in the future, we had to adjust IBM's overall 
compensation package,'' Bouchard said. ``That meant rebalancing 
what we paid out in cash versus benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Janet Krueger, a 23-year IBM employee from Rochester, Minn.,  
who quit over the flap, said IBM did a poor job of explaining 
differences between plans. Ms. Krueger, now part of the IBM 
Employees Benefit Action Coalition, insisted Tuesday the lack of 
communication was designed to keep workers in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was not a clue how we might figure it out,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Congress are pushing for changes. Sanders and  
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., want to require detailed disclosure 
45 days in advance if companies plan to reduce benefits. In 
addition, they want companies to offer all employees a choice 
between old and new pension plans or face financial sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jeffords backs a less-sweeping measure, Republican  
support for such reforms has been slow in coming. And corporate 
America is sending a clear message: Without varied benefit options, 
more companies will opt not to offer pensions.

<HEADLINE> Producer of ABC's 'This Week' Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a change at the top of ABC's struggling  
``This Week,'' which has lost its dominance among Sunday morning 
public affairs shows to NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorrance Smith, whose second stint as executive producer began  
in 1995, quit on Wednesday. The former adviser to President Bush 
hinted he may jump back into politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the original producer of ``This Week'' when it  
premiered with David Brinkley as moderator in 1981. The show 
livened up the often stale Sunday morning political landscape and 
was a ratings powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet ``This Week,'' now with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts as  
hosts, has lost 27 percent of its audience since Brinkley left in 
1997. ``Meet the Press'' now has more than 900,000 more viewers on 
average than ``This Week'' every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show can still make waves -- like when presidential candidate  
Bill Bradley and Donaldson on Sunday traded admissions that they 
had tried marijuana -- but is often eclipsed by NBC in landing 
newsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith returned to ABC and ``This Week'' in 1995 after his stint  
in the Bush administration and work in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``After producing over 600 Sunday morning programs, it is time  
for me to move on,'' Smith said in a statement. ``I wish my 
colleagues the best as I pursue other opportunities that are 
available in the upcoming political year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the show struggling, management didn't stand in his way.  
ABC News President David Westin said he was ``grateful for his many 
years of dedicated service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dorrance has been doing this a long time,'' Donaldson said.  
``It got to be a grind. I can sympathize with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to appeal to more viewers, ``This Week'' recently  
began producing the show earlier, at 9 a.m. It airs at that time in 
New York, jumping the gun on ``Meet the Press,'' but many markets 
still broadcast the program on tape at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior producer Virginia Mosely will fill in for Smith until a  
permanent replacement is named. Donaldson said he didn't expect, 
from recent conversations with Westin, that the show's 
personalities, which also include George Will and George 
Stephanopoulos, will be changed.

<HEADLINE> Senate: U.S. Should Be OK for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world won't end on Jan. 1 with a  
Y2K-related computer crash, but Americans should be ready for 
short-term disruptions ranging from higher gas prices to local 
power outages, a Senate panel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With 100 days left before computers run up against the year 2000  
date, federal agencies and the national infrastructure are in solid 
shape, but seven states remain in the ``danger zone'' with less 
than 70 percent of computer systems ready, the Y2K panel said in 
its final report. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is similar in the private sector, with big  
businesses, particularly in the banking and investment industry, 
confident their computers are ready while many smaller businesses 
could run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will not be a horizontal, systematic failure,'' said  
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who heads the Senate panel with Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. Problems ``will not occur across the 
nation. They will occur across the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's committee has held nearly 30 hearings since spring of  
last year on the consequences of the Y2K glitch, in which computers 
programmed to read only the last two digits of a year might mistake 
the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the federal government will have spent some $8  
billion to fix its computers and the nation as a whole anywhere 
from $50 billion to $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	This investment, he said, ``appears to have paid off.'' National  
power grids, phone systems, ATM machines and air travel should work 
fine on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect the four horsemen, armed with flood and  
catastrophe, to be riding in on Jan. 1, 2000,'' said Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the first lawmakers to raise the 
Y2K issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report also warned against complacency. It cited an  
August survey that concluded that seven states -- Alabama, 
California, Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Wyoming 
-- had fixed less than 70 percent of systems affecting such programs 
as child nutrition, food stamps and unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	California's top Y2K official said the Senate's numbers are out  
of date. Chief Information Officer Elias Cortez told a legislative 
committee last week that 95 percent of the state's important 
computer systems are fixed and have been checked by outside experts 
as of Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  
Medicaid and Medicare, listed eight states this month as ``high 
risk'' in terms of keeping up with Medicaid child health insurance 
or eligibility claims after Jan. 1. They were Alabama, Alaska, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North 
Dakota and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota officials said the list was based on a March review  
of state procedures. Sheldon Wolf, the state's assistant Medicaid 
director, said HCFA did a second assessment earlier this month and 
the preliminary conclusion was that North Dakota's computer systems 
are at low risk for Year 2000 problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The report gave its top five stars to the financial services  
industry for having the lowest risk of Y2K-related failures, and 
four stars to the utilities and telecommunications sectors. Getting 
its worst two-star ratings were the health care industry and the 
Y2K situation outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	While large-scale hospitals have invested in computer fixes, it  
found a less positive outlook for small inner-city and rural 
hospitals and among the nation's 800,000 doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The report named Russia, China and Italy among the many  
countries that appear to be far behind in fixing computers, raising 
the possibility of economic downturns. Disruptions in oil flows may 
affect gas prices, although the Energy Department believes this 
will not occur. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, the report said the committee was surprised by  
the wastewater industry's low level of readiness. Short-term local 
power or phone outages were possible and computer problems among 
small businesses that lack the money or the technology to fix their 
systems ``could have a ripple effect ... that will affect their 
bigger business partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it warned against overreacting, saying, ``One great area of  
concern is that panic buying and stockpiling of food might result 
in a self-fulfilling prophecy resulting in shortages and 
disruptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you stockpile anything for Y2K, stockpile information''  
about the preparations of local food suppliers, governments and 
utilities, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, said he  
and the committee were ``pretty much in agreement on where the 
risks are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, he said, is that ``there will be some glitches,  
and nobody is guaranteeing perfection even in the sectors'' where 
much money and technical know-how has been employed.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bob Errey, a left wing who played on Mario  
Lemieux's line when the Pittsburgh Penguins owner was a rookie in 
1984, was released Wednesday by the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Errey, 35, was invited to training camp on a tryout basis. He  
appeared in two exhibition games, going scoreless with two penalty 
minutes. Errey once was San Jose's captain when current Penguins 
coach Kevin Constantine coached the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins also released defenseman David Wilkie and assigned  
forward Martin Sonnenberg to Wilkes-Barre-Scranton of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkie, 25, also was invited to camp on a tryout basis.  
Sonnenberg, 21, played 44 games for Pittsburgh last season, scoring 
one goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The roster moves leave the Penguins with 18 forwards, nine  
defensemen and three goaltenders.

<HEADLINE> United Technologies Cuts More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. plans to reduce  
its worldwide workforce by an additional 9,000 jobs as the company 
looks to reduce costs amid a downturn in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartford, Conn.-based company also announced Wednesday that  
it plans close 8.5 million square feet in manufacturing and other 
space. Most of those closures are expected overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks are the latest move by UTC to restructure its  
business. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, UTC's jet-control's division Hamilton Sundstand  
announced it was cutting 1,500 jobs and consolidating plants. 
Previously announced cuts included 1,500 jobs at Pratt &AMP; Whitney; 
1,100 at Sikorsky Aircraft; 400 at Carrier Corp.; 700 at Pratt &AMP; 
Whitney-Canada; and 165 at Otis Elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with Wednesday's announcement, UTC plans to slash more  
than 14,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce over the next three 
years. UTC spokesman Peter Dalpe said the company would not give 
specifics on exactly where the jobs will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps are intended to assure that we maintain our  
competitiveness throughout our markets worldwide,'' UTC chairman 
and chief executive George David said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they were surprised by the scope of the  
reductions, given the already deep job cuts made by UTC recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought UTC had restructured and rationalized their  
operations a while ago, but this goes to show that they still have 
areas where they can improve their efficiency by reducing their 
manpower,'' said Richard Pettibone, an aerospace and defense 
analyst at Forecast International, based in Newtown, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to spend about $1.15 billion in  
restructuring charges in 1999. T The third-quarter charge is 
estimated at about $750 million, while about $75 million in charges 
have already been recorded in the first two quarters. The remainder 
will be recorded in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC provides a broad range of high technology products and  
supports services to the building systems and aerospace industry. 
It operates in 183 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC shares fell $2.25, or 3.7 percent, to $58.62 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> California Clears Retail Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a bill that  
would bar new superstores such as Costco from being built in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The way the Legislature handled the bill was ``deplorable,''  
Davis said Wednesday at a news conference. Lawmakers pushed the 
measure through by waiving rules designed to provide several public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of supermarkets and labor unions developed the bill  
in the final days of the Legislature's session, contending such 
retailers would run local grocers out of business and reduce wages 
and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was the first attempt by a state to resist  
``big-box'' stores -- giant retailers such as Costco Wal-Mart, Kmart 
and Target. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would have banned local governments from approving new  
retail stores with more than 100,000 square feet and more than 
15,000 square feet of nontaxable merchandise, such as groceries and 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This veto is a victory for consumers, for California families  
who want good prices and the right to choose where they shop,'' 
said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Cynthia Lin. ``Through letters, petitions 
and phone calls, Californians sent a loud and clear message to the 
governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he was less troubled by the substance of the  
bill than by the fact that it materialized the last week of the 
legislative session, with very little review by legislative 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you make major public policy changes, they should be  
subject to public scrutiny and have the benefit of policy committee 
hearings in both houses,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> American Seafoods Settles Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- American Seafoods has agreed to a $1.25 million  
settlement of a lawsuit filed by 18 Vietnamese workers who accused 
the fishing-industry leader of racial discrimination, breach of 
contract and inhumane treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers claimed the large fishing company created a hostile  
work environment, denied them training and promotional 
opportunities, subjected them to poor working conditions, demoted 
them and reduced their pay, and terminated those who sought time 
off due to illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was announced Wednesday at the Seattle offices of  
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which intervened in 
the case on the workers' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	American Seafoods also will start a new program of equal  
training and employment opportunities, conduct training on its 
discrimination policies and procedures, and provide quarterly 
compliance reports to the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement ``is a significant step in changing the way  
employers in the Seattle-Alaskan fishing industry review their 
largely minority processing crews,'' said Jeannette Leino, director 
of the EEOC's Seattle office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I chose to settle this thing because I thought what the EEOC  
was proposing was basically a good business idea for American 
Seafoods,'' Mike Hyde, the company's president, told The Seattle 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not immediately return a telephone call Wednesday from  
The Associated Press seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	EEOC involvement led to ``significant admissions'' about the  
company's lack of adequate procedures for training and promoting 
the workers, ``as well as its complete disregard for the health and 
safety of the Vietnamese American workers,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 plaintiffs sued in state court after catching the flu  
while aboard one of the company's ships, the Ocean Rover, off 
Alaska in February 1998. They said American Seafoods failed to 
provide them with treatment and adequate time off work for 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was moved to U.S. District Court in April 1998, and  
the EEOC intervened in September of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said the sick claims were not handled well and that ``if  
people get sick we have an obligation under the law to cover those 
sorts of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The monetary settlement results 100 percent from the people  
being sick,'' Hyde told the Times. ``It does not relate at all to 
the allegations of discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the plaintiffs got sick, American Seafoods was the  
largest fishing company in the United States, with 16 factory 
trawlers operating in the Bering Sea and waters off Russia and 
South America, and more than 2,000 fishermen, the EEOC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is still a dominant industry force, but recent  
congressional action has forced cutbacks in its fleet, the agency 
said.

<HEADLINE> Perry: North Korea To Suspend Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States expects North Korea  
to announce soon a moratorium on missile tests in return for the 
partial lifting of U.S. sanctions on the communist state, a U.S. 
policy coordinator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Perry, Washington's pointman on North Korea, said months  
of negotiations between U.S. and North Korean officials have led to 
an understanding that Pyongyang should make a formal announcement 
``in the weeks ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Pyongyang's Stalinist regime breaches that promise and goes  
ahead with long-range missile tests, the United States will restore 
sanctions and contain the North's military threat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope and expect that in the weeks ahead, North Korea will  
make a definitive statement about the suspension of missile 
tests,'' Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Perry, the former U.S. defense secretary,  
met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to discuss North Korea 
policy recommendations that he presented to President Clinton last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lifted on Friday a half-century of restrictions on  
trade, travel and banking against North Korea, the most significant 
gesture toward Pyongyang since the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions remain on sales of U.S. weapons and unlicensed exports  
of ``dual-use'' goods or technology -- items that could have 
military uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much more work has to be done, but this is the first step ...  
toward the removal of the threat and danger of war on the Korean 
Peninsula, and toward normal relations among the countries in the 
region,'' Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are unsuccessful in persuading North Korea to remove the  
threat, we must take actions to contain the threat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea, which welcomed the U.S. move, reportedly plans to  
send Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju to Washington in late 
October to discuss improving ties with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kang, a close confidant of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, will  
be the first top North Korean government official to visit 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rattled nerves in Asia and Washington after firing a  
missile over Japan last year. The United States feared the North 
was on the verge of testing another missile, this one capable of 
striking Alaska or Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fought on South Korea's side during the Korean  
War, and about 37,000 U.S. troops remain in the South under a 
defense treaty.

<HEADLINE> Sooners Finding Success Through Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- After two years with an offense that was  
usually offensive, Oklahoma is back near the top of the national 
charts -- third in total offense, sixth in scoring. Just like old 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Except it's not at all like old times.  
</P>
<P>
	These Sooners throw the football. A lot. They have thrown 99  
passes in the first two games, victories over Indiana State and 
Baylor. Quarterback Josh Heupel has already set single-game school 
records for touchdown passes (5), pass attempts (54), completions 
(37), passing yards (420) and total offense (397 yards). 
</P>
<P>
	Heupel's 68 completions through two games are more than any  
quarterback completed in a season during Barry Switzer's 16 years 
running the wishbone. 
</P>
<P>
	The option game at Oklahoma has essentially been dead since  
Switzer left 10 years ago. but his three successors all sought a 
balance between passing and running. 
</P>
<P>
	This offense doesn't. Coordinator Mike Leach looks to throw  
first, then run. Of Oklahoma's first 20 plays against Baylor last 
weekend, 15 were passes. 
</P>
<P>
	First-year coach Bob Stoops said he isn't surprised the offense  
has been so effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen it for a long time, played against it for three  
years,'' said Stoops, who as defensive coordinator at Florida went 
against Kentucky, where Leach was offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen it everywhere that they have run this offense and  
this system with coach Leach, they've put up these kind of numbers. 
Why would here be any different?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps because Oklahoma's offense was anemic in the recent  
past. Quarterback play that was average at best, coupled with 
indecision by coach John Blake over which offense he wanted to use, 
resulted in problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a 1,000-yard tailback, the Sooners averaged only 315  
yards and 18 points per game in Blake's final two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense used by Leach gives the quarterback a lot of  
freedom, and therefore requires especially good play from that 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Heupel impressed Leach right away with his desire to study game  
film. He picked up the offense quickly and established himself as a 
leader, so much so that he was voted a captain after being on 
campus just a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander doesn't have a particularly strong arm, but  
doesn't need one to direct a passing game that generally relies on 
short, quick-hitting routes. He has completed 72 percent of his 
passes so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt all along that Josh was a strong quarterback,'' Stoops  
said. ``We love his attitude, love the way he prepares. With the 
summer he's had, the spring he had, we figured Josh would be pretty 
solid and he's definitely been that.''

<HEADLINE> Watson To Interview with Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Bob Watson, set to interview for the Seattle  
Mariners' general manager spot, insisted Wednesday he's the right 
person to help turn around the struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates mentioned for the job include rising star Billy  
Beane, GM of the Oakland A's. Watson did not sound worried about 
his competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in trouble. Take a look at my credentials. Across the  
board, from a player, a coach, an assistant GM, a GM, and you tell 
me they're not in trouble,'' Watson, 53, said in a phone interview 
from his Houston home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners GM Woody Woodward will resign effective Oct. 31.  
Seattle won the AL West in 1995 and 1997, but slumped to 76-85 last 
year and has been below .500 for much of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners supposedly contacted Beane, 37, earlier this week.  
He has been credited with making trades that have enabled the A's 
to contend this year for a wild-card berth with a payroll of only 
$22 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said he wasn't necessarily chasing a job when Mariners  
president Chuck Armstrong called him this week. Watson said he did 
not know what day his interview would take place. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners manager Lou Piniella and Watson played together for the  
New York Yankees in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson was GM of the Houston Astros for two years before  
becoming GM of the New York Yankees after the 1995 season. Watson 
helped build the Yankees into the 1996 World Series champions, but 
left prior to the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his experience as Yankees GM ``seasoned me to the point  
where I won't be surprised by anything. I wouldn't be remiss in 
saying my experience here in Houston would be something that would 
serve me well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson acknowledged he'd have some catching up to do, after  
spending a year-and-a-half out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game changes basically every day,'' Watson said. ``There's  
a lot that goes on and I'll try and get up to speed as fast as I 
can if I'm the one they choose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said the Seattle job would be appealing for a number of  
reasons, including a new ballpark -- Safeco Field -- and star players 
Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have some of the top talent in the major leagues,'' he  
said. ``You probably have the marquee players in baseball in your 
center fielder and your shortstop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey and Rodriguez are both eligible to become free agents  
after the 2000 season. Club officials have said retaining the two 
players is a priority, but so far no significant progress has been 
been made in that direction.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Anderson Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- If the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons are  
going to bounce back from an 0-2 start, they'll have to do it 
without their best player. 
</P>
<P>
	From Super Bowl to super disappointment, the Falcons received  
another devastating blow Tuesday: All-Pro running back Jamal 
Anderson is out for the season because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee  
Monday night in a 24-7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, crumpling to the 
turf on his third carry of the game without being touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the way life is,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``You are  
not going to get a lot of sympathy from anybody. People aren't 
really interested in anything other than results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson rushed for a franchise-record 1,846 yards and set an  
NFL mark with 410 carries last season. His punishing style and 
remarkable durability set the tone for a ball-control offense that 
helped the Falcons reach the Super Bowl for the first time in their 
34-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Atlanta will hand the ball to third-year back Byron  
Hanspard, who missed last season with an injured knee after rushing 
for 335 yards as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely upset and saddened by this turn of fate,''  
Anderson said. ``I will do everything in my power to return better 
than I was before, as quickly as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won't be returning this season. The personable, 26-year-old  
Anderson, whose ``Dirty Bird'' dance became a symbol of the 
Falcons' improbable run to the Super Bowl, is expected to undergo 
surgery in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the best of circumstances, he would be recovered in time  
for the start of training camp next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is one of those deals that it happens, and you hate it, but  
you can't dwell on it,'' Reeves said. ``We have got to move forward 
and try to get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Anderson missed two weeks of training camp in a  
contract dispute, finally reporting two days before the first 
exhibition game after receiving a five-year, $32 million contract -- 
including a $7.5 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was held to 50 yards on 16 carries in a season-opening  
loss to Minnesota, and managed only 9 yards against the Cowboys 
before his season came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was asked if the holdout might have contributed to  
Anderson's injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has got their opinions and so forth, but you don't  
know and you never will know,'' the coach replied. ``It is just 
unfortunate that it happened. It happens a lot. It seems like when 
a guy holds out, he comes back in and has injuries. That is the 
tough part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cowboys, Atlanta already was missing quarterback  
Chris Chandler, who strained a hamstring against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Without their two best offensive players, the Falcons failed to  
move inside the Dallas 30 until the fourth quarter. They avoided 
their first shutout since 1993 when third-string quarterback Danny 
Kanell threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Tim Dwight with four 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler is questionable for Sunday against St. Louis.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was injured on a seemingly harmless play, raising more  
questions about the effects of playing on artificial turf. After 
taking a handoff, he attempted to cut to the left while still in 
the backfield. He crumpled to the ground in obvious pain with no 
one around him. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the injury was diagnosed as merely a sprain. A more  
extensive examination revealed the Falcons' worst fears: Anderson 
tore his ACL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is one of those deals that you could possibly not do  
anything and he possibly could play two or three of the last games 
of the season,'' Reeves said. ``But that would jeopardize his 
career, and we don't want to do that. We will get the thing fixed 
and hopefully have it so that in the future it will be a good, 
sound knee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, an obscure seventh-round pick from Utah in 1994,  
developed into one of the Falcons' most dynamic players, rushing 
for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	That streak effectively came to an end when he joined a growing  
list of players already out for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns linebacker Chris Spielman retired after a neck injury,  
while Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde and Chiefs running back 
Kimble Anders went down with torn Achilles' tendons. Denver 
linebacker John Mobley, St. Louis quarterback Trent Green and Jets 
running back-kick returner Leon Johnson all tore knee ligaments.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Funding Back-Up Daycare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Janette Hartman once had few options when her  
4-year-old daughter's caregiver fell sick or went away. Mostly, she 
just ended up staying home. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year ago, her employer, the catalog retailer Lands' End,  
created a backup day care center, where children can go if a sitter 
is ill, their school has a snow day or if the child is sick and 
can't go to group day care. That solution proved a godsend to Ms. 
Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
	A hot trend in child care, backup care is growing fast. Thirteen  
percent of employers now provide it, up from 5 percent in 1993, 
according to Hewitt &AMP; Associates consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton praised the idea Wednesday  
after touring a Manhattan backup center used by more than 30 
companies, from J. P. Morgan to Sony Music Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	She stood for a minute watching 13-month-old triplets who'd been  
dropped off that morning because their father -- their primary 
caregiver -- was busy with the family's move to a new house. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fills a real need that exists in the child care world,''  
Mrs. Clinton told a gathering of business leaders and work-family 
researchers. ``Productivity goes up and turnover goes down when 
employees know that their child is well taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center she visited is run by ChildrenFirst Inc., a  
Boston-based company that runs 18 backup programs nationwide, all 
for well children. A large day care chain, Bright Horizons Family 
Solutions, runs 38 backup centers, including some that take mildly 
ill children. Fourteen of those opened in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with helping retain workers, companies find that it's  
often cheaper to buy slots in a backup center that many employees 
take turns using, than to build a costly day care center for just a 
few children. 
</P>
<P>
	Fees vary, but it generally costs companies with 300 or fewer  
employees $28,000 a year and up to buy a slot at a ChildrenFirst 
center. Building an on-site child care center can cost millions, an 
impossible price tag for small companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of ChildrenFirst's corporate clients charge their employees  
nothing for the care, while half charge a nominal $10 to $20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there are the staff hours saved.  
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan Bank, one of the pioneers in the field, says it  
saved $820,000 in reduced absenteeism in 1996 alone by offering 
backup care for its New York employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the bank has three of its own centers nationwide and plans  
to add eight more by 2001. Some of the centers also offer separate 
rooms for mildly ill children, who can't attend group care. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to offering 20 free days a year of backup care, the  
company offers eight extra weeks to workers returning after the 
birth or adoption of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a critical juncture for people,'' said Christine  
Fossaceca, work-life director at Chase. ``They're making a decision 
about whether to return to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup care saved Susan Deland from quitting her job as a  
lending officer at J.P. Morgan. Last spring as her maternity leave 
was ending, she called to resign because she couldn't find a good 
nanny. 
</P>
<P>
	But when her employer offered a spot for her son at a backup  
center near her work, she was able to spend six weeks finding a 
nanny she loved. 
</P>
<P>
	While initially created in the early 1990s by law firms for top  
attorneys, backup care is increasingly offered to lower level 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend is to offer the situation in manufacturing or call  
centers, where employees also have child care that breaks down a 
lot,'' said Roger Brown, president of Bright Horizons. 
</P>
<P>
	Janette Hartman, who takes telephone orders for Lands' End, says  
the company's backup center in Dodgeville, Wis. provides the peace 
of mind she needs to continue working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I don't have to worry, because the backup center is  
there,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``Now I don't have 
anxiety over what's going to happen to my child.''

<HEADLINE> Jug's Top Two Favorites Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELAWARE, Ohio (AP) -- It won't be difficult for the two  
favorites in Thursday's Little Brown Jug to keep an eye on each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissful Hall and The Panderosa will be right next to one  
another in the first of three divisions of the second leg of the 
Triple Crown of Pacing for 3-year-olds at Delaware County 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mile-long elimination, the first few feet could make all  
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're leaving,'' John Campbell, The Panderosa'a driver, said  
of his plans. ``We're not dropping back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the banked, half-mile track, the early front-runner has a  
huge advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'd be nice if we could step around The Panderosa before we  
hit the first turn,'' said Ron Pierce, driver for Blissful Hall. 
``We'll have to see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top three finishers in each division advance to a second  
heat. If a division winner wins that, he wins the Jug. Otherwise, 
the four winners decide the Jug champion in a raceoff. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Pierce ended up in the sulky of Shady Character when  
Mike Lachance -- who had driven Shady Character to an elimination 
victory by four lengths -- elected to drive Artiscape in the final. 
Lachance ended up fourth, while Pierce got Shady Character off to a 
fast start, then held on to beat stablemate Cam Knows Best by a 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about it the last couple of weeks,'' Pierce  
said. ``I loved the experience I had last yea,r but it would mean a 
little more to me with this Blissful Hall colt because I have been 
driving him all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He, however. wishes he wasn't outside The Panderosa at the post.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really happy with the draw,'' Pierce said. ``Hopefully  
we'll overcome it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blissful Hall won the first leg of the Triple Crown, taking the  
Cane Pace three weeks ago by 2 1/4 lengths over Heartbeat Mindale. The 
horse has won eight of 11 starts with two seconds this year and has 
earned $529,395. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quite a horse right now. He's a gorilla,'' Pierce said.  
``When you let him pace, he can really go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panderosa, who has won five of eight starts, with one  
second, this year, will start in the No. 6 hole, with Blissful Hall 
next to him on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been questions about The Panderosa's mental and  
physical fitness after he broke stride in two of his last three 
starts -- including the Cane as he was making a move at the 5/8ths 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly got a break when The Panderosa broke,'' Blissful  
Hall trainer Ben Wallace said after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Glazer, The Panderosa's owner, is anything but cocky even  
though his horse has won more than $1 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly aren't brimming with confidence,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Island Fantasy, with Lachance seeking a fifth Jug win, is the  
favorite in the second division. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorite in the third division of the 54th annual Jug is  
Grinfromeartoear, riding a two-racee winning streak, including his 
most recent start Sept. 11 in the Brown Jug Preview.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Warns of Nuclear Doomsday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- South Asian nuclear rivals India and  
Pakistan carried their hostilities to the U.N. General Assembly on 
Wednesday, accusing each other of pushing the fragile region toward 
a bloody conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Warning of nuclear ``doomsday'' in South Asia, Pakistan urged  
world leaders and the United Nations to stop India from developing 
a massive arsenal of atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, India became a nuclear power, and Pakistan matched  
India's first nuclear test within days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said the world should not  
believe India's promise not to be the first of the two to use 
atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan believes that it is now essential to convene a  
conference, with the participation of all permanent members of the 
Security Council ... to promote the goals of strategic restraint 
and stability in South Asia,'' Aziz told the General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh blamed Pakistan for  
the rising tensions. He said Pakistan had spurned India's olive 
branch and attacked the northern Himalayan region of Kashmir. Both 
countries claim the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers had hoped that Singh and Aziz would meet in New  
York on the sidelines of the General Assembly in an effort to 
reduce tensions. But Indian diplomats said Pakistan had not 
requested a meeting. They did not say why India never requested a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's newest nuclear nations nearly went to war earlier  
this year. Hundreds of soldiers from both sides were killed in 
fighting in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has raised the danger of a full-scale nuclear war  
among the two nations. They have fought three wars since gaining 
independence from Britain in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Pakistan's Aziz proposed a six-point program to  
get India to reduce its nuclear weapons, starting with India 
dropping its ambitious plan for an atomic arsenal and developing 
long-range ballistic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, ``Pakistan will be compelled to enhance its nuclear  
and missile capabilities and operational readiness to preserve 
deterrence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aziz urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir  
imbroglio. He said people in Kashmir -- the only Muslim-majority 
state in predominantly Hindu India -- should have a chance to vote 
against staying under Indian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	But India's Singh told the General Assembly that Kashmir was an  
integral part of India and its future was not negotiable. He also 
defended India's nuclear weapons, saying it had been obliged to 
acquire them because neighboring Pakistan and China possess them. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, the European Union, Japan and most other  
countries have urged India and Pakistan to roll back their nuclear 
programs. The two countries have refused to open negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Hurt in Indonesia Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- More than 2,000 demonstrators opposed  
to a government plan to give more power to Indonesia's military 
scuffled with police Wednesday in the country's two main cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police in the capital of Jakarta fired tear gas at one  
group of demonstrators and ran into the crowd, swinging batons. 
Police said several dozen protesters were injured, but declined to 
specify a number. Several protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and units of elite soldiers fanned out to surround  
another group, forcing them to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators were trying to march on parliament to protest  
a bill giving the military wide-ranging powers during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If parliament passes this bill, our country will be fascist,''  
one protester shouted through a loudspeaker to the crowd, made up 
mostly of students. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia's second-largest city, Surabaya, about 500 students  
clashed with security officers outside a provincial government 
building. Witnesses said 19 students who forced their way inside 
were beaten with sticks and injured, three of them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would let the military control the news media, ban  
demonstrations and brush aside some human rights in the event of a 
political crisis. Lawmakers were to vote this week on the 
legislation, drawn up by military leaders and sponsored by 
army-appointed deputies in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Military spokesman Brig. Gen. Sudrajat defended the bill  
Wednesday, saying it would give the military a ``clear and straight 
legal framework'' in the event of riots or ``outside threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators on Tuesday agreed to water down the wording of the  
controversial bill. But many Indonesians, who have supported the 
country's recent hard-won democratic reforms, remain adamantly 
opposed to the act.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Officially Enters GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Conservative commentator and former U.N.  
Ambassador Alan Keyes says conservatives need to stick together, 
stick with the GOP and stick with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time for us to abandon the decent heart of the  
Republican majority,'' he said Tuesday after formally announcing he 
will seek the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grassroots Republicans in this state deserve a real  
conservative choice and I am determined that they will have one,'' 
he told a crowd of about sixty supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said conservatives should stay with the GOP so Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush ``or anybody else who isn't really committed to the 
conservative agenda'' doesn't win the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith recently left the party to run as  
an independent. And Pat Buchanan has said he may leave for the 
Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are concerned that a Buchanan defection could take  
votes away from the party's nominee. Polls suggest that up to twice 
as many Bush voters as Gore supporters would vote for Buchanan on a 
Reform Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was the right time for me to send a signal to all  
my people: Do not jump ship; we need to fight this battle here,'' 
Keyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, who also ran for the nomination in 1996, said that though  
Republicans are battling over the abortion issue, the GOP's 
platform remains opposed to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're fighting about right now is whether  
pro-life leadership will sit where it belongs at the head of the 
table,'' he said. ``I will fight on the line of moral principle 
within the Republican party until we prevail. I will not desert the 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, who is getting single digits in the polls, told  
supporters not to worry about the media or pollsters.

<HEADLINE> Danforth To Meet Davidian Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special counsel investigating a possible  
Waco cover-up is asking for information from the lawyers who are 
suing the government on behalf of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	But less than two weeks on the job, the special counsel, John  
Danforth, is also griping to former colleagues in the U.S. Senate 
about its own fledgling investigation into the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, meanwhile, moved to widen their probe to  
include other Justice Department controversies, even as they 
appeared at odds among themselves on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, who would head the proposed Senate probe, is  
considering hiring the former federal prosecutor who publicly 
disagreed with Attorney General Janet Reno over an investigation of 
Democratic fund-raising abuses in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, R-Pa., a few days ago broached the idea of hiring  
Charles LaBella as the lead investigator for what would be a 
five-member bipartisan Senate task force, Sen. Charles Grassley, 
R-Iowa, confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella left the Justice Department earlier this year after  
disagreeing with Reno over whether to appoint an independent 
counsel in the campaign money investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who would sit on the task force, voiced concern that  
hiring LaBella could taint an inquiry that will focus largely on 
Reno's stewardship of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the positive side, he knows where all the skeletons are,''  
Grassley said in an interview. ``On the negative side, it could 
send a signal that there is a preconceived notion about the FBI and 
the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,  
Republican, pointed a finger at Specter after Danforth expressed 
irritation that the Senate had moved ahead with its own inquiries 
in Texas after promising to give him precedence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had agreed that we would work together so that I  
can fulfill my mission as special counsel, recognizing that 
Congress has its own responsibilities to fulfill,'' Danforth said 
in a Sept. 17 letter to Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, 
the senior Democrat on Hatch's committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not within the spirit of cooperation for the Judiciary  
Committee to dispatch personnel to Waco without even troubling to 
give me a call,'' wrote Danforth, a former Republican senator from 
Missouri. His letter was obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the investigators traveled to Texas at Specter's  
direction and ``not with full committee authorization.'' He pledged 
to cooperate with Danforth as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan task force headed by Specter was proposed earlier  
by Senate Republicans as a way to resolve an impasse over the scope 
and leadership of the Waco investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the task force would investigate ``whether or not the  
Justice Department is serving the American people'' in its handling 
of controversies from Waco to Chinese nuclear espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatch said it would move forward only if Senate Democratic  
Leader Tom Daschle and Leahy of Vermont agree to it by Thursday. If 
not, he said, the proceedings would take place in the 
Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy expressed concern over the scope and likely cost of such  
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many would treat this as a way of getting at Janet Reno rather  
than who in the FBI withheld information'' during earlier Waco 
investigations, Leahy told reporters after the private meeting in 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, meanwhile, was moving on several fronts after  
traveling Monday to the Texas site, where an estimated 80 followers 
of sect leader David Korish died in a fiery blaze in April 1993 
following a 51-day siege by federal law enforcement agents. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants his staff to meet within the next two weeks with  
lawyers pressing a wrongful-death lawsuit against the government on 
behalf of surviving Davidians and relatives of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the lawyers Monday, Danforth requested the  
attorneys' views on the FBI's use of pyrotechnic tear gas 
canisters, the ``allegedly improper use of the U.S. armed forces,'' 
and the way certain evidence and testimony was presented to 
Congress. He asked them to specify the most important witnesses and 
evidence bearing on those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial on the lawsuit, which accuses the government of using  
excessive force, had been set to begin next month. But U.S. 
District Judge Walter Smith in Texas last week postponed it to give 
the government more time to produce the evidence he has demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Caddell, the Houston lawyer who is lead counsel in the  
suit, said he would cooperate with Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very willing to meet with them to discuss our evidence  
with them, to have them meet with our witnesses, including our 
experts without any strings attached to that,'' Cadell said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth last week asked for a month's delay in the trial so his  
investigators could interview witnesses beforehand.

<HEADLINE> Boston To Greet 2000 a Bit Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bostonians might want to begin chilling their  
champagne a bit earlier than usual on Dec 31. The city plans to pop 
the corks at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting customary Eastern Standard Time, the city has  
announced it will ring in the New Year when it arrives in 
Greenwich, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be marking the millennium when it's midnight in  
Greenwich, according to Greenwich Mean Time, which is the 
universally accepted standard of time for the world,'' Mayor Tom 
Menino said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan means Boston would be the first U.S. city to celebrate  
the new millennium. Planners for the city's First Night celebration 
expect about 2 million attendees, about 500,000 more than in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwich Mean Time was established in 1884 by representatives  
from 25 countries who gathered in Washington to establish a 
standardized time system. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwich was selected as the benchmark because the city's Royal  
Observatory played a key role in early navigation and timekeeping 
at sea by tracking celestial movements.

simply perpetuates the ethnic Albanian army and could help Kosovo 
achieve independence from Yugoslavia, said Oliver Ivanovic, a Serb 
community leader in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely sure that members of the Kosovo Corps will be  
members of the (KLA) in different uniforms and, of course, with the 
same attitude'' against Serbs, Ivanovic said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To protest the formation of the Kosovo Protection Corps, Serbian  
representatives resigned Wednesday from Kosovo's joint 
Serb-Albanian council, which works with the United Nations on 
creating multiethnic structures in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Kouchner, who heads the U.N. mission in Kosovo and  
presides over the joint Serb-Albanian council, denied Serb 
allegations that the corps was a continuation of the KLA and 
dismissed the Serbs' resignation as a public display of outrage 
against international officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just needed to do something against the council in front  
of their public and they chose to do this,'' Kouchner said, adding 
that he would continue to cooperate with the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovska Mitrovica, Ivanovic said Serb community  
representatives would meet Friday to consider a response and 
possibly to decide on organizing their own Serbian national guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose (NATO) is preparing for Kosovo some kind of ...  
independence,'' Ivanovic said. ``We cannot accept that Kosovo will 
be independent. There's no life for Serbs in an independent 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement signed by the United Nations, NATO and the  
KLA late Monday, the new Kosovo Protection Corps would perform 
humanitarian missions and help rebuild Kosovo after 18 months of 
ethnic warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Former KLA commander Agim Ceku will also command the corps and  
most members are expected to come from KLA ranks. Kouchner said 10 
percent of the slots would be reserved for Serbs and other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere in Kosovo are Serb suspicions deeper and the  
shortcomings of the three-month-old, NATO-led peacekeeping mission 
more evident than in the divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica, 30 
miles northwest of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of promoting multiethnicity, French peacekeepers have  
enforced a division of the city, which local Serbs say is necessary 
to protect them from vengeful ethnic Albanians. The policy, 
however, has denied some ethnic Albanians the chance to return to 
homes they fled during the 18-month crackdown on the KLA that 
triggered NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some NATO and U.N. officials, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, fear Serb militants may be infiltrating into Kosovska 
Mitrovica from the Serbian border, 40 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	They can travel down the Ibar River valley along a route that  
takes them past Serb villages without fear of running into ethnic 
Albanian militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ibar runs through the center of this drab industrial city,  
with Serbs on the north bank and Albanians, the south. French 
troops guard the bridge, preventing free movement from one sector 
to the other to avoid violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been to create a situation similar to the  
division of Berlin during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	On the south bank, walls are decorated with KLA graffiti, and  
the sound of Albanian language songs blares from cafes. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the bridge about 200 yards to the north, Kosovo is  
unquestionably Serb. At the La Dolce Vita bar, young Serb men 
sometimes play nationalist songs on a sound system at maximum 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Many signs are written in Cyrillic lettering, not Albanian,  
which is written in the Latin alphabet like English. Shop windows 
are marked with a cross and the letter `S' in Cyrillic four times, 
standing for the slogan, ``Only Unity Can Save the Serbs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vendors sell newspapers from Belgrade, not Pristina, Kosovo's  
provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere is of a defiant community that considers itself  
under siege, threatened by ethnic Albanians and abandoned by the 
Yugoslav government, which has its hands full handling a challenge 
by Serbs opposed to President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many people in Kosovo who are really disappointed in  
Serbia,'' Ivanovic said. ``We feel like we've been cheated. We are 
not satisfied about Serbia. Political support is not enough. They 
must do something practical'' to help local Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers Coach Suspends Five Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- Rutgers will be without five players,  
including starting halfback Jacki Crooks, for Saturday's game 
against Boston College because they were suspended by coach Terry 
Shea for violating team policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea announced the suspensions Tuesday. He declined to specify  
what the violation was. 
</P>
<P>
	Three New Jersey newspapers, citing sources they did not  
identify, reported that the players had missed a team practice over 
the weekend. The weekend practices were scheduled because workouts 
Thursday and Friday had to be called off because of Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Crooks, the suspended players were defensive end  
Wesley Robertson, linebacker Dennis McCormack, defensive tackle 
Jason Malakoski and defensive end Jesse Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	The five will practice this week but will not be in the lineup  
Saturday, when Rutgers hosts the Eagles in a Big East game. The 
Scarlet Knights (0-2) are hoping for their first victory of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough decision, but one I believe will strengthen  
this program down the road,'' Shea said in announcing the 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Crooks averaged 96 yards per game in the first two contests of  
1999.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed sharply lower  
Wednesday, taking a cue from Tokyo's plunge and Wall Street's 
overnight decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Tokyo posted their biggest one-day drop this year  
following the Bank of Japan's decision to keep its monetary policy 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged  
3.4 percent, or 607.03 points, to close at 17,325.76. On Tuesday, 
the average gained 357.53 points, or 2.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar continued to slide against  
the yen, following the central bank's unexpected decision Tuesday 
not to use monetary policy to weaken the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.28 yen in late trading, down 0.48 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 104.87 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of export-driven and high-tech companies were the hardest  
hit after the BOJ's decision prompted fears of a stronger yen. A 
lower yen would help Japanese exporters by making their products 
more cost-competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed lower, tracking losses in Tokyo and Wall  
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index shed 232.84 points, or 1.7 percent, to end  
at 13,187.62. On Tuesday, the index fell 51.91 points, or 0.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 225.43 points, or 2.1  
percent, to 10,598.47 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, declines on regional bourses and a weaker baht  
currency continued to hurt sentiment and forced a sell-off in 
banking and finance stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 3.6 percent, or 15.39  
points, to 410.15. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kuala Lumpur, the key index tumbled 2.45 percent as  
profit-taking was made more relentless by the regional market 
weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors moved quickly to cash in on Tuesday's steep 4.1  
percent gain in the key index, which was propelled by a central 
bank announcement that the country's controversial capital controls 
would be relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index ended at  
721.17 points, down 18.13 points.

deadly earthquake that rocked the island Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan `Purchase' in 1626 Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 1626 letter containing what is believed to be  
the only known mention of the Dutch purchase of Manhattan for $24 
has been put on display at the New York Historical Society 
</P>
<P>
	No deed or official document of Manhattan's sale to the Dutch  
from the Lenape Indians exists. The creased yellowed letter, 
written by a ship captain to the governors of the Dutch West India 
Company, briefly mentions the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the Dutch settlers) have bought the island of Manhattes  
from the wildmen for the value of sixty guilders,'' it reads. The 
letter, put on display Monday, continues with a laundry list of 
items being sent to Amsterdam including beaver, rat, and mink 
skins. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Kraft, anthropologist and director of the Seton Hall  
University Museum, said the land transfer might not have been that 
big a deal, particularly because many of the Lenape lived in what 
is now New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time it was not a great piece of property,'' Kraft said  
of Manhattan. ``There were loads of mosquitoes and it was very 
rocky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Rementer, a Lenape descendant and head of the Lenape  
Language Project in Bartlesville, Okla., said the Indians who 
``sold'' Manhattan to the Dutch did not share European notions of 
land ownership.

<HEADLINE> Showalter Involved in Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Moments after Arizona beat Colorado 11-3  
Wednesday, Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter exchanged heated 
words with an unidentified man accompanying Rockies co-vice 
chairman Dick Monfort. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was passing in front of Arizona's third-base dugout. The  
man reportedly shouted at Showalter, who shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year manager later had to be restrained by Arizona  
pitching coach Mark Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who it was,'' Showalter said. ``I don't think  
that needs to be discussed except to say it was something that was 
unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Monfort, his brother Charlie nor anyone associated with  
the Rockies would comment on the incident. Nor was anyone available 
to identify the other person involved in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw it,'' Colorado manager Jim Leyland said. ``I  
didn't know it happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland later called Showalter and offered an apology.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand their frustration because we have been at the  
bottom,'' Showalter said. ``It is surprising because Colorado has 
been a first-class organization and will continue to be one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the latest of several incidents involving Showalter and  
the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies accused Showalter and the Diamondbacks of spying on  
them in spring training before the 1998 season. Showalter and 
then-Colorado manager Don Baylor did not shake hands at the season 
opener for both teams last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona pitcher Omar Daal beaned Colorado star Larry Walker on  
May 22.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-Reno Nemesis Eyed for Waco Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former antagonist to Attorney General Janet  
Reno is being considered to head a Senate probe of the 1993 Waco 
standoff and, perhaps, the Justice Department's handling of 
controversies such as alleged Chinese nuclear espionage and 
Democratic fund-raising abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the Senate Waco probe was taking shape Tuesday, a  
turf battle erupted. The outside investigator probing the 
government's use of force during the 51-day standoff with Branch 
Davidians near Waco, Texas, cautioned senators not to undermine his 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John Danforth, the special counsel appointed by Reno  
to look into a possible government cover-up at Waco, complained 
that investigators for Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who would lead 
the proposed Senate probe, traveled to Waco earlier this month 
``without even troubling to give me a call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth and congressional Republicans want to interview  
survivors, relatives and lawyers involved in a wrongful-death 
lawsuit against the government as a result of the 1993 FBI assault 
on the Davidians' compound. During the assault the compound burned 
to the ground and about 80 members of the cult died; some died in 
the fire and some had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-day siege had begun when agents of the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms tried to arrest several cult members on 
weapons charges. Four ATF agents and six cult members were killed 
in the February shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had agreed that we would work together so that I  
can fulfill my mission as special counsel,'' Danforth wrote to the 
panel in a Sept. 17 letter obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, told reporters Tuesday that the investigators traveled to 
Texas at Specter's direction and ``not with full committee 
authorization.'' He pledged to cooperate as much as possible with 
Danforth, who is investigating whether the government covered up 
its use of potentially incendiary tear gas grenades at the end of 
the standoff and whether federal agents fired any shots in the 
final hours, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday held the first formal talks  
about the size and the scope of their Waco investigation. But the 
discussions were overshadowed by the Danforth complaint and word 
that Specter may hire Charles LaBella to head the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella ran Justice's probe of campaign fund-raising abuses  
before leaving the department earlier this year. He disagreed with 
Reno's decision not to seek an independent counsel to investigate 
1996 campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting, senior GOP leaders proposed that Specter  
chair a five-member task force that would probe ``whether or not 
the Justice Department is serving the American people'' in its 
handling of several matters, such as 1996 fund raising, Waco and 
the alleged theft of U.S. nuclear secrets by China, according to 
Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's consideration of LaBella was not discussed, according  
to those present. But Specter told Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, 
that he was thinking of hiring the former Reno aide, Grassley said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who also would sit on the task force, voiced concern  
that LaBella's hiring could taint an inquiry that would focus 
largely on Reno's stewardship of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the positive side, he knows where all the skeletons are,''  
Grassley said. ``On the negative side, it could send a signal that 
there is a preconceived notion about the FBI and the Justice 
Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter and LaBella declined to comment. But two senior  
Republican aides close to the task force talks said no other 
senators so far were advocating LaBella's hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force would move forward only if Senate Democratic  
leader Tom Daschle and the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Sen. 
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, agree by Thursday, Hatch said. Absent 
their support, the proceedings would take place in the 
Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy and Daschle expressed concern over the scope and likely  
cost of such proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many would treat this as a way of getting at Janet Reno rather  
than who in the FBI withheld information'' during earlier Waco 
investigations, Leahy told reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, meanwhile, was pressing ahead with his own  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He visited the Texas site on Monday and wants his staff to meet  
within two weeks with lawyers pressing the wrongful-death lawsuit 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the lawyers Monday, obtained by The Associated  
Press, Danforth requested the attorneys' views on the FBI's use of 
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters, the ``allegedly improper use of the 
U.S. armed forces,'' and the way certain evidence and testimony was 
presented to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Caddell, the Houston lawyer who is lead counsel in the  
wrongful-death suit, said he would cooperate with Danforth.

weapons charges. Four ATF agents and six cult members were killed 
in the February shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had agreed that we would work together so that I  
can fulfill my mission as special counsel,'' Danforth wrote to the 
panel in a Sept. 17 letter obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, told reporters Tuesday that the investigators traveled to 
Texas at Specter's direction and ``not with full committee 
authorization.'' He pledged to cooperate as much as possible with 
Danforth, who is investigating whether the government covered up 
its use of potentially incendiary tear gas grenades at the end of 
the standoff and whether federal agents fired any shots in the 
final hours, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday held the first formal talks  
about the size and the scope of their Waco investigation. But the 
discussions were overshadowed by the Danforth complaint and word 
that Specter may hire Charles LaBella to head the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaBella ran Justice's probe of campaign fund-raising abuses  
before leaving the department earlier this year. He disagreed with 
Reno's decision not to seek an independent counsel to investigate 
1996 campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting, senior GOP leaders proposed that Specter  
chair a five-member task force that would probe ``whether or not 
the Justice Department is serving the American people'' in its 
handling of several matters, such as 1996 fund raising, Waco and 
the alleged theft of U.S. nuclear secrets by China, according to 
Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's consideration of LaBella was not discussed, according  
to those present. But Specter told Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, 
that he was thinking of hiring the former Reno aide, Grassley said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who also would sit on the task force, voiced concern  
that LaBella's hiring could taint an inquiry that would focus 
largely on Reno's stewardship of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the positive side, he knows where all the skeletons are,''  
Grassley said. ``On the negative side, it could send a signal that 
there is a preconceived notion about the FBI and the Justice 
Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter and LaBella declined to comment. But two senior  
Republican aides close to the task force talks said no other 
senators so far were advocating LaBella's hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force would move forward only if Senate Democratic  
leader Tom Daschle and the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Sen. 
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, agree by Thursday, Hatch said. Absent 
their support, the proceedings would take place in the 
Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy and Daschle expressed concern over the scope and likely  
cost of such proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many would treat this as a way of getting at Janet Reno rather  
than who in the FBI withheld information'' during earlier Waco 
investigations, Leahy told reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, meanwhile, was pressing ahead with his own  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He visited the Texas site on Monday and wants his staff to meet  
within two weeks with lawyers pressing the wrongful-death lawsuit 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the lawyers Monday, obtained by The Associated  
Press, Danforth requested the attorneys' views on the FBI's use of 
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters, the ``allegedly improper use of the 
U.S. armed forces,'' and the way certain evidence and testimony was 
presented to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Caddell, the Houston lawyer who is lead counsel in the  
wrongful-death suit, said he would cooperate with Danforth.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Forward No. 1 Pick in CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arkansas forward Derek Hood, who led the  
Southeastern Conference in rebounding last season, was taken by the 
Quad City Thunder on Tuesday as the No. 1 pick in the Continental 
Basketball Association draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Hood, who wasn't taken in the NBA draft in June,  
averaged 9.5 points and 7.6 rebounds in his four years with the 
Razorbacks. His 10.3 rebound average last season was ninth in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great honor to be selected as the top pick,'' said  
Hood, who will still try to make an roster when training camps open 
next month. ``The CBA's a fine place and a lot of people have gone 
through there on the way to the NBA. If it doesn't work out in the 
NBA for me I can follow the CBA track and use it as a stepping 
stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The La Crosse Bobcats had the next two picks in the draft and  
selected Arizona center A.J. Bramlett and Texas swingman Kris 
Clack. Quad City took Nebraska center Venson Hamilton and 
Cincinnati guard Melvin Levett with the next two picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The final four picks of the first round were North Carolina  
Charlotte swingman Galen Young by Grand Rapids, St. Paul's forward 
Antwain Smith by Yakima, Villanova guard John Celestand by Sioux 
Falls, and Maryland swingman Laron Profit by Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-team league's draft lasted 10 rounds.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Working on Farmers' Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cost of bailing out the nation's farm  
economy reached $8 billion as Republican congressional leaders 
introduced their plan to aid growers who have been hurt by low 
prices or lost crops to droughts and floods. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan, released Tuesday, closely tracks a $7.4 billion  
package that the Senate attached last month to an agricultural 
spending bill. But it added $500 million for weather-related 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money would go toward compensating farmers for a  
second year of depressed commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were expected to push for hundreds of millions of  
dollars more in disaster aid, but some conceded that the $8 billion 
plan would be approved by the House-Senate conference committee 
that was writing the final version of the appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders, struggling to find a way to pay for even the $8  
billion without raiding the Social Security surplus, refused to go 
any higher, said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the lead Senate 
negotiator on the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against the limit on our allocation,'' Cochran said.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had hoped to finish work on the appropriations bill  
late Tuesday but the negotiations were put off until today because 
of a disagreement over dairy policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran said Congress could consider additional aid in 2000 to  
cover this year's crop losses. North Carolina lawmakers were 
expected to seek $1 billion or more for crops and livestock 
destroyed by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the administration to monitor the situation  
closely'' and request more money if it's needed, Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department officials say they need $1 billion to  
compensate farmers for losses that already had occurred this year 
from drought in the East and flooding in the upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau  
Federation, said the GOP proposal was ``woefully inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans control both the House and Senate, and one of the  
Democratic negotiators, North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, said 
Republicans had the votes to pass the $8 billion plan. ``They're 
not talking to us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House did not have the farm assistance in its version of the  
appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain prices plummeted during the financial crisis in Asia and  
have yet to recover because of overproduction worldwide. Prices for 
corn and soybeans are at their lowest levels in more than a decade.

<HEADLINE>  Timorese Loot Government Warehouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Thousands of desperate East Timorese  
looted warehouses in Dili today, hauling off sacks of rice, flour 
and cooking oil before international peacekeepers turned the hungry 
crowds back. 
</P>
<P>
	The multinational force has largely restored order to East  
Timor's razed capital after more than two weeks of mayhem, but 
pro-Indonesian militants pulled off what appeared to be their first 
show of resistance by killing a Western journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 helicopter-borne troops landed in Baucau, East Timor's  
second-largest town, securing the airport and extending the reach 
of the multinational force beyond the Dili area for the first time, 
said Brig. Mark Evans, commander of the land forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Baucau is 80 miles east of Dili, and its airport can accommodate  
heavy transport planes that could bring troops and food for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The looters were among thousands of residents who had returned  
to East Timor's capital, Dili, after days of hiding in nearby 
forests and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Although relief flights took off from Australia for the first  
time in three days today, growing desperation boiled over when a 
mob besieged Indonesian government-owned warehouses in Dili, broke 
down the doors and started taking everything they could grab. 
</P>
<P>
	A small squad of Indonesian soldiers guarding the complex was  
overwhelmed by the numbers and let the people in. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, about 30 armed Australian soldiers arrived at the  
scene and pulled the crowd back, blocking the entrances, but not 
before hundreds of bags of food were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed rice. We were hungry,'' said one man who ran from  
the scene with a sack of rice on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, commander of Indonesian  
forces in the territory, said the body of Sander Thoenes, a 
30-year-old reporter for London's Financial Times newspaper, was 
found in the Dili suburb of Becora, the scene of heavy activity by 
militias and their Indonesian military backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes was killed after six men in Indonesian police uniforms  
fired at him while he was traveling on a motorcycle, according to 
the vehicle's driver, Florindo Araujo. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's military said today it will stop flying journalists  
to East Timor because food, medicine and other necessities were too 
scarce. The decision was not related to the journalist's death, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, a car carrying two journalists was  
attacked by what Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the Australian commander 
of the force, said were assumed to be ``militia elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove said the attacks were ``obviously a reaction to our  
presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear that the militia have attempted to step up  
some activities as a show that all is not yet secure. Well, I would 
agree with that,'' said Cosgrove. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the troops, which arrived Monday, were restoring a  
measure of order to Dili, ``on recent events, it is still a 
dangerous place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Timor, the commander of the most notorious pro-Jakarta  
militia warned that East Timor ``will continue to seethe and there 
will be the possibility of a civil war,'' unless an acceptable 
solution for the territory is found. 
</P>
<P>
	That solution should be the division of East Timor, with  
pro-Indonesian forces getting a share, said Eurico Guterres, of the 
Aitarak militia. He was quoted by the Antara news agency from 
Kupang. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fight until the last blood to defend our territory,''  
Guterres said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, Indonesia's security affairs minister, Faisal  
Tanjung, said the government would revoke martial law soon because 
the situation had almost returned to normal in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesians planned to transfer all law enforcement duties  
to the multinational force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Western diplomat in Jakarta said Indonesian troops were  
pulling out of East Timor ``as fast as they can'' in an effort to 
avoid any incidents with the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, the peacekeepers stepped up efforts to track down  
potential troublemakers and disarm everyone except authorized 
Indonesian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said hundreds of weapons had been confiscated, from  
machetes to rifles. ``We have lost count of the number of 
weapons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian soldiers arrested a man being chased and kicked by a  
crowd that accused him of being a notorious militiaman involved in 
the killing and looting. Eight other suspected militiamen were seen 
sitting under guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A body was found in a water well in Dili, and residents said  
they feared more bodies were there. The well is behind the home of 
Manuel Carrascalao, a prominent pro-independence supporter. 
Australian peacekeepers were summoned to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	In Darwin, Australia, Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao and other  
East Timorese leaders began a weeklong session to begin planning a 
U.N.-administered interim government and the subsequent steps 
toward full independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao met Tuesday night with U.N. officials, their first  
meeting since the former resistance leader was released from 
Indonesian prison and house arrest earlier this month. He had been 
confined for nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 peacekeepers were due to arrive by today, nearly  
one-half of the planned contingent of 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The militias spared almost nothing in their systematic  
destruction of Dili, the capital city of 120,000, after East Timor 
voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia in an Aug. 30 
U.N.-supervised ballot. Hundreds have died and hundreds of 
thousands have fled their homes.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Bank Eyes Currency Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- With Colombian President Andres Pastrana  
in Washington seeking a financial bailout, the country's central 
bank fought Wednesday to prop up the national currency as an 
economic crisis deepened. 
</P>
<P>
	Already stung by a string of credit rating downgrades and a  
nearly 30 percent devaluation of the Colombian peso, the government 
sold $70 million to support the beleaguered currency a day after 
disclosing an unprecedented plunge in economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross domestic product plummeted 7.6 percent in the second  
quarter, compared with the same period in 1998 -- Colombia's worst 
three-month decline this century, the National Statistics 
Department announced Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reduction in economic activity for the trimester owes  
chiefly to a drop in agricultural production spurred by a decline 
in coffee production, which fell by 16.74 percent,'' said the 
agency's director, Rene Verswyvel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee is Colombia's No. 2. legal export after oil, but the crop  
this year has yielded 20 percent fewer beans, while coffee prices 
have dropped abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of confidence in the economy's ability to recover in the  
near term has spurred demand for the U.S. dollar, which has gained 
28.1 percent against the Colombian peso so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a devaluation would help exports in a country with a strong  
manufacturing base, but Colombia is not such a country. Much of 
that owes to the influence of the trade in illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In large part because of Colombia's deepening civil conflict,  
the country has been rated an increasingly high risk for 
international investors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Standard &AMP; Poors downgraded Colombia's  
investment-grade credit rating, encouraging a 0.7 percent drop in 
the value of the peso against the dollar. The peso closed at 1,993 
to the dollar on Wednesday -- at the upper end of the trading level 
the bank's directors say they are determined to defend. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, Moody's Investors Service Inc. similarly cut  
Colombia's prized investment-grade credit rating, restricting the 
country's access to cheap foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
	With tax revenues falling, the government's budget deficit has  
grown to 5 percent of gross domestic product, or $5 billion, the 
Finance Ministry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has asked the International Monetary Fund for a  
$3 billion line of credit to help spur economic recovery. But under 
such an agreement, it would likely be obliged to reduce the budget 
deficit considerably with a strict austerity plan. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean less in government transfers for municipalities  
already unable to provide many basic services, a restructuring of a 
health care system that can't pay its bills and a broadening of the 
tax base in a country with widespread tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	A strict austerity plan also could trigger labor unrest. Unions  
called a two-day general strike in August to protest anticipated 
belt-tightening measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana has insisted Colombia will meet all its foreign debt  
obligations and in Washington was seeking $700 million from the 
Inter-American Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian leader is seeking $3.5 billion in all from  
international sources -- chiefly the United States -- for a 
three-year plan to combat the drug trade, fortify the legal system 
and rescue endangered social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana said on Wednesday that he received ``big support'' from  
President Clinton for his plan.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Quake May Hike Chip Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The Taiwan earthquake means computer-chip  
makers will lose up to two weeks of production and could lead to an 
increase in worldwide prices, analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the chip spot market have been rising recently because  
of short supply and high demand, and analysts said the disruption 
in Taiwan could drive them even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake knocked out power at most companies in the the Hsinchu  
Science-based Technology Park. By Wednesday morning, only partial 
power had been restored to several leading chipmakers there.

<HEADLINE>  Bill Russell Now in Rancho Cucamonga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- Bill Russell works about 45  
miles from Dodger Stadium, where he was employed before being fired 
15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It might as well be 45,000 miles.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell managed the Dodgers for nearly two years and spent more  
than 30 years in the organization. Now he works at The Epicenter, 
where he is manager of the Rancho Cucamonga Surfers of the 
California Fall League. 
</P>
<P>
	A hot, desert wind blew gently. Highway 15, the road to Las  
Vegas, is a couple blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a different life for Russell, who recently managed Orlando  
to the championship of the Class AA Southern League. He will spend 
the next six weeks managing the Surfers, a team of low-level minor 
leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting right off, I'll try to get to know everybody,''  
Russell said. ``First of all, I've got to know their names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell admits it took him several months to get over being  
fired and feels no vindication from the Dodgers' lack of success 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think about it anymore,'' he said. ``I've got  
another job going. I really enjoy it, I want to do well. I'm in the 
minor leagues, I'm just like the players. I hope to get back to the 
major league level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers gave me a great shot for over 30 years. That's the  
only way I look at it. I have no hard feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked how he felt about the post-Bill Russell Dodgers,  
he replied: ``I have one comment: It was mentioned that the village 
idiot could manage the Dodgers. That's all I want to say about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Johnson made that statement last fall before being hired  
as the team's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, who played for the Dodgers from 1969-86, was fired  
along with general manager Fred Claire on June 21, 1998 -- three 
months after the Fox Group took control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers were 36-38 and finished the season with an 83-79  
record. This year has been a disaster despite several offseason 
additions, led by pitcher Kevin Brown, and one of baseball's 
highest payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was dismissed, Russell spent his first summer in more  
than 30 years without the structure of baseball. He and his wife, 
Susan, did some traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came reality.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went to the winter meetings last December in Nashville,'' he  
said. ``I was looking for a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, whose overall record as manager of the Dodgers was  
173-149, found one -- manager at Orlando, an affiliate of the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really pleased about that,'' he said of winning the  
Southern League championship. ``The first half, we really 
struggled. The second half, we started believing in ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And winning.  
</P>
<P>
	It took him until spring training to bounce back from the  
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt a lot, at first,'' he said. ``Whenever something like  
that happens for the first time, it's like a death. You're told 
your services are no longer wanted. You have to have time to 
grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team wasn't jelling, (Fox) had just bought the team, they  
wanted to try something different. I had never been fired before. 
Over time, you get over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old manager said he's glad to be back in Southern  
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ideal for me. I can go home every day,'' said Russell,  
who still lives in Glendale, not far from Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	`We're very happy to have Bill because of the Dodger connection,  
the old Dodger connection,'' said Pat Filippone, the general 
manager of the Surfers and the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class 
A California League. ``He's a symbol of the old Dodgers. The 
players are excited about playing for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedrick Bowers, a 21-year-old left-hander who played for Russell  
at Orlando, will play for him again in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's comfortable,'' Bowers said. ``He's a great guy, on and  
off the field, not just as the manager. The thing I like best about 
him -- he's straight up with you, he says it like it is.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB Won't Advise School Bus Belts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer images of children whipping around  
inside a bus during an accident re-creation helped convince the 
National Transportation Safety Board that it should not recommend 
the use of seat belts in school buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up a three-year study of bus crash worthiness, the  
board watched the video re-creations of three accidents on Tuesday 
to compare how children would have fared without belts, with belts 
and with a shoulder-and-lap combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The five members then voted unanimously to recommend that the  
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration instead expand 
current standards aimed at keeping children safely contained in 
their seating rows. 
</P>
<P>
	Those standards do not require a belt but instead that children  
be protected in a cocoon of padded, tightly spaced seats and high 
seat backs. The safety board believes the regulations should be 
broadened within the next two years so children will have a better 
chance of remaining inside a bus during a side collision or 
rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	Board engineers said that could be accomplished by increasing  
the height of seat backs, installing arm rests or replacing the 
standard bus bench seat with sculpted, bucket-type seats. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the safety board urged NHTSA to develop standards  
for construction of roofs and windows in motor coaches within the 
next two years and require new buses to meet those standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The board found in many accidents that the ever-larger windows  
in tour buses pop out and passengers are ejected. Missing windows 
can also reduce roof strength. Board engineers believe window and 
roof frames can be strengthened and the glass coated so that it 
doesn't shatter upon impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final recommendation, the board urged that buses be  
equipped with data recorders starting Jan. 1, 2003, to aid in 
future accident investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now school bus design is closely regulated. There are  
provisions for weld strength, window design and rollover 
survivability. In contrast, motor coaches -- the type of bus used by 
Greyhound -- have no occupant protection standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, school buses and motor coaches are considered the  
safest forms of transportation on the road. On average, nine people 
are killed each year in school buses, while four die in motor 
coaches. Roughly 42,000 are killed annually in car and truck 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Board engineers conceded that about half the school bus deaths  
are caused by impact, so even seat belts or extra padding would 
probably not prevent four or five of the nine deaths annually. 
</P>
<P>
	While some safety experts believe that seat belts could make  
school buses even safer, a safety board engineer used crash data to 
produce videos showing that students in three crashes studied might 
have actually been more severely injured if they had been wearing 
lap belts or shoulder harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer, Kris Bolte, said lap belts ``are not the simple  
solution,'' because restrained passengers whip back and forth in 
their seats, smashing their heads and snapping their necks. A 
passenger bouncing around the compartment spreads the impact more 
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board's study focused on accidents that occurred in  
Flagstaff, Ariz., in August 1996; Easton, Md., in October 1997; 
Buffalo, Mont., in March 1998; Monticello, Minn., in April 1997; 
and Holyoke, Colo., and Holmdel, N.J, both in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not examine a series of bus accidents that  
occurred around the New Year's holiday or the crash of a 
casino-bound charter bus in New Orleans in May, which killed 22 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it would  
have no immediate comment on the safety board's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board is a federal agency that investigates  
transportation accidents. It makes recommendations but lacks the 
power to implement them. The safety administration is the federal 
agency charged with developing regulations for motor vehicle 
safety.

	U.S. Sues Tobacco Companies  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government today sued the nation's  
tobacco industry to recover billions of dollars spent treating 
smoking-related illnesses. It accused cigarette makers of a 45-year 
campaign of deceit. ``They placed profits above the public 
health,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said as her department filed 
a civil suit in U.S. District Court. The lawsuit alleged the 
tobacco companies have conspired since the 1950s to defraud and 
mislead the public. 

</P>
<P>
	FBI Faults Campaign Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI agents testified today that federal  
prosecutors impeded their campaign fund-raising inquiry. The 
testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee covered 
donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election bid. FBI agent 
Daniel Wehr said the initial lead attorney in the inquiry, Laura 
Ingersoll, told the agents they should ``not pursue any matter 
related to solicitation of funds for access to the president. The 
reason given was, 'That's the way the American political process 
works.' I was scandalized by that.'' 

</P>
<P>
	DNC Reshuffles Its Leadership  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee, hoping to  
energize its fund-raising operation, plans to shuffle its 
leadership to give Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell a top post. 
General chairman Roy Romer is leaving to chair the Democratic 
National Convention committee, making room for Rendell. The 
Philadelphia mayor was meeting tonight with President Clinton, who 
was expected to offer Rendell his support, several Democratic 
officials said.

	Rescue Teams Arrive in Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Earthquake rescue teams streamed into  
Taiwan on Wednesday -- including a U.S. crew that quickly found a 
man in his collapsed apartment. Three strong aftershocks to the 
country's devastating quake forced terror-stricken residents to 
scurry into the streets. The aftershocks, which triggered 
mudslides, cracked one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs and forced 
evacuations. With magnitudes of 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0, the aftershocks 
were the strongest of more than 2,000 that have rocked the island.

</P>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- A weakened Hurricane Gert picked  
up speed today and hurtled toward the Canadian coast of 
Newfoundland, prompting some offshore oil rigs to stop operating. 
The storm had brushed by Bermuda. By late day, Gert's winds had 
dropped to 85 mph and extended outward up to 115 miles. The eye of 
the storm was about 415 miles south-southwest of St. John's.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and local drug-enforcement officers  
have arrested 93 suspects in cities across America in a sweeping 
crackdown. One official said it had dismantled the operations of 
the late drug trafficker Amado Carillo Fuentes. The cartel is 
believed to have funneled tons of Colombian cocaine through Mexico 
into U.S. cities.

	Aid Flights Resume for East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DARWIN, Australia (AP) -- Foreign military planes dropped tons of  
emergency food on Wednesday to hungry refugees hiding in East 
Timor's hills. With hundreds of thousands left homeless in the wake 
of a two-week rampage by pro-Indonesia militias, aid organizers 
acknowledged the airdrops supplied only a fraction of what was 
needed to stave off disaster. Aid flights were grounded Sunday so 
that U.N.-authorized peacekeepers could be sent in to bring a halt 
to the attacks by pro-Indonesia militias in East Timor.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring that global economic conditions have  
``improved markedly,'' the International Monetary Fund today 
released a generally upbeat forecast of economic prospects for the 
world through the year 2000. The IMF said a stronger-than-expected 
U.S. economy and more vigorous and quicker rebounds in Asian crisis 
countries were the major factors contributing to the improved

<HEADLINE> Central Park Considers Fees for Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Throwing your next family picnic will be as easy  
as a walk in the park, the mayor says, despite a report that the 
city is planning to start demanding a $25 fee for large gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News reported today that the city wants to enforce a  
little-known law requiring any group of 20 or more people to pay 
the fee and apply for a permit 30 days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would require permits for any ``contest, exhibit,  
ceremony, parade, athletic competition, reading or picnic involving 
more than 20 people,'' the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the story is false and there  
will be no change in the city's longstanding policy on large groups 
in parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Parks Department has had for at least 15 years the same  
policy,'' he said. ``The same policy will remain in effect. ... If 
you want to have your children in the park, you're not going to 
have to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the permit regulation  
generally targets organized events like concerts or theatrical 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's enforced by the rule of reason,'' Stern said. ``If  
there's a private social gathering, you're not disturbing anyone, 
there's no one that's going around with a clicker to see when the 
21st person arrives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 2,000 such permits were issued last year for the 326  
parks in Manhattan; no figures were available for the other four 
boroughs.

<HEADLINE> Critics Weigh In on Diet Drug Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paying for years of regular medical checkup for  
the people who took the diet drug fen-phen was supposed to be the 
hardest pill for American Home Products to swallow as part of its 
weight-loss medication quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's proven to be the easy part in the drug maker's  
settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the tentative national settlement is likely to break  
down over how much the company wants to pay patients allegedly 
injured by the once-popular drug cocktail, say attorneys close to 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home has offered to pay $2.8 billion to settle claims  
by people who say they developed heart valve injuries from taking 
fen-phen. The company has also agreed to set up a $1.2 billion fund 
to provide medical monitoring of people who took the drug 
combination, but have no signs of injury, say lawyers familiar with 
the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. An additional 
$410,000 would be paid to cover plaintiffs' attorneys legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the tentative deal, patients allegedly injured by  
fen-phen will have the choice to participate or to sue on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys say most patients will choose to sue on their own  
because the $2.8 billion will not be enough once its divided among 
the many thousands who will seek damages. And that will allow 
American Home to back out of that part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ridiculous how much they want to pay,'' said one attorney  
involved in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products and attorneys for patients who contend  
they were injured by the diet drug fen-phen are working out final 
details of a $4 billion national settlement, say lawyers close to 
the talks. An agreement could be reached within days. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,100 suits, involving 8,000 people who took the diet  
drugs, have been filed against American Home, making it one of the 
largest product liability cases ever. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home officials refused to comment on the possibility of  
a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil trial is under way in New Jersey over whether the  
company should be liable for the cost of medical monitoring to 
detect any signs of heart or lung problems. In court documents, one 
economist estimated that the company would have to pay $1.5 billion 
for a decade of regular checkups for the 94,000 residents who took 
the drug combination for at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities analysts said the medical monitoring claims were most  
troublesome because they could go on for decades, and it would be 
difficult to estimate the total cost for American Home. 
</P>
<P>
	About six million people took the drug combination.  
</P>
<P>
	Jerrold Parker, a New York attorney who said he has filed suits  
on behalf of hundreds of patients, said most people who need 
medical monitoring already have health insurance to cover the 
costs. He said more money needs to be set aside for patients who 
have been injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Other attorneys say the injury portion of the deal is probably  
too low because many victims have yet to file suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Becnel, a plaintiff attorney in Reserve, La. said he has  
filed suits on behalf of 60 patients, but knows of nearly 1,000 
more who may eventually sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Becnel is also concerned because a number of states including  
Louisiana won't allow plaintiffs to receive damages for medical 
monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Unresolved issues on Tuesday included the structure of the  
payments to patients, including how those payments will keep up 
with inflation over a number of years, an attorney close to the 
talks said. Also unresolved is how to guarantee American Home 
follows through on its agreement, said the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Any settlement would need a federal judge's approval.  
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux and marketed both until 
September 1997. That was when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked the 
drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.

<HEADLINE> Smith Shares Glory With Dorsett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Emmitt Smith's latest milestone was an  
emotional one, once he realized it. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith passed Tony Dorsett to become fourth on the NFL's career  
rushing list with a 7-yard touchdown run in Dallas' 24-7 victory 
over Atlanta Monday night. Among the first to greet Smith on the 
sidelines was Dorsett, who was at the game to help celebrate the 
Cowboys' 40th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Congratulations,' and I said `Thank you,''' Smith  
said. ``Then I kept on moving to go sit down. I didn't even realize 
what he was saying congratulations for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith wasn't seated long when he heard the good news over the  
Texas Stadium loudspeaker. As fans cheered, he went back to 
Dorsett, hugged him and whispered a few words. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to go tell him in his ear how much I greatly appreciate  
what he's done, the standards he has set,'' said Smith, who last 
season passed Dorsett as the leading rusher in team history. ``I 
wanted him to know that I greatly, really, truly in my heart 
appreciate him as a person, as a Dallas Cowboy and as a football 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith wasn't finished with his thank-yous.  
</P>
<P>
	He also sought Daryl Johnston, Smith's lead blocker in 131 of  
his 142 games, but probably no longer. Johnston re-injured his neck 
in the opener and won't return this season. Although he's going to 
try coming back next year, the odds are long. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston will remain with the team for moral support and advice.  
On Monday night, the guy affectionately known as ``Moose'' was 
walking the sidelines carrying a clipboard. Fans gave him a 
``Mooooose'' call when he was shown on the stadium's television 
screen early in the first quarter. He got more air time when Smith 
hugged him following the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not having him out there is different for me because this guy  
has led me for all these years and all those yards,'' said Smith, 
who came into the league in 1990, a year after Johnston. ``Not to 
have him is like losing a brother almost. That's an unfortunate 
part of the business. He's truly going to be missed by me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about Johnston made Smith choke up a bit. He ended a  
group interview with that response and hurried away. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders is retired. Jamal Anderson is hurt and out for the  
year. Terrell Davis is struggling without John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	And Emmitt Smith just keeps going.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a real competitor, a fighter,'' quarterback Troy Aikman  
said. ``He's still got a lot left in the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after career lows of 1,074 yards and four touchdowns,  
Smith has opened 1999 with consecutive 100-yard games and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Atlanta, he had his longest run in two years, a  
37-yarder, and he proved he's still durable with 29 carries. Dallas 
is 15-1 when he has that many attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can stand here with a smile on my face knowing that my  
career is long from being over,'' said Smith, whose three rushing 
TDs extend his NFL record to 128. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's 108 yards against the Falcons give him 12,783 in his  
career. Dorsett had 12,739. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he can get to Walter Payton (16,276) or Barry Sanders  
(15,269), Smith must catch Eric Dickerson (13,259). That's likely 
to happen in five games, maybe six. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be fitting for it to happen in six games, which would  
be Nov. 8 at Minnesota, another Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	In 20 Monday night games, Smith has 2,057 yards, the most of any  
player in the series' 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Giants Defense To Be Tested by Pats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jim Fassel didn't have to do  
anything special to get the New York Giants' attention in practice 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After an embarrassing 29-point loss to the Washington Redskins  
on Sunday, the Giants (1-1) are a much more serious team heading 
into Sunday night's game against the New England Patriots (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Usually in a two-hour practice, players will crack jokes or say  
something to loosen everyone up. There wasn't much of that 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see how we respond to adversity,'' All Pro  
defensive end Michael Strahan said. ``It's easy when you are doing 
well and you beat a team like Tampa for everything to go great. But 
when you lose, and you lose by 29 points, that next week will show 
what you are made of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Giants' offense has yet to show the big-play potential  
it exhibited in the preseason, New York's defense is the unit on 
the spot this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been the backbone of the Giants for almost two decades. If  
it does not play well, New York's chances of making the playoffs 
are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington had its way with the defense on Sunday, scoring  
relatively easy touchdowns on its first three possessions in a 
50-21 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``More important than getting a win or loss, we have to go out  
and play Giants football,'' safety Sam Garnes said. ``That's the 
No. 1 thing. As a defense, we want to cut down on the mistakes and 
go out and play well. You don't want to have two bad games in a 
row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stopping Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe is not going to be  
easy. He has passed for an NFL-high 639 yards and five touchdowns 
in rallying New England to victory twice. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Bledsoe is suspicious of the Giants' performance  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are going to come out and play inspired football  
to prove that last week was not the real Giants,'' Bledsoe said. 
``That was just a fluke, a one-time thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a key for New York this week, it will be getting  
pressure on Bledsoe. The front seven didn't do that to Brad 
Johnson, and the Redskins' quarterback hit his first eight passes 
in opening a 21-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have done anything,'' defensive line coach Denny  
Marcin said. ``It was one of those things. We've been through them 
before, everyone has. They are not fun. You just have to roll up 
your sleeves, go to work and shake it out of your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the Giants is that Jason Sehorn seems to be  
ready to play for the first time in 13 months. The right cornerback 
missed last season with a knee injury and had to sit out this 
entire preseason and the first two games with a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't look to me as a savior,'' Sehorn said after working out  
with the first team on Wednesday. ``Look to me as a piece in the 
wheel. Don't look to me as the person who is going to come in and 
all of a sudden turn this ship around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn might not do that, but he is a lot better than Jeremy  
Lincoln, who had to be replaced on Sunday because he played so 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing a nationally televised game on Sunday night also has  
gotten the Giants more excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the type of thing you look for, people read about it,''  
Garnes said of the loss to Washington. ``They didn't see us get 
beat, but now they are going to look to see if the Giants are as 
bad as they think. We have a chance to make up for it.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Clay Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Clay Walker seldom allows himself to  
wallow in misery, country music style. Upbeat smashes like ``Live 
Until I Die'' have made him one of Nashville's most consistent 
hitmakers of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	But on his new album ``Live, Laugh, Love,'' Walker tells a story  
about being trapped in a marriage on a remake of the 1983 Earl 
Thomas Conley hit ``Holding Her and Loving You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Listeners should know that Conley's song doesn't relate to  
Walker's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few songs that fit my voice so well -- not my  
life, but my voice,'' he said. ``I'm lucky and I'm fortunate that I 
get to hold the woman I love. I don't have to live out this song. 
But I did feel that after all the live performances we had done and 
sang this song that certainly the song deserved the chance to be 
heard again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called Walker a one-dimensional ``hat act,''  
meaning he is hard to distinguish from other young singers sporting 
cowboy hats who were launched at about the same time. But that 
doesn't get him down. Walker, 30, is working hard to stretch 
himself and savor the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1993, but has  
had no debilitating symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see me having MS as something to use to get  
attention,'' said Walker, who is from Beaumont, Texas. ``I 
certainly never have wanted that and I'm not generally the first 
person to bring it up in an interview. Strictly because it's a 
disease that we're managing pretty well right now, and I've been 
very blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. You sound more confident on the ``Live, Laugh, Love'' album  
and downright powerful on ``This Time Love.'' How come? 
</P>
<P>
	Walker: In the (recording) studio, the thing that's intimidating  
is not so much the technology or the electronics. ... It's the fact 
of knowing that the same musicians that are playing on your album 
have played on albums by George Strait, probably Garth Brooks, and 
a whole lot of different other singers. And I'm standing there 
thinking, `What do they think about me? They played with all these 
great guys and now I'm in here. What's going to make me different? 
Am I going to add up to that?' 
</P>
<P>
	In concert I have a lot of confidence. My new producer Doug  
Johnson came to a few shows, and he told me he didn't feel like 
what we do live had ever been captured on tape and said that was 
the challenge for the album. ... With Doug, I felt like I belonged 
in there. He said, `Just sing, just have fun.' I went with it. 
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Holding Her and Loving You'' is a real departure for a guy  
whose known for sunny, positive songs. What motivated you to record 
a song about a man who feels duty-bound to stay with his wife when 
he's in love with another woman? 
</P>
<P>
	Walker: `Holding Her and Loving You' is probably the most  
controversial song that I've ever recorded. It's controversial for 
me because I don't believe in remaking a song that's great. That's 
probably the toughest thing I had with cutting this song. Earl 
Thomas Conley did this song. I certainly couldn't do it any better. 
... His version will always be the best version of it. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Has having MS changed your life significantly?  
</P>
<P>
	Walker: I certainly don't need people to pity me. I hope that  
people don't ever think that I would want that, because I'm just so 
happy I'm alive. I just really do live for the day. ... Remember 
when you were a kid at Christmas and you rushed and ripped all the 
wrapping paper off the toys without reading the card? I don't do 
that anymore. I take a whole lot more time opening a present these 
days, and I read the card. That applies to my whole life. 
</P>
<P>
	4. You've been consistently popular for more than five years,  
sold a lot of albums and had lots of hits. Yet critics don't seem 
to care for you very much. What gives? 
</P>
<P>
	Walker: I don't pay much attention to that. I've heard about  
reviews that have angered people who are close to me. ... I think 
that there are a lot of people that feel small up beside fame or 
popularity. I, for one, have never felt small standing beside 
someone with more stature than me, or more fame than me, or more 
money. I've never felt small. I think that some of the critics who 
write these kind of reviews are trying to find a way to bring this 
person down because they feel small in their presence. 
</P>
<P>
	5. You've also never gotten much in the way of industry awards  
or nominations. What do you make of that? 
</P>
<P>
	Walker: It would be selfish to be bitter about not being  
nominated. I think that it bothered me the first couple of years I 
was out. We had a lot of hit records and sold a lot of albums. It 
was tough to swallow the fact that I didn't even have a nomination. 
I have to believe that it will happen, that I will be nominated at 
some point. And I will be happy when I am. And if I'm not, I 
certainly don't hold a grudge against anybody who did not vote for 
me. ... The opinions that mean the most to me are the fans and the 
radio people. Not too many other people's opinions affect the way 
that I record or perform.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Slams Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAHA, Japan (AP) -- Typhoon Bart plowed through the southern  
Japanese island of Okinawa Wednesday, injuring 16 people and 
leaving tens of thousands without power, police said 
</P>
<P>
	Bart's 100-mph winds blew through Okinawa Wednesday, knocking  
down trees, flooding roads and grounding planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jun Yogi, a spokesman for the Okinawa police, said most of the  
injuries were minor, such as bruises from flying objects and people 
falling on wet, slippery ground. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 113,200 homes were affected by power outages in Naha,  
the Okinawan capital, and small islands near Okinawa, Yogi said. 
Local authorities said they could not say when power might be 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million people live on Okinawa. Naha is about 1,000  
miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Typhoons are a type of hurricane that originate in the West  
Pacific ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday morning, Typhoon Bart was located 112 miles  
north-northwest of Naha, the Meteorological Agency said. It was 
heading toward the western coast of Kyushu, the southernmost of 
Japan's four main islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Okinawa were closed Thursday and public buses were  
still not running as strong winds continued to blow over the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military, which has a strong presence on Okinawa, was  
still assessing damage from the typhoon. Military personnel and 
their families were restricted to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, an unrelated landslide killed two men on Kyushu, 500  
miles southwest of Tokyo. The men, both 32, were working at a 
construction site. Officials said the landslide was caused by rain.

<HEADLINE> Pharmaceutical Chief Survives Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Milan Panic has been ousted as prime minister of  
Yugoslavia, paid $600,000 to settle a federal securities charge and 
millions more to settle six sexual harassment suits. On Wednesday, 
Panic won his latest confrontation, surviving a shareholder revolt 
to remove him as chairman of the pharmaceutical company he founded 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	But the flamboyant, outspoken businessman still faces a civil  
lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
alleges he misled investors about the prospects of an experimental 
drug. The suit seeks to prohibit Panic (pronounced PAHN-eech) from 
running any public company. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic, a Serb-born American businessman who served as Yugoslav  
leader for eight months in 1992 and 1993, on Wednesday faced many 
of his biggest critics at the annual meeting of his ICN 
Pharmaceuticals held in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	About 37 percent of shareholders who cast ballots voted to  
remove Panic as chairman, far short of the two-thirds majority 
needed. The revolt was led by the company's largest shareholder, 
Heartland Advisors of Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Heartland president William Nasgovitz said Panic's many legal  
problems and his arrogant style has hurt ICN's stock, which has 
fallen more than 37 percent since July. Nasgovitz said the Costa 
Mesa, Calif.-based company needs new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic, who charged that Nasgovitz is trying to hurt ICN with his  
attack, said the company's sales and profits are at record levels. 
Panic said he does not know why the stock has slipped so badly. 
</P>
<P>
	ICN stock dropped from $30 a share to Wednesday's closing level  
of $18.75 after the company's second-quarter results fell below 
analyst forecasts. The company, which sells more than 40 percent of 
its drugs in Eastern Europe, has been hurt by a currency collapse 
in Russia, where it sells many of its products. About half of ICN's 
$439 million in sales last year came from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I should spend more time selling the stock than building  
profits,'' Panic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokerage firm officials and securities analysts at the meeting  
also expressed frustration with Panic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your feigning ignorance implies a lack of responsibility,''  
Patricia Loepker, portfolio manager with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, told 
Panic. She said ICN's stock is down because the company's 
performance has fallen short of Wall Street projections, and Panic 
has done poorly at communicating with investors about changes 
affecting the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic said the SEC's lawsuit, which followed a 4 1/2-year-long  
investigation, has no merit. The SEC initially accused Panic of 
insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation targeted Panic's sale of $1.24 million of ICN  
shares in December 1994, after the company allegedly learned its 
bread-and-butter product, the antiviral drug Ribavirin, would not 
be approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hepatitis 
C. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news wasn't revealed to investors until February 1995.  
ICN's stock fell 41 percent in six days, to $13.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC eventually dropped the insider trading allegation, but  
on Aug. 11 of this year, the commission filed suit in California 
alleging that Panic and other top executives made fraudulent 
statements about Ribavirin. The suit seeks a $500,000 fine and try 
to prohibit Panic from serving as an officer of a public company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ribavirin, sold under the name Virazole, is now used in more  
than 40 countries including the United States to treat herpes, 
influenza, chicken pox, hepatitis, and AIDS. In June 1998, the FDA 
approved a potent drug cocktail that includes Ribavirin to treat 
hepatitis C patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic acknowledges his company has a reputation problem. ``The  
problem is investor relations and what you perceive of us not what 
we are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Panic has settled six sexual harassment suits including one for  
$3.5 million from his former secretary. Last year, a court ordered 
him to pay child support for a son he fathered with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Panic paid $600,000 without admitting wrongdoing to  
settle an SEC charge of making false and misleading statements 
about Virazole for treating AIDS.

<HEADLINE>  Clash 2, MetroStars 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ronald Cerritos scored the game  
winner early in the second half with his team-record 14th goal and 
the San Jose Clash defeated the New Jersey-New Jersey MetroStars 
2-1 on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dario Brose had a goal and an assist and goalkeeper Joe Cannon  
stopped a penalty kick late in the first half in the battle of two 
MLS teams already eliminated from playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Zambrano scored for the MetroStars, but also was stopped  
by Cannon on the penalty kick as New York-New Jersey lost its 
seventh straight at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd for the MetroStars' final home game was announced at  
7,215, but it seemed even less. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerritos' game-winner came in the 53rd minute on assists by  
Brose and Alejandro Sequeira. Brose chipped the ball to Sequeira,

and Mike Petke's header off a corner kick in the 87th minute also 
slid wide of the goal post.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ronald Cerritos scored the game

the San Jose Clash defeated the New Jersey-New Jersey MetroStars 
2-1 on Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> VP Argues for Medicare Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 1 million Medicare recipients in  
HMOs will lose their zero co-payment coverage for prescription 
drugs next year, Vice President Al Gore said today in arguing for 
the administration's Medicare legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Health Care Financing Administration review of  
HMO plans for 2000, annual dollar caps on drug coverage will also 
be imposed more widely. This year, only 21 percent of the managed 
care plans that serve Medicare beneficiaries had a per enrollee 
drug limit of $500 or less. Next year, nearly one-third of such 
plans, 32 percent, will have such limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Also next year, all plans will charge co-payments for  
prescription drugs, with an individual's average out-of-pocket 
payment for brand-name drugs increasing by 21 percent. For generic 
drugs, HCFA estimates the co-payment will increase by 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1 million Medicare patients currently get prescription  
drugs with no co-payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is running for president, released the HCFA findings  
on behalf of the Clinton administration at a Washington meeting of 
the American Medical Association. He urged doctor-lobbyists headed 
today to Capitol Hill to press Congress on President Clinton's 
proposal to add a Medicare prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell them it's doctor's orders,'' Gore said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The need for affordable prescription drugs is only becoming  
more important. That's why, if we use the (federal budget) surplus 
to strengthen Medicare for the future, we ought to help seniors who 
have their benefits cut by Medicare HMOs by ensuring that all those 
in Medicare have an affordable prescription drug benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare enrollees get  
health insurance through HMOs. Many senior citizens sign up with 
HMOs as an alternative to Medicare's traditional fee-for-service 
coverage because the HMOs, in addition to providing Medicare 
benefits, usually offer prescription drug coverage, fewer 
co-payments and other additional benefits.

<HEADLINE> Delaware Governor To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper has announced  
he will run for the U.S. Senate seat of Republican William Roth 
Jr., a five-term incumbent and the third-oldest member of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carper, 52, has won statewide office 10 times, including five  
terms holding Delaware's only seat in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. He has also presided over a robust economy and a 
time of low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, 78, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, with his  
name attached to the Roth IRA, a popular retirement account he 
helped create. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elections are not just about the past, they are largely about  
the future,'' Carper said. ``When voters go to polls a year from 
this November, they're not going to be choosing a senator for the 
20th century, but one for the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said he looked forward to running on his record.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a proven record that has been and will be a strong voice  
for the people and the state of Delaware,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP Chairman Basil Battaglia said Carper's entry into the  
race will not change Roth's election strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll run on his record -- lower taxes, more retirement  
security and IRS reform,'' Battaglia said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Mulls Legality of NATO Air War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Italy, one of NATO's most stalwart  
members, on Wednesday questioned the legality of the Western 
military alliance's air war against the forces of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, another key NATO ally, also said NATO's intervention  
without the blessing of the U.N. Security Council should remain an 
exception, not a precedent for similar incursions to protect human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the interventions that have taken place in recent  
times, on the urge to put an end to massive violations of human 
rights ... are not codified and raise the sizable question of 
legitimacy,'' Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told 
reporters. ``The intervention in Kosovo took place without the 
mandate of the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-day air war began in response to Serbia's campaign to  
drive the Albanian majority out of the province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain wanted to intervene, but they  
feared a veto in the U.N. Security Council by China and possibly 
Russia if the issue were raised there. They steered the Kosovo 
crisis away from the United Nations and dealt with it through NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	China -- long criticized for its human rights practices and its  
occupation of Tibet -- has always been reluctant to approve outside 
interference in a nation's internal affairs. Russia might have 
considered casting a veto to protect its Slavic Serb brethren from 
air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community, but not all of it, decided that  
an intervention was urgent and took the law into its own hands,'' 
Dini said. ``This cannot be repeated. I think that the principle of 
sovereignty must be upheld, generally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later, in an interview with The Associated Press, Dini said,  
``I think that Kosovo was a just cause and the need for immediate 
intervention was justified by the tragedy that was taking place. In 
the end, the matter was reviewed in the United Nations, and the 
subsequent actions have all been under a U.N. resolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer  
warned the U.N. General Assembly that ``a practice of 'humanitarian 
interventions' could evolve outside the U.N. system. This would be 
a very problematic development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the intervention in Kosovo was justified because Kosovo  
needed emergency assistance and the Security Council had ``tied its 
own hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``this step ... must not set a precedent for  
weakening the U.N. Security Council's monopoly on authorizing the 
use of legal international force.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Stephanopoulos Stalker Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday ordered a psychiatric  
examination for a former White House intern accused of stalking 
George Stephanopoulos, but refused to hold her in contempt for not 
staying away from him. 
</P>
<P>
	The exam was ordered for Tangela Burkhart, 32, who was arrested  
Friday at an Upper West Side coffee shop that Stephanopoulos 
frequents. She was sitting in the cafe when Stephanopoulos arrived. 
He went to a telephone and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkhart was arrested twice last year for allegedly harassing  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge said the latest police complaint was defective  
because it offered no evidence that the woman knowingly violated 
the court order. 
</P>
<P>
	The cafe is in Stephanopoulos' new neighborhood, some 30 blocks  
south of the Columbia University area where Burkhart lives and 
Stephanopoulos recently left. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanopoulos rose to national prominence during the 1992  
Clinton-Gore campaign and eventually became White House 
communications director.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Learned To Help Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dinnertime at Pat Buchanan's childhood home  
could be intimidating for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's father quizzed the children at the table like a  
civics professor, asking their opinions on national issues of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``What struck me was how much the kids knew, even the little  
kids,'' recalled lifelong Buchanan friend Tom McCloskey of 
Kensington, Md. ``I didn't know nearly as much as they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this challenging environment in the suburbs in northwestern  
Washington, Patrick Joseph Buchanan learned early how to fend for 
himself in the world of politics and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been jockeying for the best strategy to continue that  
debate ever since -- first as an editorial writer, then as a 
political aide, then a TV commentator and finally as a presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were immersed at our dinner table in national and world  
politics, rather than local and state issues,'' the 60-year-old 
Buchanan said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``It was 
basically my father's influence. I grew up during World War II. We 
talked about the war in Europe and the war in Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan recounted his years growing up as one of nine children  
in a close-knit Catholic family and his intense admiration for his 
accountant father, William B. ``Bill'' Buchanan, in his 
autobiography, ``Right From The Beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Buchanan was a devoted Catholic, a Republican, a stern  
disciplinarian and an admirer of the pre-World War II isolationists 
who believed in an ``America First'' policy. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his boys attack punching bags -- 300 swats a session --  
and took pride when they won a scrap with someone else while 
growing up in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the brainy brawls over dinner that gave Pat Buchanan  
a taste for political debate that surfaced frequently, especially 
in his college years when he gathered with friends at the apartment 
of Charles ``Chick'' Leasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat would be the instigator of these discussions,'' Leasure  
said. ``We could chime in, but he was the mover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his upbringing, Pat Buchanan developed a reverence that  
has never dimmed for the America of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot recreate the 1950s, but you can recapture that  
sense of community and patriotism,'' Buchanan said. ``There's 
something that's been lost that everybody wants to recapture -- the 
sense that we are a good people and one nation on one voyage 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a longtime Republican like his father, is running for  
president this year for the third time -- against the advice of some 
friends and associates who thought he could have more influence 
from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan challenged President Bush in 1992 after deciding Bush  
had moved away from the Reagan agenda. He ran against Bob Dole in 
1996, even winning the New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time around, he has become increasingly dissatisfied  
with the Republican Party and says he is seriously considering 
seeking the Reform Party nomination. A final decision, he says, 
will be made in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the second run he did because he enjoyed the first  
one,'' said Robert Novak, a conservative columnist and commentator 
who knows Buchanan well. ``This time he went into it with a little 
less joy, and a feeling that nobody was picking up this torch. The 
vast majority (of his associates) encouraged him not to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the TV commentator and former aide to Presidents Nixon and  
Reagan felt the campaign trail this year was the best place to keep 
alive his battle over the direction of the conservative movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly I hope to keep our ideas and beliefs front and center  
and make sure they are advanced,'' Buchanan said. ``But I would not 
run if I didn't think I could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan has never stopped campaigning since his college  
days, when he would read the National Review and first recognized 
that his beliefs came under the conservative label. 
</P>
<P>
	His view of conservatism includes a foreign policy that puts  
America's military and economic interests over global goals -- and 
he rejects descriptions of that as isolationism in his new book, 
``A Republic, Not An Empire.'' He wants tighter limits on 
immigration and he's a social conservative who is strongly 
anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	After he graduated from Georgetown University, Buchanan went to  
Columbia University's graduate school of journalism on a 
fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia journalism professor emeritus John Hohenberg, who now  
lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, remembers Buchanan as a very bright 
and assertive student, who spent much time in class trying to sell 
his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did all the talking when we were in a discussion in the  
class,'' Hohenberg recalled with a laugh. ``His views were extreme. 
This is a bonanza as far as a teacher is concerned. You can match 
students against students and see how they react to each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After completing his journalism degree, it took Buchanan about  
three months to move from rookie reporter to the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was assigned to a low-rung job in the financial department,  
pasting up soybean prices and he volunteered to do some 'think 
pieces' ... that attracted the attention of our publisher,'' said 
Martin Duggan, news editor at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat when 
Buchanan joined the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Duggan recalled how Buchanan, several years later, was able to  
finagle an invitation to a reception for Richard Nixon. Buchanan 
eventually was offered a job as Nixon's assistant in the years 
before the former vice president ran for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan found a common bond with Nixon, though Buchanan was  
more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, Nixon was my mentor on political strategy and  
tactics,'' Buchanan recalled. ``Nixon relished political combat and 
I did as well. We developed a plan on how to break up the New Deal 
and bring over (to the GOP) elements of the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon called him ``the only extremist I've ever known who has a  
sense of humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, his blunt honesty has brought criticism that he  
is intolerant -- even anti-Semitic -- a claim Buchanan denies. While 
his rhetoric is sometimes harsh, Buchanan tends to be personally 
warm and engaging, associates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have a mean streak,'' said L. Brent Bozell III, a  
former campaign aide. ``It's the Irish brawler in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's been married to his wife Shelley, whom he met in the Nixon  
White House, since 1971. They have no children. He's traded in the 
German-built Mercedes Benz, that brought criticism in the campaign 
seven years ago as he argued for limiting foreign trade. He now 
drives a Navigator, a Lincoln sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's determination to keep his focus on political strategy  
paid off at one key moment in his career. He was asked to head up 
the White House investigative unit that eventually became known as 
``the plumbers,'' set up to stem leaks and targeted anti-war 
activist Daniel Ellsberg, but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were taking me off track,'' Buchanan said. ``I wanted to  
do battle on political conflict and issues. The idea of running an 
investigation seemed to be a dead-end street for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan returned to writing a syndicated column after working  
for Nixon and later became a television commentator. In a 
revolving-door pattern that continues to this day, he returned to 
politics as a White House aide during President Reagan's second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	What does Buchanan hope to accomplish with his lifelong  
campaign? 
</P>
<P>
	``The preservation of the American republic forever,'' he said.  
``That's what I will achieve before they lower me into the 
ground.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors 
watched closely for news of the ongoing harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices, down more than 25 cents a bushel in the past  
week, received more pressure from the accelerating harvest with 
forecasts predicting dry weather in the soybean belt through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn inched higher before falling back as investors searched for  
the right price ahead of what could be the biggest harvest weekend 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat avoided a price dip, buoyed by export sales overnight.  
Egypt bought 55,000 tons of U.S. winter wheat, and Japan bought 
110,000 tons of U.S. wheat out of a total of 150,000 tons purchased 
from the United States, Canada and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was unchanged at $2.70 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.10 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 1 3/4 
cent to $1.14 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1 cent to $4.84 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
beef futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .10 cent to 66.65 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .18 cent to 79.55 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .28 cent to 45.10 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies rose 1.68 cents to 58.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Lower; Gold Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell against most other major  
currencies in European trading, but gained against the Japanese 
yen. Gold prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0507 in late European trading, up from  
$1.0383 Tuesday. The euro began rising Tuesday after the German IFO 
index, a barometer of business confidence, signaled growing 
optimism by German business executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in midday trading in New York, the euro traded at  
$1.6358. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 104.22 Japanese yen, up from 104.09 late  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's gain against the yen followed a sharp decline in  
the U.S. currency Tuesday when the Bank of Japan decided not to 
relax its monetary policy to take some steam out of the yen's 
recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,  
included 1.5252 Swiss francs, down from 1.5448; 1.4698 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.4740. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6388, up from $1.6278.  
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading in New York, the dollar bought 104.05 yen, and  
the pound was worth $1.6358. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth 1.8615 German marks, down from 1.8837; 
6.2430 French francs, down from 6.3176; 2.0974 Dutch guilders, down 
from 2.1224; 1,842.04 Italian lire, down from 1,864.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $264.20 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$259.25 on Tuesday. Gold prices turned sharply upwards on Tuesday 
following the Bank of England's second sale of 25 metric tons from 
British gold reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $264.05, up from $259.65. Gold rose  
$7.60 in Hong Kong to $262.85.

</P>
<P>
	Puzzled by Newberry's meltdown Sunday in San Francisco's 28-21  
win over New Orleans, coach Steve Mariucci said Wednesday the team 
was considering all its options at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' Mariucci said. ``We're trying to find  
the right combination on the offensive line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Physically imposing, quick on his feet and a dominating blocker,  
the 6-foot-5, 315-pound Newberry came into the league as a 
guard-center but this summer made the transition to tackle, 
succeeding the retired Kirk Scrafford as the blindside protector 
for the left-handed Young. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one of his first tests, Newberry was beaten several times  
Sunday by journeyman defensive end Troy Wilson. And the New Orleans 
Saints, sensing the line's vulnerability, mounted a ferocious pass 
rush that knocked Young down 21 times, including five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault left Young drained and groggy and Newberry  
shell-shocked to the point where coaches are thinking about 
replacing him, though they haven't ruled out giving him another 
chance Monday night against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Under another scenario, Phil Ostrowski could step in at right  
guard and Derrick Deese could shift from guard to tackle, a 
position he has played at times over the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Deese said he hoped the coaches didn't make a change.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is entitled to a bad game,'' he said. ``You can't be  
happy with it but you learn from it and move on to the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newberry, a second-year pro whose rookie campaign was wiped out  
by a knee injury, admits he's still learning to play tackle, a 
position he hadn't played since high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I go out there, I'm going to learn something new,''  
Newberry said. ``I mean, this is my second game. It's going to take 
me a little while to get used to things. But without a doubt, I'm 
ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci isn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last 48 hours, he's been going crazy, wondering, `What did  
I do wrong,' '' Mariucci said. ``He's been so much better than 
that. He just didn't recover mentally. He was just really 
flustered. Hopefully, he'll snap out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he has shaken off the aches from Sunday's beating and  
he remained confident in Newberry and the rest of the offensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good,'' he said. ``I got a little beat up, tired but  
got some rest. That's football. Nothing new there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to unfold,'' he added. ``We've got new guys at  
different positions, and injuries, so it's a little bit herky jerky 
right now but that's OK. We'll hopefully play our best football as 
we move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newberry, who certainly wasn't the only one beaten Sunday, said  
he thinks he got in trouble because he tried to do too much and got 
away from his usual blocking techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got beat one time early and then I tried to switch up what I  
was doing,'' Newberry said. ``It was like, `OK, I need to get back 
quicker.' I changed my set a little bit, trying to get back too 
fast and when I did that, I messed up what I normally do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that there was bound to be a bump in the road  
making the switch from an inside position to a tackle, where 
linemen are out on an island so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hoped that everything would go smoothly and I wouldn't  
see anything that I wasn't used to, but that's asking a whole 
lot,'' Newberry said. ``I've really never played in the NFL, so 
that's a new experience. And then playing a new position, that's 
difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Calls His Final Braves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ernie Johnson retired Wednesday after nearly four  
decades as a broadcaster for the Atlanta Braves. This time, he 
means it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson initially stepped down from Turner Broadcasting System  
in 1989, tiring of the heavy travel at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
	But his retirement lasted only until August 1990, when TBS lured  
him back into the booth to do about 25 games a year for 
SportsSouth, a regional cable network now known as Fox Sports Net 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I've had a lot of people say to me, `I thought you  
were retired. Are you going to give back your gifts?''' Johnson, 
75, quipped before his final broadcast, the NL East showdown 
between the Braves and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm ready to hang it up now, I really do,'' he added.  
``It's a great game to go out on, trying to win the pennant and 
playing the New York Mets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Fox Sports Net South's pregame show was  
devoted to Johnson's career. His family -- including his wife of 52 
years, Lois, and their three children -- watched from a private box 
at Turner Field. A small postgame party was planned afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, Johnson's picture was shown on the scoreboard  
and Braves fans responded with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I'll feel bad after it's over, knowing it's the last  
one,'' Johnson said. ``I'll miss the camaraderie. Lois will 
probably miss (the broadcasts) more than I will. She's my biggest 
fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their retirement plans include trips to spring training, playing  
golf and watching Braves telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Johnson called home games only, except for two  
midseason telecasts in Milwaukee. Johnson pitched for eight years 
with the Boston and Milwaukee Braves, helping the club win the 1957 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring as a player in 1960, Johnson became the team's  
public relations director. Two years later, he joined the Braves' 
radio broadcast team. When the franchise moved to Atlanta in 1966, 
he took over play-by-play duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his broadcasting career, Johnson received some advice  
from another player-turned-broadcaster, Joe Garagiola. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be yourself,'' Garagiola said. ``Don't be anyone but  
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to follow that,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Futures Soar on OPEC Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OPEC's decision to stick to production cuts for another six  
months had an immediate impact on the futures market Wednesday, 
driving already-soaring crude oil prices even higher and sending 
gasoline prices surging too. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, gold and pork belly futures both rose sharply  
for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	Expected though it was, the unity displayed by the Organization  
of Petroleum Exporting Countries at its meeting in Vienna nudged 
oil back toward the $25-a-barrel level it flirted with last week -- 
more than double the price of last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC agreed to extend cuts of 4.3 million barrels a day that  
have whittled down the abundance of oil on the world market and 
spurred talk in Washington of tapping the U.S. strategic petroleum 
reserve to help relieve surging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartel's ministers contended that oil reserves are still  
more than plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the remaining high level of stocks, OPEC member  
countries have reaffirmed their strong commitment to the agreement 
reached in March 1999 until at least the end of March 2000,'' they 
said in a communique. 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas intermediate crude oil for delivery in November rose  
18 cents to $24.12 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while 
October unleaded regular gasoline increased 1.71 cents to 69.84 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude rose 25 cents to $22.93 on the  
International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of surprises in Vienna left no obvious barrier to oil's  
price rise for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason why this market won't continue to work  
its way higher until at least January,'' said Tim Evans, senior 
energy analyst for the Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, 
predicting a price of between $27 and $31 a gallon by the beginning 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	After January, he said, the outlook becomes more uncertain due  
to peaking seasonal demand for gas and the likelihood that OPEC 
members will raise prices at their next meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy futures were mixed Wednesday. October heating oil  
rose 0.43 cent to 60.21 cents a gallon, and October natural gas 
fell 0.01 cent to $2.426 per million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures, after a $6 gain the previous day, increased by  
another $3.60 to $265.40 per troy ounce on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	That's still a far cry from the lofty prices the metal once  
commanded as the premier investment hedge. But its status inched 
higher after South Africa-based Gold Fields Ltd., the world's No. 2 
gold producers, said it bought heavily at a British gold auction 
Tuesday because it expects the price to rise due to demand from 
jewelers. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's rally began after the British Treasury fetched  
above-market prices when it sold 25 metric tons from its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures have risen more than 11 percent on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both pork bellies and hogs climbed Wednesday on speculation  
about the shrinking size of the U.S. hog herd at a time while North 
Carolina farmers are still counting their losses as a result of 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	February frozen pork bellies rose 2.88 cents to 59.65 cents a  
pound. October lean hogs rose 0.73 cent to 45.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. To Sue Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is ready to sue major  
tobacco companies today in an effort to recover billions of dollars 
taxpayers have spent on smoking-related health care, a government 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to  
formally close, without charges, a nearly 5-year-old criminal 
investigation of whether tobacco companies lied to Congress or 
regulatory agencies about the addictive nature of tobacco. That 
decision has been expected since last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-anticipated civil lawsuit prepared by a Justice  
Department task force over the past year would allege that the 
companies engaged in a conspiracy to cover up the health risks of 
smoking in violation of the federal law against civil racketeering, 
The Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``American taxpayers have been forced to spend billions of  
dollars on smoking-related illnesses and the Justice Department is 
working on a way to get them their money back,'' a government 
official said, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was expected to be announced at a news conference by  
Reno and acting civil division chief David Ogden late this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry spokesmen have questioned whether the  
government has authority to bring such a lawsuit, particularly 
given more than three decades of federal government warning to the 
public about the health dangers of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a legal standpoint, it's just pure politics,'' said  
Michael York, a lawyer for Philip Morris, the nation's largest 
cigarette-maker. ``When we look back we'll find the best legal 
minds in the Justice Department thought the facts and law didn't 
support it. It's hypocrisy to think the tobacco companies misled 
the federal government about the risks of smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of suing the tobacco companies to recover an estimated  
$25 billion spent by federal civilian and military health insurance 
programs on smoking-related illnesses was a surprise element in 
President Clinton's State of the Union speech last January. 
</P>
<P>
	It followed an expensive settlement by the cigarette-makers with  
most state governments last year, based on their outlays for health 
insurance. The industry agreed to pay the states more than $240 
billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement with the states followed the collapse of an  
effort to write federal legislation that would have substantially 
increased the cost of cigarettes through taxes and would have 
restricted the marketing of tobacco. Congressional Republicans 
blocked that bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil lawsuit follows a stalled Justice Department criminal  
investigation of whether the industry had lied to either Congress 
or regulatory agencies about the addictive effects of cigarettes 
and the industry's knowledge of that addictive power. The 
department began scaling back that criminal investigation this 
spring, and this summer, several deadlines for filing criminal 
charges passed without any action. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials have been debating for weeks whether any of  
the evidence gathered during the criminal investigation could be 
used by the task force preparing the civil lawsuit. One official 
said department lawyers had decided to try to use that data in the 
civil lawsuit but believed they needed permission from the U.S. 
District Court here which supervises the grand jury which obtained 
it. It was not clear whether that permission had been obtained yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the department's request for $20 million to pay for  
expert witnesses and 40 government lawyers in the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1 remains in limbo on Capitol Hill. The 
Republican-controlled Congress has refused so far to put the money 
into appropriations bills working their way through the Capitol but 
deleted a prohibition against Justice bringing the lawsuit. Justice 
officials expressed continued hope today that the money will be 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the department hired a Minneapolis law firm,  
Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi, which helped Minnesota reach a 
$6.6 billion settlement with the industry last year, to help it 
analyze more than 200,000 pages of industry documents disclosed 
during the Minnesota lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil lawsuit the government will claim that tobacco  
companies engaged in consumer fraud by conspiring to conceal from 
the public the risks of cigarette smoking. The suit will attempt to 
recover claims paid to veterans, military personnel, federal 
employees and the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Health Systems Called Unprepared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local public health systems remain  
ill-prepared to respond to potential biological or chemical 
terrorist attacks, emergency management and medical officials told 
a House subcommittee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, acknowledging the situation, said  
the Department of Health and Human Services was working hard to 
improve it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public health is a critical component of a comprehensive  
response plan, yet, collectively, we are far from where we need to 
be to have an integrated response capability in every state,'' 
Ellen Gordon, immediate past president of the National Emergency 
Management Association, told the House Government Reform Committee 
panel on national security, veterans affairs and international 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, also the administrator of Iowa's emergency management  
division, said state emergency management directors believe there 
are a variety of reasons why most state public health systems are 
unprepared. Among them, she said, are lack of coordination among 
medical, emergency management and law enforcement agencies, and 
little capacity to detect a potentially deadly biological attack 
soon after it occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``States need the immediate help of Congress and the federal  
government to bring the public health system up to an appropriate 
level of readiness,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee heard similar testimony at a hearing in June  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Waeckerle, chairman of the American College of Emergency  
Physicians' Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Task Force, said many 
plans are based on a model that does not address biological agents, 
which require a different response from what would be used for a 
chemical spill or attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Training emergency health care personnel to recognize and  
respond to such attacks is needed, as well as a central federal 
office to coordinate planning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most health care providers lack the knowledge or ``level of  
suspicion'' to detect a biological attack and, without it, ``our 
country will be missing a critical link in the appropriate 
management of a terrorist attack,'' Waeckerle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Knouss, director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness  
at HHS, said his office was helping local jurisdictions by creating 
Metropolitan Medical Response Systems. Contracts have been awarded 
to 47 metropolitan areas to plan their response to a release of 
chemical or biological weapons, he said. The administration's 
fiscal 2000 budget request contains funding for 25 more cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest 120 metropolitan areas eventually will have  
such plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot tell you that the nation is prepared to deal with the  
large-scale medical effects of terrorism,'' Knouss said. ``But we 
are working very diligently to prepare local medical systems and 
public health infrastructures.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Activate Pitcher Karsay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians activated right-handed  
pitcher Steve Karsay from the 15-day disabled list Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay was placed Aug. 27 on the disabled list for the second  
time this season with a strained tendon in his right forearm. He 
was hurt when his forearm tightened during an Aug. 24 game against 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay, 27, has a 2.92 ERA and his 10-game winning streak is the  
longest by an Indians pitcher since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	He began the season as the Indians long reliever, going 8-1 with  
a 2.66 ERA in 42 appearances. But after injuries put Dwight Gooden, 
Jaret Wright and Mark Langston on the disabled list, the Indians 
moved Karsay, who began his career as a starter, into the rotation. 
He went 2-0 with a 0.90 ERA in two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay had been on the DL three times before because of elbow  
injuries and surgeries. He had ``Tommy John'' surgery on his elbow 
in 1997 and has never pitched more than 133 innings in one season.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Causes Hospital Water Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A hospital where the water was knocked  
out by Hurricane Floyd has turned to its rehabilitation swimming 
pool to keep toilets flushing and medical machines operational. 
</P>
<P>
	With water service sporadic because of massive flooding along  
the Tar River, Pitt County Memorial Hospital has been getting water 
trucked in from fire trucks and water tankers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool is usually used to rebuild bodies weakened by illness  
or injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire department pumper trucks are used to suction the greenish  
water from the pool and circulate it through the hospital's 
plumbing system. Toilets flush, the lab has remained open and key 
medical machines that depend on water pressure are running. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottled water is used for drinking.  
</P>
<P>
	``The pool is pretty effective for its intended purpose, but it  
has worked pretty effectively for this unintended purpose as 
well,'' hospital spokesman Tom Fortner said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital estimates that since Tuesday, several hundred  
thousand gallons of water have gone into the 80,000-gallon swimming 
pool -- described as roughly half the size of an Olympic-size pool -- 
and then into the hospital's water system. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury-rigged system has enabled the 731-bed hospital to  
continue to serve several counties in eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a truck exploded Wednesday night outside the  
hospital. No one appeared to be hurt and firefighters quickly 
doused the blaze. The cause of the blast wasn't immediately 
apparent.

<HEADLINE> Huskers' Davison Made 'The Catch' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prone in the end zone, the prize cradled in his arms, freshman  
Matt Davison became an instant celebrity two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraska wide receiver, still living off his astonishing  
game-saving catch against Missouri, returns to the scene for the 
first time Saturday night. The memories have been flooding back all 
week with the No. 6 Cornhuskers and unranked Tigers preparing for 
the rematch in Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I want to forget about it,'' Davison said. ``It  
was a great point in my career, but I have two years left, 
practically, so hopefully I can do some other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what happens, Davison will have a hard time topping  
what occurred Nov. 8, 1997. It was what Missouri coach Larry Smith 
angrily referred to as ``one stinking play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With seven seconds to go, Nebraska trailing 38-31 and the ball  
at the Missouri 12, quarterback Scott Frost threw to wide receiver 
Shevin Wiggins in the end zone. Missouri defensive back Harold 
Piersey got there first, deflecting it into the air. But on his way 
to the turf, Wiggins kept the ball alive with his foot, and Davison 
made an alert diving catch for the touchdown that forced overtime 
and saved the season for the nation's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
	Davison caught 32 passes last year as a sophomore. After three  
games this season, he's the leading receiver with seven catches for 
106 yards. Still, it's the catch, the catch, the catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to make other plays and be a big part of the  
offense, and be a guy who's consistent catching the ball -- a guy 
that can be looked to in clutch situations,'' Davison said. ``But 
it doesn't seem like anything I do will let me get away from being 
known as a one-catch guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Missouri couldn't fight the feeling that its  
program had been cursed. Davison's grab came in the same end zone 
as Colorado's game-winning touchdown in the 1990 fifth-down game, 
which spelled national title for the Buffaloes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I thought I saw was the ball hitting the ground, and I  
thought, `Oh, hooray, we won the game,''' Missouri center Rob Riti 
said. ``Then the official signaled touchdown. It was a very sad 
moment. I felt cheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Nebraska coach Frank Solich, then the offensive coordinator  
under Tom Osborne, there was only elation. Solich pointed out that 
the touchdown came after Nebraska, with no timeouts and 1:02 to go, 
drove 67 yards behind the passing of Frost to get in position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The touchdown? No question in my mind it was executed well,''  
Solich said with a grin. ``This was all done with a hurry-up, 
two-minute style of offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a case of instant gratification in the polls, at least  
for Nebraska. At 9-0, the Cornhuskers dropped to No. 3 behind 
Michigan and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that we did learn that to win the national championship  
we have to have things go your way,'' Solich said. ``That was 
obviously a time where we really needed something special to happen 
and it happened for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a consolation prize, Missouri made it into the Top 25 for the  
first time since 1984 at No. 25. Smith has taken the Tigers to bowl 
games the last two seasons, ending a 13-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri also discovered it could run with the big dogs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Up to that point, this team looked at playing a Nebraska or a  
Texas A&AMP;M and thought, `There's no way we can beat these guys,' '' 
Riti said. ``Of course they'd never say that, but it would be on 
their psyche, in their subconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing that game did was say, `Hey, we're Missouri,  
we can beat any team in the country.' That's a big deal.''

<HEADLINE> Harlem Dance Theater Begins Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An upbeat program of heartwarming and fun  
ballets made up opening night of Dance Theater of Harlem's 
30th-anniversary season at the City Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's opening marked the first season by the company in  
mid-Manhattan in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ``Return,'' a premiere danced to recordings by James Brown  
and Aretha Franklin, and ``South African Suite,'' whose music was 
played by the Soweto String Quartet from South Africa, were strong, 
solid ballets taking a good-time approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest audience chuckle came in the second part of  
``Return,'' when Franklin sang about love in ``Baby, Baby, Baby'' 
and dancer Kellye A. Saunders turned to each of three male dancers 
on hearing each ``Baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers were crisp and strong throughout the evening.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Long and Duncan Cooper led the striking first section of  
``Return,'' in which the men strutted and the women had attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The choreographer was Robert Garland, who has been a dancer and  
teacher in the company and now is its first resident choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``South African Suite'' has sections choreographed by Arthur  
Mitchell, and two South Africans -- Augustus Van Heerden and Laveen 
Naidu. The Soweto String Quartet and two percussionists sat atop a 
high rear platform. Music sounded like exports from South African 
musicians while also reminiscent of cheerful Appalachian barn dance 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	The present version of ``South African Suite'' is expanded from  
an earlier one that was commissioned by the Kennedy Center in 
Washington. Costumes in black and various black and white prints 
are by Pamela Allen-Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening ended with John Taras' 1982 ``Firebird,'' set to  
Stravinsky's very Russian music. Andrea Long was an outstanding 
Firebird, delicate and fluttering but a steadfast heroine. Kip 
Sturm and Lenore Pavlakos were the Young Man and Princess of Unreal 
Beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will dance six different programs and end its  
two-week run with a tribute to George Balanchine, in whose New York 
City Ballet Arthur Mitchell was a star dancer before he retired to 
help found the Dance Theater of Harlem.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Quake Should Offer Insight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Taiwan, which sits on the edge of two plates on the Earth's  
crust, gets shaken by dozens of earthquakes each year. Most are 
centered in the Pacific Ocean and rarely cause damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the magnitude 7.6 quake that hit Taiwan early Tuesday was  
very unusual because it occurred beneath the island's central 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake killed more than 1,800 people. It was Taiwan's worst  
since a 7.4 magnitude temblor hit the island in 1935, killing 3,276 
people. In 1986, a magnitude 7.8 quake off Taiwan's east coast 
killed 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also say the earthquake is not related to recent  
ones in Greece and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	This quake was centered about 120 miles south of the capital,  
Taipei, in the Changyung Mountains. The mountains, which soar as 
high as 13,000 feet, are riddled with faults, but not much is known 
about their instability because the area is not as seismically 
active as the fault zone off the island's east coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Several geologists and engineers from the United States were  
preparing to fly to Taiwan for a closer look at the physical 
changes that may have occurred to the island, as well as the damage 
to buildings and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	``This earthquake is the only major one to occur in 40 years  
within this mountain range,'' said seismologist Jeff Barker of the 
State University of New York at Binghamton. ``This could be the 
piece of information to explain what's happening geologically in 
Taiwan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of the earthquake's magnitude, location and  
damage caught scientists off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my experience, this is largest occurring in Taiwan, and one  
of the very large ones in history,'' said Wai-Ying Chung, a 
University of Memphis seismologist who studied in Taiwan. ``It is 
comparable to the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, and the 1976 
earthquake in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said Tuesday's quake was as powerful as the one that  
struck Turkey a month ago, but it was caused by different seismic 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turkey earthquake occurred along a strike-slip fault,  
similar to the San Andreas fault that runs beneath California. 
Quakes along those faults move horizontally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan quake occurred along a reverse-strike fault. It  
occurs where two plates, the Eurasian and the Philippine, press 
against each other. Pressure from below pushes one plate up, while 
the other plate drops at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The energy is focused upward with a reverse-slip event,''  
Barker said. ``They tend to be more dangerous because that's where 
the people are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the plates of the Earth's crust are loosely connected,  
researchers said it is unlikely that earthquakes even in the same 
part of the world -- Turkey and Greece, for example -- are related 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of earthquakes occur every day around the world. The  
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., has 
registered more than 200 earthquakes with a magnitude above 3.5 in 
the past 2 1/2 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Swissair Knew of Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Swissair and the company that made the MD-11  
airplane knew that wiring aboard Flight 111 posed a fire risk at 
least seven years before the plane crashed off Nova Scotia, an 
attorney for the crash victims' families charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the exact source of the fire aboard the plane has not been  
identified, attorney Lee Kreindler said an electrical wire failure 
ignited insulation. The plane, flying from New York to Geneva, 
crashed on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kreindler said he had evidence that the airline and the  
manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas -- which was bought by Boeing in 
1997 -- knew the insulation on the wiring could wear down in 
ordinary use and pose a fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is some very strong evidence that shows the defendants  
knew about the problem with the airplane before the flight. That 
goes to the heart of why the manufacturers are liable, and 
conceivably liable for punitive damages,'' Kreindler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations were filed in a 23-page summary to accompany the  
families' lawsuit in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holland, an attorney representing Swissair, Boeing and  
Delta, which is being sued because it had a ticket-sharing 
arrangement with Swissair, was not in his office Wednesday and did 
not return a message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Flight 111 crashed, the pilots mentioned a strange  
smell in the cabin and then complained of dense smoke. Canadian 
investigators later found heat-damaged wiring on the wrecked plane, 
prompting U.S. air safety officials in January to recommend that 
airlines inspect all MD-11 planes for electrical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have argued that the Death on the High Seas Act  
applies to the case, a law that only allows for the recovery of 
compensatory damages, or real losses associated with income and 
medical costs, and not punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs have rejected a settlement package  
worth about $300 million in compensatory damages, saying they 
believe they can get $1 billion in punitive damages from a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' court documents maintain that when Swissair  
bought the plane in 1991, the dangers of the wire coating and 
insulation were well known. The products were made by DuPont Co., 
which is being sued separately.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Warns Parents of Web Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government warned parents Wednesday about  
a dark threat on the Internet: Web sites that nearly duplicate 
legitimate ones but whisk children and others into an electronic 
maze of pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission called the ploy ``page-jacking''  
and described it as the most pernicious example it has discovered 
in the 100 cases of Internet deception investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency on Wednesday showed how a consumer who clicked to  
visit an Internet site apparently about a popular movie, ``Saving 
Private Ryan,'' was sent with no warning to Web sites with lurid 
photographs advertising ``barely legal Asian girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When puzzled surfers try to close those browser windows, other  
windows that opened automatically displayed different pornographic 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In extreme cases, those sites also temporarily can disable a Web  
browser's ``back'' and ``forward'' navigation buttons to make it 
even more difficult to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about what it would be like if you saw your 7-year-old  
child looking at this, and she couldn't turn if off and you 
couldn't turn it off,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the 
commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC, alleging deception and unfair trade, said it obtained  
temporary restraining orders earlier this week in U.S. District 
Court against Carlos Pereira, believed to be living in Portugal, 
and Guiseppe Nirta of Australia and his company, WTFRC Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Asher, deputy chairman of the Australian Competition and  
Consumer Commission, said federal police there served search 
warrants Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said some types of Internet filtering software are  
effective blocking these pornographic sites, especially software 
that analyzes text or images from a Web page before displaying it. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is how the scheme works:  
</P>
<P>
	--A company's popular Web site is digitally copied, including the  
hidden ``meta tags'' that help the Internet's search engines 
categorize its content, and then published on different computers 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	--A few lines of software code, called Javascript, are hidden  
within the duplicated Web site to immediately redirect visitors 
elsewhere -- often to pornographic sites that pay a few cents for 
online referrals -- and to make it difficult for a person to shut 
down the browser software or surf elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein recommended that parents consider disabling Javascript  
technology in their Web browsers, a procedure that can require up 
to half a dozen mouse-clicks. But that also prevents legitimate 
sites from using the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim compared page-jacking to opening a family restaurant,  
then finding an adult bookstore built across the street in an 
identical building and under the restaurant's own marquee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like some sleazeball has tunneled under your front door  
and set up a trap door,'' said John G. Fischer of Irving, Texas, a 
lawyer for Adrenaline Vault, a Web site that fell victim this 
spring. Youngsters looking there for details about software games 
instead found their computer screens filled with pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said it helped uncover evidence of the scheme using its  
new Internet lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Blumenthal, who runs the lab, said the FTC uses a private  
Internet provider as its investigators surf the Web to avoid 
tipping companies that the government, with its familiar 
``ftc.gov'' moniker, is visiting. The agency also is establishing 
secret e-mail accounts for these digital detectives to cloak their 
online identities. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has taken a lead role among all federal agencies  
enforcing U.S. laws on the Internet, but its unclear how its 
lawyers and eight new computers will make more than a tiny dent in 
fraud on the Web, where criminals can organize operations overseas 
to thwart U.S. laws and can vanish and reappear under different 
names in a matter of hours.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Woman Bakes To Pay Farm Taxes / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOLON, Iowa (AP) -- When her husband died three years ago, Peg  
Stritesky knew it was up to her to pay the taxes on the family 
farm. She turned to cooking, her strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Stritesky, 59, and her daughter, Lisa, 28, began selling $7 pies  
at the Solon farmers market. It has become an annual part of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will always be a struggle just to preserve our lifestyle,''  
Peg Stritesky said. ``We do it not to get rich but to do what we 
enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stritesky said she got started that year because she had such  
good apples. The rhubarb, peaches, strawberries and raspberries 
were good, too. When her neighbor had more fruit than she could use 
herself, she gave it to Peg. That is how Peggy's Pies was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've built my business on fresh fruit. We don't start at the  
farmers market until August. Until then, we're getting the fruit 
ready and gardening or farming,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Picking apples for her customers' favorite flavor of pie is  
easy, but Peg works hard to please others by picking wild 
blackberries in the timber. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wear long sleeves and a leather glove on one hand. I get all  
scratched up, but people like blackberry,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The fruit they prepare goes into three freezers and four  
refrigerators and waits until the rush of pie-making days. 
</P>
<P>
	For Wednesday's market, Stritesky starts Monday by making dough.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesdays, she stands for hours at the corner of the kitchen  
cabinet and rolls out pie crusts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Stritesky and Chris Davis, 11, a neighbor who spends time  
with them, work at the table across the kitchen. They open freezer 
bags of fruit, divide it and add sugar and other ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesdays are for making fruit pies. Cream pies and kolaches -- a  
bun made of sweet dough and filled with jam or fruit pulp -- are 
made Wednesday morning, with Peg turning the kitchen light on well 
before dawn. The two women will bake for 36 hours and then sell the 
pies, kolaches, 36 loaves of quick bread and dozens of cookies in 
three or four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers market is open two afternoons, Wednesday and Friday,  
but Peggy's Pies and baked goods are available only on Wednesday -- 
the rest of the week is for farming. 
</P>
<P>
	Peg and Lisa bought 30 lambs in the spring that had been  
rejected by their mothers and fed them by hand until they could eat 
on their own. The lambs are at market weight now and are helping 
the farm's finances as they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm is home to 32 cows and a bull, plus their offspring,  
which are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm also produces firewood and garden vegetables and has  
200 acres in hay and pasture and 70 acres in crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Peg says her heart has always been with the farm. When she was 6  
or 7 years old, she wanted to drive a tractor. Her father was in a 
hurry and asked Peg's mother if he should take the time to teach 
her how to drive a tractor. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom said, 'Some day you may be glad you did,''' Peg says.  
</P>
<P>
	Not many women can bake as well as her mother and then cut hay  
and check the cattle, Lisa says. 
</P>
<P>
	Peg faces August, the beginning of the three-month pie season,  
with mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of dread some of the work, but it's fulfilling,  
rewarding to see all the baked goods,'' she says. ``We always 
learned we had to do what we had to do to survive. This is one of 
those things.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell today, extending  
yesterday's 225-point plunge by the Dow Jones industrial average 
and pushing that index to its lowest level in three months. But 
strength among technology shares and smaller-company issues 
bolstered the broad market, with the Nasdaq compsite index rising 
back toward record territory. The Dow fell 74.40 to 10,524.07, 
about 800 points below its record-high close of 11,326.04 set Aug. 
25. In the technology group, 3Com rose 1 5/16 to 28 5/8 as the most 
active Nasdaq issue after the maker of computer network products 
and Palm Pilot organizers topped Wall Street forecasts with its 
profit report late yesterday. The Nasdaq rose 37.07 to 2,858.17, 
about 30 points shy of a new high.

	Fed Finds Moderate-to-Brisk Growth  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation is enjoying ``moderate-to-brisk  
rates of growth'' with industrial activity on the rise across most 
of the country and retail sales showing strength, the Federal 
Reserve said today. It also noted there were few reports of 
pressure on wages and salaries despite a continuing tight labor 
market, and stable consumer prices. However, it found the cost of 
healthcare benefits increasing in some areas. The report compiled 
from data from the Fed's regional banks helps guide policy makers 
who will meet Oct. 5 to review interest rates. 

</P>
<P>
	Justice Dept. Sues Tobacco Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department sued the tobacco  
industry today to recover billions of dollars taxpayers have spent 
on smoking-related health care, accusing cigarette-makers of a 
``coordinated campaign of fraud and deceit.'' The lawsuit filed in 
U.S. District Court in Washington alleges the cigarette companies 
conspired since the 1950s to defraud and mislead the American 
public and to conceal information about the effects of smoking. 
Attorney General Janet Reno said that smoking is ``the nation's 
largest preventable cause of death and disease, and American 
taxpayers should not have to bear the responsibility for the 
staggering costs.''

will likely pay steeper fuel bills this winter in view of OPEC's 
decision today to maintain deep cuts in oil output until at least 
next March. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
announced its widely expected move in a communique issued during a 
semiannual meeting of its 11 oil ministers. OPEC will stick to cuts 
of 4.3 million barrels per day that it has made over the past two 
years. OPEC will review market conditions in March 2000.

	Airlines Launch Fall Fare Sale  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Air fares to Europe and some domestic  
destinations were put on sale today, with flights to London as low 
as $188 for round-trip travel. The London sale launched by British 
Airways is good for tickets purchased only through Friday. The 
fares of $188 are for round-trip travel from several East Coast 
cities on a Wednesday. Air fares from West Coast cities start at 
$298. The sale fares are available from 22 U.S. cities. Mwanwhile, 
US Airways is offering discounts up to 35 percent off two-week 
advance purchase fares for travel within the United States between 
Oct. 5 and Dec. 15. The sale fare from Washington, D.C.'s Reagan 
Airport to Denver, for instance, is $315 roundtrip if the flight 
includes a Saturday night stay, and fare from Charlotte, N.C. to 
Kansas City is $229. The sale fares must be purchased by Oct. 1.

	Senate Predicts No Y2K Disasters  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One hundred days before computers run up  
against the year 2000 date, a Senate panel said today that the 
world won't end on Jan. 1 with a Y2K-related computer crash, but 
Americans should be ready for short-term disruptions. It said 
federal agencies and the national infrastructure are in solid 
shape, but seven states remain in the ``danger zone'' with fewer 
than 70 percent of computer systems ready, the Y2K panel said in 
its final report. The situation is similar in the private sector, 
with big businesses, particularly in the banking and investment 
industry, confident their computers are ready while many smaller 
businesses could run into trouble.

	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. plans to reduce  
its worldwide workforce by an additional 9,000 jobs as the company 
looks to reduce costs amid a downturn in the aerospace industry. 
The Hartford, Conn.-based company also announced today that it 
plans close 8.5 million square feet in manufacturing and other 
space. Most of those closures are expected overseas. The cutbacks 
are the latest move by UTC to restructure its business.

	Quake Affects Taiwan High Tech  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The earthquake that hit Taiwan will cause  
computer chip companies to lose more than a week of production and 
may lead to an increase in worldwide prices, analysts said today. 
The U.S. investment firm Merrill Lynch said in a report that the 
powerful quake, which struck yesterday, would affect output for 
between one and 1 1/2 weeks. The quake knocked out power supplies at 
most companies in a science-based Technology Park. As of this 
morning, only partial power had been restored to several leading 
chipmakers located there. Prices on the chip spot market have been 
rising recently because of a short supply and high demand, and 
analysts said the disruption in Taiwan could drive them even 
higher.

<HEADLINE> Contestants Vying for Pickup Truck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGVIEW, Texas (AP) -- It's just before 7 a.m. on a chilly  
September morning and the 24 people vying for a $15,000 pickup 
truck are sizing up the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	A mother faces down the twentysomething owner of a snow cone  
store. A father-and-daughter duo eye a teacher who was inspired by 
a dream to enter the off-beat competition sponsored by a vehicle 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hands on a Hardbody contest is about to begin.  
</P>
<P>
	The participants clustered at dawn Tuesday to begin a standing  
marathon that will last until mistakes, chilly winds and exhaustion 
peel all participants from the steely skin of the truck but one. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are simple: One hand must be laid flat on the truck at  
all times. The contestant who holds out longest drives the truck 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Day One is by far the easiest. Soon feet will swell, boredom  
will sink in and tempers will shorten. Still later, as the 
sleepless hours and days roll by, the hallucinations begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go slowly insane,'' said Vinny Perkins, the 1992 winner.  
``Tempers flare, you start talking trash, playing mind games with 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most years, a winner is declared after 90-some grueling hours.  
Around the gleaming truck, the line between comedy and tragedy is 
smudged. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many aspects to this contest people don't think  
about,'' organizer Jan Maynard said. ``It is a real human drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmaker S.R. Bindler thought so. Bindler shot a documentary of  
the contest in 1995. Released last summer, ``Hands on a Hardbody'' 
traces the hilarity and heartbreak of the days-long event. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, one tired woman in a waking hallucination dreamed she  
was on her way to a dance club. She wandered away from the truck 
and was immediately disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had them thinking they see snakes, bending over to pick  
up tools that aren't there because they dream they're working on a 
truck,'' longtime judge Barbara Baggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each participant is bent on winning the Nissan Frontier, but  
everyone has a different theory on how to win, and who the toughest 
competitors will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are surprises every year,'' Ms. Baggs said. ``You  
can't tell by looking at them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diet tends to be spartan and packed with protein: Tuna  
straight from the can, thick gobs of peanut butter, bananas. No 
caffeine, lots of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Every hour, contestants can take six minutes away from the  
truck. They dash either to the bathroom inside the dealership or to 
makeshift rest stations set up nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Hearne, a state police officer, has been hitting the gym  
at dawn to ready himself. Last year, Hearne lost when -- after 56 
hours on the truck -- he accidentally used both hands to pull off 
his headphones. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, his personal trainer looked on while Hearne squirmed,  
twisted around and leaned away from the truck to chat with 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	``See?'' trainer Kevin Elder sighs, tapping his forehead. ``No  
mental concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each contestant has a collection of comforts -- things like lawn  
chairs, stocked coolers, blankets, notes from their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a vacation for me,'' said Stacy Jimerson, a mother of  
two and full-time student. ``I actually get to relax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the would-be truck owners already have cars; some say  
they'll give the vehicle away if they win. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so Mary Edwards. She needs the truck. Her 9-year-old son has  
cerebral palsy, his doctors are in Louisiana and she can't fit two 
people, a wheelchair and a walker in her compact car. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep saying, `Get a van, get a truck,''' said Ms.  
Edwards, who works as a hostess at a local restaurant. ``But I've 
been struggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others say they want to win because, well, they want to win.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really just the prestige,'' Rick Stolz said. He  
hesitated, glanced around. ``Um, if you can call it that.''

<HEADLINE> Maine Expands Subsidized Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- For nearly a quarter century, Maine has  
been a pioneer in helping its older residents purchase costly 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the income eligibility for subsidies has been broadened, and  
the list of covered prescription drugs expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The helping hand is welcomed by those facing rising prescription  
drug prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very independent but, really, it was ridiculous,'' said  
Barbara Henry, a 68-year-old former teacher. ``Prior to receiving 
this program, I was paying astronomical amounts for eye drops. And 
I couldn't afford them after a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the expanded program, which took effect last month,  
beneficiaries may now have income of up to 185 percent of the 
federal poverty level -- $15,244 a year for a single person and 
$20,461 a year for a married couple. Additionally, some people 
facing high prescription drug costs may qualify at higher income 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the basic program, the state pays 80 percent of the cost  
of medications to treat specified chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Those illnesses are diabetes, heart disease, high blood  
pressure, chronic lung disease including emphysema and asthma, 
arthritis, anticoagulation, hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol, 
incontinence, thyroid disease, osteoporosis or bone density loss, 
Parkinson's disease, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and ALS, or Lou 
Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A supplemental program covers other drugs, which must be  
medically necessary. Program participants pay the Medicaid rate for 
prescriptions, with the state paying an additional $2. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine Human Services Commissioner Kevin Concannon says the  
assistance can save lives at a time when drug prices are rising by 
as much as 20 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had a good salary, you'd have difficulty,'' Henry says.  
</P>
<P>
	Elderly people of modest means who turn to the program deserve  
the help, she says. ``They're not asking for charity, they're 
asking for assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maine officials say the state program's expansion will boost the  
number of beneficiaries from about 24,000 people age 62 or older to 
about 40,000 of the state's 241,000 elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Also potentially eligible are disabled people age 19 or older.  
</P>
<P>
	To expand eligibility and provide some coverage for a broader  
array of drugs, the new state budget includes an additional $1.1 
million for each of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials were able to stretch the extra money by getting  
the same discounts used by the state Medicaid program to apply to 
the Low Cost Drugs for the Elderly and Disabled Program, Concannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the biggest payer, that is, the taxpayers of the  
state,'' Concannon said, referring to the state's leverage with 
drug manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Concannon said that last year Maine's Medicaid program spent  
$135 million on prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Maine Revenue Services -- formerly known as the  
Taxation Bureau -- mailed applications to potential beneficiaries of 
the low-cost drugs program. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King also joined Concannon at a news conference to  
publicize the program expansion and encourage potential 
beneficiaries to apply. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the 330 pharmacies in Maine participates in the program.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're all doing it because it's a heck of a deal for them,''  
Concannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen states have programs offering coverage or financial  
assistance for purchasing drugs, according to the National 
Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Most use state funds to partially subsidize costs, with varying  
criteria for enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
	Programs in Maine and New Jersey are the oldest, dating to 1975.  
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries are primarily low-income elderly or disabled  
people who do not qualify for Medicaid. Pennsylvania's program is 
estimated to have more than 300,000 recipients. In New Jersey, 
coverage approaches 215,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with senior pharmacy assistance programs:  
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of them have been in existence since the 1970s, quietly  
working without a lot of public attention,'' said Richard Cauchi, a 
policy specialist for the group.

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Ups Copper Giants' Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. is adding almost $1 billion in  
cash to its previous all-stock bids for copper rivals Asarco Inc. 
and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the sweetened offer Wednesday, Douglas C. Yearley,  
the chairman and chief executive officer, said Phelps Dodge is 
willing to acquire one company without the other but is still 
hopeful a three-way deal can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco and Cyprus have already rebuffed two offers from Phelps  
Dodge, choosing instead to move ahead with their planned merger. 
Shareholders in New York-based Asarco, and Englewood, Colo.-based 
Cyprus Amax are scheduled to vote on that deal on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new offer, Phelps Dodge would pay $9 cash plus 0.288  
of a Phelps Dodge share for each Asarco share and $6.89 in cash 
plus 0.2203 of a Phelps Dodge share for each Cyprus Amax share. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders would be given a choice between cash and stock, but  
Phelps Dodge will only pay up to 35 percent of the deal in cash, 
Yearley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of all three companies shot higher Wednesday on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Cyprus Amax was up 9 percent, or by $1.56 1/4, at 
$18.81 1/4; Asarco was up 10 percent, or by $2.06 1/4, at $22.50; and 
Phelps Dodge was up 2.6 percent, or by $1.50, at $58.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's prices, the offer valued Asarco at $25.90 a  
share, or $1.03 billion, and Cyprus Amax at $19.82 a share, or 
$1.79 billion. That made the total stock-and-cash value of the deal 
$2.82 billion, or $270 million more than the previous all-stock 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous bid amounted to $932 million for Asarco and $1.62  
billion for Cyprus Amax, based on Tuesday's closing prices, before 
the latest offer was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Yearley said that while Phelps Dodge was willing to negotiate on  
some portions, it does not plan to increase the overall price. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco spokesman Jerry Cooper and Cyprus Amax spokesman John  
Taraba both declined to comment on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Billick, an analyst for Warburg Dillon Read, said the offer  
seems to be a good deal for Asarco and Cyprus Amax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why shareholders wouldn't take this bid,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, though, Asarco has remained resistant to Phelps Dodge's  
overtures. On Monday, Asarco filed a lawsuit against Phelps Dodge 
claiming the company wrongly interfered with its Cyprus merger 
plans. Cyprus Amax did not join in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is Asarco's management is clearly focused on  
getting something other than the best price for its company. ...The 
primary concern is preserving management jobs,'' Billick said. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Clarence Morrison, a metals analyst for Prudential  
Securities, said Phelps Dodge has put together a good acquisition 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	Logic suggests Francis McAllister, Asarco's chairman and chief  
executive officer, ``may be forced into this kicking and 
screaming,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Banged Up Badgers Await Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What's a Badger to do?  
</P>
<P>
	Barry Alvarez can't coach from the sideline because he needs  
knee replacement surgery. Heisman Trophy hopeful Ron Dayne is 
nursing a sprained ankle. Now the big question is whether Wisconsin 
can stay with No. 4 Michigan after losing to lowly Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't worry, wide receiver Nick Davis says, No. 20 Wisconsin  
will be ready to open Big Ten play against the Wolverines at Camp 
Randall Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez is to have surgery Oct. 5 and probably will coach from  
the press box Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to support him and get through it,'' Davis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dayne, who had 231 yards in last week's 17-12 loss to the  
Bearcats, says his ankle is fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's feeling good,'' Dayne said. ``I'm able to run.''  
</P>
<P>
	But how is Wisconsin (2-1) to support Dayne's bruising runs?  
Against the Bearcats, Scott Kavanagh threw for 85 yards. That won't 
do against the Wolverines (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Wisconsin traveled to Ann Arbor with a 9-0 record and  
No. 8 ranking. The 15th-ranked Wolverines won, 27-10, and ran for 
257 yards against the nation's best rushing defense. Dayne was held 
to 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan coach Lloyd Carr doesn't see much change in the  
Badgers, but he certainly expects a closer game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, Wisconsin has the same team it had a year ago,  
with the exception of the quarterback,'' Carr said, referring to 
Kavanagh replacing Mike Samuel. ``They have a strong, powerful 
offensive team. They have a strong defense. They have a great 
punter. They want to play ball control, field-position football. 
They have the kind of people that allow them to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan needs to get its offense untracked, too. Jeff Del Verne  
kicked three field goals in an 18-13 win over Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr says he'll continue alternating quarterbacks, with Tom  
Brady starting and Drew Henson playing the second quarter. He also 
wants more touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We missed out on some opportunities,'' Carr said. ``Our first  
drive, we have the ball for 10 plays, then we drop a pass. Then we 
get a field goal blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these big games, the line between winning and losing is  
very small. You have to take advantage.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Proud To Play in Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Payne Stewart is the kind of guy who  
cranks up the volume on Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA'' in 
the hallway of the hotel, someone who would look as comfortable 
draped in the Stars and Stripes as in his knickers and tam 
o'shanter. 
</P>
<P>
	How badly did he want to play in this Ryder Cup?  
</P>
<P>
	After securing his spot on the team by winning the U.S. Open, he  
was at The Country Club within a month getting to know the course. 
During the last two major championships, he proudly wore a Ryder 
Cup hat during the practice rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing, however, showed his determination quite like his  
victory at Pebble Beach in February, which moved him that much 
closer to his first Ryder Cup team since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get on the Ryder Cup team because I'm tired of us  
losing,'' he said. ``The last two Ryder Cup teams I was on, we won. 
And the last two I wasn't on, we didn't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here he is, finally, ready to make a difference, willing to grab  
his teammates by the collar and shake some spirit into them if he 
finds it lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a beauty,'' Mark O'Meara said. ``Payne is Payne. He's got  
a tremendous love for the game of golf, and it shows. And I think 
that helps our team, no question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remember that roar Stewart let out when he made a 15-foot par  
putt to win the U.S. Open? Should the United States finally win 
back the Ryder Cup, he just might be heard all the way back to 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wears his feelings right there on his sleeve for all the  
world to see,'' Tom Lehman said. ``And for that reason, he's a 
fantastic teammate and partner. If you have problem being excited 
about what's going on being around him, you have a real problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman and Davis Love III played against Stewart and Justin  
Leonard during an alternate-shot match Wednesday in a gloomy 
drizzle at The Country Club. It was tight until the end, when 
Stewart holed a chip for birdie on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	About three hours later, the first words out of Stewart's mouth  
summed up his mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody is ready for Friday,'' he said. ``I know I  
am. This is something I've looked forward to all year long, and I'm 
very excited about being back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That excitement may have been lacking the past couple of years,  
certainly two years ago at Valderrama. One of the questions 
Americans seem to face after every loss -- five of the last seven, 
to be exact -- is whether they possess the same passion as Europe 
when the stakes are as simple as a gold chalice that could fit in 
carry-on luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't appear to be the case this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a little bit more determined because there are a few of  
us that have been through some losing teams,'' Love said. ``We all 
get along very well. There's not any real dissension. A lot of guys 
are having a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts with Stewart. The leader is captain Ben Crenshaw,  
who has instilled a sense of history about the Ryder Cup and a 
sense of purpose about winning it back. But leadership also comes 
from the players hitting the shots, and the search for that player 
always seems to go back to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne is fired up about it,'' Love said. ``Whoever goes out  
with him to play better be ready for that. He's going to get us 
going in the morning and keep us focused on what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of passion might be what it takes to cope with the  
pressure that is saddled on the American team like never before. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like in 1995 and 1997, the U.S. team is stacked from top to  
bottom -- only David Duval lacks Ryder Cup experience, and the 
12-man team has won a combined 11 major championships. No American 
is lower than 28th in the world ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that credentials ever matter. The United States hasn't won a  
Ryder Cup since 1993, and not on home soil since the ``War on the 
Shore'' at Kiawah Island in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must be under pressure being the 12 best players in the  
world, according to themselves,'' England's Lee Westwood said, 
responding to Jeff Maggert's assessment the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	This U.S. team does not belong solely to Stewart. Tiger Woods is  
playing his best golf ever, and the rest of the team has looked so 
sharp this week that Crenshaw is not sure which four players will 
sit out the first round of matches when the Ryder Cup begins Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was possible that 12 fellows could be  
playing well at one time, and it's darn near there,'' Crenshaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods prefers to lead by example, as do Duval and O'Meara.  
Stewart intends to do both, of which he could do neither the past 
two Ryder Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting in your living room on your couch watching it, you  
can't make any difference whatsoever,'' Stewart said. ``So, here I 
am. If captain Crenshaw chooses to play me, I feel that I can make 
a difference playing. If he chooses not to play me, I'll make a 
difference by being out there supporting my team.''

<HEADLINE> OPEC Reaffirms Cuts in Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The outcome of the latest OPEC oil  
ministers' meeting -- a decision to prolong cuts in oil output -- 
seemed well-scripted and came as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, Wednesday's move has fed uncertainty about  
future trends in petroleum prices and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to be in for a very volatile market over  
the next few months,'' said Mehdi Varzi, an industry analyst in 
London with the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced  
its widely expected decision during a semiannual meeting of its 11 
oil ministers. OPEC will stick to cuts of 4.3 million barrels per 
day that it has made over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC ministers have said they hope to see prices increase  
further, and they expressed concern over what they see as a 
continued oil surplus in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the remaining high level of stocks, OPEC member  
countries have reaffirmed their strong commitment to the agreement 
reached in March 1999 until at least the end of March 2000,'' the 
group said in a communique. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC will review market conditions at that time and act to  
ensure ``continued market stability,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts said oil prices have become divorced from the  
underlying fundamentals of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders have already factored in the anticipated uptick in  
winter demand for heating oil in much of the industrialized world. 
Prices have more than doubled since February, even though 
inventories have been slow to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must stress that the market situation still seems to be  
fragile, contrary to what present price levels might indicate,'' 
OPEC President Youcef Yousfi told ministers in an opening speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no shortage of oil in the market, and ... stock  
levels are still high and could at any time have a negative impact 
on prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwait's oil minister, Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, told  
reporters that the price increase since March has fallen short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dale Steffes, president of Houston-based Planning and  
Forecasting Consultants, said OPEC is trying to keep the oil price 
artificially high. OPEC will lose significant market share as the 
high prices make it profitable for other countries to pump more 
crude, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They only missed two points,'' Steffes said of the OPEC  
ministers. ``Supply and demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's last round of cuts, taken in March, helped revive prices  
from 12-year lows. Now that the group has reaffirmed the cuts, 
analysts say OPEC's restraint will hit Americans hardest of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxes account for as much as 80 percent of the price for  
gasoline in Europe and 60 percent of the gas price in Japan, said 
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy 
Studies in London. By comparison, the U.S. tax rate on gasoline is 
only about 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Any increase in oil prices would therefore cause a  
proportionally sharper rise in prices Americans must pay at the 
pump. Drollas estimated that gasoline prices have already risen 
four times faster in the United States this year than in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lukman, speaking at a final news conference after the  
meeting ended late Wednesday, said the ministers did not specify a 
target price or price range. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, at  
least 35 percent of the of the world's total. In March, it agreed 
together with major non-OPEC producers to curtail daily production 
by 2.1 million barrels, or 2.6 percent of the global supply. Prices 
have risen steadily since. 
</P>
<P>
	The price for the November contract of U.S. West Texas  
Intermediate crude was trading up 29 cents at $24.23 per barrel in 
New York, more than twice its year-to-date low of $11.26, set Feb. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
	Average pump prices for a gallon of gasoline in the United  
States stood at nearly $1.32 a gallon this month, up from less than 
$1 in February, according to the Lundberg Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	And U.S. heating oil prices are expected to average about $1.04  
per gallon this winter, up from 80 cents per gallon last year, the 
U.S. government has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roger Diwan, manager of global oil markets for The Petroleum  
Finance Co., a Washington-based consulting firm, said prices are 
not sustainable at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to come down. You're going to have a strong  
retreat,'' he said. ``The question is when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC comprises Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, the United Arab  
Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Indonesia and 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's oil ministers will meet again in Caracas, Venezuela,  
on March 27.

<HEADLINE> More Flooding in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Overnight rainfall caused more flooding  
today in eastern North Carolina, slowing the recovery from 
Hurricane Floyd and the state's worst environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rivers are now swollen with human waste, animal waste and  
other pollution,'' state environmental secretary Bill Holman told a 
legislative panel today. ``Our waste systems were not designed for 
500-year floods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three inches of rain fell across the coastal plain Tuesday and  
early today, and rising water sent the number of closed roads 
soaring from about 300 to 529. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain on Tuesday delayed efforts to fire up incinerators to begin  
destroying the carcasses of hundreds of thousands of drowned hogs, 
chickens and turkeys. The incinerators were being fired up today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3,100 people remained in shelters today, nearly a week  
after Floyd's 20 inches of rain caused record flooding. There have 
been 41 confirmed deaths in North Carolina and the deluge flooded 
30,000 homes. The storm caused at least 68 deaths from the Bahamas 
to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina officials have said the damage may surpass the $6  
billion in damage caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996. In Pitt County 
alone, estimated damage from Floyd was pegged at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Holman told lawmakers early reports show damage to 22 water  
treatment plants, 209 sewage plants and 430 animal farming 
operations, in addition to the fire hazard from leaking propane gas 
tanks, runoff from junkyards and seepage from warehouses where 
chemicals were stored. About 400,000 wells are affected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fishermen were looking forward to the best fall shrimp  
harvest in years, but the slug of pollution and fresh water has 
essentially wiped that out,'' Holman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Tolbert, director of the state's emergency management  
operations, said at least 30,000 homes had been flooded, with at 
least 1,600 of them damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina has started distributing 420 camping trailers for  
flood evacuees, and plans to eventually have 1,000 campers in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Davis was delighted at the prospect of getting one of the  
trailers after spending six days in a temporary shelter at Tarboro 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can call that a home because there's nobody but me and my  
family in one camper,'' she said Tuesday at the school, where she 
and her two children are among nearly 2,000 displaced residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north along Floyd's destructive path, more than a  
million New Jersey residents were still being advised to boil their 
drinking water because of a damaged treatment plant. Tempers there 
and elsewhere are being strained by the storm's effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want outright money,'' John Trulio Jr. shouted at state and  
federal officials Tuesday outside his parents' damaged home in 
Ossining, N.Y. ``I don't want a loan, I want a grant. If we can 
give these foreign countries all this aid, why not some right here 
in America?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several miles beyond the North Carolina state line, hazardous  
materials specialists at Franklin, Va., were testing for 
contamination from leaking petroleum barrels, pesticides, raw 
sewage and dead animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that even after the flooding is over, residents  
and business owners will not be allowed to return until 
environmental agencies give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, everything from caskets to bloated animal  
carcasses to household goods floated in polluted water flooding 
parts of an 18,000-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots delivering food and bottled water to shelters continued  
to look for stranded people. 
</P>
<P>
	At Greenville, a city of 44,000, the water supply was  
temporarily shut down Tuesday by the rising water of the Tar River. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also no running water at Tarboro High and flood  
refugees bathed in shower tents hooked up to water tankers by the 
National Guard. Portable toilets were overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to have flushable toilets, but that's not in  
the foreseeable future,'' said Dave Stone of the American Red 
Cross. ``Thank God we've got power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salvador Lopez, who lived with 12 relatives in a mobile home in  
nearby Princeville until the flood wiped him out, is looking for a 
way to move his family to his parents' home near Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost everything -- cars, mobile home,'' said Lopez in  
Spanish. ``We only saved ourselves. Everything is lost.''

<HEADLINE> Debt Relief Proposals Get a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's poorest countries moved closer to  
easing their huge burden of debt when the Clinton administration 
asked Congress for a big increase in money to finance a debt-relief 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty-fighting groups praised the U.S. move Tuesday as a  
dramatic gesture that would salvage the effort to help 41 of the 
poorest nations, mostly in Africa, obtain $90 billion in debt 
relief. The big industrial nations pledged at a summit in June to 
expand the debt initiative so countries receive more help faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that time, however, the proposal had run into roadblocks  
that included a campaign by the gold industry to block direct sales 
of gold from reserves of the International Monetary Fund to finance 
part of the debt relief. Members of Congress from gold-mining 
states and lawmakers critical of the IMF's overall performance 
joined the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials indicated the IMF was close to approving an  
alternative gold sale plan for the debt-relief plan. They hope to 
get approval for an overall debt-relief package when the 182-nation 
IMF and its sister institution, the World Bank, hold their annual 
meetings in Washington next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to set an example for other rich countries, Treasury  
Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters Tuesday the 
administration sent Congress a request to more than triple the 
amount the United States will offer in debt relief in the fiscal 
year starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., a leading supporter of debt  
relief, expressed optimism that Congress will approve the 
administration's increased funding request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of funding debt relief is $1.20 a year for every man,  
woman and child in the United States over the next three years,'' 
Bachus said, ``and the cost of not doing it will be the deaths of 
tens of thousands of people every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, a persistent critic of the IMF,  
said the administration's plan was a step in the right direction 
but the United States should be bolder and directly cancel debts 
owed by poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crucial to allocate the sums the administration is  
talking about in the right way to break the hammerlock of the IMF 
on poor countries, '' Sachs said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said by directly cancelling poor country debt owed to the  
United States, the administration could leverage up to $100 billion 
from other nations for debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the administration's budget had included $120  
million to support debt relief next fiscal year. Summers said the 
new request would boost that total by another $250 million, 
bringing next year's total request to $370 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to that, the administration asked Congress to  
approve another $600 million for another three years of U.S. 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential moral policy to write off debts to nations in  
significant parts of the world where a child is more likely to die 
by the age of five than attend secondary school,'' Summers told 
reporters after testifying at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of religious and other poverty organizations, known as  
Jubilee 2000, pushed leaders of the industrial nations to do more 
for debt relief at their annual summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam International, praised the  
administration's new proposal as a potential spur to wealthy 
nations, the IMF and the World Bank to be more generous. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration released a fact sheet estimating that if  
wealthy creditor nations and organizations such as the IMF and 
multinational development banks meet obligations envisioned by the 
industrial nations, current debt of $127 billion held by the 
world's poorest nations could be cut to $37 billion.

<HEADLINE> BYU Coach Signs Five-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When LaVell Edwards became coach at BYU,  
some said he wouldn't last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 27 years ago, before Edwards engineered BYU's rise to  
national prominence. On Wednesday, he signed a five-year contract 
extension that will keep him in Provo through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``He built this program and he can stay as long as he wants,''  
linebacker Rob Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms weren't disclosed but published reports have placed  
Edwards' salary at $250,000 annually. Edwards, 68, declined to say 
if he had received a raise in the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards has a career record of 245-91-3 and ranks eighth among  
active NCAA Division I coaches, winning 72 percent of his games. 
The Cougars won the 1984 national title after beating Michigan in 
the Holiday Bowl to finish 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards recalled that he once planned to coach until he was 60.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was about 62 before I ever remembered that's what I had set  
up. ... Now I'm already making plans for next year and recruiting. 
That's the reason for this. I just feel good right now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards needs 11 victories to pass Nebraska's Tom Osborne for  
sixth place on the list of career coaching victories. Edwards turns 
69 next month but Morris said he sees no signs that his coach has 
slowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to have found the fountain of youth for coaching. All  
he does is drive around in a golf cart all day. I could do that,'' 
said Morris, the team jokester. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars (2-0) are ranked No. 17 and play Virginia on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Val Hale said the extension came early in the  
season to help Edwards with recruiting. Speculation had persisted 
since summer that Edwards was ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This announcement should send a clear message to recruits and  
fans that BYU football will continue its winning ways into the next 
century,'' Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving, Edwards said he hopes to improve BYU's  
facilities, including the construction of an indoor practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have good young players in the program and strong schedules  
in the coming years,'' he said. ``The future looks bright for BYU 
football. I also want to get a number of projects off the ground 
before I retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Edwards took over in 1972, he had been a BYU assistant for  
10 years, the last few as defensive coordinator. As coach he 
devised a passing game to offset the more physical opponents on 
BYU's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had changed coaches every three or four years before my  
getting the head job,'' Edwards said. ``It was just going to be a 
matter of when I got fired. There were a lot of people that felt 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars developed one of the most prolific passing offenses  
in NCAA history, grooming quarterbacks like Marc Wilson, Jim 
McMahon, Steve Young, Robbie Bosco and 1990 Heisman Trophy winner 
Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Through two games this fall, quarterback Kevin Feterik leads the  
nation in total offense, averaging 491 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Calif. Probes Four Women's Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sexual misconduct allegations at four  
women's prisons have led to the resignations of five prison 
employees and the investigation of 12 others, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The male employees, some of them correctional officers, have  
been accused of sexual assaults and of illegal consensual sexual 
relations with female inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	One employee has been placed on administrative leave and faces  
sexual assault charges in San Bernardino County, prison officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another correctional officer allegedly fathered an inmate's  
child, prison officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ongoing investigation could include as many as 40 additional  
employees at the California Institution for Women in Frontera 
alone, said state Corrections Department spokeswoman Kati Corsaut. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began in November 1998 when the Fontera warden  
asked the state to investigate an inmate's accusation that a 
correctional officer had fathered her child. That officer has since 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	California has 11,249 female inmates housed in four prisons. One  
is in Frontera, two are next to each other in Chowchilla and one is 
in Stockton.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Proposes Gas Can, Spout Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First-of-their kind regulations on portable  
gas cans are being considered in California as officials try to 
cope with the innocuous-looking containers they say spew dozens of 
tons of pollutants into the air each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Martin, spokesman for the state Air Resources Board in  
Sacramento, said the regulations will significantly cut seepage and 
spills and will ``reduce a lot of pollution at a low cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated 10 million residential and commercial gas cans in  
the state spew almost 90 tons of smog-forming pollutants into 
California's air each day, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Resources Board will consider the regulations at its  
meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the proposed rules would require that the  
plastic cans and spouts automatically snap shut to prevent 
overfilling and spilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrocarbon vapors from the gasoline seep into the air and  
combine with other pollutants, then sunlight triggers a chemical 
reaction that forms ozone, said Richard Varenchik, a spokesman for 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The emissions leak out several ways: Vapors pass through the  
walls of plastic containers; fumes escape through vent holes, 
through poorly capped spouts and when the fuel is poured; fuel is 
easily spilled during filling or overfilling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would apply to new gas cans and spouts sold in  
California starting Jan. 1, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufactures say they would go too far, and fear that once  
California adopts the regulations, other states will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``In essence, it will sweep the country,'' said John Kowichezk,  
owner of Portland-based EnviroCan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to put my company out of business,'' Kowichezk  
said. ``I highly support what they're doing, but they're taking a 
leap from no control to total control.''

<HEADLINE> China Turning Over US Airmen Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China is handing over to U.S. officials what  
are believed to be the remains of two American airmen whose B-24 
bomber crashed into a mountain in southern China during World War 
II, a Pentagon official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A repatriation ceremony will be held Thursday in the city of  
Guilin, and the remains will be flown to Hawaii for examination by 
the Army's Central Identification Laboratory, said Pentagon 
spokesman Larry Greer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Jones, the Pentagon's top official on matters of American  
missing servicemen, will attend the ceremony, Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sets of remains were found this summer during an  
unpublicized joint U.S.-China recovery operation in a rugged ravine 
on Mao'er Mountain in Guangxi province, Greer said. U.S. and 
Chinese officials have made multiple trips to the site since 
recovering bone fragments there in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All 10 airmen died when their B-24 crashed during a return  
flight to Guangxi after bombing Japanese ships near Taiwan on Aug. 
31, 1944. Greer said forensic scientists believe they now have 
most, if not all, of the 10 sets of remains and are ``very close'' 
to positive identifications of most of them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to U.S. military records, the crew members were pilot  
2nd Lt. George H. Pierpont; co-pilot 2nd Lt. Franklin A. 
Tomenendale; navigator 2nd Lt. Robert L. Deming; bombardier 2nd Lt. 
George A. Ward; engineer Staff Sgt. Anthony W. DeLucia; radio 
operator Sgt. Ellsworth V. Kelley; radar observer Pfc. Fred P. 
Buckley; and gunners Staff Sgt. William A. Drager, Sgt. Robert L. 
Kearsey, and Pvt. Vincent J. Netherwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense has not provided the men's hometowns.  
</P>
<P>
	The bomber crash site lay undisturbed for 52 years until two  
Chinese farmers hunting for wild herbs found it on Oct. 2, 1996, 
Chinese officials said. The discovery was made public in November 
1996 when Chinese President Jiang Zemin turned over photographs of 
five dog tags taken from the aircraft, as well as a videotape of 
the crash site, to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States poured aid and bomber crews into China during  
World War II to fight the Japanese, who had invaded much of the 
country. About 1,000 U.S. planes went down over China during the 
war, and about 100 remain missing. The Pentagon has cited China's 
cooperation on the B-24 recovery operation as a helpful influence 
toward a broader improvement of military-to-military relations.

</P>
<P>
	When Bryant Gumbel begins his job as co-host of ``The Early  
Show,'' he will have 32-year-old Jane Clayson as his partner. 
Clayson has reported for ``World News Tonight'' and other ABC 
broadcasts since 1997, covering Bob Dole's presidential campaign 
and the O.J. Simpson civil trial. The search for Gumbel's co-host 
was so closely watched that it was dubbed ``Operation Glass 
Slipper'' within the television industry. Gumbel, who was born on 
Sept. 29, 1948, begins his new duties on Nov. 1. A storefront 
studio is being constructed across from Central Park for the CBS 
show. 

</P>
<P>
	Gwyneth Paltrow stars with Matt Damon in the new film, ``The  
Talented Mr. Ripley.'' Damon plots to insinuate himself into the 
lush life of playboy Jude Law and his girlfriend, played by 
Paltrow, who was born on Sept. 27, 1972. Her previous films include 
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Sliding Doors.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Janeane Garofalo isn't one of Hollywood's most fashionable  
actresses -- and she's proud to say she just doesn't care. ``There's 
a let-them-eat-cake quality to fashion that bothers me,'' Garofalo 
said. ``I can't in good conscience read in the paper about a 
Bosnian rape camp and then put on an $8,000 Versace dress.'' 
Garofalo, who was born on Sept. 28, 1964, was criticized for 
wearing a plain, off-the-rack dress to the 1996 Emmy Awards.

<HEADLINE> Fire Burns Down Home Nabokov Rented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A recent fire that burned down a modest  
rental home drew little attention until a librarian recalled that 
Vladimir Nabokov finished his masterpiece ``Lolita'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabokov rented the house in the summer of 1953 and ``found  
Ashland singularly favorable to literary inspiration,'' Brian Boyd 
wrote in his 1991 book, ``Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Lolita was now purring along steadily,'' Boyd wrote, ``and had  
reached the point where he could begin to dictate his finished 
chapters to Vera (his wife) at the typewriter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book was published in 1955.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the house lost much of its luster as a charming  
cottage and was turned into three apartments. It burned Saturday 
when a 19-year-old resident forgot to turn off two burners on the 
stove, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local librarian and author Bill Ashworth read Boyd's book in the  
early '90s and took special note of the home's address because it 
was about a block from where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-born Nabokov died in 1977 in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Hilton Studies Building Space Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As NASA assembles the international space  
station high above the Earth, private lodging and travel companies 
are taking a serious look at orbiting hotels and other projects 
that could make space the final frontier of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in space tourism was piqued this week, when Hilton  
Hotels Inc. disclosed that it is looking into the feasibility of a 
space hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to take a hard look at it and see if Hilton can be  
first into space,'' said Hilton spokeswoman Jeannie Datz. ``It's 
certainly not going to happen tomorrow. We're talking 15 to 20 
years down the road, if any of it makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton isn't alone. Robert Bigelow, owner of the Las Vegas-based  
Budget Suites of America lodging chain, has committed $500 million 
to the goal of building a ``cruise ship'' that would fly from Earth 
orbit to the moon and back. He formed a new company, Bigelow 
Aerospace, to pursue the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of space resorts may not be as farfetched as it  
seems. A 1997 NASA study concluded that space tourism represents a 
potential market worth billions of dollars if economic and 
technical barriers can be overcome, and Hilton has said it will 
host a symposium on the subject in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercialization of space will be a key topic on Thursday when  
the Space Frontier Foundation opens its annual conference in Los 
Angeles. NASA Administrator Dan Goldin is scheduled to address the 
group on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous speeches, Goldin has raised the possibility of  
public space travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open to proposals,'' said NASA spokesman Brian Welch.  
``I don't think anybody believes it's going to happen tomorrow, but 
there are new space technologies coming on line. There are new 
spacecraft being built that could lead to widespread traffic back 
and forth into space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenges of space tourism would be enormous. And at this  
point no one can say for sure whether a space hotel would be 
profitable or even appealing to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this for young, really healthy people or can the John  
Glenns of the world go up there and have a good experience?'' 
Hilton spokeswoman Datz said. ``What are you going to eat? If you 
want your New York steak or pasta primavera, is it going to be 
available, or is it going to be in pill or freeze-dried form?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Meyers, executive director of Space Island Group of West  
Covina, Calif., believes there would be plenty to entertain 
tourists in space. The company wants to use empty space shuttle 
fuel tanks to build an orbiting hotel similar to the space Hilton 
depicted in the film ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guest could take space walks, gaze down at the Earth and try  
their hand at space gardening and minor maintenance projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've referred to as the romantic possibilities of zero  
gravity always comes up,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Bigelow Aerospace, recently formed, is hiring engineers and  
others to work on space related projects. The lunar cruise ship is 
a long-term goal. For now, the company is trying to develop 
inflatable modules that could be appended to the space station and 
leased to NASA to create additional room for researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, NASA has failed to give private companies much access to  
the shuttle for private research and commercial enterprises, 
Bigelow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this stuff is predicated more on politics and  
legalities than it is on technology,'' Bigelow said. ``The 
technology is here to do that. The problem is whether or not NASA 
is going to stand in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the closest tourists can come to space travel  
comes by way of the Russian air force. For $12,000, the adventurous 
can hitch a ride on a MiG-25 fighter that will take them 15 miles 
above the Earth at more than twice the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Incredible Adventures, a travel company based in Sarasota, Fla.,  
has arranged about 400 high-altitude flights since 1993. The 
company also arranges zero-gravity flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Smith, 43, of Portland, Ore., has done both.  
</P>
<P>
	``At 80,000 feet, the sky turns into a very deep, midnight blue,  
not quite black, and you can just start seeing the curvature of the 
Earth,'' said Smith, an Intel Corp., program manager. ``You get a 
sense of being much more removed from the Earth at that altitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would she buy a ticket to space if she had the chance?  
</P>
<P>
	``In a flat second,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Head Unlikely To Get Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake's top Olympic bidder is unlikely  
to get immunity from federal prosecutors in exchange for testimony 
against International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Tom Welch, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Wednesday the former head of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee would consider trading his testimony against IOC 
officials for immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said Welch would cut the deal for his own protection,  
not because he would admit to any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and his lawyer, Tom Schaffer, have not pitched an immunity  
deal to the Justice Department, nor have they been contacted by 
federal prosecutors or the FBI during the 10-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department source, also speaking Wednesday on  
condition of anonymity, said department officials have no intention 
of giving immunity to Welch, who is considered the chief target of 
a federal grand jury probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer was traveling and didn't return phone messages relayed  
by his secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch was prepared to give Richard Wiedis, the Justice  
Department lawyer leading the Olympic investigation, information he 
gave an ethics panel for the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	That panel detailed $1.2 million in gifts and favors Welch and  
others lavished on voting members of the IOC and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch has insisted the inducements were normal for Olympic  
bidding and fall short of criminal bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch figures in charges already filed against two others  
accused of shadowy Olympic dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the unidentified Salt Lake bid committee officer in an  
indictment handed up earlier this month against the son of IOC 
executive board member Kim Un-yong. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim was indicted on 17 felony charges of fraudulently  
obtaining a permanent U.S. visa or green card and using it to 
travel frequently to the United States. Kim, who had returned to 
South Korea before he was indicted, keeps a house on New York's 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake businessman David Simmons acknowledged setting up a  
phony job in New York for Kim, using money funneled from the bid 
committee. Simmons pleaded guilty in August to tax fraud for 
deducting Kim's salary from his taxes as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he hired Kim as a favor to Welch, who was then the  
president of the bid committee and later the SLOC until he was 
forced to resign in 1997 amid spouse-abuse charges. Welch's name is 
on some of the checks to Simmons' former company, Keystone 
Communications, for Kim's salary.

<HEADLINE> More Relaxed Martin on Verge of PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNCTION CITY, Ore. (AP) -- Just when Casey Martin began to  
realize there's more to life than playing on the PGA Tour, he 
started making big strides toward accomplishing just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who sued the PGA Tour last year for the right to ride a  
cart to ease the pain in his right leg, is within striking distance 
of earning a tour exemption for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 15 finishers on the Nike Tour, sort of golf's  
minor-league circuit, earn a PGA Tour card. Martin currently is 
12th at $101,527 entering this week's Oregon Classic, held just 
north of his hometown of Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big week for me and my career, and hopefully I can  
do well,'' he said Wednesday during an interview aboard his cart, 
parked near the practice tees at Shadow Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm just not trying to think too far in advance,'' Martin,  
27, added. ``Obviously I'd like to make it, so I'd like to take 
advantage of where I am right now. But at the same time, I don't 
think it's the most important thing in my life to make the PGA 
Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important stage of his life came in February 1998, when  
a federal judge in Eugene ruled against the PGA Tour and allowed 
Martin to use a cart to get around the course in tournaments. The 
decision is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin suffers from a degenerative condition in his right leg  
that makes it painful to walk. The PGA Tour, and many veteran 
golfers, argued that walking is part of the game and that using a 
cart would give Martin a ``competitive advantage'' over opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	After his court victory, Martin became a hero to disabled  
children and a media phenomenon. He signed an endorsement deal with 
Nike and made the rounds at talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my life was going to be like that all year long, I would  
have seriously considered another profession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the spotlight faded, Martin found himself struggling on  
the course. He qualified for the U.S. Open and had a strong 
showing, but later fell to a 29th-place finish on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He played poorly to begin the 1999 season, but thanks to three  
top-10 finishes since the beginning of August, he could secure his 
PGA Tour card with a second-place finish here. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin began playing better after he took some time off in  
August. He sought treatment from a Chicago doctor who specializes 
in an ultrasound-guided therapy that Martin hoped would alleviate 
some of the pain in his leg. But it had no effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I'm just the same, business as usual,'' he said. ``I've  
lived with my leg my whole life, and it has good days and bad days, 
but I'm still able to compete thanks to the cart, so I'm grateful 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pain got so bad that he considered withdrawing from a  
tournament in South Dakota. But he stayed and tied for sixth. The 
next week, he was second in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my leg got bad, I kind of wanted to come home,'' he said.  
``But that's when I actually started to play well, so I think I 
learned not to put too much pressure on myself, and if I try too 
hard it kind of backfires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spending time with family and sleeping in his own bed has  
further boosted Martin's spirits, but he also feels the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to play well for the people at home,'' he said. ``Now  
that all the attention has died down, it's been nice. But hopefully 
I'll play well enough in the future that I'll have to learn to deal 
with those issues on a weekly basis.''

<HEADLINE> SLOC Head May Testify for Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The man who won the 2002 Winter Olympics  
for Salt Lake City might be willing to testify against IOC 
officials in exchange for immunity from federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Tom Welch, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Wednesday the former Salt Lake bid leader would insist on 
immunity for his own protection, and not because he would admit to 
any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and his lawyer, Tom Schaffer, have not proposed an  
immunity deal to the Justice Department, nor have they been 
contacted by federal prosecutors or the FBI during the 10-month 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman would not comment  
on the likelihood of any immunity deal for Welch or for Dave 
Johnson, the former No. 2 bid official. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer was traveling and could not immediately be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch is prepared to give Richard Wiedis, the Justice Department  
lawyer leading the Olympic investigation, information he gave an 
ethics panel for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That panel detailed $1.2 million in gifts and favors that Welch  
and others lavished on voting members of the International Olympic 
Committee and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch has insisted the inducements were normal for Olympic  
bidding and fall short of criminal bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch figures in charges already filed against two others  
accused of shadowy Olympic dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch is the unidentified Salt Lake bid committee officer in an  
indictment handed up earlier this month against the son of IOC 
executive board member Kim Un-yong. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim was indicted on 17 felony charges of fraudulently  
obtaining a permanent U.S. visa or green card and using it to 
travel frequently to the United States. Kim, who had returned to 
South Korea before he was indicted, keeps a house on New York's 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake businessman David Simmons acknowledged setting up a  
phony job in New York for Kim, using money funneled from the bid 
committee. Simmons pleaded guilty in August to tax fraud for 
deducting Kim's salary from his taxes as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he hired Kim as a favor to Welch, who was president  
of the bid committee and later the Salt Lake Organizing Committee 
until he was forced to resign in 1997 amid spouse-abuse charges. 
Welch's name is on some of the checks to Simmons' former company, 
Keystone Communications, for Kim's salary.

<HEADLINE> McCain Tells GOP To Let Buchanan Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain said today that Pat Buchanan's  
``own rhetoric'' indicates that he already has left the Republican 
Party and that, despite the political implications, it is time for 
the GOP to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has said he is ``dead serious'' in considering leaving  
the Republican Party to seek the Reform Party's presidential 
nomination. He is expected to announce his decision next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders fear a third-party bid by Buchanan would  
siphon votes from the GOP nominee and put a Democrat back in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,  
has met with Buchanan. Other GOP presidential candidates have tread 
softly on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fully aware of the political implications of a Buchanan  
third-party candidacy but regardless of what the polls show our 
party must stand on principle,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said in a statement that it appears that Buchanan already  
has made his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's evident to me by Pat Buchanan's own rhetoric that he's  
left the Republican Party,'' the Arizona senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defeating Hitler's Germany and Tojo's Japan was a very noble  
cause and I would not want any Republican to think otherwise, or 
any American for that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' Buchanan  
contended that Adolf Hitler was not a direct threat to the United 
States after 1940 and his ambitions for conquest were toward the 
east, not the west. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitler's real ambitions lay in carving out an empire in the  
east ... He had given up the idea of global empire,'' said 
Buchanan, a frequent critic of U.S. intervention overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Buchanan said the United States was right to fight in  
Europe after Germany declared war.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Escapes on Cigarette Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COUNCIL GROVE, Kan. (AP) -- A man let out of his jail cell to  
smoke a cigarette climbed a fence topped with razor wire and 
escaped hours after he was sentenced to almost 42 years in prison 
for shaking a toddler to death. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 law enforcement officers used horses, helicopters and  
dogs to search for Scotty Adam today in woods near the Morris 
County Jail, said Scott Teeselink, spokesman for the Kansas Bureau 
of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge went beyond sentencing guidelines to give Adam, 24,  
double the recommended sentence for second-degree murder. The 500 
months imposed by Morris County Judge Morris Platt was the maximum 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Platt said Adam's 1993 involuntary manslaughter conviction in  
the stabbing death of a 19-year-old man was the reason he exceeded 
the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two lives taken by you is enough,'' Platt said.  
</P>
<P>
	Adam escaped Tuesday when deputies let him into a recreation  
area outside of the jail for a smoke, Teeselink said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam, charged with first-degree murder, pleaded guilty to  
second-degree murder in the shaking death of 16-month-old Timothy 
Post in the toddler's Council Grove home. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy, the son of Adam's girlfriend, suffered massive brain  
swelling caused by violent shaking, according to expert testimony 
at Adam's preliminary hearing last year. Adam told investigators he 
treated the toddler ``rough'' on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam was taking care of the boy and his sisters, ages 2 and 3,  
when Timothy was injured Oct. 21. At the time, Adam was on parole 
for the earlier killing.

<HEADLINE> Albright Chides Foreign Policy Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
Wednesday Congress does not understand the harm it is causing the 
United States by not giving President Clinton all the money he 
wants to finance U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	One result of congressional cuts is that the United States is in  
debt to the United Nations and, Albright said, ``they resent us 
deeply because we are not paying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By U.N. accounting, the bill is about $1.5 billion. If the  
United States does not pay $350 million by January, it could lose 
its vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lack of understanding in Congress about the toll it  
takes on the American position if we don't have the money,'' 
Albright said of the cuts in foreign spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright agreed with congressional critics who say that the  
United Nations should do more to trim its spending, but she said 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had ordered some worthwhile reforms in 
U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	And Albright said that the U.S. share of U.N. costs -- 25 percent  
of the budget and about 30 percent of peacekeeping operations -- was 
unfair and that several other nations were prosperous enough to pay 
a larger share. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, the United States is ``the backbone'' of the  
United Nations and should pay its debts.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks, Galloway Agent To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- When Mike Holmgren heard Joey Galloway's  
agent wanted to meet with the Seattle Seahawks this weekend, he 
decided to try to move up the timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks' first-year coach-general manager told the team's  
negotiator, Mike Reinfeldt, to call Eric Metz, Galloway's 
Scottsdale, Ariz.,-based agent, to try to set up a soon-as-possible 
meeting here before the team left for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to fly them in here,'' Holmgren said at his news  
conference Wednesday. ``I don't want to wait until this weekend. 
Why wait until Pittsburgh? We'll pay for their plane tickets and 
get them in here. If they think we can get something done this 
weekend, let's not wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metz on Wednesday said thanks, but no thanks.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he'll talk by phone with Reinfeldt on Thursday and meet  
with him in person in Pittsburgh on Friday evening, saying a 
Pittsburgh meeting fit his schedule better. He emphasized there had 
been no new offer from the Seahawks and no deal was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway has no plan to be in Pittsburgh for the meeting, Metz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off a 14-13 victory in Chicago last weekend to even their  
record at 1-1, the Seahawks will play at Pittsburgh (2-0) on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Metz said Tuesday that Galloway would end his holdout  
immediately if the Seahawks would promise not to use their 
``franchise player'' designation to limit Galloway's options after 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would definitely do that if you would promise me you'll  
sign,'' Holmgren said. ``I want him here. If he wants to be here, 
which I think he does, let's get the thing done now. Let's do this. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stance hasn't changed. I have high hopes for him and what  
he can do and how I think I can help him become a player who can 
maximize his potential. I'm surprised it's lasted this long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, 27, is considered the top talent in the Seahawks'  
offense. He caught 65 passes for 1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns last 
season. In 63 games with Seattle, he has 261 career catches for 
4,122 yards and 36 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to be paid $1.58 million in the final year of a  
five-year contract that he signed as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, the Seahawks made him what they said was a final  
offer, a $35 million deal for seven years, including a $7 million 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm willing to tweak here now because I want this thing to get  
done,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren sounded almost conciliatory in his remarks about his  
missing receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so concerned about making a statement,'' he said.  
``It's a good learning experience for me and it's one right out of 
the chute. I really hope it gets fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway's holdout has cost him $416,000 in lost salary and  
fines, but Holmgren hinted the fines against Galloway weren't 
written in stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' he said.  
``That's a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For every game that Galloway misses, the team gains $93,000  
under its NFL-mandated salary cap. If Galloway misses enough games, 
the team could use that money toward the signing of a free agent.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico St. Football Back on Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- Four hundred years ago, Spanish explorer  
Don Juan de Onate came to southern New Mexico's Mesilla Valley in 
search of gold and treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't find any, but those who followed discovered a fertile  
valley where today fields of chili, groves of pecan trees and acres 
of cotton and vineyards stretch for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The valley has always been fertile territory for a lot of  
things, but not football. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last three decades, few major college programs in the  
nation have rivaled New Mexico State's pigskin futility. Just two 
winning seasons since 1968 and an especially embarrassing stretch 
from 1985 through 1991, when the school won eight games and lost 
69. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought finally may be over.  
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies are 3-0 after last week's stunning 35-7 victory over  
then-No. 22 Arizona State in Tempe and a win Saturday at Texas-El 
Paso would give New Mexico State its best start since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it's still early in the season, and the Aggies could fade  
again, football fever hasn't been this high in Las Cruces since the 
school won consecutive Sun Bowls in 1959 and 1960 behind 
quarterback Charley Johnson, who went on to a career in the NFL 
with the old St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's great excitement in town. You can't beat success,''  
said Jim Bradley, coach at Las Cruces' Mayfield High School and the 
coach of the 1974 New Mexico State team that, despite its early 
winning streak, still ended up with a losing record after dropping 
its final five games. 
</P>
<P>
	So ecstatic were Aggies fans after the ASU victory in Tempe that  
some of them tore down one of the goalposts at the empty New Mexico 
State stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like turning on an electric light switch. The bulb was  
out before, or at least very dim,'' said Jack Nixon, the school's 
play-by-play commentator for 20 years. ``People are energized now. 
Before, it was we think it will be better. We hope it will be 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The architect of better times is former Nebraska player and  
assistant Tony Samuel. A soft-spoken disciple of hard work and a 
relentless recruiter, Samuel brought his Cornhuskers roots and 
connections with him when he became the Aggies' 31st coach two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Samuel was merely curious.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really came just to look,'' Samuel said. ``I knew about the  
history of the program. I knew they were battling for the basement. 
But that's all I knew. I didn't know much about the city and didn't 
know much about the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legacy of losing didn't keep Samuel from taking a closer  
look. He desperately wanted to be a coach, so much so that for 2 1/2 
years prior to taking the New Mexico State job, he had been 
contacting other assistants he wanted on his staff. His listed 
included former Nebraska players like Rich Glover, the 1972 Outland 
Trophy and Lombardi Trophy winner; Barney Cotton, Jeff Jamrog and 
Gerry Gdowski, all of whom joined him in Las Cruces and are still 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 11 members of Samuel's staff played at Nebraska.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of them are good coaches, good people,'' Bradley said.  
``They've brought something to this community that's very good. 
They're clean-cut people who work their tail off and know what 
they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel also brought much of Nebraska's playbook. On defense, the  
Aggies run the same multiple 4-3 defense as the Huskers and 
offensively run a variety of schemes to free up their running 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arizona State, the running back trio of Walter Taylor,  
Chris Barnes and Keeon Johnson produced 295 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aggies didn't win much more in Samuel's first two seasons  
than they had in the previous 30. They finished 2-9 in 1997, losing 
41-10 to Arizona State in Samuel's debut and 61-24 the following 
week to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season the Aggies were 3-8, but four of the losses were by  
four points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel and has staff have steadily built depth and the talent  
pool by recruiting players from throughout the country. Often, 
they've tapped their Nebraska connections. For example, sophomore 
running back Kenton Keith is the cousin of former Nebraska running 
backs Roger Craig and Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got ex-teammates calling us and recommending, and we  
have good connections with people who know talent,'' Samuel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel's staff also has found players off the usual recruiting  
highway. Players like starting safety Donald Malloy, who graduated 
from Friendly High School in Port Washington, Md., and considered 
walking on at Rutgers or Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the coaches here were from Nebraska,'' Malloy said. ``I  
thought, `I'll take my chances with these guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Another former walk-on, wide receiver Ryan Shaw, came across  
town from Mayfield High and has turned into the Aggies' go-to 
receiver with 19 career touchdown catches. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the euphoria over the Aggies' start has come  
speculation that if New Mexico State does have a good year, Samuel 
and his staff will be lured away by a bigger school and more money 
than the $158,000 base salary he now earns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have time to worry about that,'' Samuel said. ``Those  
kind of things, if they happen, they happen. I preach to the team 
all the time, to focus on one game at a time. If I don't do the 
same thing, I'm lying to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Brian Faison thinks those offers will come.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do everything we can to try to keep him,''  
Faison said. ``The job he's done is tremendous. I think 
realistically, if we have the kind of season that we hope we can, 
he's going to be a very attractive candidate for a lot of 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel says New Mexico State, too, can be an attractive program  
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the proper support, this is a gold mine,'' he said.  
``We've proven that we can compete with anybody. I said that the 
day I came. It's only a graveyard if you believe it is.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world won't end on Jan. 1 with a  
Y2K-related computer crash, but Americans should be ready for 
short-term disruptions ranging from higher gas prices to local 
power outages, a Senate panel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With 100 days left before computers run up against the year 2000  
date, federal agencies and the national infrastructure are in solid 
shape, but seven states remain in the ``danger zone'' with less 
than 70 percent of computer systems ready, the Y2K panel said in 
its final report. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is similar in the private sector, with big  
businesses, particularly in the banking and investment industry, 
confident their computers are ready while many smaller businesses 
could run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will not be a horizontal, systematic failure,'' said  
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who heads the Senate panel with Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. Problems ``will not occur across the 
nation. They will occur across the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's committee has held nearly 30 hearings since spring of  
last year on the consequences of the Y2K glitch, in which computers 
programmed to read only the last two digits of a year might mistake 
the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the federal government will have spent some $8  
billion to fix its computers and the nation as a whole anywhere 
from $50 billion to $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	This investment, he said, ``appears to have paid off.'' National  
power grids, phone systems, ATM machines and air travel should work 
fine on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect the four horsemen, armed with flood and  
catastrophe, to be riding in on Jan. 1, 2000,'' said Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the first lawmakers to raise the 
Y2K issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report also warned against complacency. It cited an  
August survey that concluded that seven states -- Alabama, 
California, Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Wyoming 
-- had fixed less than 70 percent of systems affecting such programs 
as child nutrition, food stamps and unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  
Medicaid and Medicare, listed eight states this month as ``high 
risk'' in terms of keeping up with Medicaid child health insurance 
or eligibility claims after Jan. 1. They were Alabama, Alaska, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North 
Dakota and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota officials said the list was based on a March review  
of state procedures. Sheldon Wolf, the state's assistant Medicaid 
director, said HCFA did a second assessment earlier this month and 
the preliminary conclusion was that North Dakota's computer systems 
are at low risk for Year 2000 problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The report gave its top five stars to the financial services  
industry for having the lowest risk of Y2K-related failures, and 
four stars to the utilities and telecommunications sectors. Getting 
its worst two-star ratings were the health care industry and the 
Y2K situation outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	While large-scale hospitals have invested in computer fixes, it  
found a less positive outlook for small inner-city and rural 
hospitals and among the nation's 800,000 doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The report named Russia, China and Italy among the many  
countries that appear to be far behind in fixing computers, raising 
the possibility of economic downturns. Disruptions in oil flows may 
affect gas prices, although the Energy Department believes this 
will not occur. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, the report said the committee was surprised by  
the wastewater industry's low level of readiness. Short-term local 
power or phone outages were possible and computer problems among 
small businesses that lack the money or the technology to fix their 
systems ``could have a ripple effect ... that will affect their 
bigger business partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it warned against overreacting, saying, ``One great area of  
concern is that panic buying and stockpiling of food might result 
in a self-fulfilling prophecy resulting in shortages and 
disruptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you stockpile anything for Y2K, stockpile information''  
about the preparations of local food suppliers, governments and 
utilities, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, President Clinton's chief Y2K adviser, said he  
and the committee were ``pretty much in agreement on where the 
risks are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, he said, is that ``there will be some glitches,  
and nobody is guaranteeing perfection even in the sectors'' where 
much money and technical know-how has been employed.

<HEADLINE> Hawaiian Air Buying 13 Boeing 717s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaiian Airlines said Wednesday it has agreed  
to buy 13 Boeing 717-200 airplanes for $430 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier said the order eventually will replace its entire  
fleet of 15 interisland aircraft, with all of the new planes flying 
by the end of 2001. Hawaiian also has an option to buy seven more 
airplanes before 2005 for an additional $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major investment in the future of the company,''  
Hawaiian president Paul Casey said. ``It underscores our commitment 
to the future of interisland travel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing the current fleet of airplanes will save $200 million  
in cash operating expenses during the first 10 years, with the bulk 
of the savings coming from not having to maintain the current fleet 
of 15 aging, DC-9-50 aircraft manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched as the MD-95 in October 1995, the airplane was renamed  
the Boeing 717-200 after McDonnell Douglas was merged into Boeing 
two years ago. The first of the new models, produced in Long Beach, 
Calif., is scheduled for delivery Thursday to AirTran Airways 
</P>
<P>
	The new planes will be configured by Hawaiian for 123 seats, 10  
fewer than the current planes, but will have more overhead storage 
space, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's 12th-largest carrier will be able to increase  
volume by flying more flights because the new aircraft are more 
efficient and less costly to operate. Hawaiian also expects more 
passengers through code-sharing arrangements with American, 
Northwest and Continental, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Operationally, it's more efficient, way more reliable and it  
brings with it enormous cost savings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By following through on the order, Hawaiian would be the fifth  
airline to order the 717. The Hawaiian Airlines order brings the 
total number of orders for the model to 128, with options taken on 
117 more. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Boeing announced plans to cut more than 600 jobs  
at the Long Beach Division fabrication shop as the company moves 
most of its work from the surburban Los Angeles plant. The 717 
program will remain, while production of the Delta rocket program 
and the C-17 military airlift program will be moved to a yet-to-be 
determined site. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is also shutting down three of its four Long Beach  
production and fabrication lines -- the MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Boeing is the second-largest defense contractor  
after Lockheed Martin Corp.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the sixth straight season, the Dallas  
Cowboys are the nation's favorite NFL team, according to the Harris 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the latest poll, the Cowboys are either the  
favorite or the second-favorite team of 22 percent of those who 
follow professional football. They are followed by the San 
Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers (18 percent each) with the 
Denver Broncos, winners of two straight Super Bowls, fourth with 13 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top ten are Pittsburgh (11 percent); Miami (9);  
Minnesota (8); Washington (7), and Chicago, the New York Giants and 
New England (all 6). 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was based on a telephone survey of 1,008 adults, 541 of  
whom said they follow professional football. In the survey, 53 
percent said they follow the NFL, the fourth straight year the 
figure was over 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Airways, Machinists Reach Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- US Airways and the Machinists union have  
reached a tentative contract agreement covering more than 7,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced by both sides Tuesday comes nearly four  
years after the contract came up for renegotiation and avoids a 
strike that had been scheduled for midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Weintraub, a spokesman for US Airways, headquartered in  
Arlington, Va., refused to comment or provide details about the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists union officials could not be reached Tuesday night  
for comment, but a message announcing the agreement on the 
organization's Web site said officials were ``in the process of 
finalizing the language'' of the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members will work under the existing agreement until a  
ratification vote can be held on the new accord, according to the 
Web site message. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement is subject to the approval of more than 7,000  
airline mechanics, cleaners and other related workers. A previous 
tentative agreement was rejected by union members in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinist members have not had a pay raise since October 1995. A  
main issue in the debate has been job security for less-skilled 
position and what the union sees as a company effort to convert the 
jobs of aircraft cleaners into part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline is engaged in mediation in an effort to reach a new  
contract with 8,300 flight attendants.

<HEADLINE> Ladies Baseball Founder Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A former broker who founded the now defunct  
Ladies Professional Baseball league admitted Wednesday that he 
defrauded investors of $2.8 million to help support his failed 
sports enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ribant, 42, pleaded guilty in federal court to one count  
each of mail fraud and tax evasion. He is expected to be sentenced 
to 30 months in prison during a hearing Dec. 14, said assistant 
U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam. 
</P>
<P>
	Ribant, who is from San Diego, defrauded two dozen investors of  
the $2.8 million between 1993 and 1998 through his now closed 
brokerage firm, Trinity Capital, Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity clients who lost money believed their capital was being  
invested, but Ribant admitted that he used the money for personal 
expenses and some of the costs of the six-team Ladies Professional 
Baseball league, which failed in 1998 because of low fan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The league had teams in Long Beach and San Jose in California,  
and in Phoenix, Buffalo, N.Y., Florida and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors have received at least partial reimbursements of  
their capital from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 
which insures up to $500,000. The agency has paid $1.5 million so 
far and additional payments are expected, Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 13 barred Ribant  
from associating with any broker or dealer in the future.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested in Minister's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISONVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Two people have been arrested in the  
murder of a minister who was found beaten to death and burned on 
his rural property. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the Rev. William B. Petty Jr. was discovered  
Saturday and his car was located Monday about 30 miles away in 
Andrews, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Hass and his wife were arrested outside St. Louis at  
around midnight Tuesday, Richard Brogan, an agent of the Tennessee 
Bureau of Investigation, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were still trying to verify Mrs. Hass' first name.  
Additional details of the arrest were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said Hass was hitchhiking when he was picked up by the  
56-year-old minister, then got into a fight with Petty and killed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hass then drove Petty's car across the state line to North  
Carolina's Cherokee County where he lives, picked up his wife and 
fled, Brogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence Mrs. Hass participated in the murder,  
Brogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty was clubbed on the head with a piece of wood, which was  
then burned with the body and clothing, authorities said. He had to 
be identified from a college class ring. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a lawyer for three decades in Chattanooga before  
recently leaving his profession to become a United Methodist 
minister in charge of five small congregations in Meigs County.

<HEADLINE> GAO: Blood Supply Is Tightening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The blood supply is tightening as donations  
drop, but a prediction of nationwide blood shortages striking next 
year is exaggerated, a congressional report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is cause for concern about shortages of certain  
blood types or in certain regions, the blood supply as a whole is 
not in crisis,'' says the report by the General Accounting Office 
being released at a House Commerce subcommittee hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have become increasingly worried about the adequacy of  
the blood supply, as donations have dropped over the last decade 
while transfusion demand has increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Blood Data Resource Center has predicted that next  
year, Americans will donate just under 11.7 million units of blood, 
while hospitals will need 11.9 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	That prediction came before the Food and Drug Administration's  
recent ban on blood donations by anyone who spent six months or 
more in Britain since 1980, when that country's ``mad cow disease'' 
crisis began. The FDA anticipates that ban will cut the blood 
supply by 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO's investigation says the prediction of a crisis next  
year is overblown. ``The blood supply has declined more slowly'' 
than previous studies suggested, it concluded. Also, blood banks 
``may be able to increase collections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts can disagree on how soon severe shortages could strike,  
but the nation needs to prepare now, responded Marian Sullivan, 
executive director of the National Blood Data Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly action needs to be sooner rather than later,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 8 million Americans donate blood -- just 5 percent of  
eligible donors, the GAO noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortages, usually of Type O or Type B blood, already occur in  
certain regions, particularly around holidays. Almost 9 percent of 
hospitals in a recent survey said they had canceled elective 
surgeries due to blood shortages at least once in 1997 -- the latest 
year data is available. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the ``mad cow'' donation ban promises to hit hardest in  
major cities, home to more affluent blood donors who can afford 
frequent travel, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The GAO's findings give us many reasons to be concerned,''  
said Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who ordered the GAO probe as part 
of his House Commerce Committee's investigation of blood safety and 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The most up-to-date count of donated blood is due in November,  
when Sullivan's center completes a survey of whether the supply 
improved or worsened this year.

<HEADLINE> Molasses Spill Hits Michigan River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) -- A river of molasses began leaking from a  
tank at Monitor Sugar Co. before dawn Wednesday, oozing around the 
plant and dripping into the Saginaw River. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4,000 tons -- the equivalent of 8 million pounds --  
of the thick, gooey liquid escaped, said company spokeswoman Judy 
Bagley. She said the cause of the spill was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews were dumping sawdust onto the spill Wednesday to absorb  
the molasses and make it easier to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured and the molasses posed no public health  
threat, but officials said it could affect wildlife in the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Silfven of the state Department of Environmental Quality  
said specialists were trying to determine how much molasses got 
into a drain leading to the river. He said most of the molasses 
appeared to have pooled on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Molasses is a byproduct of sugar beet refining. The molasses  
sold in stores comes from sugar cane; the beet variety is sometimes 
used in livestock feed.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Airport Reduces Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- In a bid to attract more flights, Hong Kong's  
top airport official announced Wednesday that aircraft landing and 
parking charges would be reduced by 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Fung, chairman of the Airport Authority, said the airport  
would lose as much as $36 million with the move but that 
transferring some airport operation expenses to the government 
would help buffer the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a competitive package aimed to strengthen our position  
as an air hub in the region,'' Fung said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan takes effect Jan. 1, Fung said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lower charges mean that airlines operating from Chek Lap Kok  
airport could expand services and increase passenger traffic to 
Hong Kong, Ronnie Choi of the Board of Airline Representatives said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will give passengers greater choices and flexibility in  
their travel arrangements,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes amid increasingly vociferous complaints from the  
group representing airline interests that Hong Kong is losing out 
on passenger traffic because of high fees at the new $20 billion 
Chek Lap Kok airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials said charges were 34.1 percent higher for  
large planes at Chek Lap Kok airport than they were a year earlier 
at the old Kai Tak international airport. Smaller planes were 
paying 14.7 percent more, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were about double those of Singapore's Changi  
Airport, which slashed its charges 10 percent last year in a bid to 
compete for Asian traffic.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Hog Farmers Can't Save Herds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- The smell of burning coals and rotting  
flesh mixed on Allen McCoy's farm Wednesday as a front-end loader 
scooped up dead hogs -- two or three at a time -- and dumped them 
into an incinerator superheated to more than 1,800 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy, a hog farmer since 1973, tried his best to save much of  
his herd when Hurricane Floyd struck last week. Instead, he's had 
to round up more than 3,000 carcasses and watch them go up in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sweat and blood you're talking about,'' McCoy said.  
``I've lost basically what I've worked for the last 40 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy, who lost more than half a million dollars in animals,  
buildings and equipment, is just one of hundred of farmers across 
eastern North Carolina whose livestock herds and fields were left 
in ruin. The hurricane destroyed the prized breeding operation he 
built with his cousin Phillip. 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide, officials estimate at least 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million  
chickens and 500,000 turkeys drowned. Early estimates of crop and 
farm structural losses totaled $333 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of disease from rotting carcasses led state officials  
to send portable incinerators into counties with the most extensive 
livestock deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	At 30 feet long, 9 feet wide and 9 feet tall, the incinerators  
resemble boxcars filled with flames. Scrap lumber and timber are 
dumped in to feed the fires, which are stoked with the help of 
large blowers blasting like jet engines. 
</P>
<P>
	As the burning went on at McCoy's farm Wednesday, hundreds of  
decomposing hog carcasses lay in a pile a few feet away, their 
snouts buried in the mud. At the water's edge, scores of other dead 
pigs, still pink, appeared as if they were sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very high-quality herd,'' said state veterinary  
officer Jim Kittrell. ``It was an expensive herd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy set out to save his hogs after the hurricane hit last  
Thursday. With floodwaters from the Trent River rising rapidly and 
the road to his hog houses already submerged, he grabbed a chainsaw 
and began cutting a swath through the woods for his tractor. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy worked with friends and neighbors to rescue as many pigs  
as possible from the floodwaters, which turned his farm into a 
17-acre lake. He said some of the starving hogs had to tread water 
for days before they were saved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unreal how well they can swim,'' McCoy said.  
</P>
<P>
	McCoy recalled how Phillip, 65, waded through chest-deep water

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Clinton Travel Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional criticism of President Clinton's  
foreign travel as a waste of taxpayer money is ``ignorant,'' 
Clinton's spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican complaints that Clinton spent more than $72 million  
on three foreign trips last year displays a glib lack of 
understanding of the economic and political payoffs from 
presidential visits, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just no other word for it than ignorant,'' Lockhart  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Larry Craig of Idaho, Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Craig  
Thomas of Wyoming released a General Accounting Office study 
Tuesday that detailed the costs of the three trips to Africa, China 
and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers, cost and personnel involved exceeded by a great  
deal my own expectations,'' said Sessions. ``I think this really is 
excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senators acknowledged, however, that they had no basis for  
comparing Clinton's travel costs with those incurred by previous 
presidents. In asking for the GAO study, they inquired only about 
Clinton's spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said such comparisons aren't relevant.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about is it reasonable to spend $43 million to  
go to Africa,'' he said. ``This idea of relating it to some others, 
I think, is immaterial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Craig did compare the presidents based on time spent  
abroad: Clinton, 186 days during seven years as president; former 
President Reagan, 84 days during eight years, and former President 
Bush, 86 days during four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said Clinton's six-nation trip to Africa from March 22  
through April 2 last year cost $42.8 million, not counting Secret 
Service expenses, salaries of government workers involved and 
agency planning expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 1,302 government employees from 12 federal agencies  
or departments, including 16 members of Congress, accompanied 
Clinton to Africa. The biggest share of the cost, $37.7 million, 
came from the Defense Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Lockhart called criticism of the African trip  
``particularly shortsighted,'' saying the senators ``are trying to 
find a political issue to raise and are missing the point of the 
whole trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president traveled Africa like no U.S. president has  
traveled before, really providing new insights for the American 
public on Africa, and new insights for the African public on 
America and our role,'' Lockhart said. ``It, in time, will be seen 
as a groundbreaking trip in terms of our relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report also found that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton's five-day trip to Chile in April 1998 cost $10.5  
million. It included 592 officials from 13 federal agencies or 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
	--The China trip, from June 25 through July 3 last year, cost  
$18.8 million and included 510 officials from 11 agencies or 
departments.

<HEADLINE>  Johnson Calls His Final Braves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ernie Johnson retired Wednesday after nearly four  
decades as a broadcaster for the Atlanta Braves. This time, he 
means it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson initially stepped down from Turner Broadcasting System  
in 1989, tiring of the heavy travel at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
	But his retirement lasted only until August 1990, when TBS lured  
him back into the booth to do about 25 games a year for 
SportsSouth, a regional cable network now known as Fox Sports Net 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I've had a lot of people say to me, `I thought you  
were retired. Are you going to give back your gifts?''' Johnson, 
75, quipped before his final broadcast, the NL East showdown 
between the Braves and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm ready to hang it up now, I really do,'' he added.  
``It's a great game to go out on, trying to win the pennant and 
playing the New York Mets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Fox Sports Net South's pregame show was  
devoted to Johnson's career. His family -- including his wife of 52 
years, Lois, and their three children -- watched from a private box 
at Turner Field. A small postgame party was planned afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	During the game, Johnson's picture was shown on the scoreboard  
and Braves fans responded with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I'll feel bad after it's over, knowing it's the last  
one,'' Johnson said. ``I'll miss the camaraderie. Lois will 
probably miss (the broadcasts) more than I will. She's my biggest 
fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their retirement plans include trips to spring training, playing  
golf and watching Braves telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Johnson called home games only, except for two  
midseason telecasts in Milwaukee. Johnson pitched for eight years 
with the Boston and Milwaukee Braves, helping the club win the 1957 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring as a player in 1960, Johnson became the team's  
public relations director. Two years later, he joined the Braves' 
radio broadcast team. When the franchise moved to Atlanta in 1966, 
he took over play-by-play duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his broadcasting career, Johnson received some advice  
from another player-turned-broadcaster, Joe Garagiola. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be yourself,'' Garagiola said. ``Don't be anyone but  
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to follow that,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Means Expects To Be Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Natrone Means doesn't expect to be watching  
Sunday's home opener from the sidelines despite injuries the 
Chargers running back suffered last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Means twisted his left ankle and bruised his right knee in San  
Diego's 34-7 win at Cincinnati last Sunday. He had the knee drained 
Monday, when he had a hard time getting around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, man, no comparison whatsoever,'' said Means, who didn't  
practice Wednesday. ``The knee feels a lot better. Right now the 
main thing is getting the ankle ready, get some strength in it and 
get some flexibility back and we'll be ready to roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind I'll be ready.''  
</P>
<P>
	That was good news to coach Mike Riley, who wants to see the  
offense play more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's saying that, because we would miss him badly,''  
Riley said. ``He's gotten a lot better in two days, so we're pretty 
excited about the possibility of him being ready to go by the end 
of the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means is trying to get through an entire season for the first  
time since 1994, when he rushed for a team record 1,350 yards and 
helped the Chargers reach the Super Bowl. He missed the last six 
games of 1998 after breaking a bone in his left foot, and missed 
time the previous three seasons with ankle, thumb and groin 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Means rushed 27 times for 79 yards in the Chargers' opener on  
Sunday and caught two passes for 14 yards, including a 12-yard 
shovel pass from Jim Harbaugh for a touchdown.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Accused of Overcharging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. pharmacies in Florida  
allegedly used cash registers that were automatically programmed to 
ring up extra surcharges totaling more than $100,000 over a 
27-month period, according to a lawsuit filed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering lawsuit filed Wednesday by Florida Attorney  
General Bob Butterworth accuses Rite Aid of intentionally 
overcharging 29,000 uninsured customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid had two prices for the same prescriptions, adding an  
average surcharge of $1.15 per prescription for uninsured 
customers, said Mary Leontakianakos, Butterworth's chief of 
economic crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it, $100,000 doesn't seem like an awful lot  
of money, but a couple of dollars here and there is significant to 
someone who is on Medicaid and living on a fixed income,'' 
Leontakianakos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, in a brief statement, said the suit is without merit  
and that ``not one customer was deceived or defrauded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident we will prevail,'' the Camp Hill, Pa.-based  
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the investigation of Rite Aid covered just over a two-year  
period, Leontakianakos said it appears the practice stretched into 
the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot more,'' Leontakianakos said. ``We looked at a  
snapshot. We looked at a 27-month period. Our information is they 
had been doing this since the late '80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leontakianakos said the Rite Aid policy was likely used in all  
its stores and her office has notified attorneys general in other 
states. She said the company stopped the surcharges three months 
after receiving a subpoena from Butterworth's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pharmacists disapproved of the policy and only added a  
penny extra to the prescription costs. Others quit over the policy, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, had 34  
drugstores in Florida during the period of the allegations. It no 
longer operates in the state, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office is seeking triple damages against  
the chain under racketeering laws and fines of $10,000 or $15,000 
for each violation. The higher fine will be sought in cases when 
elderly customers were charged extra. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also want Rite Aid to return the nearly $100,000 in  
surcharges.

<HEADLINE> Bush Calls for Gun Prosecutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's call for  
stepped-up prosecution of criminals carrying guns is a step in the 
right direction, but he could go further, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after a gunman killed seven people and himself at a Fort  
Worth church, the Republican presidential front-runner said Tuesday 
it is time to ``vigorously'' enforce federal and state laws that 
could make streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some very tough laws against gun violence in Texas,  
and federal law with its mandatory sentences is tough as well,'' 
Bush said. ``Only with tough enforcement can we win the war against 
gun violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Attorney General John Cornyn unveiled a two-year, $1.6  
million program they said could add prison time for using or 
possessing a weapon during a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying it welcomed the initiative, the group Texans  
Against Gun Violence said Bush should do more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call on Governor Bush to prevent as well as prosecute gun  
crime in Texas,'' said Nina Butts, a lobbyist for the group. 
``While prosecution is crucial to curbing gun violence, most 
victims of gun crime would prefer that the criminal never got his 
hands on the gun in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Butts criticized Bush for failing to support a bill in the  
Legislature this spring that would have required background checks 
on buyers at Texas gun shows. Bush said it was a federal issue. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that Bush signed into law a bill to prevent Texas  
cities and counties from suing gun manufacturers for gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also came under fire from Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the  
Democratic National Committee. ``You can't say that you're in favor 
of protecting children and families and siding with law enforcement 
when time and time again you follow the lead of the NRA,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the gun initiative was a reaction to Democratic  
criticism of his gun control policies after the church shooting, 
Bush said, ``That's politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing my job,'' he said. ``The attorney general's doing  
his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor, a gun rights supporter, said, ``If  
law-abiding citizens legally carry a gun, I see no harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program announced Tuesday calls for coordination among  
local, state and federal prosecutors to make certain criminals face 
the stiffest prison sentences possible under state or federal law, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, state law enhances penalties for gun use. In  
other cases, such as those involving felons and drug dealers, a 
criminal can receive an additional five-year prison sentence under 
federal law for gun use or gun possession, said Ted Delisi, a 
spokesman for the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said his office is providing a $1.6 million grant for the  
two-year program, including $1.28 million to pay for eight 
full-time prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant also will pay for advertising to make Texans aware of  
the effort and create a toll-free telephone hotline for reporting 
those suspected of illegally using or possessing guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn said he and Bush have discussed the effort for several  
weeks, patterning it after a program in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said ``we certainly hope'' the new effort might help  
prevent such tragedies as the Fort Worth shootings.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Sues Publishers Clearing House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida's attorney general sued  
Publishers Clearing House on Wednesday, saying the company isn't 
doing enough to change the way it runs its magazine promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit charges that Publishers Clearing House preyed on  
senior citizens by sending personalized mailings with disclaimers 
that were too small to read and letting consumers think they had to 
buy magazines or merchandise to win a prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Months of negotiations with Publishers Clearing House have  
failed to produce any meaningful changes to the deceptive 
solicitations mailed out by the company,'' Florida Attorney General 
Bob Butterworth said. ``The time has come to let the court decide 
this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana, Washington and Wisconsin also  
have sued the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida suit seeks $40 million for Florida consumers plus  
civil penalties against the Port Washington, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth has urged Florida residents not to participate in a  
proposed national settlement, which would cover everyone who bought 
something from the company between 1992 and 1999. A hearing on the 
settlement is scheduled Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Publishers Clearing House said the company has  
been addressing Butterworth's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now contacts people who frequently buy magazine  
subscriptions to make sure they understand they don't have to buy 
something to win a prize, said Christopher Irving, the company's 
director of consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Publishers Clearing House speaks to them on the phone and, if  
they are confused, removes them from our mailing list,'' Irving 
said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Ministers Begin Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Oil ministers from the 11 OPEC countries  
began meeting today to consider maintaining current cuts in oil 
output, despite disagreeing over who should lead the group into the 
new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was widely  
expected to reaffirm its reduced level of production until at least 
next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers would feel the impact of such a decision in the form  
of bigger bills for heating oil and gasoline. That hard fact 
prompted U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, to ask 
President Clinton and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to sell oil 
from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve to help ease surging 
crude prices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC has made cumulative cuts of 4.3 million barrels per day  
over the past two years, in an effort to revive prices that plunged 
to 12-year lows in December. 
</P>
<P>
	There now seems little likelihood that OPEC will boost  
production before early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the tougher statements heard on the subject, Qatar's  
oil minister, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, said Tuesday that OPEC 
should stick to its current level of production until March 2000 
``whatever the consequences.'' His colleagues have made similar 
statements in the days leading up to today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the group's unity showed signs of cracking on a  
different issue, when Iraq unexpectedly named its own candidate for 
a leadership job already contested by both Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-way struggle for the post of OPEC secretary general  
threatened Tuesday to weaken the solidarity that the group has 
taken such pains to build. The current secretary general, Rilwanu 
Lukman of Nigeria, is stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said today  
that Iran and Saudi Arabia will jointly propose that their 
respective candidates serve back-to-back terms of three years each. 
</P>
<P>
	Ardebili is Iran's nominee, while Saudi Arabia wants its own  
OPEC governor, Suleiman Jafir Al-Herbish, to get the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they should be discussing is expanding production because  
the market is overheating and has been for some time,'' said Leo 
Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	At its last meeting in March, OPEC agreed together with major  
non-OPEC producers like Russia and Mexico to curtail daily 
production by 2.1 million barrels, or 2.6 percent of the global 
supply. The agreement extends through March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's ministerial monitoring subcommittee, which met Tuesday,  
backed a plan to keep its current quotas in place ``until at least 
March 2000,'' said its chairman, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar 
Zangeneh. The subcommittee included Lukman and oil ministers from 
Kuwait and Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Zangeneh told reporters that the subcommittee also determined  
that group members were more than 90 percent compliant with output 
cuts in August. Compliance should be even better in September, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's apparent resolve to continue pumping less oil bodes  
poorly for consumers, who already are paying higher prices to drive 
their cars and heat their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prices now in the market are normal,'' Iraq's Oil Minister  
Amer Mohammed Rasheed told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, at  
least 35 percent of the of the world's total. Its discipline in 
curtailing production since its last meeting has caused world 
prices to rise sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``This price (level) is good, we think, for both sides of the  
market,'' Zangeneh said, adding that OPEC needed to see ``a 
considerable drawdown'' in global oil inventories before increasing 
its output. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer disagreed, describing OPEC's apparent refusal to  
increase output as ``nothing less than economic warfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But higher prices also could prove self-defeating for OPEC over  
the longer term, by tempting its members and other producers to 
pump more oil. This could send prices crashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts argued that OPEC will have to boost output before  
next March if it is to prevent prices from becoming too volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some time they're going to have to increase production, and  
it's likely they'll do it before the end of the year,'' said Roger 
Diwan, manager of global oil markets for The Petroleum Finance Co., 
a Washington-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC comprises Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, the United Arab  
Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Indonesia and 
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Buys Into Italy Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- The German airline Lufthansa announced today  
that it was buying a minority stake in a regional airline in Italy, 
a move that would make it the country's largest foreign carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Dolomiti has a fleet of 15 planes and serves 14 airports in  
Italy, mostly in the north. Based in Trieste, it also flies to 
Frankfurt, Munich, Paris and Barcelona. Last year, it operated 
6,500 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, Lufthansa and Air Dolomiti will serve 323 destinations  
and Lufthansa will have more flights in and out of Italy, which is 
dominated by the Italian national airline Alitalia, than any 
foreign airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the Air Dolomiti deal, Italy was one of Lufthansa's  
biggest foreign markets. Its manager for Italy, Gabriel Leupold, 
said Wednesday that Lufthansa will add a new route between Berlin 
and Milan's Malpensa airport this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lufthansa is buying 26 percent of Air Dolomiti, said Lufthansa's  
chief financial officer, Karl-Ludwig Kley. He did not disclose the 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel company Gruppo Leali will control 45 percent of the  
airline and a Friuli regional investment fund will hold 15 percent, 
according to Air Dolomiti chief executive Alcide Leali. Other 
minority shareholders will own 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord marks an expansion in routes, joint-ticketing and  
frequent-flyer programs for Lufthansa's Star alliance, which 
includes Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Ansett Australia, SAS 
Scandinavian Airline, Thai Airways International, United Airlines 
and Varig Brazilian Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Pipe Bomb Shakes Black College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A pipe bomb exploded Wednesday in a  
building at Florida A&AMP;M University, the second blast at the 
historically black school in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported and damage was minor in blasts that  
were accompanied by the warning it was ``just the beginning, 
brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At around the time of Wednesday's explosion, a caller to a  
Tallahassee television station used racial slurs and said the 
students at Florida A&AMP;M didn't need a university. WTXL-TV received 
a second call laced with profanity and racist remarks after the 
bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
	``FAMU has seen the beginning of this ... they got no business  
having a college where there ain't nobody ... smart enough to get a 
degree .... This is just the beginning, brother,'' the station 
quoted the caller as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Aug. 31 blast, a caller told the same station he wanted  
to ``get rid of some of them niggers.'' No one was hurt and there 
was little damage from that blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also received a call Wednesday warning of a bomb in  
another campus building, but a search turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are obvious, commonsense connections you could make,''  
said Byron Price, FBI supervisor in Tallahassee. But he added that 
authorities have no concrete evidence linking the two explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have offered a $10,000 reward for information  
leading to an arrest and conviction in the first bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb that went off Wednesday exploded in a first-floor  
restroom of Perry Paige Hall, which has four floors of 
laboratories, offices, classrooms and the Navy ROTC office. The 
building and several others were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were called off for the day and scheduled to resume  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Eddie Jackson said the school, which has 12,000  
students and 119 buildings on campus, stepped up security after the 
first bomb and will tighten it even more now. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they no longer feel safe on campus.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' Olevia Robinson said. ``The next time someone  
might definitely get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday evening, about 200 students gathered on the university  
library's steps to pray and talk about making the campus safe. 
Students suggested placing cameras around the university and 
notifying all students if a threat has been made on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Student government vice president Derric Heck said he hoped the  
bomber would not succeed in shutting down the campus. ``Let them 
know that our education cannot be stopped,'' Heck said.

<HEADLINE> Angry Cruise Passengers Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMETTO, Fla. (AP) -- Passengers from a cruise ship that was  
disabled by an engine-room fire and left adrift in rough seas 
stepped ashore Wednesday complaining of ``the ship from hell,'' 
with sewage trickling down hallways and people getting seasick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was horrible,'' said David Rizzo of Clearwater. ``I've  
never seen stuff like that in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four tugboats guided the Carnival Cruise Lines ship Tropicale as  
it limped into port on one engine Wednesday with 1,700 passengers 
and crew members. The 660-foot vessel was hit by a fire over the 
weekend and spent two extra days at sea in the Gulf of Mexico as 
Tropical Storm Harvey churned up the waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Handmade signs displayed by passengers read ``Five hour fire no  
H2O in toilet'' and ``Help No Water, No Toilet, No AC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One passenger disembarked with a bottle of dark gray water,  
which he said came from his bathroom tap. Others carried videotapes 
of stopped-up toilets and other problems. Some described panic 
during the fire that disabled the engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hell on this ship,'' said Lake Alfred Mayor Larry  
Clark, who had taken his wife Sarah and 4-year-old grandson, Jacob, 
on the cruise. ``It was not a Fun Ship as they advertise. It was 
the ship from hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said they had to walk around raw sewage in the  
hallways and in their cabins. Water stopped flowing in cabin sinks, 
toilets and showers, though cold water was restored to sinks 
intermittently before the liner docked. 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise line promised all passengers a full refund, a free  
ticket for a future cruise and free flights home. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship left Tampa on Thursday on what was supposed to be a  
four-day cruise with stops at Key West and Cozumel, Mexico. But the 
fire disabled both of the ship's engines Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers got seasick as the tropical storm churned up 12-foot  
seas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was getting sick. They had no provisions at all for  
anybody that was sick,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said seasickness pills were  
distributed throughout the ship. One passenger with a heart 
condition was airlifted from the ship early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher also said cabins had drinking water, air conditioning,  
working toilets and electricity. He said some toilets may have 
malfunctioned for up to two hours, but ``the vast majority of the 
time every passenger on board had working toilets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said they got little direction from the crew during  
the engine-room fire, and passenger Nick Dimitri of Tampa said 
elderly and disabled people were pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``People started running by with their life jackets,'' Rizzo  
said. ``People were running around like maniacs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Coast Guard investigators were flown to the ship Tuesday.  
Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz said the ship was last inspected in 
October 1998 but Gallagher said it passed a quarterly inspection in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival's 2,600-passenger Ecstasy was disabled in July 1998 by  
a $15 million fire that took four hours to control. Meanwhile, the 
Tropicale will not make its next scheduled run for Saturday, 
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Pleas in NYC Divorce Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Over the course of their ugly three-year  
divorce, billionaire businessman Ronald Perelman and millionaire 
political fund-raiser Patricia Duff have squandered more than $4 
million on legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	If only they had known.  
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan's chief matrimonial clerk has acknowledged taking  
bribes as tiny as $10 to expedite divorce cases -- perhaps as many 
as 2,000 of them since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Perelman-Duff case, these divorces were uncontested.  
But the clerk's guilty plea last week has raised questions about 
the validity of the splits involved and the possibility that some 
people unwittingly went on to commit bigamy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of bizarre. Common sense tells you that some of  
those people have remarried,'' celebrity divorce lawyer Raoul 
Felder said Wednesday. ``They're people who are technical 
bigamists, but they're really victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, the bribes -- ranging from $10 to  
several hundred dollars -- were paid to speed up the divorce 
process. Rather than waiting the usual two to six weeks, the bribes 
assured delivery of a divorce decree in less than 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Singer, 50, who earned nearly $83,000 a year as  
Manhattan's chief matrimonial clerk, pleaded guilty Friday to three 
charges of taking bribes. He faces seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, a court employee for 28 years, admitted that he took  
money from lawyers and divorce mills -- clerical services that 
handle divorce paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	He never verified the papers' authenticity. Prosecutors said  
some of the papers were fraudulent, with husbands forging their 
wives' signatures on settlements that required minimal child 
support payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began when a woman called the Manhattan  
matrimonial office to complain that she was served with an 
uncontested divorce agreement that she never approved. 
</P>
<P>
	A sting operation ensued. Using the names of turn-of-the-century  
prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office, 
investigators quickly secured four divorces and moved in on the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe could involve as many as 20 more people, prosecutors  
said. Singer and the operator of a Queens divorce mill have pleaded 
guilty, and two more attorneys and another court clerk were 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the scam is exposed, partners who were duped by their  
spouses could find a surprise payday, said attorney Louis Newman, 
head of the matrimonial division at Kurzman, Karelsen &AMP; Frank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ex-spouse might now feel there's leverage, and might say,  
`This is going to cost you a little extra, my dear,''' Newman said. 
``Leverage is everything in life.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Swann Doubtful for 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals coach Vince Tobin is  
downplaying the significance of the decision to list defensive 
tackle Eric Swann as doubtful for Monday night's game against the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time the two-time Pro Bowl performer has been  
listed as anything other than out, since the seventh game of last 
season, because of knee surgery. Since then, Swann has undergone 
two operations on his arthritic right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said Swann has yet to be receive the go-ahead to play by  
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't been cleared for a game yet, but this is Wednesday  
and we'll see what happens,'' Tobin said. ``He would have to be 
cleared before he would be declared eligible to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann, who has talked to reporters only once this season, wasn't  
talking again Wednesday. Two weeks ago, he said he expected to be 
ready in six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said the Cardinals are approaching the situation  
cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's getting closer,'' Tobin said. ``To say he's  
getting close, I don't know that, because we haven't done anything 
with him in pads yet. He is cleared to play a few snaps this week 
in pads, but we'll take it very, very slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann was dissatisfied with the surgery preformed by the  
Cardinals' doctor and went to noted knee surgeon Dr. Richard 
Steadman for a more unorthodox surgery that requires more recovery 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery has taken longer than the Cardinals or Swann  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said Swann is anxious to  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been chomping at the bit,'' McGinnis said. ``He keeps  
asking to do more, more, more.''

<HEADLINE> Ky. Workers Told Uranium Was Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Workers at a uranium plant in Kentucky told  
lawmakers Wednesday that for years, managers withheld from them 
that they were being exposed to plutonium, telling them the uranium 
powder that contained traces of the dangerous metal was ``safe 
enough to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just stunned,'' Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said after  
hearing several employees describe working conditions at the 
Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in western Kentucky during much of 
the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce oversight and investigation subcommittee,  
chaired by Upton, was examining allegations of widespread health, 
safety and environmental violations at the Energy Department plant, 
which has processed enriched uranium for use in nuclear weapons and 
commercial reactors since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Energy Department investigation concluded that while  
some improvements still need to be made, there is no imminent 
danger to plant workers today. 
</P>
<P>
	But in graphic testimony, Garland ``Bud'' Jenkins described how  
he had worked at the uranium dust-filled plant for 30 years under 
private contractors and was never told some of the uranium had been 
laced with highly dangerous plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We constantly inhaled the dust and fumes. There were no  
devices to measure radioactivity in the air,'' said Jenkins. He 
said workers would wear contaminated clothing home and even after 
taking showers some mornings their bed linens ``would be green or 
black from the black oxide and greensalt'' of the uranium powder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told that the uranium substances we were working with  
were safe and posed no threat to our health, or to the health of 
our families,'' continued Jenkins. ``We were even told the 
materials were safe enough to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radiation concerns and violations continued into the 1990s, and  
some continues today, the lawmakers were told. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Fowler, who was hired in 1991 as a health physicist at  
the plant, said he repeatedly was rebuffed when he raised concern 
about workers' contamination and even today has been targeted for 
harassment and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was bucking a management culture that had told workers for  
decades that there were no health hazards at Paducah,'' said 
Fowler. He said health and safety infractions continue to occur at 
the plant, despite denials by plant managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler, who has filed a whistleblower complaint charging  
harassment, said radiation monitoring at the plant continues to be 
haphazard. Three weeks ago a computer that was supposed to be 
donated to a school was found by chance to have substantial 
radiation contamination, said Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	David Michaels, the Energy Department's assistant secretary for  
environment, safety and health, said the department ``takes the 
concerns that have been raised seriously and is committed to 
investigating and resolving them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson last week said he will ask  
Congress to compensate thousands of workers who became ill from 
radiation at the Paducah plant. The compensation, which may be 
expanded to two other similar plants if problems are confirmed 
there, may cost up to $20 million, officials have estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1952 to produce enriched uranium, the Paducah plant has  
been managed by a number of private contractors. Martin Marietta 
Energy Systems managed the plant for the Energy Department for 
years before the plant was transferred from the government to the 
U.S. Enrichment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	USEC, a quasi-government corporation, took over in 1993 and  
hired a Martin Marietta (later Lockheed Martin) subsidiary to 
continue plant management and environmental cleanup. Last year, 
Bechtel Jacobs Co., took over the environmental restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
	James Miller, executive vice president of USEC Inc., said some  
$220 million in government funds has been spent for nuclear safety 
upgrades at the plant. He said the improvements have 
``significantly reduced workers' potential exposure to radioactive 
material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ``has found that our program  
adequately protects workers and the public'' from radiation, Miller 
told the subcommittee. ``Procedures and training are in place to 
ensure proper protection of individuals entering radiological 
areas.''

<HEADLINE> Xerox To Acquire Tektronix Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. will buy the color printing  
division of Tektronix Inc. for $950 million in a deal that will 
make Xerox second only to Hewlett-Packard in the office color 
printing market. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Wednesday, will give Xerox the Tektronix  
line of Phaser color laser and solid ink printers, which last year 
logged nearly $725 million in sales. Xerox's distribution capacity 
will nearly double to more than 16,000 resellers and dealers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tektronix currently holds the second-largest share of the office  
color printing market. Once the acquisition is completed, Xerox 
will take over the No. 2 spot, with more than 30 percent of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash acquisition, which would be the largest technology  
acquisition ever for Xerox, is expected to close within 60 days. 
The deal is subject to regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us an extraordinarily strong hand in one of the most  
exciting technology marketplaces, which is the emerging space for 
color in the office,'' said Xerox President and Chief Executive 
Officer Rick Thoman. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Tektronix stock initially shot up 9 percent before  
giving up its early gains on the New York Stock Exchange. In 
trading, Tektronix shares rose $1.31 1/4, or 3.8 percent, to $36.18 3/4. 
Xerox shares rose 56 1/4 cents to $42.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox, traditionally a high-end copier company, in the last few  
years has made a move to become a major player in the home office 
and small business environment, through low-end retail channels 
such as Staples and Office Max. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the acquisition of Tektronix is a logical  
outgrowth of that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they wanted to gain some major share, Tektronix is the one  
they would have gone after. ...It is definitely a good move for 
Xerox and it just further strengthens them against 
Hewlett-Packard,'' said Alyson Frasco, an industry analyst with 
International Data Corp., a market research firm based in 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	According to IDC's research, as of the first half of the year,  
Hewlett-Packard held about 45 percent of the U.S. office color 
printing market, which includes desktop color laser and solid ink 
technology. Tektronix currently holds about 30 percent, while Xerox 
holds 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tektronix Inc., based in Wilsonville, Ore., has a portfolio of  
measurement, color printing and video and networking businesses. 
The company had revenues of approximately $1.9 billion in its last 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's printing division has approximately 2,400  
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry J. Meyer, chairman and chief executive of Tektronix, said  
the company expects to eliminate the jobs of up to 200 employees 
within the next six months as a result of the acquisition. He said 
most of the job cuts will be made in Wilsonville, although some 
will come from other offices around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman said Xerox expected ``relatively little'' in the way of  
job elimination at Xerox. ``We think this is really about growth,'' 
said Thoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Xerox will acquire Tektronix proprietary  
technology known as ``solid ink,'' a process Meyer said achieves a 
photo-quality print by loading a color crayon-like substance into a 
printer, then changing its phase from solid to liquid and then 
again to solid when it hits the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tektronix printer operations will remain in Wilsonville.  
Employees of the color printer division will become employees of 
Xerox. Gerry Perkel, currently president of Tektronix' Color 
Printing and Imaging Division, will join the Xerox Channels Group 
as president of the Office Printing Business. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Tektronix announced plans to form separate  
companies for its measurement and color printing businesses, and 
has subsequently announced the sale of its video business.

<HEADLINE> Princeton Professor Sparks Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- More than 250 demonstrators protested the  
first day of classes of a Princeton University professor who says 
parents should have the right to euthanize newborns with severe 
handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters -- including about 60 people in wheelchairs --  
surrounded the school's administration building. Fourteen people 
were arrested when they refused to stop blocking the entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who guarded the classroom where bioethics professor Peter  
Singer was teaching said they will continue to do so as long as 
they feel it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	In his recent books, Singer has said children less than one  
month old have no human consciousness and do not have the same 
rights as others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to  
killing a person,'' he has written. ``Sometimes it is not wrong at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Tasy, of the anti-abortion group Right to Life, said  
Singer's views -- and their extreme interpretations -- prey on the 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human history has shown us where this type of thinking can  
lead,'' she said. ``If Professor Singer's views do not go 
unchallenged, there is a possibility that they could be adopted by 
health insurance companies, who are always looking to save 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, a Princeton  
alumnus who also serves on the university's Board of Trustees, said 
Tuesday he will withhold any donations to the school as long as 
Singer teaches there. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, whose daughter is a Princeton junior, said in an open  
letter that Singer's elevation to an endowed professorship ``deeply 
troubles me, just as it would if such an honor were bestowed upon 
an anti-Semite or a racist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickets equated Singer with Adolf Hitler and chanted ``Princeton  
promotes murder of people with disabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, 53, declined an interview request by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Bioethicist Paul Armstrong, the attorney who successfully argued  
for the right to die in the landmark Karen Ann Quinlan case, said 
he disagrees with many of Singer's ideas, but welcomed him to the 
bioethics debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peter's strength is making us rethink our first, fundamental  
ideas,'' Armstrong said. ``His weakness is trying to translate that 
into public policy.''

<HEADLINE> MCI Upgrades Nasdaq Trade Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- MCI WorldCom has fully implemented an  
electronic trading network for Nasdaq Stock Market that will enable 
it to handle up to 4 billion shares traded per day, the companies 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system, which will be maintained by MCI, more than  
doubles the speed and capacity of Nasdaq's previous electronic 
trading network. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgraded network can handle up to 4 billion shares traded  
per day, and can be scaled up to accommodate an 8 billion share 
day, they said. Nasdaq has averaged 985 million shares traded per 
day in 1999, with a peak of 1.4 billion shares traded on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the new network enables subscribers to  
receive a message simultaneously after a broker enters it and 
guarantees delivery of time-sensitive data. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI signed a $600 million contract in November of 1997, to  
replace Nasdaq's existing electronic trading network, also designed 
by MCI.

<HEADLINE> 93 in Mexican Drug Cartel Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and local drug-enforcement officers  
have arrested 93 suspects in a sweeping crackdown that one official 
said Wednesday had dismantled ``from top to bottom'' the operations 
of notorious late drug trafficker Amado Carillo Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests over the past 18 months resulted from an  
investigation into one of the largest drug cartels in Mexico. The 
cartel is believed to have funneled tons of Colombian cocaine 
through Mexico into major U.S. cities, including New York, Los 
Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, Atlanta, Philadelphia and 
Houston, and from there throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, dubbed ``Operation Impunity,'' targeted  
alleged ``cell heads'' running the drug operation after the death 
of Carillo, who was known as the ``Lord of the Skies'' because of 
his use of large aircraft to transport drugs. Carillo was 
considered Mexico's No. 1 drug lord until he died in July 1997 
while recovering from plastic surgery designed to help him evade 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have substantially hindered their ability to move cocaine  
and other drugs into, and around, this country,'' said Attorney 
General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we have taken another step forward in making our  
streets safer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While authorities were careful to point out that drug players  
and operations are usually replaced, Donnie Marshall, acting 
administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said: ``We 
effectively dismantled this operation from top to bottom ... right 
down to their local distribution networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This operation was undertaken to prove that traffickers in  
Mexico and the United States no longer operate with impunity,'' 
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was conducted by the DEA along with the FBI  
and the U.S. Customs Service and scores of local police departments 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	It also had the cooperation of the Mexican government, a stark  
contrast to last year when Mexican officials were incensed at a 
U.S. sting operation that snared some 160 people suspected of 
laundering drug profits, including two dozen Mexican bank 
executives who had been lured to the United States and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican officials at that time objected to the use of U.S.  
undercover agents in Mexico without the government's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar told  
reporters, ``We were completely involved in this operation in the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, shortly after the U.S. announcement, authorities said  
they had been informed that the Mexican government on Wednesday had 
arrested one suspect indicted in this country -- Jaime 
Aguilar-Gastelum. He was arrested in Reynosa, Mexico, the DEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they had to overcome sophisticated criminals  
who hid drugs in crates of cilantro or watermelons and used 
sophisticated telephone systems to disguise calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an example of creative law enforcement overcoming  
creative criminals,'' said Raymond W. Kelly, Commissioner of the 
U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the arrests were in the United States, but two suspects  
are in custody in the Dominican Republic. The key lieutenant of the 
organization, Gilberto Salinas-Doria -- a former Donna, Texas police 
officer -- was already in Mexican custody on unrelated charges, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have asked for Mexican assistance in locating  
another suspect indicted in this country -- Victor Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
	The three main ``cell heads,'' believed responsible for  
directing the Carillo cartel's operations in U.S. cities, were 
arrested in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Arturo Arredondo allegedly had overall responsibility for U.S.  
transportation and distribution of the organization's drugs and is 
the highest-ranking trafficker of the U.S. operations. Also 
arrested were Jesse Quintanilla, who was responsible for the 
Chicago operations and Jorge Ontiveros-Rodriguez, who oversaw San 
Diego cocaine distribution, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said arrests were made in 15 U.S. cities: Atlanta;  
Chicago; Detroit; Houston; Los Angeles; McAllen, Texas; Miami; 
Nashville, Tenn.; Newark, N.J.; New York; Philadelphia; Raleigh, 
N.C.; San Antonio; San Diego; Tulsa, Okla. Additional arrests are 
expected, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cash and other assets, agents seized about 5,500  
pounds of cocaine and 4,800 pounds of marijuana. Authorities could 
not put a dollar value on the drugs seized.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Morandini Suspended Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs second baseman Mickey Morandini was  
suspended two games and fined an undisclosed amount Wednesday by 
the National League for ``overly aggressive behavior'' toward an 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension is supposed to start with Thursday's game against  
the Pittsburgh Pirates, but Morandini can appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Morandini and Cubs first base coach Dan Radison were both  
ejected in the seventh inning of a game against Milwaukee on Sept. 
17 for arguing a questionable out call at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Morandini appeared to beat catcher Brian Banks' throw, but first  
base umpire Greg Gibson said he was out. Morandini then ran toward 
Gibson to argue the call and Radison tried to intercede before they 
were both tossed.

<HEADLINE> Fed Finds Moderate-to-Brisk Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy is growing strongly as  
manufacturers continue to rebound and consumer spending fuels brisk 
retail sales, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a new survey of 
business conditions around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``moderate-to-brisk rates of growth,'' however, are  
contributing to widespread labor shortages, the Fed said in the 
survey, which is based on reports from its 12 regional banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey noted ``few reports of acceleration in nominal wages  
and salaries'' even as companies find it difficult to hire 
qualified workers for job openings in the current ``tight'' labor 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey did point out that some areas reported ``a  
substantial upswing in the cost of health-care benefits'' while 
consumer prices continue to be stable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report continues to paint a picture of an economy that is  
expanding strongly but with still tame inflation,'' said Mark 
Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, known as the ``beige book'' for the color of its  
cover, will be used when Fed policy-makers meet Oct. 5 to review 
the central bank's stance on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are split over whether the Fed will boost rates a  
third time at its October meeting in an effort to slow economic 
growth and keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	The beige book, which was based on information collected before  
Sept. 13, offered ammunition for both sides. The survey reported 
strong growth and tight labor markets, but it also said inflation 
generally remains subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some economists did not believe the Fed survey was the  
definitive piece of economic information. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic message of the report was expected: the economy has  
a lot of momentum,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist with First 
Union. ``I don't think this report changes anything for the Fed and 
the odds are that the Fed won't raise rates in October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``would argue that the Fed remain predisposed to  
tightening but it doesn't necessarily mean the Fed will make a 
tightening move at its next meeting,'' Zandi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing activity had accelerated in almost every district,  
with the Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis Fed districts reporting 
solid demand for steel and other metal products, particularly for 
the auto industry, the Fed survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston, Dallas and Minneapolis districts noted strong demand  
for semiconductors and computer components while the San Francisco 
district said demand from markets in East Asia, the area hardest 
hit by the global currency crisis, was beginning to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the production of apparel appears to be down across the  
board, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the retail front, many areas reported strong back-to-school  
sales and even stronger demand for new autos. Most areas reported 
that retail sales were up from their level last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In most areas, home sales remain high but some slowing has  
occurred recently in both sales and construction, reflecting rising 
mortgage rates and rising building costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agriculture sector, the recent drought had worsened crop  
and livestock conditions in the East and parts of the Midwest, the 
survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago, Cleveland, Richmond and St. Louis districts rated  
corn and soybean crops as in poor to fair condition. The San 
Francisco district said adverse weather had lowered the quality and 
yield of many grain, fruit and vegetable crops. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis reported  
favorable agriculture conditions with corn and soybean crops rated 
as good to excellent with above average yields.

<HEADLINE> Bears' Jaeger Says He's Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Chicago Bears kicker Jeff Jaeger said  
Wednesday he is ``90 percent'' recovered from a hip injury and 
should be ready to play at Oakland on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bears coach Dick Jauron isn't quite as optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``His problem, if he has one, is he doesn't feel he can swing  
fully at the ball,'' said Jauron. ``Now, he's saying he'll feel 
very comfortable doing that by the end of the week. If he says 
that, we'll go with Jeff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaeger, who played for the Raiders from 1989 to 1995, hurt his  
left hip during the first week of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears settled on rookie Brian Gowins to take Jaeger's spot.  
But Gowins was cut for the third time this season Monday after 
missing a 50-yard field goal and a potential game-winning 48-yarder 
in Sunday's 14-13 loss to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to go out and beat 'em,'' Jaeger said. ``I  
don't think I was ready last week, but I feel like I am now. As of 
right now, I'm feeling pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left tackle Blake Brockermeyer will sit out Sunday's game after  
doctors Wednesday diagnosed him with an atypical migraine. 
</P>
<P>
	All tests since Sunday's game, including an MRI Wednesday on his  
neck, have come back negative, the Bears said. Doctors will 
reevaluate him next week.

<HEADLINE> Seafood Co. Settles Suit for $1.25M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A seafood company has agreed to pay $1.25 million  
to Vietnamese boat workers who complained of racial discrimination 
and inhumane treatment after they got the flu aboard a fishing 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement involving American Seafoods was announced  
Wednesday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency Chairwoman Ida Castro said the case involved ``egregious  
types of discrimination,'' with Vietnamese Americans singled out 
because of their nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president Mike Hyde said that suggesting the 18  
plaintiffs were treated badly because of their national origin ``is 
just a preposterous allegation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I concluded we did have significant liabilities related to  
their illness claims,'' he said. ``I also concluded we did not have 
any liability related to their discrimination claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement calls for American Seafoods to conduct training  
on its discrimination policies and procedures, and provide 
quarterly compliance reports to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs sued after catching the flu while aboard one of  
the company's ships off Alaska in February 1998. They said American 
Seafoods failed to provide them with treatment and adequate time 
off work for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers said the company created a hostile work environment,  
denied them training and promotional opportunities, subjected them 
to poor working conditions, demoted them and terminated those who 
sought time off due to illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said none of the plaintiffs had ever asked for promotion.  
</P>
<P>
	``Processing crews throughout the industry are predominantly  
composed of minorities. They're the backbone of our operation,'' he 
said. ``The only people discriminated against on our boat are 
people who don't work hard.''

<HEADLINE>  Golota Expecting To Fight Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Grant got some good news from Andrew  
Golota on Wednesday concerning their Nov. 20 fight between 
heavyweight contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my side, I think the fight is going to be clean, you  
know, nothing like my other fights,'' Golota, a native of Poland 
living a Chicago, said of the 12-round bout at Trump Taj Mahal in 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Golota (34-3, 28 knockouts) is best known for two of his losses.  
He was disqualified twice for fouling Riddick Bowe -- in the seventh 
round July 11, 1996, at New York and in the ninth round Dec. 14, 
1996, at Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, however, wasn't around to hear Golota's declaration since  
he was more than an hour late for the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Grant -- he arrives on time for the fight,'' Golota  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant (30-0, 21 knockouts), of Norristown, Pa., said that after  
he arrived by train from Philadelphia he was unable to find the 
limousine that was supposed to pick him up at Penn Station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to apologize,'' Grant said. ``I got a taxi and I gave  
him $20 and told him, `Get me there.' And you know it doesn't cost 
$20 to get here from Penn Station (about 27 blocks).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it can cost more -- depending on the driver, traffic  
and gullibility of the passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted this fight,'' Grant said. ``I'm happy about this  
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will be in line for a heavyweight title shot. WBC  
champion Lennox Lewis of Britain and WBA-IBF champion Evander 
Holyfield, who boxed a controversial draw March 13 at New York, 
will fight a rematch Nov. 13 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Grant's advisers is Jim Thomas, who is Holyfield's  
lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Senators Skirmish Over Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking turns blocking the other party,  
senators are getting nowhere on a Democratic attempt to raise the 
minimum wage and on several judicial nominations while delaying a 
final vote on a bill overhauling bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats blocked action Tuesday on the bankruptcy bill and the  
nomination of a federal judge for Utah, and Republicans responded 
by blocking final votes on President Clinton's choices for a 
California-based appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's at their wit's end as to what to do,'' Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif., complained in the midst of the votes. She 
helped lead the charge to block the Utah nomination, saying the 
California appointees have been waiting for years and deserve 
Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart today cheered the Democrats'  
action, saying the Senate should move forward on all judicial 
nominees and not extend ``preferential treatment for one candidate 
that they have a particular interest in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We at the White House want to work through this impasse  
expeditiously and hope the Senate will provide for a vote on all 
our nominees,'' Lockhart said. ``People have been waiting as long 
as four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the bankruptcy bill, Democrats derailed action in an attempt  
to have debate and a vote on an amendment to increase the minimum 
wage by $1 over two years. Republicans said they were willing to 
debate the minimum wage measure, but said Democrats also wanted 
votes on unrelated issues such as farm programs and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 53-45, with one senator voting present, seven short  
of the 60 votes needed to move the measure toward passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Democrats blocked efforts to force a speedy vote  
on Ted Stewart, a nominee to become a federal judge in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is backed by Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who  
chairs the Judiciary Committee. Democrats complained that while 
Republicans were eager to vote on Stewart, they were unwilling to 
vote on several other Clinton nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	So Democrats held ranks and the Senate voted 55-44, five votes  
short of the needed 60, to hold a final vote on Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a rare move, Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South  
Dakota sought to force a vote on two judicial nominees, District 
Judge Richard Paez and an attorney, Marsha Berzon, both of whom 
have been named to the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Republicans' turn to block action, and they did so.  
</P>
<P>
	Daschle accused Republicans of seeking to choke off debate on  
the bankruptcy bill prematurely. He also said that dozens of 
Clinton's judicial nominations are awaiting action, including Paez, 
who was appointed more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have these votes,'' Daschle said. ``We've got to  
confirm these nominees. We've got to have a bankruptcy bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of breaking through the procedural morass, and  
I'm going to break through it,'' countered Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the skirmishing, all three nominations and the  
bankruptcy bill are still alive.

<HEADLINE> Moss Hopes Vikes Can Start Rolling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randy Moss swears he's not dwelling  
on his coming out party last year at Lambeau Field. But what better 
stage for the Minnesota Vikings to regain their confidence? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the memories are always going to be there,'' Moss said  
Wednesday. ``But as far as motivating myself to go out and try to 
do the same thing as last year, I don't want to try to reminisce on 
that because I think that will probably get me away from my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 5 last year, Randall Cunningham threw for 442 yards and  
four TDs, two of them to Moss, in the Vikings' 37-24 victory over 
the Packers. The loss ended Green Bay's 25-game home winning streak 
and signaled a shift in the NFC's power structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of reminded me of when I was at Southern Miss and we  
played teams like Florida State and Alabama and Texas A&AMP;M in that I 
knew we couldn't stop them,'' Packers quarterback Brett Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his stunning 75-yard TD catch was negated by a holding  
call that night, Moss caught five passes for 190 yards and two long 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, both teams were 4-0 and seeking the upper hand in the  
division race. This time, both are 1-1 and feel fortunate, at that. 
</P>
<P>
	This game is more about survival than swagger.  
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who caught 17 touchdown passes last year, including ones  
covering 52, 44 and 49 yards against Green Bay, has yet to see the 
end zone this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss said the Vikings need a breakout like last year's at  
Lambeau. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we're close to one,'' Moss said. ``Hopefully,  
we are. I think we need one to show ourselves, not anybody outside 
the Minnesota Vikings, that we're ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss has been blanketed by double- and triple-coverage.  
Cunningham's Pro Bowl-studded offensive line hasn't given him much 
time to hit his other targets. And Robert Smith is averaging a 
paltry 2.6 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're doubling, tripling me, we've just got to find a  
way to make it happen,'' Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said he'll get rid of the ball faster, but that could  
further hamper the downfield passing game that led to 10 TDs of 
40-plus yards for Moss a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Moss, the Packers chose defensive backs Antuan  
Edwards, Fred Vinson and Mike McKenzie with their first three draft 
picks and said good-bye to old-timers Pat Terrell, Rod Smith and 
Mike Prior. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you,'' Moss said, ``I didn't really pay too  
much attention to the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Vikings got pass-rusher Dimitrius Underwood, who  
went AWOL after one practice, eventually leading Minnesota to bring 
Chris Doleman, who will be 38 next month, out of retirement this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings also brought back linebacker Corey Miller on  
Wednesday and cut ties with defensive backs Antonio Banks and Kevin 
Divine and fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it did send a powerful message and opened a lot of  
eyes this morning, guys coming in moping around still with sleep in 
their eyes,'' Moss said. ``And Coach Green just got right to the 
point and let guys know he wasn't playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players had a jump in their step at Wednesday's workout. And  
Moss said there's a feeling of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two games we haven't really been in sync,'' he said.  
``So I think we will be pumped to see if we can get back on that 
path of being dominant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just look forward to seeing Lambeau again.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Deciding Supremacist's Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A jury on Wednesday weighed the  
life-or-death fate of a white supremacist who bragged that the 
dragging death of a black man had made him and his buddies ``bigger 
stars'' than O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel deliberated for 11 hours before recessing until  
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing testimony over eight days, the panel had two  
options for Lawrence Russell Brewer: life in prison or death. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's former prison pal, John William King, 24, already is on  
death row, convicted and condemned in February for the murder of 
James Byrd Jr. A third man, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, is set to be 
tried next month. Prosecutors also will seek the death penalty in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
	The same jury considering Brewer's punishment on Monday  
convicted the 32-year-old parolee, the ``exalted cyclops'' of his 
Ku Klux Klan splinter group, of capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, Byrd, a former vacuum cleaner salesman from the  
east Texas timber town of Jasper, was harnessed by the ankles with 
a 24 1/2-foot logging chain to the bumper of a pickup truck and 
dragged for three miles along a rutted logging path and bumpy 
asphalt road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances of this case, obviously there is a  
serious need to protect future victims from this man,'' Jasper 
County District Attorney Guy James Gray told the jury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorneys said the evidence did not support a death  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Society is going to be adequately protected'' by a life term,  
attorney Doug Barlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	After they were arrested, Brewer wrote letters to King saying he  
had become a ``hero'' and preferred execution, which he said would 
be ``a little old sleeping medicine,'' to a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at O.J.,'' Brewer wrote in one note. ``I do believe we  
are bigger stars, or should I say hero of the day, than what we 
ever expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorneys characterized the writings as mere bragging  
to impress other inmates.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Ad Prices Said Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of admission to the Super Bowl  
telecast appears to be rising a whopping 25 percent to a record $2 
million for a 30-second commercial, advertising buyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC officials declined comment Tuesday on how much they were  
getting for Super Bowl ad time in the telecast set for Jan. 30 or 
how much commercial time remains unsold. 
</P>
<P>
	But two top advertising executives who buy network commercial  
time for advertisers said that ABC appears to be getting top 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC has been getting in excess of $2 million and only has a  
handful of units left,'' said Bob Flood, who oversees network ad 
purchases for customers of the ad buying service DeWitt Media. 
</P>
<P>
	If the average price winds up at $2 million, it would be the  
highest average ever for commercials in a TV program and would 
easily eclipse the old Super Bowl record of $1.6 million set last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reports have put the all-time commercial price record at  
$1.7 million for the finale of the comedy series ``Seinfeld'' in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl telecast typically attracts the biggest TV  
audience of the year and it has become a showcase for advertising 
as well, allowing the network that carries it to charge seemingly 
endlessly escalating prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Flood said demand for Super Bowl time remains strong even though  
the rating for this past January's NFL finale was down 9 percent 
from the previous year and was the lowest rated Super Bowl in nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few of these platform events that offer the  
opportunity to reach the masses in a concise period,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the game also offers ``the cachet of being  
associated with other blue-chip advertisers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flood said Super Bowl ad demand has gotten a lift from Internet  
companies eager to get quick and widespread recognition and movie 
companies who want to attract big audiences for their new releases. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Croasdale, a top buyer of network TV for clients of Western  
International Media, said he heard one Internet company had agreed 
to pay $2.5 million for a 30-second Super Bowl spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overal ad economy is so strong that this is what people  
are stepping up to pay to get into shows,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Forces Monastery Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUCIA, Calif. (AP) -- Benedictine monks who bake fruitcakes to  
support their monastery were among the hundreds forced to flee 
wildfires that raced up the coastal mountains of Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight monks remained behind Tuesday to help firefighters save  
their monastery high above the Pacific. The New Camadoli Hermitage, 
which is reachable only by a narrow, twisting road, offers stunning 
views of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The winds were calm Tuesday evening, but given Big Sur's  
often-changing winds, firefighters said the blazes could climb a 
ridge and sweep down onto the property within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it comes up nice and slow, things will be cool. If it comes  
up in a firestorm, then things could get interesting,'' said Irene 
Kahn, a volunteer with the Big Sur Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A small amount of rain fell Tuesday and more was forecast for  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the monks who stayed behind were cutting brush, said the  
Rev. Romuald Duscher, acting superior for the 32 monks. He said 
felt he had to stay, especially since some of the monastery's monks 
are elderly and didn't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our home. Also, we feel we can help,'' Duscher said.  
</P>
<P>
	The monks, whose monastery is perched 1,300 feet above the  
Pacific about 140 miles south of San Francisco, support a 
contemplative life by selling fruitcakes and date-nut cakes over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The monastery also caters to tourists seeking a refuge from the  
wired world, and is so popular that reservations have to be made 
months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the evacuees, Allison Howard, 33, had planned to spend a  
week at the monastery and was forced to flee after just one night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be there. It's so peaceful and wonderful,'' said  
Ms. Howard, who had hoped for a respite from what she described as 
a stressful life in Los Angeles, where she studies acupuncture and 
herbal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning-caused fires have burned more than 78,000 acres in  
Northern California's forests in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooler weather Tuesday helped in the fight against the fires in  
the Big Sur area, but conditions were difficult in the Trinity Alps 
Wilderness Area in far Northern California, where the nation's 
largest active fire -- more than 50,000 acres -- was spreading toward 
the Six Rivers and Klamath National Forests. 
</P>
<P>
	In Big Sur's Los Padres National Forest, more than 30,453 acres  
of oak trees, sage, chaparral and other brush had burned by Tuesday 
evening.

<HEADLINE> 2-Year-Old Colt Bevo Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bevo, a top 2-year-old, had surgery to remove a  
bone chip in his left knee and not only will he be out the rest of 
year, but his status was in doubt for next year's Triple Crown 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt was hurt while scoring an upset in Sunday's Belmont  
Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bevo was shipped to the New Jersey Equine Clinic where he had  
surgery on Tuesday. The prognosis for his complete recovery is good 
but, according to trainer Bill Badgett, if it takes as long as four 
months, the outlook would be dim for the 2000 Triple Crown series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, it has to go picture perfect,'' Badgett said.  
``With the timing, we'd have to get him back in a time frame that 
will allow us to get a couple of races into him before you get to 
the major races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bevo, winner of four of his five career starts, won Saratoga's  
Grade II Special and added to his prestige when he upset More Than 
Ready in the Belmont Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Badgett believes Bevo suffered the injury nearing the wire in  
the Futurity. ``He was probably getting a bit tired,'' the trainer 
said. ``A lot of times when they run hard and that gutsy, they get 
a little tired. That's when something's going to go if it's going 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badgett expects Bevo to begin his recuperation with a 30-day  
stay at Belmont Park before being shipped to Palm Beach Downs in 
Florida for the winter.

<HEADLINE> Census: Subsidize Down Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most effective way to increase the number  
of renters who can afford a house is to subsidize the down payment, 
a Census study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing the amount of required down payment and lowering  
mortgage interest rates had less impact on the ability to buy a 
house, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are contained in an analysis of homeownership in  
1995 being released Wednesday by the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency looked at the affordability of modestly priced  
houses, which it defined as homes that were less expensive than 75 
percent of the houses in the area. These ranged from around $84,000 
for homes bought by individuals to $136,000 for homes bought by 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	In analyzing the various reasons people are unable to afford a  
private home, researcher Howard A. Savage determined that a down 
payment subsidy of $2,500 would increase the number of renters who 
qualify to buy by 2 percentage points by reducing the amount of 
money needed up front. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsidy of $5,000 boosted those qualifying by 11 percentage  
points, $7,500 raised it by 18 points and $10,000 by 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``This approach is the equivalent of receiving a gift from  
parents or employers or home sellers or assistance from nonprofit 
agencies or government agencies,'' Savage explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surprisingly,'' he added, ``decreases in the mortgage interest  
rate of less than 3 percentage points ... had no significant impact 
on the number of renters who would have qualified for a mortgage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the lower income requirement for lower rate mortgages  
many still faced the barrier of a down payment and closing costs or 
still had too much debt to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing interest by 3 points, the report said, increased the  
share of renters who could qualify by only 1 percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowering the down payment from 5 percent to 2.5 percent  
increased the number who could qualify by 1 percentage point also. 
It lowered the initial payment needed, but increased the amount of 
income needed to qualify because the amount saved in down payment 
had to be added to the long-term cost of the home mortgage.

<HEADLINE> Eric Clapton To Write Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Clapton says the music he wrote for Rob  
Reiner's new comedy, ``The Story of Us,'' needed an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clapton viewed a rough cut of the film about a couple on  
the brink of divorce, he felt the story ``was this loggerheads 
situation going on where no one would back down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, well, I've got to make up for this,'' Clapton said  
during press interviews to promote the film last week. ``I'll write 
the general apology.''

	Clapton recorded the song for the movie, which also includes  
instrumental tracks he co-wrote with Marc Shaiman and features his 
1970s hit ``Wonderful Tonight.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Finds World Economy on the Mend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring that global economic conditions have  
``improved markedly,'' the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday 
released a generally upbeat forecast of economic prospects for the 
world through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But IMF officials warned that unforeseen shocks such as a sudden  
plunge in America's high-flying stock market or a precipitous drop 
in the value of the dollar could disrupt the newfound optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the Asian crisis struck in July 1997,  
the new IMF forecast actually represented an upward revision in 
growth predictions compared with the previous forecast. The IMF 
last issued a forecast in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF predicted that the global economy would grow by 3  
percent this year and an even better 3.5 percent next year. In May, 
the IMF had put growth this year at a lower 2.3 percent, increasing 
to 3.4 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF said a stronger-than-expected U.S. economy and more  
vigorous and quicker rebounds in Asian crisis countries were the 
major factors contributing to the improved outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Chief Economist Michael Mussa said the IMF was making its  
forecast for next year ``with increasing confidence'' because of 
the multiplying number of favorable developments. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those developments also include ``a clear end to the  
recession'' in Japan, the world's second-largest economy, and 
shallower-than-expected recessions in Brazil and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Wednesday that the  
upcoming annual meetings of the 182-nation IMF and World Bank were 
occurring in a far different environment than a year ago when the 
global economy was reeling from the collapse of the Russian ruble 
and the near-failure of a large U.S. hedge fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year ago the world was facing what was generally declared to  
be the most serious situation in global financial markets in 50 
years,'' Summers said in a speech at Yale University. ``Important 
challenges remain. But it is fair to say that we have pulled back 
from the abyss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the upcoming meetings of finance ministers in  
Washington would launch a new Group of 20, which will include the 
world's seven wealthiest nations and a collection of developing 
countries, to provide a broader forum to address efforts to 
overhaul the global financial architecture to prevent, or at least 
better handle, future financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this effort will not result in ``construction of a  
single edifice'' but rather ``an organic and ongoing process 
comprising the work of many governments and private sector actors'' 
over a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF forecast predicted that the gross domestic product in  
the United States would increase by 3.7 percent this year before 
slowing to 2.6 percent in 2000, numbers that would describe a 
hoped-for ``soft landing'' in which interest rate increases by the 
Federal Reserve slow growth enough to prevent inflation but don't 
plunge the country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year and  
Mussa said that more rate increases may be needed. The IMF report 
also singled out the possibility of a sharp drop in the U.S. stock 
market or the dollar as two of the biggest downside risks to its 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussa said proper policy coordination among governments will be  
crucial, and he suggested that might include joint intervention by 
the world's seven largest economies to buy dollars in an effort to 
stabilize the U.S. currency, which has dropped sharply in recent 
weeks in value against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's slide against the yen is expected to be one of the  
primary discussion topics when finance ministers and central banks 
presidents from the Group of Seven wealthy countries -- the United 
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- meet on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bill Russell Now in Rancho Cucamonga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- Bill Russell works about 45  
miles from Dodger Stadium, where he was employed before being fired 
15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It might as well be 45,000 miles.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell managed the Dodgers for nearly two years and spent more  
than 30 years in the organization. Now he works at The Epicenter, 
where he is manager of the Rancho Cucamonga Surfers of the 
California Fall League. 
</P>
<P>
	A hot, desert wind blew gently. Highway 15, the road to Las  
Vegas, is a couple blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a different life for Russell, who recently managed Orlando  
to the championship of the Class AA Southern League. He will spend 
the next six weeks managing the Surfers, a team of low-level minor 
leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting right off, I'll try to get to know everybody,''  
Russell said. ``First of all, I've got to know their names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell admits it took him several months to get over being  
fired and feels no vindication from the Dodgers' lack of success 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think about it anymore,'' he said. ``I've got  
another job going. I really enjoy it, I want to do well. I'm in the 
minor leagues, I'm just like the players. I hope to get back to the 
major league level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers gave me a great shot for over 30 years. That's the  
only way I look at it. I have no hard feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked how he felt about the post-Bill Russell Dodgers,  
he replied: ``I have one comment: It was mentioned that the village 
idiot could manage the Dodgers. That's all I want to say about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Johnson made that statement last fall before being hired  
as the team's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, who played for the Dodgers from 1969-86, was fired  
along with general manager Fred Claire on June 21, 1998 -- three 
months after the Fox Group took control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers were 36-38 and finished the season with an 83-79  
record. This year has been a disaster despite several offseason 
additions, led by pitcher Kevin Brown, and one of baseball's 
highest payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was dismissed, Russell spent his first summer in more  
than 30 years without the structure of baseball. He and his wife, 
Susan, did some traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came reality.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went to the winter meetings last December in Nashville,'' he  
said. ``I was looking for a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, whose overall record as manager of the Dodgers was  
173-149, found one -- manager at Orlando, an affiliate of the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really pleased about that,'' he said of winning the  
Southern League championship. ``The first half, we really 
struggled. The second half, we started believing in ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And winning.  
</P>
<P>
	It took him until spring training to bounce back from the  
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt a lot, at first,'' he said. ``Whenever something like  
that happens for the first time, it's like a death. You're told 
your services are no longer wanted. You have to have time to 
grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team wasn't jelling, (Fox) had just bought the team, they  
wanted to try something different. I had never been fired before. 
Over time, you get over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old manager said he's glad to be back in Southern  
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ideal for me. I can go home every day,'' said Russell,  
who still lives in Glendale, not far from Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	`We're very happy to have Bill because of the Dodger connection,  
the old Dodger connection,'' said Pat Filippone, the general 
manager of the Surfers and the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class 
A California League. ``He's a symbol of the old Dodgers. The 
players are excited about playing for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedrick Bowers, a 21-year-old left-hander who played for Russell  
at Orlando, will play for him again in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's comfortable,'' Bowers said. ``He's a great guy, on and  
off the field, not just as the manager. The thing I like best about 
him -- he's straight up with you, he says it like it is.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton opened the door Wednesday  
for more federal money to help storm cleanups in Florida, 
Pennsylvania and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	He declared major disasters in all three states, which makes  
federal money available to local governments and individuals for 
repairs and loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, Clinton approved federal money to help repair or  
replace public facilities in nine counties that were hit by 
Hurricane Floyd last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, Clinton's declaration means business owners and  
others in four counties can apply for emergency disaster housing, 
grants, low-cost loans and other programs. The money covers damage 
from flash floods from Tropical Depression Dennis earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico, Clinton's declaration means local governments in

<HEADLINE> Gert Hurtles Toward Newfoundland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- A weakened Hurricane Gert picked  
up speed Wednesday as it churned toward the Canadian coast of 
Newfoundland, prompting some offshore oil rigs to stop operating. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Gert's winds had dropped to 80 mph and extended  
outward up to 115 miles. The eye of the storm was about 300 miles 
south-southwest of St. John's in Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane was moving north-northeast at about 30 mph on a  
path that would take it east of Newfoundland, passing the Avalon 
peninsula early Thursday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Gert was expected to weaken more over the next 24 hours but gain  
speed as it continued in the same general direction. 
</P>
<P>
	In Newfoundland, workers on offshore rigs prepared for gale and  
storm-force winds. Some rigs stopped drilling and nonessential 
workers were taken to land as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night and Tuesday, the hurricane brushed Bermuda with the  
outer edge of winds blowing at speeds of up to 110 mph, whipping up 
punishing waves that smashed the walls of seaside cottages and 
washed away three miles of prime beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm uprooted trees and washed out roads on Bermuda, and  
about 11,000 people suffered temporary power outages, according to 
police spokeswoman Evelyn James Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of visitors fled the popular island before the storm,  
and others canceled reservations, hurting the tourism business.

<HEADLINE> Playmobile Toy Flashlights Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toymaker Playmobile is recalling some 5,500  
toy flashlights that came with its Coastal Search and Rescue Boats 
toy sets because the spring in the flashlight's battery compartment 
can dislodge and cause the batteries to overheat or leak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced the  
recall Wednesday, said the toy sets had been sold from July through 
September for about $40 and came with a boat, raft, diver and 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer, Sonca Products of Hong Kong, received two  
reports of minor property damage and two minor injuries from the 
flashlight in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy set owners should take the flashlight, not the entire toy,  
away from children immediately and call 800-669-6394 to receive a 
$5 refund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission also announced a recall of more than 2,800  
Buffalo Fluorescent Work Lights, which are made by New Buffalo 
Corp. of Chesterfield, Mo., because the work lights have undersized 
wiring and exposed electrical parts on the plug that could shock 
consumers or cause fires. No injuries have been reported, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware and auto supply stores sold the work lights, with model  
numbers PL-16, between March 1996 and December 1998 for $13. 
Consumers should call 800-568-6657 to find out how to obtain a 
refund.

<HEADLINE> House GOP To Seek Welfare Paybacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite vehement opposition by governors,  
House Republicans plan to try reclaiming $3 billion in federal 
welfare payments to states to help pay for a massive social 
spending bill, a GOP official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is part of a congressional GOP effort to find  
enough savings to write spending bills for fiscal 2000, which 
starts Oct. 1, without using the Social Security surplus. The 
decision to use the money over governors' objections underlines the 
difficulty Republicans are having finding available funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
welfare money would be returned to the states in full for use in 
fiscal 2001. The official characterized the proposal as a 
bookkeeping device to help Republicans avoid raiding Social 
Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	As they had when a similar plan was floated several weeks ago,  
governors' representatives said they strongly opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	They said governors agreed to the 1996 welfare overhaul on  
condition they be allowed to bank unused money for future economic 
downturns. Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have a 
total of $4.2 billion in unspent federal welfare funds, according 
to the most recent statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton Key, executive director of the Republican Governors'  
Association, said an effort to reclaim the money would be ``a huge 
mistake.'' He said in recent meetings with top Republicans, GOP 
leaders had promised that lawmakers would not seek the welfare 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be very disappointed in any elected official who did  
not feel a sense of commitment once the leadership has given their 
word,'' Key said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Terrell Halaska of the National Governors'  
Association said, ``As they have done all year, the governors are 
opposed to any attempt by Congress to break the deal with the 
governors'' on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats were also critical.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican leaders apparently think that it's OK to steal  
billions of dollars in funding for needy families to get themselves 
out of their budget jam,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings are to help pay for the year's biggest spending  
bill, covering the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, 
and Education. Its price tag will exceed $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	To help pay for the bill, Republicans also plan to declare the  
$1.4 billion program that helps poor people pay heating bills a 
budget ``emergency.'' That declaration means the money can exceed 
spending limits enacted two years ago, and that GOP leaders 
recently conceded they will break. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the Senate voted by voice to boost spending for  
veterans by $600 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become a bidding war over a popular program, the  
Senate voted to increase veterans' health-care spending next year 
to $19 billion. That would match the House's figure and exceed both 
this year's total and President Clinton's original request by $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 63-36, senators rejected a proposal by Sen. Paul  
Wellstone, D-Minn., to add the $1.3 billion for veterans health, 
paid for out of budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, senators voted 61-38 to kill a plan by Sen.  
Robert Smith, I-N.H., that would have provided $225 million for 
veterans, this time paid for by killing Clinton's Americorps 
national service program. 
</P>
<P>
	That vote was significant because it signaled that the Senate  
would refuse to go along with the House, which voted to kill 
Americorps entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has sent Clinton just four of the 13 spending bills for  
the coming fiscal year, and the White House has threatened vetoes 
of six of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	With a certainty that some of the measures will be incomplete by  
Oct. 1, GOP leaders said they would send Clinton a stopgap bill 
keeping agencies functioning through Oct. 21 at this year's 
spending levels. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said 
the bill will be as ``non-vetoable as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments,  
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate negotiators deadlocked over a veto-threatened  
$12.6 billion foreign aid bill because of a dispute over U.N. 
family planning programs. House negotiators said they would drop 
controversial language denying U.S. funds for organizations that 
lobby foreign governments to repeal anti-abortion laws, if the 
Senate would eliminate $25 million previously approved by both 
House and Senate for the United Nation's family planning assistance 
program. Senators refused. 
</P>
<P>
	--Republicans all but abandoned a plan to provide $5.5 billion in  
emergency farm aid in the dwindling days of this fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Set To Start Without Ewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Patrick Ewing's injured Achilles'  
tendon still hurts and that means the New York Knicks head into 
training camp in two weeks without their signature center. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes things more complicated is backup Chris Dudley is  
banged up too, limping around on a sore knee that is likely to keep 
him out as well. 
</P>
<P>
	This is nothing new for coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose team was  
beat up and running out of bodies as they lost the NBA Finals in 
five games to San Antonio last June. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the last two years, Van Gundy has been forced to go  
without Ewing for long stretches of the season, first because of a 
fractured wrist and then because of the injured foot. The Knicks 
have learned to play without him and the coach thinks those lessons 
will serve the team well until the star center returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be back healthy at some point,'' Van Gundy said  
Wednesday. ``When he's ready, he'll tell me and he'll play. I don't 
have a timetable set for Patrick. It will be his call. When he 
feels ready to go, he'll go. We've had to do it that way for a 
couple of years. We know how we have to play. We found out last 
year what we needed to do to win when he was there and when he 
wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be frustrating if this was the first time. This is  
just how it is. We have capable people, different players with 
different strengths. You just go out and play, try to maximize the 
strengths and minimize the weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy doesn't concern himself with things he can't control.  
The Knicks aren't calling off training camp. Without Ewing and 
Dudley, the centers become 6-foot-11 Marcus Camby and 6-9 Kurt 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable with that,'' Van Gundy said. ``You play. You  
can't worry about who's not there. This is our team and we're 
excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A summer of relaxation has erased the dark bags under the  
coach's eyes. He seemed refreshed and ready to deal with the grind 
of a full 82-game season after last year's lockout created a 
50-game sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were 21-21 when they turned their season around,  
squeezed into the playoffs and then made it all the way to the 
Finals. And when he was asked if, at age 37 and coming off two 
injury-filled seasons, Ewing could no longer be counted on as a 
fulltime player, Van Gundy came to the defense of his big man. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, we were 8-3 with him and 4-5 without him,''  
he said. ``That's the bottom line. He averaged 34.2 minutes per 
game. He can do that. Whether it's needed or not, we have to wait 
and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would seem to describe Ewing's availability for the start  
of the season, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	While several other teams retooled their rosters, New York added  
just one significant player in the offseason, signing ex-Knick John 
Wallace from Toronto. Top draft choice Frederick Weis will play in 
Europe this season. 
</P>
<P>
	New York will be tested early as the Knicks open with 13 of  
their first 18 games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mentality coming in, where we see ourselves is I want our  
guys to understand how much success we had last year,'' Van Gundy 
said. ``I want to build on the lesson of how we play to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to defend well and we've got to rebound well. We've  
got to pass the ball willingly and want to pass it to the open man. 
That's a challenge every year in the NBA, being unselfish, giving 
it up to the open man. You play to your strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Training camp begins Oct. 4 in Charleston, S.C. without Ewing.  
And, Van Gundy said, the team will get along. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick is going to come back when he's healthy,'' he said.  
``When that takes place, I don't know. But I have no doubts he will 
be an effective player again because of my belief in him.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Will Test Avery's Receiving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Having given up on Marcus Nash, the Denver Broncos  
will assess newly acquired John Avery's receiving skills before 
determining where he fits in their offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos and the Miami Dolphins swapped first-round busts on  
Tuesday, with Nash, a wide receiver, going to Miami and Avery, a 
running back, heading to Denver. Both players are in their second 
pro seasons, having been drafted as the 29th and 30th players in 
the 1998 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery was the Dolphins' second-leading rusher last season with  
503 yards on 143 carries. He also caught 10 passes for 67 yards and 
returned 43 kickoffs for a 25.2-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
	His combined yardage of 1,655 yards set a Miami single-season  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, however, became buried on the Dolphins' depth chart  
behind veteran running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar and rookies Cecil 
Collins and J.J. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a spot for him,'' Dolphins offensive coordinator  
Kippy Brown said. ``I think he has a very bright future, but some 
guys just take time to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Nash, who was given a chance to  
showcase his talents when he started in place of the injured Rod 
Smith in Kansas City on Sunday, but he continued to run his routes 
tentatively. His only catch this year -- for zero yards against the 
Chiefs -- was nullified by a holding penalty. Nash caught only four 
passes for 76 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the deal on Wednesday, coach Mike Shanahan said the  
Broncos concluded that Nash ``could not help us in the future. We 
thought it was best to go in a different direction because he was 
not going to be one of our top four wide receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the selection of Nash was one of his rare mistakes in  
the draft, Shanahan said, ``To call it a mistake, I hate to do that 
and put it on him. To put that on me, I'd say yes. But here's a 
young man who has a lot of ability, and maybe a different 
surrounding may help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan also denied that Nash, one of Denver's fastest  
receivers, helped to stretch opposing defenses. ``If he did, he'd 
still be here,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Avery, the Broncos will work him at receiver for about a  
week and then work him at running back the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got great speed, and maybe he can help us in a couple of  
areas,'' Shanahan said. ``Can he return kicks, help us a spot 
player, help us as a wide receiver or as a running back? He 
definitely has some talent. We'll give him a chance to show us what 
he can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said Avery, who arrived at Broncos headquarters late  
Wednesday afternoon, won't be activated for Sunday's game in Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-9, 190-pound Avery said he was surprised by the  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was happy because I knew some things weren't right in  
Miami,'' he said. ``To come to a team that has won two Super Bowls 
with the leadership they have around here, I was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running back is my nature, but I've had some work at receiver  
in Miami. As long as I can touch the football and have an 
opportunity to make plays, that's all I want. I love to return 
kicks and get an opportunity to break the defense's back.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Mayor's Son Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The 37-year-old son of Denver Mayor Wellington  
Webb was arrested on suspicion of robbing a man of $500 and 
stealing his Gucci watch while showing him an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's arrest added to a string of police run-ins for Allen  
Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested three times in 1995 for alleged misdemeanor  
assault, possession of a controlled substance and attempted sexual 
assault and robbery. No charges were filed in the sexual assault 
case because the alleged victim could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Webb turned himself in to police on Tuesday. The alleged  
victim, Adrian Nunez, 24, said he was robbed late Monday, Detective 
Virginia Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor and his wife issued a statement Tuesday saying:  
``Allen is a 37-year-old adult and he will have to face the 
allegations that have been brought against him.''

<HEADLINE> Garcia Is Spain's Next Great Hope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Sergio Garcia doesn't have to step up  
this week and try to end American domination at the Ryder Cup. One 
of his countrymen helped take care of that 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Seve Ballesteros is gone, though, and the hopes of Europe  
retaining the cup may well rest with the young new admiral of the 
Spanish Armada. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few months after he first got paid to play, Garcia is the  
unlikely leader of both the three-man Spanish contingent at The 
Country Club and possibly the European team itself. 
</P>
<P>
	His infectious enthusiasm, unlimited imagination and unbridled  
talent are just the things needed to spark a team loaded with 
rookies against the favored Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sergio is a very exciting kid who could be the best in the  
world,'' Tom Lehman said. ``He leads by his play and example on the 
golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who remembers Garcia's 6-iron that faded onto the green  
from between tree roots during his duel with Tiger Woods at the PGA 
Championship last month or his leaping run after the ball doesn't 
need to be reminded of the excitement he brings to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	And what is not to love about a 19-year-old who not only wanted  
to make the European team, but to play Woods in the Sunday singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I'll have to play against him,'' Garcia said. ``It  
will be nice. But what I have in my mind right now is to help the 
European team try to win the cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia may have a big hand in that, with European captain Mark  
James expected to send him out not only on Sunday but also in the 
alternate shot and best ball competitions that set the stage for 
the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	In practice Wednesday, Garcia was partnered with Jesper Parnevik  
for alternate shot play. But he could end up going out with Masters 
champion Jose Maria Olazabal, who along with Ballesteros has been a 
mentor to the young Spaniard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pretty good friends,'' Garcia said. ``I met him when I  
was 11 years old, I think, playing a Spanish event in his home 
course. He's been always trying to help me, and I'm really pleased 
with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who inherited the title of Spain's best golfer from  
Ballesteros, figures to pass it along some day to Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	That day could come sooner than later, judging from Garcia's  
spectacular explosion into professional golf. Olazabal knows it, 
but it's clear he doesn't begrudge Garcia anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Tuesday what impressed him most about Garcia, Olazabal  
said ``everything,'' before describing his various talents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't say anything else. I'm getting red,'' Garcia said, the  
two laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Olazabal, a five-time Ryder Cup member, will be  
joined on the team by Miguel Angel Jiminez, who, like Garcia, is 
making his cup debut. Together, they give Spain a full fourth of 
the European team. 
</P>
<P>
	If history is any indication, that may not be good for the U.S.  
team, which had a 28-year winning streak snapped in 1985 when 
Ballesteros and fellow Spaniard Manuel Pinero combined for 7 1/2 
points at The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing all those Spanish players playing in the Ryder Cup,  
it's an honor to be here,'' Garcia said. ``It's an honor to be 
following their footsteps. I think we have a lot of good players in 
Spain and maybe because it's not such a great sport in Spain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it becomes a great sport, it might be due to the fieriness  
that Ballesteros showed openly and that seems to be deep inside 
Olazabal and Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way we are, most of us, anyway,'' Olazabal said.  
``It's very difficult to see a Spanish person who is very quiet and 
doesn't react to certain situations. We are not as calm as some of 
the British, that's for sure, or Germans or Swedish. But that's the 
nature of our personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniards will have the added incentive of playing well for  
King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, who will be among the spectators 
cheering the European team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to have the king and queen here with us,''  
Olazabal said. ``That will put some attention on what is going on 
back in our country. I truly believe that will be beneficial for 
the game.''

<HEADLINE> Bizarre Golfer Sandelin Stands Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Jarmo Sandelin has left the  
crocodile-skin shoes, the $6,000 jacket and the formfitting, 
see-through shirts at home. He has trimmed his absurdly long 
52-inch driver down to a merely ridiculous 50 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the 32-year-old Ryder Cup rookie is at The Country  
Club this week to play for the European team, not to widen his 
repute as the continent's most eccentric new star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get press for my personality. I want to get  
press for my golf shots,'' he said after a practice round in which 
his more subdued self made a debut. ``I'm a team player now, and I 
like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Finnish-born naturalized Swede who lives in Monte Carlo,  
Sandelin is a European team all by himself. But before this Ryder 
Cup, his name was most often mentioned -- or cursed, depending on 
who was doing the talking -- in connection with his idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
	He was known for using an exceptionally long driver -- 45 inches  
is more the norm. And he was known for his clothes: Tuesday's belt, 
an indescribable tangle of stones, silver and snakeskin, cost him 
$1,500. (He ordered another one from the same Italian designer for 
more than $2,000.) 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy that I collect belts and not cars,'' he said.  
``They're less expensive, and I always have them with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Sandelin was fitting in with the team despite being a  
bit eccentric, European captain Mark James took exception to the 
premise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say Jarmo is a bit eccentric,'' he said, ``I think  
he's very eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have a lot of eccentric people in Europe, and we're  
very used to them. Jarmo fits in great. He's a good, fun guy to be 
around,'' James said. ``We understand him. Simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe now. But not always.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara and Sandelin had words at the Lancome Trophy in  
1997 when he accused the American of improperly marking his ball 
and called him ``Mark-It-Nearer.'' Mickelson got upset at the 
Dunhill Cup in '96 when Sandelin, after holing a putt, used his 
club as a mock machine gun to finish off the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's Lancome Trophy, Sandelin's current Ryder Cup  
teammate Lee Westwood accused him of hitting a ball while it was 
moving. All of which combined to give Sandelin a reputation as a 
jerk -- and a peculiar one, at that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see myself that way,'' Sandelin said. ``It's like it's  
another Jarmo they're talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesper Parnevik -- Sandelin's teammate, countryman and a fellow  
oddball -- says the clashes are a misunderstanding, a combination of 
innocent exuberance and Sandelin's inefficiency with the English 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be something about the fertilizer they use on the  
Swedish golf courses,'' said Parnevik, who is perhaps best known 
for wearing his cap with the bill flipped up but has somehow become 
the second-strangest Swede on the European team. 
</P>
<P>
	Having earned his share of quizzical looks, Parnevik is happy to  
help Sandelin avoid the burdens of being bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Jarmo has to explain himself, he can't really get the  
words out the right way,'' Parnevik said. ``He's very outgoing. 
He's a very fun character on the golf course. He likes to show a 
good time. But his intentions are always good. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't know Jarmo and you see him doing funny things,  
you think, 'Who is this crazy guy?''' Parnevik said. ``But you see 
him do it a few times and you realize he's just a funny guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And you see him make a couple of shots, and you realize that  
there's more to Sandelin than wacky antics. He has won twice this 
year on the European tour, in the Spanish and German Opens, ranking 
eighth on the European points list to earn a spot on the Ryder Cup 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's won two tournaments. I haven't won any tournaments,''  
said O'Meara, who spoke with Sandelin at a dinner Tuesday night and 
said the conversation was ``very cordial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no issue with Jarmo Sandelin. ... This is not any  
grudge match or this or that,'' O'Meara said. ``(If I'm) paired 
against Jarmo, that isn't going to change my demeanor. ... I've got 
to try to do what I do best. And, hopefully, I'll do that well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandelin agreed that his antics are easily misunderstood; the  
machine gun incident, for example, was something he saw in an Adam 
Sandler movie. But he doesn't think a total makeover is in order, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't change it if people judge my personality based on how  
I dress, or how I react when I make putts,'' he said. ``I'm glad 
I'm an individual. We have to have individuals that are different. 
Otherwise, I don't think the world would go.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Indonesia Sign Gas Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Singapore Power Ltd. signed a  
preliminary agreement on Wednesday to purchase $7 billion worth of 
natural gas from Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is expected to be signed in December.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Pertamina will sell 2.27 trillion cubic  
feet of natural gas from fields in south Sumatra over 20 years 
starting in mid-2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Power signed the agreement through its subsidiary  
PowerGas Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In the initial stage, Singapore Power will purchase 150 million  
cubic feet of natural gas daily, with the amount increasing to 350 
million cubic feet by 2008, the two companies said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Get This: You Can Bet on Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Trying to predict the weather has been a popular  
pastime since long before Farmer's Almanac started forecasting next 
year's blizzards. 
</P>
<P>
	Now you can bet on it.  
</P>
<P>
	Weather futures made their debut Wednesday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, enabling traders to speculate on what the 
temperature is going to be in four U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities, insurance companies and other businesses with a lot  
riding on the weather can use the futures to hedge their risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone else willing to bet on next year's weather can too, with  
some effort. A Farmer's Almanac is optional -- all you need to 
``play'' the weather is a commodity brokerage account and money 
you're willing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	But this idea is aimed squarely at big business -- utilities, for  
example, seeking to protect themselves from a milder-than-normal 
winter that would hold down sales of electricity for heating homes 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Merc, where investors buy and sell futures and  
options contracts on everything from milk to Treasury bonds, says 
weather affects 20 percent of the $9 trillion U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather touches just about all parts of the economy,'' from  
retail sales to utilities to insurance, said Pete Barker, vice 
president of the exchange. ``Now it's possible to do something 
about that by taking a position on how warm or cold it's going to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after mixed results with previous innovations -- contracts on  
brine shrimp and Russian ruble futures bombed, while eurodollar and 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index futures have boomed -- exchange 
officials are braced for a potentially chilly reception for 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't,'' Barker  
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather futures already have been trading on the  
over-the-counter market for the past two years. The investment is 
known as a ``derivative'' because its value is derived from an 
underlying asset. Instead of being based on swings in a foreign 
currency, stock index or interest rate, this investment is related 
to the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors place their ``bets'' on the average temperature in  
four U.S. cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati or New York. Plans 
call for later adding Dallas, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and 
Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merc offers monthly contracts based on heating degree days  
expected in those cities. A degree day is a measure used to 
describe how much the temperature differs from the standard average 
for one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Headed into fall and winter, the contract is based on an index  
that measures how much the actual daily average temperature in 
those cities is below 65. For example, an average temperature of 55 
degrees for a full day would equal 10 index points. If that 
temperature held at 55 over a 30-day month, the index swing would 
be 300 points. 
</P>
<P>
	For an initial investment, a trader has to put up a down payment  
for each contract traded. For the Chicago temperature contract 
covering October, that would be $1,400 per contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader makes money on a contract when the index rises after it  
is purchased. A gain of 20 points, at $100 a point, represents 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader loses money when the index falls after the contract is  
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of the first temperature-related derivative to be  
traded on an exchange was hardly stormy for a setting that usually 
is raucous. 
</P>
<P>
	While red-jacketed traders on the exchange floor shouted and  
gestured wildly as they dealt in contracts for live cattle and 
frozen pork bellies, there was only electronic trading of weather 
futures. The action was evident only in the flashing of tiny red 
and green lights showing prices on the overhead quote board and on 
desktop computer screens above the trading pit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merc said 53 contracts were sold in the first five hours of  
trading, which will continue around the clock. It was a modestly 
successful start. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange would not reveal its customers, but the majority  
were presumed to be large utilities or insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Four energy trading firms are making the market and guaranteeing  
payment on the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract's backers, armed with reams of historical  
temperature records, set the initial price levels and were hoping 
the market will take off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses are gambling on the weather anyway, and this allows  
them to hedge their positions,'' said Jeff Porter, vice president 
of Koch Energy Trading of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Insiders already are talking about the possibilities of snowfall  
futures, which could help protect ski resorts or snowblower 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone's waiting to see how weather futures fare first.  
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Arbor, former chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade,  
says he's dubious about their success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting idea,'' he said. ``But these new product  
launches are very, very difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Floods Spur DaimlerChrysler, GM Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Flood-related problems at a parts company in  
North Carolina have created headaches at some auto factories in the 
United States and Canada, forcing automakers to cut production. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at seven assembly plants owned by DaimlerChrysler AG and  
three owned by General Motors Corp. are working half-shifts due to 
a lack of a single part. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it was lacking a ``suspension part,'' while  
GM said it was lacking a disc brake bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said the slowdown was due to flooding  
problems at a Simpson Industries Inc. plant in Greenville, N.C. 
DaimlerChrysler spokesman Dan Moore said the part came from a North 
Carolina supplier, but declined to name the company. 
</P>
<P>
	A Simpson spokesman did not immediately return a message.  
</P>
<P>
	To hold down costs, automakers tend to keep parts inventories as  
low as possible, relying on ``just-in-time'' systems where parts 
are delivered as they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes and Moore said production could continue with parts that  
were on their way when the flooding began. Holmes said the main 
problem was that the flood cut off most of the roads to the 
factory, keeping workers and parts from coming and going. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped more than 20 inches of rain in the region  
last week; more rain this week has sent waters rising again. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected DaimlerChrysler assembly plants include Sterling  
Heights, Mich. Warren, Mich.; Belvidere, Ill.; Newark, Del.; one 
plant in Fenton, Mo.; and two in Canada. GM said its 
Detroit-Hamtramck; Orion, Mich.; and Oshawa, Ontario, plants were 
running half shifts Wednesday. Holmes said the Detroit and Orion 
plants will try to run full shifts Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Dutch Journalist Killed in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- A Dutch journalist was killed and two  
others were assaulted in separate attacks in East Timor blamed on 
anti-independence militiamen, officials and witnesses said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutilated body of Sander Thoenes, a 30-year-old reporter for  
London's Financial Times newspaper, was found today in the Dili 
suburb of Becora, the scene of heavy activity by militias and their 
Indonesian military backers, said Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, 
commander of Indonesian forces in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorcycle driver Florindo Araujo said he was taking the Dutch  
journalist to Becora on Tuesday, when they approached a roadblock 
staffed by at least six armed men wearing what Araujo said were the 
gray uniforms of the Indonesian police. 
</P>
<P>
	The two turned around, but some of the armed men gave chase,  
firing warning shots and eventually shooting out the motorcycle's 
rear wheel. Araujo, who fled, last saw Thoenes lying in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes was believed to be the first foreigner killed since  
international peacekeeping troops landed in Dili on Monday and the 
first foreign reporter killed in East Timor since six 
Australia-based journalists were slain in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes, who also worked for The Christian Science Monitor and  
Dutch news magazine Vrij Nederland, was the Financial Times' 
Jakarta correspondent and previously had worked as its Central Asia 
correspondent based in Almaty, Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sander was one of the FT's finest foreign correspondents and a  
wonderful friend and colleague,'' said Richard Lambert, editor of 
the Financial Times. ``He was full of enthusiasm and showed great 
initiative and flair in everything he did. He was devoted to 
getting to the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Federation of Journalists expressed outrage  
over Thoenes' death, calling it a blatant attempt to stop 
journalists from reporting on what was happening in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Militiamen have vowed to kill Westerners, whom they accuse of  
helping East Timor in its efforts to break free of Indonesian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, commander of the  
international force in the Indonesian territory, said the militias 
were attempting a show of force in Dili and the attacks were 
``obviously a reaction to our presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear that the militia have attempted to step up  
some activities as a show that all is not yet secure,'' Cosgrove 
said. ``We are imposing some level of control in the close part of 
the city. However ... it is still a dangerous place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second incident in the hills near Becora, a car carrying  
London Sunday Times correspondent Jon Swain and Chip Hires, an 
American photographer for the Gamma agency, was attacked by what 
Cosgrove said were assumed to be ``militia elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hires said their driver lost an eye when he was beaten before  
being taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian troops eventually rescued them.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Trade Williams to 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Chiefs traded cornerback  
Robert Williams to San Francisco for a draft choice in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs also re-signed four-year veteran cornerback Juran  
Bolden to a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a second-year cornerback, was a fifth-round draft  
choice from North Carolina in 1998. He played in all 16 games last 
season, including one start. In his rookie season, he recorded 16 
tackles and half a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-10 and 182 pounds, Williams lacked the size coach  
Gunther Cunningham wants in his cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good organization I'm going to and an opportunity to  
play more,'' Williams said of his mve to the 49ers. ``I think it 
will work out for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bolden, 6-2 and 207 pounds, was in camp with Kansas City earlier  
this year. He spent last season with Carolina. In six games with 
the Panthers, Bolden had six tackles and recovered one fumble on a 
kickoff. He also played with Green Bay in 1998 after seeing action 
in the season's first three games with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolden made a strong bid to make the Chiefs' roster in training  
camp, but suffered an elbow injury in the last preseason game.

<HEADLINE> Estes Gearing Up for PGA Texas Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Bob Estes has been ready to travel to  
Massachusetts on a moment's notice should he be needed as first 
alternate for the American Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Texas Open begins Thursday, Estes insists his mind will  
be on the sprawling course at La Cantera Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking forward to playing in some warm weather on a  
firm, fast golf course, which we don't get that often,'' Estes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Estes worked in a practice round -- just in case -- last  
week at The Country Club at Brookline, Mass., where Ryder Cup 
competition starts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I would love to be playing on that team,  
representing my country,'' he said. ``It just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes finished sixth in the PGA Championship. Had he been fifth,  
he would have won a spot on the Ryder Cup team. The top 10 golfers 
on the Ryder Cup points list make the team, and the captain gets to 
choose two others. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw selected Tom Lehman (No. 12) and Steve  
Pate (No. 14) over Estes (No. 11). Estes is the first alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Open is without several top golfers this year because  
of the Ryder Cup, including last year's champion, Hal Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton shot a 4-under-par 68 to capture a one-stroke victory  
over Justin Leonard and Jay Haas last year. Sutton had an 18-under 
270 total, winning his first title on the PGA Tour in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-hole Texas Open, sponsored by Westin, takes place at the  
7,001-yard, par-72 La Cantera course on the edge of the Texas Hill 
Country. Sponsors have upped the purse to $2 million this year, 
with the winner receiving $342,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes emphasized the positives of playing in the Texas Open, in  
which he'll aim for his second PGA Tour victory and have the 
opportunity to solidify his standing on the money list. He's 
currently 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	He refuses to dwell on missing the Ryder Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was going to work out fine either way. I was really in a  
no-lose situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes is partial to this part of the country. The 33-year-old  
former University of Texas golfer still lives in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	His only PGA Tour victory came in the Texas Open in 1994, the  
last year the tournament was held at Oak Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning that title, Estes endured tough times the next two  
years and in 1996 lost his fully exempt status by dropping out of 
the top 125 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes climbed to 69th on the money list in 1997 and was 28th  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes enters the Texas Open with four straight top-15 finishes.  
He has nine top-10 finishes this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been nice to make the progress that I have in the last  
couple of years,'' he said, attributing his improvement to changes 
in equipment and in his physical approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing at La Cantera so far this week, Estes said, he hasn't  
seen many differences in the course compared with past years, 
although he noted the rough is not quite as high. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the greens are firm and fast, he said. ``These greens  
are some of the toughest we play on.''

<HEADLINE> White House Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's fondness for cigars is a  
bad habit he hasn't kicked, his spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart did not try to square  
the habit with Clinton's vocal opposition to cigarette smoking by 
young people, or with White House support for the Justice 
Department's just-announced civil suit against tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president believes that's a bad habit, but it's a  
habit he hasn't broken,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart did not say whether Clinton is trying to give up  
cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House maintains some mystery about whether Clinton  
actually smokes cigars, or merely chews on them, as he has been 
photographed doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart has said he has never seen Clinton light up.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will not be the featured speaker at an upcoming National  
Endowment for the Humanities dinner that traditionally features a 
leading academic at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEH, often accused by Republicans of holding culturally and  
politically liberal biases, was criticized by Republicans and some 
academics for making the unusual speaking invitation to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want the important work that they do to be called  
into question,'' Lockhart said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax-supported NEH funds museum exhibits, TV and radio  
programs and other research into the humanities. It is chaired by a 
Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton never formally accepted the offer to deliver the NEH's  
Jefferson Lecture, and decided against doing so in part to avoid 
questions about whether a politician is an appropriate speaker, 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any ... continuing of debate might have the effect of  
calling what they do into question, and the president wanted no 
part of that,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The White House delayed a veto showdown with the GOP over tax  
cuts on Wednesday, but managed to find a few other opportunities to 
aim some political firepower at congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart called three senators' criticism of Clinton's foreign  
travel glib and uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, put very bluntly, the comments are just ignorant,''  
Lockhart said, repeating the word several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart also was irked by GOP remarks that there is little  
chance of congressional support for China's bid to join the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., publicly undermined  
U.S. trade negotiators by saying Congress won't have time to 
consider China's WTO bid this year, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said he doubts the  
measure can win necessary congressional support. Lockhart said the 
timing of that remark ``just doesn't strike me as responsible 
leadership.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: HMOs in Medicare Reduce Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many of the 6.3 million Medicare recipients in  
HMOs are facing new restrictions on their coverage and increased 
out-of-pocket expenses, Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday, 
pushing for the adoption of an administration plan to revamp the 
program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	A Health Care Financing Administration review of Medicare  
beneficiaries in HMOs said that about 21 percent currently have an 
annual cap of $500 or less on the amount they may spend on 
prescription drugs. By 2000, that percentage will increase to 
almost one-third of recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is running for president, released the findings on  
behalf of the Clinton administration at a Washington meeting of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said the 1 million beneficiaries in HMOs who now  
have no copayments for prescription drugs will have to pay by 2000. 
Copayments for brand name drugs will increase 21 percent, with 
generic drugs' copayments increasing 8 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many of America's working families depending on Medicare  
cannot depend on their HMOs to deliver the affordable, critical 
benefits that convinced them to choose an HMO in the first place,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, the government health insurance program for the  
elderly, provides care to roughly 40 million seniors annually, 
including about 33 million beneficiaries in a traditional 
fee-for-service program. The administration has called for an 
improved payment system for health care providers and a 
prescription drug benefit for the program's beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	At a House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing on strengthening  
Medicare, Chairman Bill Thomas, R-Calif., said Wednesday that the 
program ``cannot keep pace with the changes of the health care 
marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``we can improve Medicare both administratively and  
structurally to offer seniors more health care choices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the administration announced that about 327,000  
Medicare beneficiaries could lose coverage because several large 
managed care providers plan to pull out of the Medicare market. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the report said providers that plan to stay in the  
program will charge higher premiums for enrollment. That means some 
3 million beneficiaries who do not pay premiums now will have to 
pay them by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human  
services, on Wednesday announced a campaign to enroll children in 
free or low-cost health care programs through the Children's Health 
Insurance Program. The back-to-school campaign will include 45 
events in 25 communities and a $1 million radio campaign.

<HEADLINE> Martin Closes In on PGA Tour Berth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNCTION CITY, Ore. (AP) -- Casey Martin is close to earning the  
right to go four-wheeling all over the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who sued the PGA Tour last year so he can ride a cart to  
ease the pain in his right leg, needs at least a second-place 
finish at the Nike Oregon Classic this weekend to secure a tour 
exemption for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has played well this summer after struggling for most of  
the past year. He currently is 12th on the Nike Tour money list at 
$101,527 entering the Oregon Classic, which begins today just north 
of his hometown of Eugene. The top 15 finishers on golf's minor 
league circuit earn a PGA Tour card. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin blew a chance to clinch a spot two weeks ago when he  
slipped from second to ninth in the final round of the Tri-Cities 
Open in Washington state. Only two tournaments, including the Nike 
Tour Championship Oct. 21-24, are left in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big week for me and my career, and hopefully I can  
do well,'' he said Wednesday during an interview aboard his cart, 
parked near the practice tees at Shadow Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm just not trying to think too far in advance,'' Martin  
added. ``Obviously, I'd like to make it, so I'd like to take 
advantage of where I am right now. But at the same time, I don't 
think it's the most important thing in my life to make the PGA 
Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important stage of his life came in February 1998, when  
a federal judge in Eugene ruled against the PGA Tour and allowed 
Martin to use a cart to get around the course in tournaments. The 
decision is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 27, suffers from a degenerative condition in his right  
leg that makes it painful to walk. The PGA Tour, and many veteran 
golfers, argued that walking is part of the game and that using a 
cart would give Martin a ``competitive advantage'' over opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	After his court victory, Martin became a hero to disabled  
children and a media phenomenon. He signed an endorsement deal with 
Nike and made the rounds at talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my life was going to be like that all year long, I would  
have seriously considered another profession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the spotlight faded, Martin found himself struggling on  
the course. He qualified for the U.S. Open and had a strong 
showing, but later fell to 29th on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He played poorly to begin the 1999 season, but thanks to three  
top-10 finishes since the beginning of August, he could secure his 
PGA Tour card with a second-place finish here. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin began playing better after he took some time off in  
August. He sought treatment from a Chicago doctor who specializes 
in an ultrasound therapy that Martin hoped would alleviate some of 
the pain in his leg. But it had no effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I'm just the same, business as usual,'' he said. ``I've  
lived with my leg my whole life, and it has good days and bad days, 
but I'm still able to compete thanks to the cart, so I'm grateful 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pain got so bad that he considered withdrawing from a  
tournament in South Dakota. But he stayed and tied for sixth. The 
next week, he was second in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my leg got bad, I kind of wanted to come home,'' he said.  
``But that's when I actually started to play well, so I think I 
learned not to put too much pressure on myself, and if I try too 
hard it kind of backfires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spending time with family and sleeping in his own bed has  
further boosted Martin's spirits, but he also feels the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to play well for the people at home,'' he said. ``Now  
that all the attention has died down, it's been nice. But hopefully 
I'll play well enough in the future that I'll have to learn to deal 
with those issues on a weekly basis.''

<HEADLINE> Davis Love III: Let's Play Five  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Now that he's reacquainted with his golf  
clubs, Davis Love III wants to put them to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Love, who didn't hit a ball for almost three weeks to rest a  
pinched nerve in his neck, said he is ready to play in the maximum 
of five Ryder Cup matches for the U.S. team this weekend, if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I could,'' he said Wednesday after a second day of  
practice on The Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think so when I talked to him (U.S. captain Ben  
Crenshaw) at the PGA Championship. I said, `If you want me to not 
play, tell me. Because right now I can't give you a 36-hole day. 
Now I think I'm the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's unlikely that Crenshaw will take him up on the  
offer, it is a good sign for a player who pinched a nerve in his 
neck in mid-August and later went 19 days without touching a club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team and I are elated over the way he feels, the way he's  
playing right now. He feels wonderful,'' Crenshaw said. ``I think 
the two weeks of rest did him a world of good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love was at the PGA Championship when he first felt a twinge in  
his neck and numbness in his hands. He played anyway for the next 
two weeks before shutting down completely. 
</P>
<P>
	For 19 days, he didn't so much look at his clubs. The first time  
he touched them again was last Friday to move them from his old bag 
to the red, white and blue one given to the U.S. team members. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I don't do anything to reinjure it, I think I'm in  
very good shape,'' Love said Wednesday. ``I'd be lying if I said 
I'm 100 percent, but I'm probably 90 percent. I'm hitting the ball 
as good or better than I have all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really come back hitting the ball this good from a  
layoff. I was having problems before that were affecting my swing, 
and now they've gone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament consists of four matches on Friday morning, four  
more in the afternoon and the same schedule on Saturday. On Sunday, 
there are 12 singles matches; it's the only day that everyone on 
the roster must play. 
</P>
<P>
	That means that a golfer can play in as many as five matches and  
as few as one. As is the tradition, Crenshaw has held his cards 
close to his vest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some things in mind,'' he said. ``My problem right now  
is leaving four guys out the first day because I feel like a lot of 
guys are playing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said Wednesday's rain was beneficial because it gave  
the golfers a chance to see the course under different conditions. 
But for Love, the wet, colder weather also challenged his powers of 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I think, was a pretty good test,'' Crenshaw said.  
``This is a day where you can feel a few strains here and there and 
he came through wonderful and he played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But playing 90 holes in 60 hours could be another story.  
</P>
<P>
	``The perfect world for me right now would be to maybe sit out  
an alternate-shot match,'' Love said. ``But I've told Ben, 'Hey, if 
guys are playing better than me, I want to win. I'll sit out all 
four if it means we can win.'''

<HEADLINE> Military Tells of Vieques Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ending the U.S. military's live-fire training  
on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Vieques would compromise the 
combat readiness of American troops and create a national security 
risk, military officials told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the inhabited island is the only place on the East  
Coast with all the qualities needed for war games training from the 
air, sea and ground simultaneously, which most closely simulates 
real conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a nutshell, the training on Vieques is critical to the  
readiness of the forces we deploy from the East Coast of the United 
States,'' Navy Vice Adm. William Fallon told the Senate Armed 
Services subcommittee on readiness. ``There is no place that even 
comes close to replicating the target possibilities that exist in 
Vieques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moratorium has been placed on live-fire exercises there since  
an errant Marine Corps bomb in April killed a 35-year-old Puerto 
Rican civilian and wounded four others. A four-member Pentagon 
panel is reviewing training on the 22-mile island and is expected 
to make a recommendation to the Clinton administration shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the subcommittee's chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.,  
said he feared that President Clinton would politicize the Vieques 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster his contention, Inhofe released a Clinton memo to his  
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, in which he said it ``is 
wrong'' to use Vieques as a training range. The note was written on 
a letter to Clinton from the Puerto Rican Independence Party that 
included a plea to end the target training on Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want us there, that's the main point,'' Clinton  
wrote. ``The Navy can find a way to work around it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also wrote: ``What about the prisoners?''  
</P>
<P>
	The president has been under fire for his offer of clemency to  
16 Puerto Rican separatists. He has been accused of making the 
offer to bolster Hillary Rodham Clinton's standing among New York's 
1.3 million Puerto Ricans as she eyes a run for the Senate from 
that state. She opposed the clemency offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration official said the president's note  
shows the ``compassion he feels for the Puerto Rican people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not be interpreted to mean that the president has  
made a final determination on Vieques,'' the official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rican lawmakers and their supporters gathered on Capitol  
Hill to reiterate their long-held opposition to the use of Vieques 
for live-fire exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to free the people of Vieques from the military  
occupation of their home,'' said Rep. Nydia Velasquez, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before congressional committees, Fallon and Marine  
Lt. Gen. Peter Pace stressed that the Rodriguez's death was the 
first in the more than 50 years the military has used the area for 
target practice.

<HEADLINE> Trying To Prevent Gardening Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Gardening enjoys such a serene  
reputation that getting injured at it seems almost laughable. Yet 
an overzealous green thumb can also mean a sore elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The casualty lists are swelled, of course, by the power  
equipment injuries often suffered through inattention or failure to 
wear protective gear. But what we're talking about here is 
soreness, strains and sprains. 
</P>
<P>
	A common ailment is tendonitis. You can get tennis elbow just  
pulling weeds, the repetitive squeezing motion inciting 
inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Back muscle spasm is another trauma that threatens the  
wheelbarrow lifter or the person who bends abruptly or improperly 
to perform some task in flower bed or vegetable patch. Sometimes it 
just happens without an easily pinpointed cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Having suffered both these ailments from my gardening, I can  
testify they're just as painful as if you got them on the tennis 
court, as I did, or from some other sport or at work. To add to 
potential miseries, a bad elbow you got in tennis might heal only 
to flare up again in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Tendonitis can hit the shoulder, too, and often does.  
</P>
<P>
	There are conditioning exercises you can do, and probably should  
do, to prevent injuries, but in my experience inflammatory ailments 
like tendonitis sometimes seem to happen willy-nilly. 
</P>
<P>
	One day you're fine after weeding and another day you develop  
pain that doesn't go away. The same thing happens to a pitcher or a 
hard-serving tennis player despite conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Proven therapies, involving drugs, exercises or even surgery,  
exist to heal such injuries but preventing them from happening in 
the first place is something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, suggestions exist, and a good book has just come  
out aimed at conditioning you to minimize the chances of getting 
hurt while gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gardener's Fitness'' by Barbara Pearlman (Taylor Publishing  
Co., $12.95, paperback), a Manhattan fitness expert and a gardener, 
prescribes exercises, proper posture and attire and relaxation 
techniques. The 151-page book contains easy-to-follow instructions 
and helpful illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lets get down to earth and be real,'' Pearlman says,  
``gardening is an active, contact ``sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When is the last time you sat still in your garden?'' she  
asks, ``If you're not hauling heavy rocks, you're pushing a 
wheelbarrow, toting tools, dragging the hose, or whacking weeds. 
You're in perpetual motion, unless of course your idea of gardening 
is planting a pot of petunias or pansies on your patio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearlman identifies the body parts that work hardest in the  
garden as arms, knees, hands ``and, above all, your back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Back pain,'' she says, is ``the gardener's bugaboo. Unless  
your back is made of steel (in which case, you probably can't get 
into all the contorted positions gardening calls for) at some point 
during the season, your back is bound to protest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The very best defense against back pain is a good offense,  
which means strong abdominal muscles,'' Pearlman says. ``In 
essence, these muscles act as ``guy wires,'' to keep your back in 
line.'' She prescribes a series of abdominal strengthening 
exercises and also exercises to condition other muscles related to 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
	If, in spite of all this, back spasm suddenly strikes, Pearlman  
says stop your garden work immediately, head for the house and lie 
down on an ice pack for 20 minutes. That's just a beginner. Then do 
some exercises and maybe take a pain reliever. Repeat the sequence 
four or five times during the first day. In two or three days you 
should be better, she says, and if not, think of going to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearlman prescribes a variety of push-ups and weight-lifting  
exercises to strengthen arms. One way to strengthen hands, she 
says, is repetitive squeezing of a semisoft rubber ball. Aside from 
strengthening exercises, knee fitness involves proper squatting in 
the garden, Pearlman says. This means keeping your heels flat, 
``otherwise far too much pressure is placed on your knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing how to bend over and how to lift an object (or  
yourself) the correct way is crucial to gardening,'' Pearlman says. 
``The chance of straining your back is far greater if you neglect 
to bend your knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When carrying things, she says, ``you should use the strongest  
and largest joints and muscles (those in your arms) for the job to 
avoid direct pressure on your smallest joints and weakest muscles 
(those in your hands and fingers.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right way and a wrong way to move when you garden  
and making the right moves makes good garden sense,'' Pearlman 
says. ``It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Women Give Dying Family Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When someone falls terminally ill, it's usually a woman in the  
family who provides most of the day-to-day care, researchers 
reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, the first in a decade of how terminally ill patients  
get their care, found that the bulk of the care falls to the 
patient's wife, daughter or sister. The care can include complex 
nursing tasks such as changing feeding tubes and giving intravenous 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that nearly a quarter of those dying from  
diseases other than cancer fail to get all the kinds of care they 
need. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be a best-case scenario,'' said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel,  
a bioethecist at the National Institutes of Health who directed the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were based on 988 people whose doctors expected  
them to die within six months. Among those excluded from the study 
were people with disabling injuries, Alzheimer's and chronic 
illnesses, which generally require more intensive care for much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wakeup call for (doctors) to address the needs of  
care givers,'' said Suzanne Mintz, president of the National Family 
Caregivers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers interviewed terminal patients and their primary  
care giver in six cities and counties, both rural and urban, with 
varying levels of managed care. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
	-- About three-quarters of the primary care givers for terminally  
ill patients are women relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Those who are especially poor are more likely to receive help  
from paid care givers, such as home health agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	-- While women are called upon to help dying family members, they  
typically must rely on significantly more paid help when they 
themselves are dying. 
</P>
<P>
	-- About 15 percent of patients dying from cancer have unmet  
needs for care, compared with 23 percent of those dying from other 
illnesses. These requirements include rides to medical services, 
housekeeping, personal care such as bathing and dressing, and 
nursing care, sometimes including changing bandages or giving 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers speculated that doctors may be more comfortable  
in considering patients with cancer as dying, so they are more 
likely to arrange for health agencies to help with their care. 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel said his study shows the need for better end-of-life  
care for the three-quarters of terminally ill people dying of 
diseases other than cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	With hospitals discharging patients sooner and sicker than  
before, health professionals must recognize the importance of 
family care givers and provide training in the complex tasks 
expected of them, said Donna Wagner, director of gerontology at 
Towson University in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Universe May Be Younger Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The celestial yardstick commonly used for measuring outer space  
may have to be recalibrated, according to astronomers who say the 
universe may be expanding faster and could be younger than 
currently believed. 
</P>
<P>
	The team worked with new, more precise measurements of the  
distance to a far-off galaxy and reported its findings in today's 
issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since Edwin Hubble discovered the universe was expanding in  
1929, astronomers have sought to determine the rate of that 
expansion, called the Hubble constant, and whether the universe 
will continue expanding or eventually collapse in on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, astronomers have come up with  
increasingly more accurate measurements, and some believe their 
estimates are within 10 percent of the actual rate. 
</P>
<P>
	To reach these estimates, astronomers measure and compare  
distances to certain flickering stars called Cepheid variables. 
Astronomers use the brightness of Cepheids observed in far-off 
galaxies and compare them with Cepheids in a galaxy known as the 
Large Magellanic Cloud. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if a Cepheid variable in a galaxy of unknown  
distance is one fourth as bright as a Cepheid in the LMC, that 
galaxy is twice as far away as the LMC. The drop in brightness is 
always the inverse of the square of the distance -- a Cepheid in a 
galaxy three times as far away will be one ninth as bright. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, however, has been determining the distance to the  
LMC, which has been measured only to within 10 percent accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA researcher Eyal Maoz and his colleagues tried to get around  
the problem by using new, more precise measurements to another 
galaxy, known as NGC4258. These measurements are believed to be 
accurate to within 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	These new findings indicate ``something is probably wrong with  
the Cepheid calibration,'' said Maoz, who is at NASA's Ames 
Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. ``If it is correct, it has 
significant implications for our understanding of the universe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Cepheid distances are revised according to his findings, the  
rate at which the universe expands would increase 12 percent, plus 
or minus 9 percentage points. The age of the universe, meanwhile, 
would decrease by the same amount from the current estimate of 12 
billion to 13 billion years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take some time for the community to digest this, but  
it's definitely shaking the boat right now,'' Maoz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Galaxy NGC4258 may turn out to be a better yardstick,''  
Princeton University astronomer Bohdan Paczynski wrote in an 
accompanying commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that because of other recently discovered errors in  
celestial observations, the mistakes may cancel themselves out and 
the Hubble constant may not need to be revised after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Turner, chairman of astrophysics at the University of  
Chicago, said the significance of Maoz's work is unclear because of 
the large margin of error in the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The correction could be 12 percent plus or minus 9 percent,''  
Turner said. ``That means it could be almost zero as likely as it 
could be 20 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons Handle Life With No Jamal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons are slowly coming to  
grips with the idea of life without Jamal Anderson. The NFC 
champions can only hope Chris Chandler won't be out much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day Anderson hobbled into the training complex,  
dragging along the injured right knee that will keep him out for 
the season, Chandler returned to the practice field with the hope 
of playing Sunday against the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you miss a game, there's always pressure to get back  
in there,'' said Chandler, who didn't play in Monday night's loss 
to Dallas because of a strained hamstring. ``But yeah, it's a 
little more important now to get back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Chandler returns, he won't be handing off to the guy who  
set an NFL record with 410 carries and a franchise mark with 1,846 
yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's upsetting, particularly with the way things are going for  
us as a team this season,'' Anderson said Wednesday, referring to 
an 0-2 start after leading the Falcons to an improbable Super Bowl 
last season. ``To go down like I did was terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Anderson finished for the year after suffering a torn  
anterior cruciate ligament on his third carry against the Cowboys, 
there is even more need for Chandler to make a hasty return to the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 quarterback Tony Graziani has yet to make it through an  
entire game during his three years in the NFL, getting pulled early 
in the third quarter at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels a lot better than it felt last week,'' said Chandler,  
who looked a bit stiff, but took part in most of the drills. ``I'm 
very optimistic that if it continues to improve, I'll be good 
enough to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons talked bravely about carrying on without the player  
who defined their ball-control offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson carried an inordinate amount of the load last season,  
allowing Atlanta to lead the NFL in time of possession and keep its 
defense well rested. Counting 27 pass receptions, he had a direct 
hand in 44 percent of the Falcons' 993 plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamal did some great things for this team last year, and we  
were expecting him to do great things this year,'' receiver Terance 
Mathis said. ``Now, we've got to rally together and help each other 
out. If you're not blocking, not running routes, not catching the 
ball, you're not going to be successful no matter who's running the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the runner will be Byron Hanspard, a former  
2,000-yard rusher at Texas Tech who missed all of last season with 
a knee injury. He'll be supported by Ken Oxendine, a seventh-round 
draft pick in 1998 who has rushed for 50 yards in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody needs an opportunity to see what they can do when a  
starter goes down,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I have tremendous 
confidence in Byron. I have tremendous confidence in Ken. Are they 
Jamal Anderson? No. But can they run certain plays well? Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest question concerning Hanspard is the state of his  
left knee. In the final exhibition game of 1998, he tore the ACL 
and patella tendon, requiring surgery and a full year to 
recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't think he is 100 percent,'' Reeves said. ``Each  
week that he can go through and gain more confidence in that knee, 
the better football player he is going to be. We will see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Anderson went down Monday -- crumpling to the ground after  
trying to make a cut with no one around him -- Hanspard ran a 
career-high 19 times for 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is fine,'' he said. ``God has completely healed my  
knee. Yes, there's always room for it to get stronger, but I've not 
had any setbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanspard won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top college  
running back in 1996, when he had 2,084 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I need to carry the ball 33 times a game, I won't have a  
problem with that,'' Hanspard said. ``I've got to step up and be 
the man. That comes naturally for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is expected to undergo surgery in a couple of weeks. He  
plans to be fully recovered by the start of offseason workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm setting a timetable to be 100 percent by December,'' he  
said. ``If not then, it won't be much longer than that. I'm already 
making bets with the trainers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Falcons will have to play with a weakened  
hand the rest of this season. They placed Anderson on injured 
reserve and signed 5-foot-7 Winslow Oliver, who was waived by 
Carolina at the end of training camp and won't be mistaken by 
anyone for the player he's replacing on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the kind of things that cause the true character of  
your team to come out,'' defensive tackle Travis Hall said. ``When 
you lose one player, is that your team? I think we can rebound.''

<HEADLINE>  Strong Aftershocks Hit Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Teams from around the world streamed into  
Taiwan today to help rescue victims of the devastating earthquake 
as three strong aftershocks hit the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue efforts were complicated by today's aftershocks, which  
triggered mudslides, forced terror-stricken residents to scurry 
into the streets and cracked one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The aftershocks, with magnitudes of 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0, were the  
strongest of more than 2,000 that have rocked the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll from Tuesday's quake climbed to 2,003 people,  
with 4,400 injured, officials said. Some 2,600 people were believed 
to be trapped in rubble, but rescuers were finding more bodies than 
survivors as they bored into collapsed houses and high-rise 
apartment complexes across central Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers from Fairfax Co., Va., and Miami-Dade, Fla., arrived in  
Taiwan today and quickly found a conscious man trapped inside a 
caved-in apartment building in the town of Touliu. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty glad to see us,'' said Capt. Michael Reilly, one  
of the U.S. emergency workers who brought four sniffing dogs to 
Taiwan in hopes of saving as many lives as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 14 countries that dispatched earthquake specialists  
were the United States, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, 
Singapore, South Korea, Israel and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central News Agency placed the number of foreign specialists  
in the country at about 500, with more scheduled to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Geological Survey officials said Tuesday's quake had a  
preliminary magnitude of 7.6 -- about the same strength as the 
devastating tremor that killed more than 15,000 people in Turkey 
last month -- although Taiwanese seismologists initially put the 
magnitude at 7.3. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the foreign experts had assisted in rescue operations in  
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	After today's aftershocks, state radio said cracks had been  
discovered in one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs, the Sun Moon Lake 
Reservoir, and warned downstream residents to evacuate their homes. 
It said water would be released from the reservoir as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio report also said officials were evacuating two towns  
in west-central Taiwan where streams of mud slid into a river. 
Officials feared the blocked water flow would cause flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The aftershocks also were felt in Taipei, shaking buildings and  
sending many frightened citizens out of their homes and into the 
streets again. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, rescuers continued to pry carefully into the  
tottering Sungshan Hotel, hoping to find some of the estimated 30 
people inside still alive. Concrete sections dropped off the 
partially toppled 12-story building, periodically driving searchers 
and rescue vehicles back. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tungshih, a city of 60,000 people in a mountainous area of  
Taichung county, virtually every house was damaged and one in three 
was ruined, with all power, water and links to the outside cut off. 
People slept along sides of roads or in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	At a community center converted to a morgue, 105 bodies lay  
covered with saffron Buddhist robes. Offerings of canned drinks, 
biscuits, burning incense sticks and make-believe money were placed 
before the corpses. Many of the dead were children. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lin Yung-lung said rescuers were running out of body bags  
and needed refrigeration for the corpses. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the buildings that collapsed were new high-rises that  
have cropped up in the region during a building boom in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who identified himself only as Liu waited anxiously

He had managed to escape from a seventh-floor apartment with one 
child when the earthquake struck, but his wife and a second child

the quaking stopped,'' he said, unable to talk more about his 
traumatic experience. 
</P>

Tungshih was knocked out by the earthquake, making movement of 
rescue equipment into the area difficult.

quake struck in the wee hours, forcing people in their underwear

	The quake was Taiwan's deadliest since a 7.4 magnitude tremor  
hit the island in 1935, killing 3,276 people. Taiwan is hit by 
dozens of quakes each year, but most are centered in the Pacific

<HEADLINE>  Strong Aftershocks Hit Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Teams from around the world streamed into  
Taiwan today to help rescue victims of the devastating earthquake 
as three strong aftershocks hit the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue efforts were complicated by today's aftershocks, which  
triggered mudslides, forced terror-stricken residents to scurry 
into the streets and cracked one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The aftershocks, with magnitudes of 6.8, 6.1 and 6.0, were the  
strongest of more than 2,000 that have rocked the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll from Tuesday's quake climbed to 2,003 people,  
with 4,400 injured, officials said. Some 2,600 people were believed 
to be trapped in rubble, but rescuers were finding more bodies than 
survivors as they bored into collapsed houses and high-rise 
apartment complexes across central Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers from Fairfax Co., Va., and Miami-Dade, Fla., arrived in  
Taiwan today and quickly found a conscious man trapped inside a 
caved-in apartment building in the town of Touliu. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty glad to see us,'' said Capt. Michael Reilly, one  
of the U.S. emergency workers who brought four sniffing dogs to 
Taiwan in hopes of saving as many lives as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 14 countries that dispatched earthquake specialists  
were the United States, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, 
Singapore, South Korea, Israel and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central News Agency placed the number of foreign specialists  
in the country at about 500, with more scheduled to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Geological Survey officials said Tuesday's quake had a  
preliminary magnitude of 7.6 -- about the same strength as the 
devastating tremor that killed more than 15,000 people in Turkey 
last month -- although Taiwanese seismologists initially put the 
magnitude at 7.3. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the foreign experts had assisted in rescue operations in  
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	After today's aftershocks, state radio said cracks had been  
discovered in one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs, the Sun Moon Lake 
Reservoir, and warned downstream residents to evacuate their homes. 
It said water would be released from the reservoir as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio report also said officials were evacuating two towns  
in west-central Taiwan where streams of mud slid into a river. 
Officials feared the blocked water flow would cause flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The aftershocks also were felt in Taipei, shaking buildings and  
sending many frightened citizens out of their homes and into the 
streets again. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, rescuers continued to pry carefully into the  
tottering Sungshan Hotel, hoping to find some of the estimated 30 
people inside still alive. Concrete sections dropped off the 
partially toppled 12-story building, periodically driving searchers 
and rescue vehicles back. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tungshih, a city of 60,000 people in a mountainous area of  
Taichung county, virtually every house was damaged and one in three 
was ruined, with all power, water and links to the outside cut off. 
People slept along sides of roads or in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	At a community center converted to a morgue, 105 bodies lay  
covered with saffron Buddhist robes. Offerings of canned drinks, 
biscuits, burning incense sticks and make-believe money were placed 
before the corpses. Many of the dead were children. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lin Yung-lung said rescuers were running out of body bags  
and needed refrigeration for the corpses. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the buildings that collapsed were new high-rises that  
have cropped up in the region during a building boom in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who identified himself only as Liu waited anxiously  
outside a 14-story apartment building tilting at a 45-degree angle. 
He had managed to escape from a seventh-floor apartment with one 
child when the earthquake struck, but his wife and a second child 
were still trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even realize that the building had fallen over until

<HEADLINE> Congress Battles Over Dairy Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A battle among the nation's dairy farmers over  
the way that milk is priced has spilled over into Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight, which could lead to an increase in retail milk  
prices, is over an Agriculture Department plan for modernizing its 
Depression-era dairy pricing system and a separate effort by 
farmers in the Northeast and South to fix prices on a regional 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The tussle is taking place both on the House floor and in a  
Capitol backroom where House and Senate negotiators are working on 
USDA's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was expected to vote today to toss out USDA's new  
pricing system, which is set to take effect Oct. 1. It would cut 
consumer prices an estimated 2 cents a gallon while boosting income 
for farmers in the upper Midwest to the detriment of producers in 
the East and South. 
</P>
<P>
	Less certain was what the House-Senate conference committee  
that's working on the USDA spending bill would do with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of an alternative pricing system want to attach it to  
the must-pass spending measure along with authorization for the 
regional pricing cartels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation's dairy farmers are in a crisis,'' said Rep. Thomas  
Reynolds, R-N.Y. The alternative plan ``is critical for the 
long-term viability of farming in most states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House GOP leaders want to keep the dairy issue out of the  
spending bill, lawmakers said, and that forced the conference 
committee to break up for the night Tuesday without an agreement on 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in the East and South say the USDA plan would cost them  
as much as $200 million and drive many producers out of business. 
Producers overwhelmingly approved the plan in an August referendum, 
but opponents say that was only because there was no alternative 
for farmers to vote on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a railroad job. ... Nobody wanted it, and nobody  
supported it,'' said Heck Davis, a Georgia dairy farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional pricing organizations, such as one now operating in  
New England, set prices different than the federal system. The New 
England system is set to expire Oct. 1 unless Congress keeps it 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has pitted Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., against fellow  
liberals like Sen. Herb Kohl and Rep. David Obey, Wisconsin 
Democrats who are among the chief Democratic negotiators on the 
appropriations measure. Kohl threatened to sidetrack the 
legislation if Leahy succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue also could pose a problem for some senators up for  
re-election next year, including Republicans Rod Grams of 
Minnesota, considered one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents, 
and James Jeffords of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups back USDA's pricing plan and oppose the  
price-fixing compacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government's current system, guaranteed minimum prices  
for fluid milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the 
South and West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, 
because the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's new plan would narrow the pricing disparities and throw  
out the Eau Claire system. 
</P>
<P>
	The current system was designed to spur production in areas  
where it had been scarce. But today, milk can easily be trucked by 
refrigerated truck from one region to another, according to 
supporters of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	All but six states are covered by the federal system:  
California, Virginia, Wyoming, Montana, Hawaii and Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Abernathy Trial Jurors Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Investigators are looking into whether civil  
rights activists tampered with the jury in the trial of a former 
state senator accused of cheating the state out of expense money. 
</P>
<P>
	The theft case against Ralph D. Abernathy III, the son of a  
renowned civil rights leader, ended last week in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has been asked by  
the judge to look into an encounter between jurors and a group of 
civil rights leaders that included Coretta Scott King, GBI 
spokesman John Bankhead said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. King, New York activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, state Rep.  
Tyrone Brooks and others intercepted the jurors as they were going 
to lunch, according to law enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Abernathy's mother, Juanita, who also was with the group, said  
the meeting was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, in which Abernathy was accused of cheating the state  
out of about $13,000 in Senate expense money, ended two days later 
with a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Les Hankinson has said the encounter with Mrs.  
King's group had little bearing on the outcome of the case. He and 
other jurors blamed the mistrial on a juror who they said would not 
participate in deliberations.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Sues Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The way Attorney General Janet Reno  
explained it, the government has a duty to sue cigarette makers to 
recover billions of dollars taxpayers have spent treating sick 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Oscar Giles and others in America's tobacco belt see it,  
their country has gone to war with their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people apparently view the tobacco companies as cash cows  
or the Golden Goose. Even the Golden Goose runs out of eggs,'' said 
Giles, president of the union which represents workers at a plant 
where Philip Morris rolls out 730 million cigarettes every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department sued the nation's tobacco industry  
Wednesday, seeking billions from cigarette makers it accuses of 
waging a 45-year campaign ``to preserve their enormous profits 
whatever the cost in human lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges the companies have conspired since the 1950s  
to defraud and mislead the public. The industry concealed data that 
showed nicotine is addictive and smoking causes disease, sponsored 
biased research and suppressed development of safer cigarettes in 
violation of federal anti-racketeering law, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cigarette companies realized -- at least since 1953 -- that  
the truth poses a mortal threat to their businesses,'' Reno said in 
Washington. Federal health plans spend more than $20 billion a year 
treating smoking-related illnesses, which kill 400,000 people a 
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing internal company documents, Assistant Attorney General  
David Ogden traced the alleged conspiracy to a meeting of cigarette 
company chief executives at the Plaza Hotel in New York in January 
1954. They ``agreed there to wage a long-term public relations 
campaign based on fraud and based on deception,'' Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit names Philip Morris Inc.; Philip Morris Companies; R.J.  
Reynolds Tobacco Co.; American Tobacco Co.; Brown &AMP; Williamson 
Tobacco Corp.; British-American Tobacco P.L.C.; British-American 
Tobacco (Investments) Ltd.; Lorillard Tobacco Co. Inc.; Liggett and 
Myers Inc.; The Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Inc.; and the 
Tobacco Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Company lawyers questioned the government's case and motives,  
especially in light of decades of federal government warnings about 
the health dangers from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This blatantly political lawsuit is ... the height of  
hypocrisy,'' said Greg Little, associate general counsel of Philip 
Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeated legal assaults have taken a toll in Virginia and  
especially in Richmond, where tobacco is an economic mainstay. 
Philip Morris employs 6,900 people locally. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are nervous about their jobs'' Giles said.  
``We've just had seven months of four-day work weeks. That makes 
people very uneasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, the tobacco industry has agreed to pay nearly  
$250 billion over 25 years to settle lawsuits states brought to 
recover their costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fat, dumb and happy four years ago working five, six,  
seven days a week. Now I'm losing 20 percent of my pay,'' said 
Frank Holloman, who has put in 27 years at the Richmond plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia's ties to tobacco date to the 1600s, and painted images  
of tobacco leaves adorn the inside of the state Capitol dome. In 
1997, tobacco accounted for $4.6 billion of the state's $211 
billion economy, according to state figures. Virginia's tax on 
cigarettes -- 2.5 cents per pack -- is the nation's lowest. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leaf is slowly losing ground.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray Emerson has raised tobacco in Pittsylvania County all his  
life, and his son joined him in the family business. Now, Emerson 
sees bleak times ahead and is advising his grandson to stay out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see him stay on the farm but we just don't  
see any future in it,'' Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the place where we can't sell out because we can't  
get anything for our equipment. At the market, the price you get 
keeps going down. It's like we're caught in a squeeze. You keep 
throwing these lawsuits on top of it, it just doesn't seem worth 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sympathy for the tobacco industry, however, is by no means  
universal in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see them bankrupt the tobacco companies,''  
said Hilton Oliver, executive director of the Virginia Group to 
Alleviate Smoking in Public (GASP) in Virginia Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-eight to 99 percent of the people in Virginia have  
nothing to do with tobacco,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ripplewood May Take Over Japan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese authorities plan to allow the transfer of  
troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. to U.S.-based 
Ripplewood Holdings, Japanese newspapers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission will officially  
decide on the transfer as early as Monday, the influential Nihon 
Keizai business daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	If completed, it would be the first takeover of a major Japanese  
bank by a foreign company, the nationally circulated Asahi 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission officials were not available Thursday for comment on  
the report because of a national holiday in Japan. Officials at 
Ripplewood, a large New-York-based investment company, could not 
immediately be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, a Japanese government body overseeing the  
cleanup of the country's banking industry, has been discussing 
LTCB's transfer since the middle of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB is now under state control since being nationalized last  
year after being declared insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai said that the Japanese government will inject  
public funds $1.92 billion to $2.88 billion into a reformed LTCB on 
condition that Ripplewood continue loans to the bank's troubled 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	To secure the deal, Ripplewood will buy up LTCB shares by paying  
$9.61 million to the Deposit Insurance Corp., the Japanese 
government finance body which is now LTCB's sole shareholder, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripplewood will then pump $1.15 billion into the new LTCB, it  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB, once one of Japan's premier banks, was nationalized last  
October after regulators determined it would never recover from a 
mountain of bad loans. It was the first time the Japanese 
government had taken over a bank since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of LTCB's bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices in Japan collapsed in 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parties that reportedly have expressed interest in buying  
LTCB included Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsui Trust and 
Banking Co., both of Japan, and J.P. Morgan and Co. of the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Chief Judge Ignores Congressman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressman has received no response from a  
judge about why prosecutions of presidential friends Webster 
Hubbell and Charlie Trie were specially assigned to judges 
appointed by President Clinton, the congressman's office said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Aug. 26 letter to U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway  
Johnson, Rep. Howard Coble, who chairs the House Judiciary 
Committee's courts and intellectual property panel, said he had 
``concerns'' about news reports that Johnson bypassed the 
computerized system that randomly assigns cases to various judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble also said he was concerned about news reports that  
Democratic judges at the federal courthouse in the District of 
Columbia meet privately once a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee staffers have discussed the matters with the  
Administrative Office of the Courts, which oversees the judiciary, 
but ``we have not received a response'' from Johnson, said Ed 
McDonald, a spokesman for Coble, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the chief judge of federal court in the District of  
Columbia, assigned a tax evasion case against Hubbell to Judge 
James Robertson and a campaign fund-raising case against Trie to 
Judge Paul Friedman. Both judges are Clinton appointees. An appeals 
court ruling reinstated the Hubbell case after Robertson threw it 
out. Another appeals court decision reversed Friedman's ruling in a 
campaign fund-raising prosecution, resulting in a guilty plea by 
Trie several days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``In slightly more than one year's time, these two  
Clinton-appointed judges issued five decisions'' in various cases 
``that benefited friends and allies of President Clinton'' and ``in 
each case, these same judges were reversed or effectively 
reversed,'' Coble wrote Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are the press reports regarding the assignment of the''  
Hubbell and Trie ``cases essentially accurate?'' Coble asked the 
chief judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a story by The Associated Press, Johnson said she  
is authorized under local court rules to assign ``protracted or 
complex criminal cases to consenting judges when circumstances 
warrant.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Output a Mixed Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Domestic production rose at two major Japanese  
automobile manufacturers in August, was steady at a third and fell 
at two others, the companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic auto output is closely watched as an indicator of  
economic health because it accounts for a big part of Japan's 
industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some signs of an economic improvement, Japan is still  
struggling to pull out of its worst economic downturn since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Production in Japan was up 9.4 percent at both Toyota, Japan's  
largest automaker, and at Honda in August. Domestic production held 
steady at Nissan and was down 5.3 percent at Mazda and 15 percent 
at Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's domestic production climbed to 203,925 vehicles from  
August a year ago, marking its first increase in monthly production 
in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's sales in Japan rose 3.2 percent to 89,379, giving it a  
38.3 percent share of the domestic market, excluding mini-vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota said exports jumped 15.9 percent to 103,130 in August as  
shipments to North America, Europe and Asia rose. Toyota made 
127,442 vehicles at overseas plants, up 12.7 percent, helped mainly 
by rising output in North America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor said production in Japan rose 9.4 percent to 84,685  
vehicles, helped by improved domestic demand for its vehicles and 
rising exports to North America and Europe. It was Honda's second 
straight monthly rise in domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's domestic sales surged 19.1 percent to 46,561, led by  
continued popularity of its mini-vehicles and wagons. The company's 
total exports rose 15.7 percent to 37,821. Honda produced 84,000 
vehicles at overseas plants, up 3.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest automaker, said its  
domestic production stood at 96,038 in August, unchanged from a 
year ago, but its overseas production climbed 17.2 percent to 
81,497. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said domestic sales rose 1.5 percent to 47,283, while  
exports fell 8.5 percent to 44,842 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. reported declines in  
domestic production and sales as well as exports in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda's domestic output dropped 5.3 percent to 53,558 vehicles,  
as sales edged down 1.3 percent to 21,266 and exports dropped 15.5 
percent to 33,853. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda said overseas production, however, increased 13.4 percent  
to 9,538, rising for the fourth straight month, boosted by 
increased production of pickup trucks at its joint-venture with 
American automaker Ford Motor Co. in Thailand. Hiroshima-based 
Mazda is 33.3 percent owned by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors said domestic production fell 15.0 percent to  
64,375 vehicles, while sales edged down 0.90 percent to 32,746 in 
Japan. Its exports fell 27.5 percent to 33,981 vehicles. 
Mitsubishi's overseas production rose 11.5 percent to 50,501 in 
August.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Improve Minority Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly twice as many blacks as whites have bad  
credit, mortgage lender Freddie Mac said Tuesday as it began an 
initiative with several black colleges to get teen-agers and young 
adults started on a better track. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative furthers our mission to help make the American  
dream of decent accessible housing a reality,'' said Freddie Mac 
chairman and CEO Leland C. Brendsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasing the pool of qualified minority homebuyers will play  
an important role in future expansion of the home mortgage 
industry,'' Brendsel said. ``This initiative is not only good for 
our nation, but makes good business sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are the results of a survey Freddie Mac launched  
nine months ago with the help of five historically black colleges 
and universities -- Benedict College in Columbia, S.C.; Clark 
Atlanta University in Atlanta; Florida A&AMP;M University in 
Tallahassee; Howard University in Washington; and Saint Augustine's 
College in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Among all respondents, 30 percent had bad credit records. About  
47 percent of blacks and 34 percent of Hispanics had bad credit. 
Among whites surveyed, 27 percent had bad credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers were judged to have ``bad credit'' if they had been  
either 90 days late on a payment in the last two years or 30 days 
late on a payment more than once in the last two years, or have a 
record of delinquent liens, unpaid taxes on property or bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that while bad credit crosses racial and  
economic lines, it is pervasive among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among people with incomes under $25,000, 48 percent of black  
borrowers had bad credit, while 31 percent of white borrowers had 
bad credit. And even in the $65,000 to $75,000 income bracket, 34 
percent of blacks had bad credit, compared with 20 percent of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just simply a poor person without money trying to get  
what they see as the American dream. It's one who has met the 
American dream but cannot manage money,'' said Arthur Washington, 
dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Florida A&AMP;M University. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are now analyzing the results to develop an  
initiative, which will include some college courses, to help 
consumers obtain and maintain good credit. The National Urban 
League and the NAACP have agreed to help implement the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern are college students, who are often  
bombarded with credit card offers after enrolling in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole notion of developing a curriculum that can be taught  
would aid in that regard, would arm them as to what to do when you 
receive a credit card that says you have a $500 limit and you 
didn't even apply,'' said Barron H. Harvey, dean of the School of 
Business at Howard University. Harvey said Howard would likely have 
such a curriculum in place next year. Other schools have similar 
plans under way. 
</P>
<P>
	At 18 years old, Jackie Blandon, who is Hispanic, is the type of  
student the program aims to help. She has managed to get six credit 
cards since entering the University of Maryland last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for another job just to help pay them off,''  
Blandon said. ``I never apply for one. They always send it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes forever to pay it off. It's like no spending money  
whatsoever,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Mac, which has contributed $2 million to the effort so  
far, began the initiative amid statistics that show that 46 percent 
of blacks own homes, compared with 72 percent of whites. Poor 
credit is often cited as one of the leading factors in rejection of 
mortgage applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12,000 respondents to the survey were between the ages of 20  
and 40 and with incomes of up to $75,000. The margin of error for 
the survey is plus or minus 1 percentage point.

<HEADLINE> USOC Wants Samples Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee wants  
drug and urine samples from the Sydney and Salt Lake City Games 
preserved in the event better drug-testing methods become available 
in the future, Olympics officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Schultz, executive director of the USOC, said some new  
tests already are available, but long-term standards have not yet 
been developed for them so they may not be used for the Sydney 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz met Wednesday with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House  
drug czar, to discuss ways to prevent and detect the use of banned 
drugs in sports, not only the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the use of drugs to improve performance has  
reached epidemic proportions, and he said it's no longer limited to 
the NCAA and professional sports. ``It's in the Little League, and 
even high school competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said proposals from the International Olympic  
Committee for drug testing are unacceptable, because it's governed 
by a board ``acting in secrecy.'' He said the IOC insists on 
following Swiss corporate law when it comes to drug-testing, even 
though the United States and Europe foot most of the bill for 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said it would be prudent to save urine and blood  
samples from Olympic champions to be tested years later when better 
tests become available. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are ways for us to put down markers for those who  
achieve and win,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the samples should be taken ``so even if 20 years  
from now, if the tests are available,'' the samples could be tested 
and violators stripped of their awards. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the use of banned drugs hit a peak after it was  
learned that the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire was using Andro, 
a substance that fits three of the four requirements for a steroid. 
The drug is not banned in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was proud when McGwire renounced use of the drug, and  
set a standard for young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's playing with the God-given talents he's got,''  
McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there has to be some standardization among all  
sports, not just the Olympic Games. He said many professional 
players are now going into Olympic competition and finding that the 
rules are different. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is, there is no common standard,'' he said, noting  
that the Olympic ban on Andro didn't apply to McGwire. ``The 
athlete is in an almost untenable position.''

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Mitchell Benched Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Scott Mitchell envisioned himself  
duplicating the 1998 season of Randall Cunningham, who resurrected 
his career under the guidance and direction of offensive whiz Brian 
Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	Much to his dismay, Mitchell has become this year's version of,  
well, Scott Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Mitchell lost his starting job with the Detroit  
Lions after the second week of the season. He now finds himself in 
the same position with the Baltimore Ravens, having dropped to 
third on the depth chart after two straight ineffective 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, replaced by Stoney Case in the third quarter of  
Sunday's 23-20 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, has thrown four 
interceptions and just one touchdown. He's 24-for-56 for 236 yards 
and dead last in the AFC with a dismal 31.5 quarterback rating. 
</P>
<P>
	That's hardly what coach Billick had in mind when he helped  
mastermind the trade that brought Mitchell to Baltimore in March. 
The Ravens, and Mitchell, hoped a change of scenery would enable 
him to display the talent he showed in 1995, when the left-hander 
threw 32 touchdown passes for the Lions and topped the 4,000-yard 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick had a profound effect on Cunningham last year while he  
was the Minnesota Vikings' offensive coordinator. Cunningham, who 
played in only five games in 1997, finished with an NFL-best 106.0 
quarterback rating and became one of the year's biggest comeback 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was set for Mitchell to do the same following a season  
in which he languished on the bench for the final 14 games. But 
Case will start Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, while Mitchell 
will likely be deemed inactive as the third quarterback behind Tony 
Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is I didn't play good, for whatever reason. It  
doesn't matter,'' Mitchell said Wednesday. ``The coach felt like we 
needed a change. I'm disappointed about it. I feel like I just 
haven't played to how I'm capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, 31, bemoaned his fate in Detroit. It's no easier the  
second time around, but he's not feeling sorry for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``How did he react? The same way anyone in that position  
would,'' Billick said. ``You're not particularly happy with it and 
you don't necessarily see it the same way. But you're going to go 
do your job and be part of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell led stretching exercises during Wednesday's practice,  
but there is some question as to whether he will ever get the 
chance to lead the Ravens to victory on a Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way this business is,'' he said. ``So I've got to  
buckle down, get to work and help the team any way I can. I've got 
to try to keep my sanity and hope I get another chance to go out 
there.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Is Magic Number in Estate Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Three years is the magic number in estate  
planning. To put it bluntly, it sometimes can save you a lot of 
money if you live at least three years after giving away part of 
your estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Estate tax problems can occur if you die within three years of  
making certain types of gifts,'' says E.G. McBroom, an estate 
planning expert at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``People may give away an ownership interest in something, such  
as a life insurance policy or their home, thinking the gift will 
keep the asset out of their estate so it won't face federal estate 
taxes,'' McBroom says. ``But if they die within three years of the 
transfer, certain assets will still be included in their estate and 
be subject to tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, you don't need to worry about federal estate taxes  
unless your estate is valued at your death at more than $650,000 in 
1999, or $675,000 in 2000. But if your estate value exceeds that 
total, you may find it beneficial to give away some of your estate 
while you are still alive, says McBroom. The key is knowing what's 
best to give away. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common gifting mistake involves life insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	``People often read that by transferring the ownership of life  
insurance in which they are the insured to an irrevocable life 
insurance trust for their children, they can keep the policy's 
death benefit out of their estate,'' McBroom says. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they may be unaware of, however, is if they die within  
three years of that transfer the death benefit would be included in 
their taxable estate. In short, they've given up ownership of the 
policy, which includes the right to change beneficiaries or to 
borrow against the policy, yet they've not achieved the estate tax 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One way to avoid the three-year wait is to first set up the  
irrevocable trust and have the trust buy the life insurance on your 
life. The trust owns the policy and there is no three-year rule. 
McBroom cautions that if you already own life insurance, don't drop 
it until the trust has completed purchase of new insurance, just in 
case it turns out that you are no longer insurable. 
</P>
<P>
	McBroom says the three-year rule also doesn't apply if you  
transfer into a trust life insurance you own on someone else's 
life, such as your spouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The home is another asset that faces the three-year rule, says  
McBroom. People often learn that they can avoid probate on their 
home by transferring an ownership interest in the home (called 
``remainder interest'') to their children while retaining the 
lifetime right to live in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps years later the parents or surviving parent become so  
ill they have to go to a nursing home or other long term care 
facility. At that point, they may give up their lifetime rights to 
stay in the home and let their children become full owners. 
However, if the parent dies within three years of giving up their 
lifetime rights, the home will be included in the parent's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	The same issue arises with revocable trusts. It's popular for  
people to set up revocable living trusts in order to avoid probate. 
However, when they learn that the assets held in the trust will be 
included in their estate, they decide to convert it to an 
irrevocable trust. However, as before, says McBroom, they will have 
to live at least three years; otherwise, the assets come back into 
their estate for federal estate tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, says McBroom, an irrevocable trust set up and funded  
from scratch, instead of converted from a revocable trust, doesn't 
face the three-year rule, unless the crator of the trust transfers 
life insurance into it or retains certain specified rights to the 
trust. The creator of the trust could die the day after the trust 
is created and assets used to fund the trust such as mutual funds, 
securities, and cash would not be included in the creator's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	McBroom says some people may still be under the impression that  
what was called the ``contemplation of death'' rule still applies 
to lifetime transfers. That rule said that the three-year rule 
applied to all assets that were transferred. But the rule was 
changed in 1981, and now the three-year-wait rule only applies to 
the gifting of life insurance ownership and gifting of other assets 
when the donor retains certain specified rights such as the 
lifetime right to use or income or the right to revoke the 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is to anticipate these transfers far  
enough ahead as you can,'' McBroom says. ``Depending on your 
circumstances, you may then decide whether it's better to give up 
control of life insurance or a home, versus securities or other 
assets not covered by the three-year wait.'' 
</P>

It's just a sore shoulder basically.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Hoping for Statement Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The national spotlight is something  
Virginia Tech has openly craved during its rise into almost weekly 
residence in the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	With non-conference schedules that have included the likes of  
Akron, Alabama-Birmingham and Arkansas State in recent years, and 
playing in a conference that has been declining in stature, 
exposure has often been hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	That all changes Thursday night when Lane Stadium will be the  
site of the Hokies' game against tradition-rich Clemson. ESPN will 
televise nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	No disrespect to Clemson (1-1), but the Hokies come in ranked  
No. 8, the highest in school history, and don't expect to waste the 
opportunity to show the country that Virginia Tech football is a 
burgeoning phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be probably the greatest atmosphere  
we've ever had at Virginia Tech,'' coach Frank Beamer, in his 12th 
season, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to play in front of a big crowd and a  
national audience, you shouldn't be playing college football,'' 
linebacker Jamel Smith added. ``You've got to get excited for 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies (2-0) have had 10 days to watch tapes of how the  
Tigers picked apart Virginia two weeks ago, beating them 33-14 in 
Death Valley as Brandon Streeter enjoyed a career day with 343 
passing yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also have sweet memories of a year ago. Last September  
at Clemson, the Hokies rattled Streeter early and romped to a 
stunning 37-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Corey Moore said Tuesday he knows Clemson was  
feeling pretty good after routing the Cavaliers, but the Virginia 
Tech defense that intercepted four passes off Streeter in 1998 
won't be any kinder this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that those guys are feeling confident, but they  
haven't seen anybody play defense or swarm to the ball like we're 
going to,'' Moore said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers under first-year coach Tommy Bowden surprised  
Virginia with a no-huddle, pass-oriented attack and kept them on 
their heels throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing 13-10 at home to Marshall in their opener, the  
victory over Virginia was a big step for the Tigers, Bowden said. 
But it's nothing compared to what the program could gain for its 
rise back to prominence Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each week, it's a little bit better performance until you are  
ultimately headed in the right direction,'' Bowden said. ``I wish 
it could happen overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In victories over James Madison and UAB, Virginia Tech allowed  
an average of 136.5 yards. That's No. 1 in the nation, but a figure 
some view with skepticism because the competition wasn't exactly 
top 25 material. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore thinks Thursday night could help answer the critics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel like we have to make a statement,'' he said,  
``but it's a great opportunity for us to make a statement.''

<HEADLINE> Report Downplays TV 'Whitewash' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four of the six broadcast networks have a higher  
percentage of blacks as regular characters in prime-time comedies 
and dramas than the general population, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by TN Media suggests television is no whitewash, as  
some civil rights groups have charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP is considering a boycott of network television because  
of what it considers a dearth of minorities on TV. Hispanic groups 
have similar complaints, and are in the midst of a two-week 
``brownout'' urging their followers not to watch TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by TN Media, which advises companies on TV  
advertising, said 18 percent of CBS's characters this fall are 
black, as are 14 percent of ABC's. Blacks represent about 13 
percent of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight percent of NBC's characters are black, and 7 percent of  
Fox's. 
</P>
<P>
	The two developing networks, which both air shows that  
specifically appeal to a black audience, do much better. On UPN, 45 
percent of the characters are black. Twenty-three percent are black 
on the WB. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-network average is 16 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The networks seem to be fairly representative,'' said Steve  
Sternberg of TN Media. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how much the percentages changed after the NAACP  
made diversity a public issue. With the situation was pointed out 
to the networks, several shows in production began adding minority 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People said the organization is equally concerned about the 
lack of minority executives, writers and production people at the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we're glad that there are a number of minority  
characters on camera,'' said the NAACP's John White, ``but we're 
still saying this is more than a matter of who's on screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3 percent of the prime-time characters on the networks are  
minorities other than blacks, the report said. Hispanics alone make 
up 9 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Sternberg argued that the belief that blacks were much better  
represented on screen during the 1970s and 1980s is not true. And 
he disagreed with the notion that networks don't cater to blacks 
because advertisers are only interested in young, upscale whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone appealing to the same audience hurts us all, viewers  
and advertisers alike,'' he said. ``It limits our choices, further 
polarizes the audience and contributes to network ratings 
erosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TN Media's study of viewing habits indicated that CBS is the  
most popular network among black viewers, as it is now with all 
viewers. Blacks watch nearly 72 hours of television, on average, 
each week, while whites watch 50 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half of all Hispanic television viewing is of  
Spanish-language television, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Wagner Strains Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Houston Astros reliever Billy Wagner has a  
slightly strained ligament in his left elbow and is listed as 
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, one of baseball's most dominating closers with his  
100-mph fastball and 37 saves, felt a twinge in the elbow while 
getting the final two outs in the eighth inning of the Astros' 6-3 
victory Tuesday in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner was angry at not being allowed to pitch the ninth inning  
and get the save, but manager Larry Dierker said he wasn't about to 
risk exposing Wagner to a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one who thought he should go back out was Billy,''  
Dierker said. ``We're not going to take a chance, because we're not 
going anywhere without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner has converted 37 of 40 save opportunities, allowing only  
five hits while pitching 20 consecutive scoreless innings in 17 
games since Aug. 13. He has more saves than hits allowed (30). 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, attempting to win a third consecutive NL Central  
title, have eight games remaining following Wednesday night's game 
in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> FBI Decries Freed FALN Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top FBI official told Congress he regards  
Puerto Rican militants freed in a grant of clemency by President 
Clinton as terrorists who continue to represent a threat to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The description by Neil Gallagher, the FBI's assistant director  
for national security, came Tuesday as President Clinton explained 
anew why he granted clemency, this time in a five-page letter to a 
Democratic congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans released a draft letter prepared for  
FBI Director Louis J. Freeh stating the FBI was ``unequivocally 
opposed'' to the clemency offer. That letter to Rep. Henry Hyde, 
R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was among 
thousands of documents sent to Congress by the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's own letter said the offer was motivated not by  
politics, as critics have charged, but out of concern for the 
``extremely lengthy sentences'' the separatists were serving. 
</P>
<P>
	``No form of violence is ever justified as a means of political  
expression in a democratic society based on the rule of law,'' 
Clinton wrote. ``Our society believes, however, that a punishment 
should fit a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those who had their sentences commuted were serving  
between 35 and 90 years for seditious conspiracy and possession of 
weapons and explosives. None had been convicted of a violent crime, 
the White House noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wrote the letter to Rep. Henry Waxman of California,  
senior Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, which 
held a hearing on the clemency Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The explanation from the president came just days after the  
White House announced it was invoking executive privilege to block 
Congress from access to documents and high-level testimony 
pertaining to the clemency. The House panel hearing testimony 
Tuesday had issued subpoenas to get that information. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defended that decision in his letter, noting that the  
granting of clemency is an exclusive power of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``In vesting the pardon power to the president alone, the  
framers of the Constitution ensured that clemency could be given 
even in cases that might be unpopular and controversial,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher's testimony marked the first time that federal law  
enforcement officials have testified on the issue. Also on hand 
were officials from the Justice Department and the Bureau of 
Prisons. They were barred from answering direct questions about the 
clemency, because of the White House executive privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher described the activities of the FALN -- the violent  
organization to which most of those offered clemency belonged. 
Afterward he was asked by the committee's chairman, Rep. Dan 
Burton, R-Ind., if they should have been freed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think they should be out on the street? I think these are  
criminals and that they are terrorists and that they represent a 
threat to the United States,'' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was one of several law enforcement organizations opposed  
to the clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the continuing threat of the FALN and its sister  
group in Puerto Rico, Los Macheteros, Galllagher ticked off a 
handful of more recent bombings in Chicago and Puerto Rico believed 
to have been conducted by the groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer of clemency has come under fire from some who  
have accused him of making it to boost first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's popularity among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
Mrs. Clinton is considering a bid for the Senate from New York in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said in his letter that ``political considerations  
played no role in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FALN -- the Spanish abbreviation for the Armed Forces of  
National Liberation -- is responsible for a wave of bombings of U.S. 
civilian and military targets in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
that left six dead.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Lewis Stalker Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The man who spent more than four years in  
prison for stalking Jerry Lewis wants the comedian to know he's 
sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize and it'll never happen again,'' Gary Benson said  
in a phone call to the syndicated ``Inside Edition'' television 
show on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said he called Lewis about 12 times and went to his house  
a couple of times. He said he didn't realize his actions would have 
such an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I did anything,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Benson, a 56-year-old diagnosed chronic schizophrenic, was  
convicted in 1995 of aggravated stalking and is scheduled to be 
released Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a court granted Lewis' request to extend a 1992  
protection order against Benson until Sept. 21, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit, Lewis alleges Benson called him as  
recently as May and said, ``Jerry, I'll be out in 65 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benson's attorney said his client plans to reside in another  
state upon his release.

<HEADLINE> Senate Reorganizes Nuclear Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to months of uproar over  
allegations of Chinese espionage, Congress today overwhelmingly 
agreed to create a new nuclear weapons agency in the most dramatic 
reorganization of the Energy Department in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization was included in a widely popular $288.9  
billion defense bill that includes a military pay raise and a 4.4 
percent across-the-board increase in Pentagon spending, including 
more money for military housing and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the defense measure 93-5, following House  
approval of the bill last week by a likewise veto-proof 375-45 
vote. The administration has indicated a possible veto because of 
concerns about the nuclear weapons agency, but lawmakers said a 
veto would be politically difficult given the defense bill's 
overwhelming bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	While some Democrats voiced concern about the new weapons agency  
within the Energy Department, they said the defense measure was too 
important to have it sidetracked on the reorganization issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new agency will not be totally independent, the  
legislation insulates the department's nuclear weapons programs and 
consolidate authority over the government's three nuclear weapons 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization marks the most far reaching fallout yet to  
months of controversy about lax security at the Energy Department 
and the alleged theft by China of nuclear warhead secrets from U.S. 
weapons labs, dating back 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure say the new National Nuclear Security  
Administration within the department would streamline control over 
nuclear weapons programs and provide increased accountability for 
security and counterintelligence efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	While supporting some reorganization, Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson expressed strong reservations about the proposal as it 
moved through Congress. He argued the new agency would be given too 
much autonomy and would interfere in security and 
counterintelligence improvements he already has made in response to 
Chinese espionage concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has said he likely would recommend that President  
Clinton veto the legislation. There was no immediate reaction to 
the Senate vote from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president would be crazy to veto it,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl,  
R-Ariz., who said he was confident of getting a veto-proof majority 
on the Senate bill, including the DOE reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Although voicing concern about the nuclear agency, Sen. Carl  
Levin, D-Mich., said he too would vote for the changes because he 
didn't want to jeopardize the defense bill. The $288.8 billion 
defense measure includes military pay raises and a 4.4 percent 
overall increase in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., presented their case for 
the nuclear agency in a meeting with the president earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left with the impression ... there is not much fervor down  
at the White House for a veto,'' Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said he told the president ``it's high time'' to  
separate the nuclear weapons programs from the rest of the Energy 
Department. He said he and Warner made the argument that another 
alternative would have been to remove the nuclear program entirely 
from the Energy Department and put it under an independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici rejected suggestions the reorganization would harm  
environmental or worker protection. The new agency would still be 
subject to all environmental laws, he said,. 
</P>
<P>
	But some critics of the proposal said the new agency would be  
insulated from the Energy Department's own officials responsible 
for ensuring that environmental and health protection requirements 
are met.

<HEADLINE> Veto for GOP Tax Bill Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a veto of the Republican tax cut all but  
official, the White House is criticizing Congress for ``running up 
to the deadline'' on approving appropriations bills before the end 
of the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday the public  
should be concerned that members of Congress are engaging in 
``gimmicks and tricks'' over the budget process, while the majority 
of the 13 appropriations measures before lawmakers have not been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has passed just four of the 13 spending bills for the  
fiscal year 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is once again running up to the deadline with very  
little of the work they're charged to do having been done,'' 
Lockhart said. ``So I think the fact that we're not getting a 
straightforward process, and that it is again this year well 
behind, is something that should be a concern to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has already promised to veto the 10-year, $792  
billion tax cut proposal that Republican leaders forwarded to him 
days ago. White House officials spent Tuesday trying to decide how 
Clinton would carry out the veto, which is expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton, hampered by hoarseness, decided against  
holding the veto ceremony today because that ``would be 
counterproductive to the voice rehabilitation project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax bill would use part of a projected 10-year budget  
surplus to reduce all federal income tax rates by 1 percentage 
point, cut capital gains taxes, phase out estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax and ease the ``marriage penalty'' paid by 
many two-income couples. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter accompanying the legislation, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
urged Clinton to sign the bill to ``affirm the principles of 
smaller and smarter government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has contended the legislation would take away money that  
is needed to preserve Social Security and Medicare, and ensure 
adequate spending levels for education and defense programs.

<HEADLINE> Debt Relief Proposals Get a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration asked Congress on  
Tuesday to support a sharp increase in debt relief for the world's 
poorest countries in a move that supporters praised as the dramatic 
gesture needed to salvage the effort from defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan to offer $90 billion in debt relief to the world's  
poorest nations, many of them in Africa, was endorsed in June by 
the world's seven wealthiest countries in Cologne, Germany, at 
their annual economic summit. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the proposal since then has run into roadblocks  
including a campaign by the gold industry to block direct sales of 
gold from the International Monetary Fund's reserves to finance 
part of the debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. officials indicated Tuesday they believe they were  
close to overcoming all objections in time for the debt relief 
package to win approval at next week's joint annual meetings of the 
182-nation IMF and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters the  
administration had sent Congress a new request to more than triple 
the amount the United States will offer in debt relief in the new 
fiscal year, hoping to set an example for other rich countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the administration's budget had included $120  
million to support debt relief in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 
1. But Summers said the new request boosts that total to $370 
million, an increase of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also asked Congress to approve another $600  
million over three more years, amounting to a total U.S. 
contribution of $970 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential moral policy to write off debts to nations in  
significant parts of the world where a child is more likely to die 
by the age of five than attend secondary school,'' Summers told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jubilee 2000, a coalition of poverty and religious groups, is  
pressing the debt relief effort through an aggressive lobbying 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Amgott, a spokesman for the private aid agency Oxfam  
International, praised the administration's proposal, saying it 
should spur other wealthy nations, the IMF and the World Bank to 
give more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Summers is making clear that the United States will  
do what it can to keep the commitment made at Cologne,'' Amgott 
said. ``This is a very positive development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, officials said the IMF was close to approving an  
alternative to its original plan to raise its share of the debt 
relief through sales of gold on the open market. That original 
proposal drew heavy opposition from members of Congress from Utah 
and other gold-producing states that feared it would depress 
further world gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of direct sales, the IMF is considering a proposal to  
sell 14 million ounces of its gold to member nations -- not 
including the debt-relief countries -- at market prices and let them 
use the gold to pay for their own IMF loans coming due. Such a 
circular transaction would let the IMF revalue the gold from the 
$47 per ounce on its books to market prices, currently above $250 
per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF is being forced into this convoluted exercise because  
its rules prohibit an outright revaluation of its gold reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., a leading supporter of debt relief  
who initiated the new gold sales proposal, said he was optimistic 
Congress will approve the administration's increased funding 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of funding debt relief is $1.20 a year for every man,  
woman and child in the United States over the next three years and 
the cost of not doing it will be the death of tens of thousands of 
people every day,'' said Bachus. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration released a fact sheet estimating that if  
wealthy creditor countries and multinational organizations meet the 
obligations envisioned by the Cologne initiative, it would reduce 
the debt held by the 33 poorest nations from $127 billion to $37 
billion, a cut of $90 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the fact sheet said Mozambique's annual  
debt-financing costs would be cut in half, from more than 30 
percent of the government's budget to about 15 percent, freeing up 
$30 million a year that could be used for health care or education. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters he hoped  
the upcoming meetings would resolve the issue, including how the 
World Bank will finance its share of the debt relief proposal.

<HEADLINE> UN: World Population Will Reach 6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The world's population is expected to top 6  
billion next month, with most of the growth occurring in poor 
regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, according to 
U.N. figures released today. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the midst of the greatest wealth the world has ever seen, 1  
billion people still live without the fundamental elements of human 
dignity -- clean water, enough food, secure housing, basic education 
and basic health care,'' said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director 
of the United Nations Population Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Africa's population is the world's fastest-growing -- more than  
doubling to 767 million since 1960 -- although AIDS has cut life 
expectancy dramatically and access to basic services and jobs is 
limited, according to the State of the World Population Report 
1999. Asia's population has doubled to 3.6 billion over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, North America and European growth has slowed or  
stopped altogether as more couples decide to have less than the two 
children needed to ``replace'' themselves, the report noted. The 
United States is the only industrial country where increases are 
still projected, largely as a result of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	The report warned that the demographic shifts will need to be  
accompanied by policy shifts so developing regions can offer jobs 
and services to their growing populations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations reviewed a 20-year action plan, drawn up by  
179 countries in Cairo in 1994, and found two-thirds of the 
countries had introduced policies to encourage gender equality and 
that more than a third had updated health care policies. But Sadik 
stressed that the action plan was largely underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need $5.7 billion from the international community. We have  
$2 billion and $2.5 billion will have to be spent on Africa 
alone,'' Sadik said. 
</P>
<P>
	The review found ``far too many'' women in developing countries  
are denied access to education, family planning, contraception, and 
decent health care. Every year, 70,000 women die from unsafe 
abortions and, every minute, more than one woman dies from problems 
related to childbirth and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In developing countries reproduction is the single greatest  
threat to their health,'' said Sadik. ``Women are urged by society 
that that is their role, but then they're not really supported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted that women overall have been having fewer  
children, but so many are of childbearing age that birth rates have 
continued at a rate of about 78 million per year. That trend looks 
likely to continue, given that almost half the world's population 
is under the age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 8.9 billion,  
markedly lower than the 9.4 billion predicted by the United Nations 
two years ago, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the lower figure takes into account the ravages of the  
HIV/AIDS virus and increased mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa 
and parts of the Indian subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 29 African countries, average life expectancy has been cut by  
seven years as a result of AIDS. Half of those infected are under 
the age of 24 and there is an urgent need to improve health care 
and education, the United Nations said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Botswana, where one of every four adults has the virus, life  
expectancy dropped from 61 years in the 1980s to 47 today -- and is 
expected to plunge to 38 by 2010, the report said. Despite 
Botswana's crisis, however, fertility rates continue to be high and 
the population is expected to nearly double by 2050, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued population growth also affected environmental trends,  
which led to collapsed fisheries, shrinking forests and the 
extinction of plants and animals, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the real choices we will face in the 21st century is  
how many species and ecosystems we are willing to eliminate in 
order to make more space for human activities,'' it warned. 
</P>
<P>
	On the positive side, the United Nations noted that mortality  
rates are dramatically falling, including infant mortality, which 
has dropped by two-thirds. Average life expectancy rose from 46 to 
66 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has designated Oct. 12 as the ``Day of 6  
Billion.''

<HEADLINE> Never Alone When TV Talks to You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On most TV dramas and comedies, the characters  
are happy to talk to one another. 
</P>
<P>
	But on several new series, they also talk to themselves ... and  
to you. 
</P>
<P>
	Just take a look at Fox's high school dramedy ``Get Real.'' At  
the hospital after Meghan's brother Cameron cracks up his car, 
Meghan pulls a ``gotcha'' on the viewer: ``You think we're gonna 
kill my brother?'' she says, laughing into the camera. ``In the 
first episode?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when the parents are summoned to a conference about Cameron,  
both are startled by how young the vice principal is. This you 
learn, dear viewer, as their unspoken reactions surface as 
voice-overs: 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron's father: ``What is she -- nine?''  
</P>
<P>
	Cameron's mom: ``I've got ice cubes older than her.''  
</P>
<P>
	Shakespeare knew. A soliloquy can be very handy for putting  
across sentiments that would be awkward to express to another 
character, or hard, if not impossible, to convey visually. 
</P>
<P>
	A few centuries later, TV's ``Burns and Allen Show'' of the  
1950s allowed patriarch George Burns to adjourn to his den, view 
the family downstairs on his magic TV, comment on the action, then 
rejoin it as if he'd never left. 
</P>
<P>
	And a decade ago, ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' starred the  
stand-up comic as a stand-up comic with a TV show. He and his 
friends all knew they were on a TV show, and frequently remarked 
upon it, even as they were swept up in the stories it depicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Now TV's newly fashionable out-of-body experiences (out of the  
body of the story, that is) continue to serve a number of useful 
and entertaining purposes. A few well-chosen words of narrative can 
do wonders to supply exposition, ease a transition or paper over a 
gap in the plot-line. 
</P>
<P>
	And by going straight to the viewer with his or her message, a  
character mimics the behavior you expect from the hucksters, 
entertainers, journalists and pundits who make up the rest of TV's 
on-screen population. 
</P>
<P>
	You've long been accustomed to this entre-nous relationship with  
TV personalities. So on a TV drama or comedy, it feels right to be 
directly addressed, to be made privy to a character's private 
thoughts, to hear a wisecrack the other characters don't share. 
</P>
<P>
	At a party, Meghan alerts you to another girl's fashion faux  
pas: ``Platform shoes! Hmmmph. Those who forget history are doomed 
to repeat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Get Real'' (airing tonight at 9 p.m. EDT) isn't the only  
new series that talks to you. 
</P>
<P>
	Little wonder. This is the Age of Irony, when seemingly no  
thought or action is complete without a mocking addendum. This is 
also the Age of Self-Examination, when you are expected to ponder 
to death every moment of your life. 
</P>
<P>
	On the NBC sitcom ``Mike O'Malley'' (airing Tuesdays), 30-ish  
single guy Mike interrupts the story for a flashback chronicling 
how he lost his girlfriend or for a pledge to the audience that 
he'll win her back. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fox's comedy ``Malcolm in the Middle'' (premiering in  
January), 9-year-old Malcolm is a knowing observer of his nutty 
household, as well as an obliging participant. 
</P>
<P>
	In one scene, Malcolm's mother tries to cheer him up as he faces  
his dark future as a genius in an accelerated class. ``Any kid who 
makes fun of you,'' she snaps, ``is a creepy little loser who'll 
end up working in a car wash.'' Malcolm turns to the camera: ``That 
shouldn't make me feel better. But it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the WB's post-collegiate romance ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' (premiering  
Sunday), David ``Jill'' Jillefsky is about to run into scrumptious 
Jacqueline ``Jack'' Barrett as you hear him, in voice-over, 
fretting over his current girlfriend: ``Elisa was the kind of girl 
I could spend the rest of my life with, y'know? It's just hard to 
know when the rest of your life is supposed to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Fox's ``The Badland'' (premiering Oct. 15), Ryan Caulfield,  
the rookie cop, uses voice-overs to confide his excitement and 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
	And on ABC's drama ``Once and Again'' (airing Tuesdays), the  
narrative is intercut with play-by-play commentary from Rick or 
Lilly, the single parents who are falling in love. Shot in 
black-and-white, these sequences are staged as if each of the 
characters were being interviewed, allowing them to reflect on the 
action, or themselves, in safe isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not very good when people pull away,'' Lilly muses in one  
of these scenes. ``I always think that it's something I did. I 
guess I take responsibility for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But among the season's newcomers it's ``Get Real'' that bursts  
the dramatic ``fourth wall'' most rambunctiously. 
</P>
<P>
	When high schooler Meghan hears a fellow student squeal in  
delight at landing admission to a prestige college, she scoffs to 
herself. Big deal -- she got in, too, but turned the college down. 
``Gimme a break,'' she sneers in the voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, speaking to the camera, she adds, ``I made a decision not  
to go to college and I'm fine with it. Totally.'' She detects your 
skepticism and stares you down: ``What?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Look what you've got: interactive TV!  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`WEST WING': If you liked ``Sports Night'' last season, you'll  
be all the more intrigued with Aaron Sorkin's latest creation. On 
``The West Wing,'' there's the same witty, rapid-fire dialogue and 
sweeping camera work. But where ``Sports Night'' is a half-hour, 
set behind the scenes at a cable network, ``The West Wing'' has a 
much broader canvas: It's an hour series that goes backstage at the 
White House. As the deputy communications director, Rob Lowe is 
only one of an enormous and appealing ensemble that also includes 
Martin Sheen as President Bartlet. Wry but patriotic, funny and 
proud, ``The West Wing'' is a rousing vision of America. Premiering 
tonight at 9 p.m. EDT on NBC, it's a show to salute. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC Cautious on Samaranch Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee expressed a  
wait-and-see attitude Wednesday to a request for its president to 
testify at a Congressional hearing on Atlanta's tainted bid for the 
1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A top IOC executive, meanwhile, accused U.S. officials of making  
``self-serving'' accusations and of ignoring the ``massive reform'' 
undertaken by the Olympic organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said Tuesday he would ask IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to appear at hearings next month 
investigating the ``culture of corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's 
winning bid. He said he would subpoena Samaranch if he declines to 
testify voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't received any official notice from the House  
subcommittee,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said. 
``When we do, we'll consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to appear at Senate hearings in April  
prompted by the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. Samaranch sent Anita 
DeFrantz, the American IOC vice president, to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada, who headed an internal  
inquiry into the Salt Lake scandal, said Samaranch would probably 
consult with his executive board about how to deal with Upton's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to wait and see in what terms the invitation was  
issued, what the scope and purpose of the hearing is,'' Pound said. 
``It will be decided on an ad-hoc basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House hearing is scheduled for the week of Oct. 11.  
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has not traveled to the United States since the Salt  
Lake City scandal broke late last year. He and other IOC members 
are subject to possible questioning by the FBI in connection with 
its Salt Lake investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have been raised whether the IOC will go ahead with  
its scheduled executive board meetings in Colorado Springs and Salt 
Lake City in February. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Salt Lake, Atlanta bid officials offered lavish gifts and  
favors in their attempt to win the votes of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said a report on the Atlanta bid, submitted to Congress  
last week by former Attorney General Griffin Bell, shows that IOC 
members often expected gifts and favors and that Atlanta bid 
officials willingly accommodated them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly votes were for sale,'' Upton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Upton said he wanted Samaranch to ``explain exactly how the IOC  
awards games,'' based on some of the ``outrageous revelations'' 
related to the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell and other Atlanta officials have suggested that Atlanta was  
dragged into a corrupt bid culture fostered by the IOC, an 
accusation rejected by Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is particularly self-serving is for someone to say it's  
all the fault of the IOC for creating this kind of atmosphere,'' he 
told The Associated Press by telephone. ``The IOC certainly didn't 
create any such atmosphere all by itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is quite clear the IOC members did not demand all these  
gifts and favors. They may have asked for some, in which case we'll 
take responsibility, but the (people making the offers) have to 
take their own responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said Upton and others have not taken into account the  
actions the IOC has taken the past 10 months, including the 
expulsion or resignation of 10 members and the initiation of 
reforms of its structure, rules and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are talking and acting as if they are unaware any of  
this is going on,'' he said. ``Some of (the Atlanta controversy) 
seems to be taking place in a vacuum. It seems a trifle bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress has to do what it thinks it has to do,'' Pound  
added. ``What you hope is (investigators) will take into account 
all of the relevant facts, which in this case involves a massive 
reform on the part of the IOC. This doesn't seem to be on anybody's 
radar screen. I don't understand that.''

<HEADLINE> Misery in North Carolina After Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- The ground is too soggy to bury the  
dead. Entire farms of tobacco and cotton have disappeared. Dead 
hogs and chickens bob along with kitchen chairs and coffins in the 
filthy floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Misery comes in a million forms these days in eastern North  
Carolina, from swarms of blowflies feeding on bloated livestock to 
broken dams, 30,000 flooded homes and miles of cars turned to junk. 
And it could be weeks before some places dry out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost everything we had,'' said Carolyn Whitehead of  
Greenville, who on Wednesday moved into a state-built trailer on 
the edge of Rocky Mount. ``But we've still got our health and now 
we've got a place to stay. I just want to take a hot bath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters spawned the worst  
environmental, agricultural and human disaster in the history of 
North Carolina: rivers fouled by human waste, hog waste and debris 
of all kinds; a wrecked shrimp harvest; farm losses expected to 
exceed $1 billion; millions in uninsured home and car losses; and 
at least 41 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, the storm killed at least 69 people from the Bahamas  
to New England -- and that toll was expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt there are individuals out there who were  
swept off roadways and whose bodies have not been recovered,'' said 
Dr. John Butts, the state's chief medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage in North Carolina is expected to surpass the $6 billion  
caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996, the state's costliest natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt appealed to residents to help their suffering  
neighbors, but nature itself didn't cooperate. Three more inches of 
rain fell across North Carolina's coastal plain Tuesday and early 
Wednesday, keeping more than 500 roads closed. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3,000 people remained in shelters throughout the flood  
region, waiting for workers to finish more trailers that will serve 
as temporary homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the environmental effects will linger for months -- maybe  
even years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rivers are now swollen with human waste, animal waste and  
other pollution,'' state Environmental Secretary Bill Holman said. 
``Our waste systems were not designed for 500-year floods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holman said early reports show damage to 22 water treatment  
plants, 209 sewage plants and 430 animal farming operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrimp fishermen, he said, had anticipated the best fall harvest  
in years, ``but the slug of pollution and fresh water has 
essentially wiped that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials estimate at least 100,000 hogs, 2.4 million  
chickens and 500,000 turkeys drowned. Early estimates of crop and 
farm structural losses totaled $333 million at a time when 
commodity prices for everything from cotton to turkeys are down. 
</P>
<P>
	The drowned livestock posed a disease threat that officials  
hoped to reduce by burning the carcasses in industrial incinerators 
-- an operation that began Wednesday. Workers used front-end loaders 
to feed the carcasses into the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen McCoy, a hog farmer since 1973, has had to round up more  
than 3,000 carcasses and watch them go up in flames. The smell of 
burning coals and rotting flesh mixed on his farm in Trenton on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sweat and blood you're talking about,'' McCoy said.  
``I've lost basically what I've worked for the last 40 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some places, the presence of too much water knocked out water  
service. One hospital in Greenville, along the Tar River, had to 
use the water in its rehabilitation swimming pool to keep toilets 
flushing and medical machines working. Bottled water is used for 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral homes throughout the waterlogged region put bodies in  
storage until cemeteries dry out. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowling Funeral Home in Rocky Mount had held two bodies for a  
week. Owner Mark Bowling said some families were holding funeral 
services now and burying their dead later. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to stretch a funeral out too long,'' Bowling  
said. ``But a lot of people are like, `We don't want to bury Daddy 
in a mudhole.'''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks Human Rights Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Indonesia wants its own human rights  
commission to investigate alleged human rights violations in East 
Timor before an international probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas expressed his concerns a  
day after the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission decided to 
hold a special session in Geneva starting Thursday to discuss 
rights violations in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that it will be a good session, but that it will not  
take decisions that turn out to be exacerbating the situation 
rather than improving it,'' he told reporters Tuesday on the 
sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Indonesian militias, backed by Indonesian troops, have been  
blamed for lootings, killings and wholesale destruction in East 
Timor following the announcement that voters overwhelmingly chose 
independence from Indonesia in an Aug. 30 U.N.-supervised ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The special session of the U.N. rights commission was requested  
by Portugal, East Timor's former colonial ruler. 
</P>
<P>
	The session was backed by Mary Robinson, the top U.N. rights  
commissioner, who has denounced ``a deliberate, vicious and 
systematic campaign of gross violations of human rights'' in the 
territory following its vote in favor of independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas inisited Jakarta ``shares firmly'' the belief that people  
who committed human rights violations should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``we believe that at this stage perhaps it would  
be better for our national commission on human rights to conduct 
the investigations, with the help of expertise from the Commission 
on Human Rights, rather than go immediately into an international 
commission of the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal's President Jorge Sampaio said peacekeepers and U.N.  
officials should start gathering evidence of human rights 
violations -- but emphasized it should be done discreetly. 
</P>
<P>
	Once evidence is collected, Sampaio said it will be time to  
assess the mood in East Timor and in Indonesia and determine how to 
proceed. He said he couldn't be certain how the Indonesian army 
would react to possible war crimes charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any army reacts well when you're just pointing  
the finger at them,'' Sampaio said.

<HEADLINE> Get This: You Can Bet on Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Investors can literally bet on the weather now.  
</P>
<P>
	Weather futures made their debut Wednesday on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, enabling investors to speculate on what the 
temperature is going to be in four U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities, insurance companies and other businesses with a lot  
riding on the weather can use the futures to hedge their risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A utility, for example, might seek to protect itself from a  
milder-than-normal winter, which would hold down sales of 
electricity for heating homes and businesses. A peach grower in 
Georgia might want to protect a crop from frost damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Merc, where investors buy and sell futures and  
options contracts on everything from milk to Treasury bonds, says 
weather affects 20 percent of the $9 trillion U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone else determined enough to bet on next year's weather can  
do it, too. A Farmer's Almanac is optional -- all you need to 
``play'' the weather is a commodity brokerage account and a 
bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
	At $100 for each point change in the weather index, the stakes  
can mount up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weather touches just about all parts of the economy,'' from  
retail sales to utilities to insurance, said Pete Barker, vice 
president of the exchange. ``Now it's possible to do something 
about that by taking a position on how warm or cold it's going to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after mixed results with previous innovations -- contracts on  
brine shrimp and Russian ruble futures bombed, eurodollar and 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index futures have boomed -- exchange 
officials are braced for a potentially chilly reception for 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't,'' Barker  
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather futures already have been trading on the  
over-the-counter market for the past two years. The investment is 
known as a ``derivative'' because its value is derived from an 
underlying asset. Instead of being based on swings in a foreign 
currency, stock index or interest rate, this investment is related 
to the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors place their ``bets'' on the average temperature in  
four U.S. cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati or New York. Plans 
call for later adding Dallas, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and 
Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merc offers monthly contracts based on heating degree days  
expected in those cities. A degree day is a measure used to 
describe how much the temperature differs from the standard average 
for one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Headed into fall and winter, the contract is based on an index  
that measures how much the actual daily average temperature in 
those cities is below 65. For example, an average temperature of 55 
degrees for a full day would equal 10 index points. If that 
temperature held at 55 over a 30-day month, the index swing would 
be 300 points. 
</P>
<P>
	For an initial investment, a trader has to put up a down payment  
for each contract traded. For the Chicago temperature contract 
covering October, that would be $1,400 per contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader makes money on a contract when the index rises after it  
is purchased. A gain of 20 points, at $100 a point, represents 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader loses money when the index falls after the contract is  
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of the first temperature-related derivative to be  
traded on an exchange was hardly stormy for a setting that usually 
is raucous. 
</P>
<P>
	While red-jacketed traders on the exchange floor shouted and  
gestured wildly as they dealt in contracts for live cattle and 
frozen pork bellies, there was only electronic trading of weather 
futures. The action was evident only in the flashing of tiny red 
and green lights showing prices on the overhead quote board and on 
desktop computer screens above the trading pit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merc said 53 contracts were sold in the first five hours of  
trading, which will continue around the clock. It was a modestly 
successful start. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange would not reveal its customers, but the majority  
were presumed to be large utilities or insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Four energy trading firms are making the market and guaranteeing  
payment on the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract's backers, armed with reams of historical  
temperature records, set the initial price levels and were hoping 
the market will take off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses are gambling on the weather anyway, and this allows  
them to hedge their positions,'' said Jeff Porter, vice president 
of Koch Energy Trading of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Insiders already are talking about the possibilities of snowfall  
futures, which could help protect ski resorts or snowblower 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange doesn't pretend to be able to predict the  
weather any better than your uncle with a trick knee. But officials 
warn this isn't a place to look for big profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to predict weather with any accuracy beyond 10-14  
days,'' says Barker.
