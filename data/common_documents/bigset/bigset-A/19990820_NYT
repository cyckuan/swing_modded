BANK OF NEW YORK AGGRESSIVELY COURTED RUSSIAN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 4th graf to put size of alleged laundering in context; 9th
graf with example of transaction.) (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York, in an effort to expand a
lucrative business in Eastern Europe over the last several years,
aggressively pursued relationships with many of Russia's largest
banks, a strategy that might have contributed to embarrassing
questions about money laundering that the bank now faces.
</P>
<P>
   The bank specialized in setting up cash and securities accounts
for Russian banks in the United States, a higly competitive market
that the bank dominated, according to American bankers and
financial analysts. The accounts allowed Russian institutions, many
of which collapsed last year beneath piles of debt and speculative
investments, to easily transfer money outside of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At first, doing business with Russian banks seemed like a
fruitful new business. But now the bank is under federal
investigation for channeling billions of dollars through accounts
in what is suspected to be a major money laundering operation by
Russian organized crime, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that it could be one of the largest money
laundering operations ever uncovered in the United States, with
$4.2 billion passing through one account alone from last October
through March. The bank said Wednesday that it has been cooperating
with the investigation, which involves the use of bank facilities
to transfer funds from Russia to other countries. The bank said
there are no allegations of wrongdoing and declined to comment
further. It also suspended two senior officers pending the outcome
of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank entrusted responsibility for much of the fast-growing
business in Eastern Europe to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a
senior vice president whom federal investigators believe to be at
the heart of a money laundering scandal inside the bank. Ms.
Kagalovsky, who was one of the employees suspended Wednesday, has
not been accused of any crime. But it remains unclear whether there
was wrongdoing by her or other individuals, and how adequately the
bank supervised their activities and their Russian customers.
</P>
<P>
   One of her best customers was Inkombank, a fast-growing Russian
bank that transacted more than 250 payments a day through the Bank
of New York. Inkombank brought its business to the Bank of New York
from the Republic New York Corp. in 1992, because Ms. Kagalovsky
promised to be less vigilant than Republic about the way in which
Inkombank's accounts were handled here, according to Emanuel E.
Zeltser, a former attorney for Inkombank.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky assured Inkombank's representatives that ``Bank
of New York would be much more understanding about how to manage
correspondent accounts than Republic,'' Zeltser said. Republic
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Republic and the Bank of New York handled similar
transactions with Russian clients some time ago, one investigator
said, Republic filed a suspicious activity report with bank
regulators but the Bank of New York did not. The nature of the
transactions could not be learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank of New York was very happy with the money Natasha and
Galitzine were making and routinely let them run their own show,''
Zeltser said referring to Ms. Kagalovsky and Vladimir Galitzine,
another Bank of New York officer. Bank of New York said Galitzine
was unavailable for comment. An individual familiar with the
investigation of the bank said that Galitzine has not been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined who at the bank supervised Ms.
Kagalovsky. The bank declined comment further, and Ms. Kagalovsky
was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Ms. Kagalovsky, the wife of Konstantin
Kagalovsky, a prominent Russian banker and oil executive, was a
vociferous and active cheerleader in pushing Bank of New York to
expand its presence in Russia in the early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 memo to Thomas Renyi, who was then the president of
the bank and is now the chief executive, Ms. Kagalovsky and another
executive made note of how important one Russian bank, Inkombank,
was to the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inkombank is our largest generator of fee income, and they are
now the largest clearing bank in Russia for domestic
transactions,'' the memo noted. The memo, which Bank of New York
declined to comment on, was given to The New York Times by Zeltser,
who said he acquired it as part of a lawsuit he has filed against
Inkombank over unpaid fees. Lawyers representing Inkombank declined
to comment about the bank's involvement with Bank of New York or
Zeltser's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Inkombank, like many of it counterparts in Russia, is now
insolvent. Another Russian bank that had accounts with Bank of New
York was Menatep, part of an industrial empire overseen by Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, one of Russia's prominent financiers, called
``oligarchs.'' Bank of New York had an active relationship with
Menatep and helped the bank list its stock for trading in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are trying to determine whether some of
the money that was channeled through the Bank of New York came from
Menatep. Menatep, and related companies in Russia, are suspected by
Western investors and Russian regulatory authorities of having
looted money from the country, allegations that Khodorkovsky and
his representatives have firmly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Through Ms. Kagalovsky, Bank of New York had a personal
connection to Menatep. Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin, is a
former senior executive at Menatep and is now the vice chairman of
Yukos, an oil company that is the flagship of of Khodorkovsky's
troubled business empire. Ms. Kagalovsky did not respond to an
interview request.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltser, the former Inkombank attorney, said that the
Kagalovskys were married in the mid-1990s, when Bank of New York
began doing business with Menatep. An American official close to
the money laundering investigation of the Bank of New York
described the Kagalovskys' business connection as ``extraordinarily
provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kagalovskys own a condominium on East 47th Street in
Manhattan that Ms. Kagalovsky bought in January 1997, for $796,000,
according to real estate records. It appears that Ms. Kagalovsky
paid cash. The property records show no loan.

BIAS SUIT THREATENS AIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA BIGGS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona's new high school gradu ation test may be in jeopardy be
cause of a lawsuit begun seven years ago by Nogales parents who say
the state does not do enough to educate Spanish-speaking children.
</P>
<P>
   This year's sophomore class is the first that will be required
to pass AIMS, or Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards, before
it gradu ates in 2002. The test is given only in English to
high-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   The case winding its way through U.S. District Court in Tucson
con tends that the AIMS is discrimina tory against limited-English
students as a graduation requirement. If a judge agrees, the test
could be declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The graduation competency tests are to be English-only
tests,'' said attorney William Morris, who's rep resenting families
in the Nogales Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start off by taking the English and writing tests, and if
you don't pass those, then that's it,'' Morris said. ``What about
the population of (non-English speaking) newcomers we have who
arrive here in eighth, ninth grade? They don't have a prayer of
passing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is reminiscent of the suit brought by the Arizona
Center for Law in the Public Interest that, after years of
litigation, determined that the state's school-construction fi
nancing mechanism discriminated against poorer districts.
</P>
<P>
   After four attempts, the Legislature last year crafted the
Students FIRST (Fair and Immediate Resources for Students Today)
bill, which central ized funding for school districts. But Students
FIRST does not affect such operating expenses as teachers sala
ries, nor extra tutoring needs for students lacking English
proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues in the Nogales case involves whether the state
is ade quately funding programs for such students.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was initiated in 1992 by two parents in the Nogales
Unified School District seeking to force the state to help improve
programs for limited-English students. In amend ments during
litigation, it more directly came to address the AIMS graduation
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments, which ended Wednesday, consultant Sidney
Borcher testified that a 1988 study by the state estimated it costs
$450 more to educate a limited-English student than it does to
teach an English-proficient student. But Ari zona designates only
$150 in extra funds per limited-English student to the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said there are effective tech niques for teaching English
pro ficiency, but they ``involve intensive tutorial skills'' and
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Glass, associate dean for re search at Arizona State
University's College of Education, testified that an analysis found
that if 10 percent of Anglos fail the AIMS test, then more than a
third of Hispanic and Black students will fail.
</P>
<P>
   He said he came to his conclusion after analyzing Anglo and
minority students' results on the Stanford 9, the state's current
standardized test. He said 75 percent of the standards used in the
AIMS test are shared by the Stanford 9.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Education offi cials could not be reached
for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the trial, Assistant Attorney General Roger Hall, who
represents the department, disagreed that other tests' results can
show how students will do on the AIMS, and said that race alone
does not determine per formance on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Alfredo Marquez will rule on the case after
both sides submit memos, due within 30 days. The two sides are
working on a consent decree on issues involving state monitoring of
English profi ciency programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs hope the judge will address adequate funding for
English proficiency programs, rather than just striking down the
AIMS test as unconstitutional. &QL;

SHAKE OFF MOSS, POLI-DIXON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Minnesota Vikings receiver Randy Moss might not
be much of a role model, but as a summer workout partner, he's not
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real cool,'' said UCLA receiver Brian Poli-Dixon. ``He
kept it real and gave us lots of inside tips. He made us feel real
welcomed. There wasn't any, `I'm Randy Moss and I'm not talking to
anybody.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon and teammate Freddie Mitchell trained with Moss and
Vikings receiver Chris Carter for eight days this summer in Boca
Raton, Fla., a few hours from Mitchell's Florida hometown of
Lakeland. They talked football, spoke of life and participated in
Carter's grueling conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous how hard those guys work,'' said Poli-Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   It was an experience to remember, for sure. But when Poli-Dixon
struggled during the opening days of training camp, Bruins coach
Bob Toledo wondered if his junior receiver should have spent more
time running routes and playing catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little rusty,'' Toledo said. ``He talked with Randy
Moss, but he isn't playing like Randy Moss. He's dropping too many
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon's first practice was one of the worst of his life. He
was lethargic, his technique was poor and he couldn't concentrate.
The resulting drops were a shock to his coaches and his system, but
eventually his confidence returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I have had a better summer? Maybe,'' he said. ``I could
have worked on my game more, but I learned things in other areas
and there's something to that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; High praise: UCLA's dynamic offense averaged 40 points per
game the last two seasons and won admirers throughout college
football _ including former USC coach John Robinson, who's
replicating the system in his rookie season at Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're copying a lot of what UCLA did last year,'' Robinson
told the Orange County Register. ``I thought they had the best
offense I've ever seen in college football.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Calling all bodies: Toledo hoped to hold a brief scrimmage
for freshmen and walk-ons Wednesday, then realized he didn't have
enough bodies. Minor injuries and the disabled-parking suspensions
have slashed UCLA's depth, especially in the secondary and
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the linebackers, I think we can get through (the
suspensions) and be OK,'' he said. ``The defensive backs and
offensive line are my concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Bright future: The Bruins expect to redshirt freshman
tailback Akil Harris, although they're impressed with what they've
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' Toledo said. ``He's a physical runner. He's
smart and he can catch the ball. He was a good recruit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris might be the primary ballcarrier in two years, since
Jermaine Lewis is a junior and sophomore DeShaun Foster potentially
could bolt for the NFL after next season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Older and better? Redshirt freshman Sean Phillips was the
marquee catch among UCLA's 1998 defensive-line recruits, a Parade
All-American coveted by all the top schools. Yet he redshirted last
year while Anthony Fletcher and Ken Kocher played.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: age.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was just 17 last season and lacked the physical
maturity necessary to compete against 300-pound offensive linemen
three and four years older. This season, he's stronger, leaner and
ready to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really starting to develop,'' said defensive ends coach
John Pearce. ``He's got tremendous talent, but he's still a young
guy.''

H&AMP;R BLOCK'S NEW BUSINESSES INCREASE ITS REVENUE, BUT LOSS
INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. said its seasonal tax-service
losses widened in its most recent quarter, but its newer
mortgage-lending and business-services businesses helped produce a
72 percent increase in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Block said losses for its fiscal first quarter, which ended July
31, increased to $37.1 million, or 38 cents a share, up from $27.7
million, or 26 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter rose to $121.6 million from $70.6 million
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Block, based in Kansas City, is the nation's largest
tax-preparation service, handling about one in seven returns that
taxpayers send to the Internal Revenue Service. Because the tax
business is highly seasonal, the company also has been diversifying
into mortgage lending and other year-round business and personal
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Increased expenses related to the continuing expansion of the
company's tax-office network and a reduction in investment income
were the biggest contributors to the latest quarter's wider
operating loss, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Block normally invests its surplus cash for additional income,
but it also has been using some of those funds since 1998 to buy
back its stock in the market to increase the value of the remaining
shares still held by investors.
</P>
<P>
   Block said that among its three main operations areas:
</P>
<P>
   - Tax operations revenue rose 7 percent, to $13.1 million,
primarily because of higher tax-preparation fees. Pretax losses
increased 23 percent to $71.1 million because of expansion costs
and a compensation and benefits package change for field managers.
</P>
<P>
   - Mortgage operations revenue increased 44 percent to $76.1
million, and pretax profit rose 54 percent to $21.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   - Business service operations revenue increased to $24.2 million
from a year-earlier $1.3 million, primarily because Block acquired
several regional accounting firms in the intervening 12 months.
Pretax losses for the unit were $185,000.

ABORTION FOES' ADS URGE MISSOURI LEGISLATORS TO DEFEND BAN ON
PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Abortion opponents have begun a statewide
radio campaign to help override Gov. Mel Carnahan's veto of a bill
they say would criminalize a certain abortion procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began Monday and will air until lawmakers decide the
issue at their annual veto session, said Susan Klein, executive
director of Missouri Right to Life. The veto session begins Sept.
15.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the ads are part of a campaign backed by the Missouri
chapter of the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, Missouri
Right to Life, Missouri Catholic Conference, Eagle Forum, Christian
Life Commission and others.
</P>
<P>
   Backers contend the bill is designed to ban only certain
late-term abortions by classifying them as infanticide. The
procedure would be a felony unless it was done to save the mother's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan vetoed the bill because he said it was a deceptive
attempt to outlaw all abortions. The governor, who favors abortion
rights, also contends the bill would allow people to use violence
to stop what the bill labeled a ``partial birth'' abortion, a new
argument that backers dispute.
</P>
<P>
   One radio ad airing in the Kansas City area, and financed by the
physicians group, questions whether the procedure should even be
labeled an abortion since it takes place outside the womb. The ad
says former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and the American
Medical Association have said the procedure should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sifford, Carnahan's chief of staff, said Thursday the ad
is misleading because it deals only with one abortion procedure
when the bill would outlaw numerous abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has held news conferences intended to build support for
his veto. Abortion-rights groups earlier started their own campaign
to defend the governor's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the bill 127-29. The Senate endorsed it 27-6.
An override requires two-thirds majorities in both chambers, which
is 109 in the House and 23 in the Senate.

`DANDRIDGE' HAS FEW TRIUMPHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Two moments grip you in Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, HBO's
worthy-but-flawed chronicle of the first Black woman to receive an
Oscar nomination for Best Actress.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first occurs at a Hollywood party, where manager Earl Mills
has been lured to hear a promising singer. He finds three women
laughing under neath the piano: Ava Gardner, Mari lyn Monroe and
Dandridge. And it's Dandridge he's drawn to.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, a medical examiner pauses over Dandridge's nude
body while searching for clues in her still-mysterious death at 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dorothy Dandridge,'' he says to a colleague. ``Wasn't she some
kind of colored singer?''
</P>
<P>
   Those two scenes capture the es sence of Dandridge, at least as
she's presented here. All the talent, fire and beauty in the world
couldn't overcome the obstacles _ both in ternal and external _ she
faced. Gardner and Monroe are legends. Dandridge, the true pioneer,
is merely a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes movies can correct that kind of shortcoming. This one
won't. Although it's obviously a labor of love for Halle Berry, who
is not only mag nificent in the title role but the execu tive
producer of the movie, it falls short in too many places to change
history's perception of Dandridge.
</P>
<P>
   Given network television's current lily-white atmosphere, you
really want to love this movie. It's always watchable and, at
times, quite mov ing. We're left with an interesting look at one of
Hollywood's most in triguing stars. We're also left wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is told through an all-night telephone call Dandridge
makes to a friend. She begins by remembering picking up a
dry-cleaned dress at a hotel where she once stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your lady must have already paid,'' the clerk says,
dismissively checking the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge goes upstairs, puts on the dress and walks down to the
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   `` `My lady' is going out for the evening,'' Dandridge says
icily, toss ing a cover of Life magazine down in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Her picture is on the cover. She's on her way to the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few truly satisfying res olutions of such a
situation in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of an actress, Dan dridge performed as part of the
sing ing Dandridge Sisters at the famed Cotton Club in Harlem.
That's where she met her future husband, Harold Nicholas, one of
the tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge gives birth to a mentally retarded daughter, and her
shaky marriage falters. Her mother urges Dandridge to concentrate
on her burgeoning career, which, though promising, is fraught with
problems compounded by racism. She tells Mills, for instance, that
she isn't in terested in being a singer; she's a se rious actress.
</P>
<P>
   The next scene finds her on a movie set, her face darkened by
makeup, tied to a stake while waiting to be rescued by Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   She takes Mills' advice and hits the supper-club circuit. Again,
racism is painted in broad strokes. With a sin gle song, Dandridge
wins over the racist city fathers in Miami Beach who have held up
completion of a club where she's performing. The easy victory seems
artificial, con trived.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dandridge's reputation (and Mills' persistence) win
her a reading with Otto Preminger, who is casting an all-Black
version of Car men, called Carmen Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just realized this is the moment I've always dreamed of,''
Dandridge tells Mills (well-played by Brent Spi ner of Star Trek:
The Next Genera tion).
</P>
<P>
   ``A reading with Preminger?'' he asks. Dandridge shakes her head
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Well. Let's put on a show, kids. Pab lum like that keeps popping
up, and keeps Introducing Dorothy Dan dridge from rising to the
heights it might have reached.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge wins the role, of course, and begins an affair with
Preminger. She is nominated for an Academy Award but doesn't win, a
result chill ingly predicted by her sister, who screams in a
drunken rage, ``You're not going to win an Oscar, Dottie! They
already gave us one!'' (Hattie McDaniel won a Best Supporting Ac
tress Oscar in 1939 for Gone With the Wind, the first Black actress
to win one.)
</P>
<P>
   The nomination doesn't lead to bet ter roles. Dandridge
continues to fight racism (when she defiantly dips her toe into a
Las Vegas swimming pool, the hotel drains the water and scrubs the
pool). But she spirals downward, firing Mills and falling into
another unhappy marriage, bank ruptcy and addiction to prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   She reunites with Mills for a come back, but just before leaving
for New York, he finds her dead of an over dose of a prescription
anti-depres sant. The cause of death _ suicide or accident _ was
never deter mined.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tragically unsatisfying way to end a life. And it's a
fittingly unsatis fying way to end the movie. Again, Berry is
excellent as Dandridge (she's also an accomplished lip-syncher;
Wendy Williams does the actual singing), and Klaus Maria Brandauer
brings brilliant life to Preminger.
</P>
<P>
   But Introducing Dorothy Dandridge does just that _ introduces us
to her. It would have been far more sat isfying to get to know her
even bet ter. &QL;

PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO GET FUNDS WHILE LAWSUIT IS DECIDED 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Planned Parenthood offices in Kansas City
and St. Louis can continue getting state family-planning funds
while a lawsuit on the issue unfolds, a circuit judge ruled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Cole County Circuit Judge Byron Kinder dealt
only with a narrow legal issue. A hearing on whether Planned
Parenthood is getting state funds in violation of a 1999 law is
scheduled for Oct. 29. Any decision is expected to be appealed to
the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The new law bans groups that get state family-planning funds and
their abortion affiliates from sharing the same or even similar
names, medical facilities, equipment, expenses, business offices or
waiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was passed, Maureen Dempsey, state health
director, issued two-month contracts to Planned Parenthood of
Kansas and Mid-Missouri and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis
Region Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Cherrick, a special assistant attorney general, told
Kinder that Dempsey erred, that Planned Parenthood has not complied
with the new law and any tax dollars that go to the two groups will
be hard to recover even if his side prevails. State funding to the
groups should be stopped immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are saying is, `We want to do it our way. We don't
want to follow the law,' '' Cherrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherrick was named a special assistant attorney general by
Attorney General Jay Nixon. His hiring stemmed from complaints by
abortion opponents in the legislature who said Nixon had not
adequately defended Missouri laws designed to impose curbs on
Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer C. Jaff, an attorney for Planned Parenthood Federation
of America, opposed efforts to stop the funding. Jaff told the
court that the group would return family planning money to the
state if a court ever ordered it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The state's financial year began July 1. Planned Parenthood is
getting family planning funds under a two-month contract, which
covers July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Jaff said that, since July 1, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri provided family planning services to 280 patients at a
cost of $42,000. The St. Louis office has treated 100 patients at a
cost of $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder also rejected a bid by Planned Parenthood to dismiss the
lawsuit.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ It was the second game of the best-of-three 1998 WNBA
Finals at Compaq Center. The Comets were facing elimination,
trailing the Phoenix Mercury by 12 points with seven minutes
remaining.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Van Chancellor called a timeout, drew up a series of
plays, then preached wildly in an effort to convince the Comets
they still could win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell from the looks on their faces, they weren't
really buying it,'' Chancellor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Kim Perrot, the heart and soul of the team who was
already the source of inspiration, playing despite a severely
sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she said was this,'' Chancellor remembered. ```Hey, we've
got to play. We've got to do a job. We've got to play defense.
We've got to tighten up. We've got to play together. And we've got
to listen to coach.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind, that won us the second
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, died Thursday at Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center after six months of fighting to overcome brain and lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, struggling with his emotions, recalled fondly
Perrot's contributions last August as the Comets pulled out that
game against the Mercury and her value to the team as the Comets
won the WNBA's first two titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Cynthia Cooper; we had Sheryl Swoopes; we had Tina
Thompson,'' Chancellor said. ``But I don't know if we would ever
have had one, much less two championships, if we had not had Kim
Perrot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bleakest day in Comets history, Chancellor had no trouble
pronouncing Perrot's name. What a turnaround from the previous 2{
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mispronounced her name 98,000 times,'' Chancellor said,
``and she never once said, `Coach, you say it this way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their first contact occurred during the Comets' inaugural tryout
camp at St. Thomas High School in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a point guard on the roster at that time,''
said Chancellor. ``I was completely amazed. Kim was flashy, but she
was so wild, threw the ball anywhere and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she had so many friends. I accused her later of posting
friends about every 15 feet on the court. And they kept asking me,
`You going to keep little Perrot?' I used to kid her about that
after we won the first championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Signed as one of the Comets' two developmental players in 1997,
Perrot eventually beat out Tiffany Woosley and became the starting
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week after tryouts,'' said Chancellor, ``she told me this:
`You brought everybody to Houston to try to beat me out, from all
over the world, and they couldn't beat me out. I came to training
camp, and you tried to have me beat out again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All the (rest of the Comets) thought she could be the person.
The only person who wasn't convinced was this hardheaded coach.''
</P>
<P>
   She had won the job as point guard. But Perrot felt she might
never win over the heart of her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim used to take it personally when coach would yell at her,''
said Cooper, Perrot's closest friend. ``She didn't understand that
what he was trying to do was make her better so the team would get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the second preseason game in 1997, Perrot had
begun to contemplate leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss, she thought, was too bossy. Her turnovers, Chancellor
thought, were too numerous and too costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't seem to get it in her head what we were trying to
do in our system,'' Chancellor said. ``But she went from that to
being like a coach on the floor. It was like she knew what I wanted
done before I knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to minimize her points. I don't want to minimize
her assists. But Kim Perrot was the best defensive player in the
WNBA in 1997 and '98. Unquestionably. No one was better.''
</P>
<P>
   But when balloting for postseason honors was complete, the 5-5
Perrot wasn't included on the All-WNBA first or second team.
</P>
<P>
   She was overlooked in favor of New York Liberty guard Teresa
Weatherspoon, her friend and collegiate rival at Louisiana Tech, as
Defensive Player of the Year both seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nonplused over the omission the first time, Perrot was vexed
last summer at being snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's understandable,'' said Chancellor. ``There was no one
who could tear down an offense like Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like a little gnat buzzing in your ear. Her hands, she
was so quick. Seemed like she was everywhere. Turn your head and
look away just a little bit, she had stolen the ball and was headed
to the other end of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot once scored 58 points in a game (the second-highest total
in NCAA history) at Southwestern Louisiana but didn't need to score
to help the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really need her offense,'' said Chancellor. ``We had
Cynthia and Tina and Sheryl. But, Lord, what she could do on
defense. It was unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just never going to be anyone else quite like Kim
Perrot.''
</P>
<P>
   Comets forward Tammy Jackson said, ``This team has lost a member
of its family. Kim's faith and determination in life will
constantly inspire us both as individuals and as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her positive attitude will motivate us, not only to win games
but to enjoy life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 10 will always be a member of the Houston Comets.'' &QL;

BUSH IMPLIES HE HAS USED NO DRUGS IN LAST 25 YEARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS Bush's age and when he gave up drinking in 11th graf.) 
(ATTN: Kan.)   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has vowed not
to answer questions about whether he has ever used illegal drugs,
answered a few Thursday morning and suggested he had not used drugs
in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief, informal news conference as he campaigned in
southwestern Virginia, Bush fielded questions for the second
straight day about drug use, and explained why he chose to answer a
question from The Dallas Morning News on the subject Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had been asked ``what I thought was a relevant
question:'' whether as president he would insist that his
appointees undergo full FBI background checks, which include
questions about past drug use. He would, he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I pass the challenge of a background check?'' Bush said
he was then asked. ``My answer is `absolutely.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he could swear that he had not used drugs within the
period required by the Clinton administration of potential
employees _ the previous seven years. Then he went further, saying,
``Not only could I pass the background check and the standards
applied to today's White House, but I could have passed the
background check and the standards applied on the most stringent
conditions when my dad was president of the United States _ a
15-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   That would appear to mean that Bush has not used drugs since
1974, or 15 years before his father's administration, which ran
from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   C. Boyden Gray, President Bush's former White House counsel,
confirmed the 15-year standard, which he said was later relaxed to
10 years. White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that prospective
Clinton administration employees were asked to disclose illegal
drug use for the last seven years, or since age 18, whichever was
less. Some high-level political appointees are asked whether they
have ever used illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, at a second campaign event later Thursday in Columbus,
Ohio, declined to answer whether he could deny using illegal drugs
since he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the American people all I'm going to tell them''
on the subject, he said. ``I hope the people appreciate a candidate
who comes along and says, enough is enough. Enough is enough
digging into people's background years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At his appearance here, Bush said, without giving specifics,
that ``over 20 years ago,'' he did ``some things'' that he now
considered wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the people of this country that over two decades
ago I made some mistakes, when I was younger. I have learned from
those mistakes.'' It was not clear whether he was referring to drug
use or to drinking to excess, which he has acknowledged, or
something else. Bush, gave up drinking on his 40th birthday and now
sticks to alcohol-free beer.
</P>
<P>
   All the presidential candidates were asked on Wednesday by The
Associated Press whether they had ever used drugs. Spokesmen for
all of Bush's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination
said no. Aides to the Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, admitted that the candidates had used
marijuana in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to reply, and he said in an interview Thursday
night during a flight here that he was determined to end what he
called ``the politics of personal vilification'' and ``give my best
shot at cleansing and re-invigorating the system.''
</P>
<P>
   But to his evident irritation, the governor was peppered at
every stop with questions about drugs _ not from voters, several of
whom said they supported his position, but from reporters. Only one
of several hundred people with whom Bush spoke at a farmer's market
here pressed him to make a fuller statement about drug use. That
was a man in modish sunglasses who refused to give his name, but
said he was a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had answered the Dallas paper's query about FBI
background checks, while refusing to answer most others touching on
the subject of drugs, because it was ``a relevant question about
how I would conduct my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people need to know if there will be
security checks administered on White House personnel. It is a very
good question.''
</P>
<P>
   If the American people ``don't like my position,'' Bush said
here, ``they can go out and find someone else to vote for. That's
the great thing about the American system.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance in New Orleans earlier this week, Bush was
asked whether Texas would follow Kansas' lead and de-emphasize the
teaching of evolution in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he thought such decisions were best left to local
school boards and that he believed children should be taught about
evolution. But he said he saw nothing wrong if teachers wanted to
reflect other views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe children ought to be exposed to different theories
about how the world started,'' Bush said, adding he would not
mandate such teaching.

SERBS IN U.S. SEE DOUBLE-STANDARD IN AMERICANS' ATTITUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ For news about Kosovo, the Rev. Alexander
Bugarin stays up until 11:30 p.m. and listens to the British
Broadcasting System on public radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it on American TV anymore,'' said Bugarin, of St.
George Serbian Orthodox Church in Kansas City, Kan. ``People here
say the war was a good thing. That's ignorance. They don't know
what they're talking about. The news has been very one-sided.
People just listen to CNN and think that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in coverage _ near-saturation during NATO's air
war in the Balkans, but only scattered reporting in recent weeks _
reflects an American double standard, he suggests. The pain being
inflicted on Serbs by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, he says, is being
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were demonized, and now the whole ethnic cleansing
experience is being experienced by them,'' said Wayne Ranick, a
fourth-generation Serb living in Kansas City, Kan. ``That is very
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, ethnic Albanians appear intent on expelling Serbs and
Gypsies from Kosovo, using intimidation and murder.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of that abuse, the report cited the gunning down of
14 Serb farmers in a wheat field on July 23, and threats against
three elderly Serb women at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have documented abuses on all sides,'' said Minky Worden,
electronic media director for Human Rights Watch. ``Between 1989
and 1998 much of the abuses were by Serb para-militaries. Now that
the Kosovo Albanians have come back and the KLA are in a sense
running things, there are abuses from that side.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician Jeff Colyer of Overland Park, Kan., a volunteer with
International Medical Corps, said the conflict has affected relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several Serb physicians and nurses we work with,''
Colyer said. ``We try to be even-handed. But there is a level of
fighting going on now that we are very concerned about. We expect
it to continue for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanka Jovanovich, a Belgrade-born parishioner at St. George's,
said she was not surprised by conditions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a sheer tragedy what is going on over there,''
Jovanovich said. ``They bombed to protect Albanians, and now
they're moving Serbs out to protect Serbs. It doesn't make any
sense. I have a cousin in Kosovo. Nobody knows what happened to
him. They say, hopefully, he'll turn up some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bugarin also has family in Yugoslavia. He was born in Pachir, a
small Yugoslavian village near the Hungarian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village I grew up in was just 3,500 people,'' he said.
``Mostly farmers. It was a different life. Over there in the
village people worked hard to live. They didn't care much about
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, politics is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO didn't finish the work for the KLA extremists,'' Bugarin
said of the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``KLA said their work was not
done yet. They are not satisfied with the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing by Albanians is not revenge against the Serbs.
It's what they've been doing for years. They're doing their best to
clean Kosovo of Serbs and Gypsies to make Kosovo Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranick blamed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for stoking
ethnic hatred, but said Serbs should not be blamed for his
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a Milosevic apologist,'' Ranick said. ``He's an evil
man. But America spent billions of dollars bombing people and
schools and then said it was the people's fault for not changing
the Milosevic government. That leads me to question the humanity of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bugarin called the mass Albanian graves found by the
international peace keeping forces in Kosovo the ``tragic acts of
godless people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not local Serbs from Kosovo who did this,'' he said.
``The people that committed those rapes and killings are godless.
If the Serb military was forced to do bad things...I'm not proud of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently started a Kosovo relief fund at St. George's. Cash
donations are sent to churches in Kosovo and distributed mostly to
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than money to bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to stop the killing is to split up Kosovo,''
Bugarin said. ``This village, Serbian; this village, Albanian. We
have to do this in order to save the people and save the churches
and monasteries and shrines we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a small country. We had so many beautiful things.''

INDIANS COOL OFF RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. Sullivan 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Rangers, except for some inclement weather and a
few scattered cases of food poisoning, had a fabulous stay here on
the shores of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Winning three of four in any American League city is cause for
some chest-thumping, whether it's against a first-place team or a
team looking at the first pick in next year's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers couldn't sneak out of Cleveland without at least
one reminder why the Indians have one of the best records in the
major leagues and why they've scored more runs than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians knocked out starter Mike Morgan with five runs in
the first three innings and avoided getting swept by the Rangers
with an 8-0 victory last night at Jacobs Field. The game was
delayed 89 minutes at the start because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was just a total washout,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``We just never got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay and three relievers combined on a seven-hitter as
the Rangers were shut out for only the fifth time this season. The
Rangers still took three of four from the Indians, but they had
their lead cut to 5 1/2 games in the American League West because
the Oakland Athletics defeated Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very good baseball team,'' outfielder Juan Gonzalez
said. ``To beat them three out of four here is great. This is
probably the first signs of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, not enhancing his chances of starting against Cleveland
in the playoffs, faced 18 batters and 11 reached base. He allowed
seven hits and walked four, which is a little unusual for someone
who averages 2.7 walks per nine.
</P>
<P>
   However, Roberto Alomar, Jim Thome and Manny Ramirez aren't
average American League hitters, something that got lost during the
first three games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pretty good stuff the first two innings,'' Morgan said.
``I went into the third inning and basically didn't execute. I had
a hard time throwing strikes and made a lot of mistakes that
inning. That's the way it's gone for me the last couple weeks. I
haven't been able to make the big pitch to get me out of an
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is now 1-2 with a 10.18 ERA in his last four starts,
having allowed 36 hits and 20 earned runs in 17 2/3 innings. He is
39, but the Rangers don't see any signs of fatigue at this point of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with 39?'' Oates said. ``He's in better shape
than any of my pitchers out there except for \RJohn\S Wetteland.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some moments early that didn't help the Rangers. Ivan
Rodriguez was thrown out trying to steal third base with one out in
the first inning, runners at first and second and Juan Gonzalez up
to bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bad,'' Rodriguez said. ``I got a late jump. I've been doing
that all year, I just got a bad jump.''
</P>
<P>
   That cost the Rangers a chance to inflict some damage on Karsay.
Gonzalez followed with a single to left and Rafael Palmeiro walked,
but Todd Zeile fouled out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, still feeling tightness in his left hamstring, also
couldn't catch up to Enrique Wilson's long drive to right with one
out and one on in the second. Instead, the ball hit off his glove
as he reached over his head and went for a double. Richie Sexson,
who had singled, went to third on the play and then scored on Jesse
Levis' grounder to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough play, line drive over his head,'' Oates said.
``If he makes that play, you say, `Nice play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gonzalez, ``It's a little bit tough, but the grass is too
wet and I'm concerned about my leg. I'm trying to play but it's
still 90-95 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   This game really came down to the Indians proving they don't
roll over for anybody.

AGE, DECLINING MEMBERSHIP BRING THE DEMISE OF SEATTLE ENGINEERS'
CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Seattle club whose members built some of the
region's most lasting public-works projects has gone the way of the
slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   Over roasted chicken and potatoes and afternoon chitchat, the
Seattle Engineers Club met for its final lunch Thursday after 87
years of providing professional support to members, many of whom
helped build and shape this region.
</P>
<P>
   The group is calling it quits, blaming dwindling membership on
changing times and a failure to attract ``young blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of bittersweet,'' said Adrian Arnold, a former club
president who joined in the 1960s and whose father also held the
post. ``We've become outdated as an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the Seattle Engineers Club was the professional
group to join.
</P>
<P>
   Members worked on some of the region's largest public-works
projects _ bridges, tunnels and engineering feats _ which continue
to shape the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Club engineers helped design and construct the Alaskan Way
Viaduct, Seattle's downtown bus tunnel, the West Seattle bridges,
Shilshole's breakwater and the electrification of city bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``people involved in building this city,'' said Joyce
Lem, club president and a bridge engineer with HDR Engineering in
Bellevue. At 42, she may be one of the club's youngest members.
</P>
<P>
   In ``the good ol' days,'' club lunch programs once drew
heavyweights including chief engineers from the city, county, Port
of Seattle and railroads. At its height, the club buzzed with more
than 300 members who met daily for lunches in the Arctic Building
at Third Avenue and Cherry Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a prominent place to network,'' said Arnold, vice
president of Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs, civil and structural
engineering consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The club was established in 1912 to promote fellowship among
local engineers. From 1925 to 1968, the club was on the ninth floor
of the Arctic Building, where a kitchen, dining room and library
played host to engineers who came to unwind during long lunch
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the membership grew older and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The once-thriving institution has since dwindled to about 60
members, half of whom are retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing,'' said Lem, the club's first female
president. ``At the same time, it's difficult to keep something
like this going.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, said 91-year-old John Loux, club treasurer
and one of the club's oldest members. ``Young people aren't too
interested in clubs,'' Loux said. There's no longer an emphasis on
``sitting around and talking about ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   A final farewell bash celebrating the club's history will be
scheduled in late September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found we were swimming up a stream,'' said club manager Dan
Lyons during lunch at Rock Salt Steak House, formerly Latitude 47,
where the club has held luncheons since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He said the club knocked on the doors of the city's engineering
companies to recruit new members. The companies were receptive, but
younger engineers weren't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young engineers tend to be too busy now to come for a lunch,
even when their employers pay,'' said Lyons, 76, a retired
electrical engineer who joined the club in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons proudly rattles off the engineering achievements of his
fellow members.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gordon Snyder, a retired naval architect who was
instrumental in the design of Alaskan and Washington state ferries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gerald Van Faasen, a retired district engineer for the
Army Corps of Engineers who helped build the breakwater at
Shilshole Bay and worked on the large Fort Peck Dam in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   There's Roy Morse, a prominent city engineer who oversaw
important developments in Seattle's history. He joined the club in
1950.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, 18 members and guests reminisced and ate lunch during
a 2{-hour program.
</P>
<P>
   The guest speaker was Thom Mullins of Sparling Inc., the
electrical engineers hired to work on the Experience Music Project
at the Seattle Center. His topic was the future of technology.

INACCURATE PROJECTIONS PROMPTED AVOIDABLE AIR POLLUTION CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Last month, the Kansas City region faced an
air pollution crisis. Federal highway money was going to be cut off
unless the Missouri and Kansas governors sanctioned a
less-polluting gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it turns out, the crisis could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   And if it had been avoided, Kansas' governor would not have
approved the reformulated gasoline for this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision would have been considerably different,'' said
Mike Matson, spokesman for Kansas Gov. Bill Graves.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's office would not
speculate on how that office would have reacted.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis stemmed from projections showing that Kansas City's
vehicle traffic would grow to violate federal clean air standards
by 2020. That forced officials to formulate a plan to prevent that
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the region's air-quality officials revealed the
projections had been recomputed and Kansas City wouldn't violate
the standards after all.
</P>
<P>
   What changed? One method to lower pollution was taken out of the
projections and another method was put in its place. Had that
second method been put in earlier, Kansas City wouldn't have faced
the funding cutoff _ which triggered the governors' action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have avoided all this,'' said Craig Volland, a Sierra
Club representative on a regional air-quality task force.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Flournoy, the Environmental Protection Agency's regional
deputy director over air quality, agreed: ``We didn't have to go
through all the hoops'' to meet air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Added Jack Sell, who directs a local coalition of classic car
clubs and who has followed the region's air-quality issue: ``It's
an embarrassment. A fairly coercive situation was created where the
governors had to act quickly, and it was all based on the wrong
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gasoline has sparked national controversy because
one component of the fuel can contaminate ground water. But because
of the two governors' actions, the new fuel is expected to be
available at area service stations next year.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame for the crisis? Several government agencies had a
role to play.
</P>
<P>
   This week, officials from all the agencies involved gave
accounts of the crisis' chain reaction. All agreed on these basic
points:
</P>
<P>
   The first link in the chain was the Mid-America Regional
Council, the group that puts together the region's long-range
transportation plan. As part of that plan, the regional council
estimates how vehicle traffic will affect air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the regional council put together a
complicated model of air quality projections. It showed Kansas City
would have too much pollution by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce pollution levels in its model, the council had a
couple of alternatives. One was to include the impact of
reformulated gasoline, which both Missouri and Kansas already were
considering because of the region's previous violations of federal
clean air standards.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative was to factor in the impact of EPA's
National Low Emission Vehicle Program. This program, started last
year in selected states, requires automakers to add extra
hydrocarbon emission controls to vehicles. Such vehicles will be
phased into the new-car fleet across the country by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But federal highway officials told the regional council that the
low-emission program wouldn't have much impact on this region's
future pollution projections. Also, the council had trouble
figuring out how to incorporate the program's impacts into its
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no rational reason to pursue that analysis, and we
were told not to (by the federal highway officials),'' said David
Warm, the regional council's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   So the regional council only put the reformulated gas
alternative into its model. With the new gas included, Kansas
City's future pollution dropped enough to satisfy federal standards
and state limits.
</P>
<P>
   This solution, however, hit bureaucratic snags. A federal court
decision in March caused the federal transportation department to
dictate a July 28 deadline for regional transportation plans to
meet clean-air standards. If they didn't, the regions could not
proceed with design and engineering work on federally funded
highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, though, would not accept the regional council's
projections with reformulated gas unless there was a guarantee that
reformulated gas could come to Kansas City. To achieve this
guarantee, the governors had to act _ by July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the regional council searched for alternatives that
would satisfy the EPA. It plugged the low emission program instead
of reformulated gas into its pollution model.
</P>
<P>
   It showed Kansas City's air satisfied clean air standards.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that the EPA wouldn't accept the revised
model's results immediately. The results had to be amended to the
existing transportation plan, which requires formal hearings and
approvals. The process would take 90 days _ well past the July 28
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   By July 28 the two governors were dealing with a deadline
dictated by a federal transportation department and a process
dictated by a federal environmental agency. And the transportation
deadline couldn't be postponed to accommodate changing
environmental considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of one of those concurrent processes,'' said Chris
Hess, an EPA air quality conformity analyst.
</P>
<P>
   So facing the prospect of approving reformulated gas or letting
the region lose federal funding, the two governors chose the
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But if the regional council had plugged the low emission program
into its pollution projections initially, the governors wouldn't
have faced a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opted in reluctantly at best,'' said Matson. ``Had there
not been a deadline, the governor would not have opted in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess, however, said reformulated gas still could have been
required in the Kansas City area in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the governors) have a responsibility to achieve some
kind of emission reductions (based on the region's previous clean
air violations). Reformulated gas still would have been an issue,
but it took on a more urgent process.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The foundation of Kim's Place, a refuge for children facing serious
illnesses, will be the hundreds of thousands of dollars that
well-to-do Houstonians poured into the project at a charity gala
earlier this year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the spirit of Kim's Place _ and of namesake Kim Perrot, the
Comets guard who died Thursday after a six-month battle with cancer
_ runs deeper and wider than one night.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident as recently as Monday night at Compaq Center,
where Comets fans arrived knowing full well that Perrot was at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center and that the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, unbidden, they walked up to Rockets and Comets
employees on the arena concourse. ``I know you work for the
Comets,'' they would say. ``Please take this.''
</P>
<P>
   They were small donations _ five bucks here, 10 bucks there. But
when the workers counted the bills that night, they had received
more than $500 _ just a drop in the bucket toward the $600,000
price tag for Kim's Place but evidence of the love that fans from
every walk of life felt for Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a childlike nature that was appealing to all people,''
said Fran Harris, a former Comets teammate who now works as a WNBA
analyst for Lifetime television. ``Everyone can identify with being
a kid for the first time taking up a sport, and that is how she
was, and she wasn't afraid to show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid to do that. They don't have that
level of openness about them. And that's it; that's it right there.
When you see it, you want to get close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot provided ample opportunity for people to do so. She
appeared at more than 100 functions across Southeast Texas in
recent months to promote the Comets, the Rockets and the
construction of Kim's Place.
</P>
<P>
   One of those appearances was at an April 12 gathering in
Beaumont, sponsored by Lamar University and Beaumont's I Have a
Dream program, that attracted more than 600 young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was weak and ill, and the children could feel her
sadness,'' said sponsor Regina Rogers. ``But they could feel her
strength, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim's message was plain and simple: You can do it, and don't
let anybody tell you that you can't,'' said Sarah Joseph, the
Rockets' community services director. ``Kids would thrive on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would tell them the story of how she had to fight when she
got to the league and how she pushed her way through the door. They
would see the evidence that this little bitty person made it, and
this gave them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's appeal extended into the stands at Compaq Center,
drawing in people who had never heard of Sheryl Swoopes' NCAA
championship days at Texas Tech or Cynthia Cooper's two stints on
the U.S. Olympic team but adopted Perrot as the symbol of something
new _ a new hero for a new league.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands wore white ribbons during the Monday and Wednesday
night games at Compaq Center. They will, no doubt, still be there
when the Comets return to the arena floor for the WNBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever thought up those ribbons for the light, that was
exactly right, because she brightened up many days for me,'' said
Rockets/Comets executive Carroll Dawson. ``We would talk about a
million things. It took me a year to realize this, but I was
getting a lot more work done after she would leave. I mean, she was
just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   That quality led Dawson to hire Perrot as a Rockets goodwill
ambassador, and it led Rockets owner Leslie Alexander to adopt the
concept for Kim's Place as this year's charitable project for the
Clutch City Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Perrot) took this city and this team by storm, and she
stole our hearts in the process,'' Alexander said Thursday night.
``She is loved by her family, her teammates, the entire Comets
staff and the city of Houston. We all will miss her deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   The sad duty of ministering to the Perrot family Thursday night
fell to Rockets communications executive Angela Blakeney. Today,
Blakeney and other team executives will continue working to make
Kim's Place a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two-thirds of the $600,000 required to begin
construction and provide initial operating funds has been raised,
although there is no word when construction will begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue,'' Blakeney said. ``It will be built, and it
will be special, and it will always remind people of Kim. Her
determination will live on. She would want the Comets' fans and her
friends and the people who loved her to remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the Perrot family has asked that memorial
contributions be made to Kim's Place. Checks should be made payable
to Clutch City Foundation and may be sent to 2 Greenway Plaza,
Suite 400, Houston, TX 77046. For information, call 713-627-WNBA.

PANEL FINDS HUGE FLAWS IN HOW SEATTLE POLICE INVESTIGATES ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL AND KIMBERL A.C.WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An independent panel found major flaws in the way
Seattle police investigate themselves, recommending that a civilian
run a new office to pursue allegations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In a 37-page report issued Thursday by the panel after three
months of study of the Seattle Police Department, its members
offered a blueprint on implementing the most rudimentary police
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The document called for Police Chief Norm Stamper to declare
that lying, cheating and stealing will no longer be tolerated in a
department wracked by waning public confidence. And to win back the
public's trust, the department should clean up shoddy
record-keeping on misconduct investigation cases, respond better to
misconduct complaints and allow for face-to-face interviews of
accused police officers during inquiries _ a practice currently not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member panel stopped short of suggesting a full-fledged
citizen watchdog committee, citing a lack of ``systemic''
corruption in the department. Though it chided Stamper for
delegating ``too much of his responsibility'' on investigations, it
did not recommend firing the beleaguered chief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, panel members called for a hybrid option that blends a
civilian director overseeing existing police staff to run the
department's new Office of Public Accountability (OPA). Stamper
would hire the civilian investigations director, who in turn could
hire another civilian or police officer as second in command over
the eight-member investigations unit and auditors office.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson Collins, author of a recent book on police
accountability and senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, called
the recommended OPA an ``unusual set-up'' that is somewhat ``better
than absolute inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of another U.S. city that has tried to introduce
civilians over police in an advisory role,'' she said. ``Two things
are key to making it work: First, who will be made director of the
OPA and second, whether they'll blow the whistle on any discovered
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The OPA would act as an umbrella over the Internal
Investigations Section, the police office under fire for failing to
properly investigate misconduct allegations and for allegedly
erecting the ``Wall of Silence'' to protect fellow police officers.
</P>
<P>
   For the recommendations to go into effect, Police Department
leadership, union representatives and the Seattle City Council
would have to sign off on it. Ongoing collective bargaining
negotiations could soon touch on a little-known policy in the
department unearthed in the report that allows officers accused of
misconduct the right to not be interviewed face-to-face during
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, appointed by Mayor Paul Schell and chaired by retired
King County Superior Court Judge Charles V. Johnson, took 90 days
to craft the report, released amid troubled times for Stamper. He
has overseen the 1,260-member force since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The report described an investigations process that lacked
consistency: ``No single person in the department makes the key
decisions regarding discipline. Employees describe cases in which
seemingly arbitrary decisions have been made regarding whether to
initiate an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the report recommended adding more training on
ethics and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant reform,'' said panel member Jenny Durkan, a
Seattle attorney and former executive counsel to the governor.
``It's learning from other people's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file officers and community members concurred, but
reaction to the report varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, these problems in the department may not be as bad as
problems in New Orleans or Albuquerque, but I would have expected
tougher recommendations as far as the leadership of the department
goes,'' said a West Precinct patrol officer who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
offered a different perspective. ``I haven't seen the actual report
but from what I've heard, it ought to put some of the (recent) bad
talking about the Seattle Police Department to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriett Walden, a longtime activist for police accountability,
said the panel's recommendations to restore integrity and personal
responsibility to the Police Department were ``a step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unhappy _ or I won't be if we can get these
recommended actions implemented,'' she said after the news
conference in the mayor's office at which the panel officially
released the document to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The panel outlined 23 major recommendations on oversight,
leadership training and rules, but failed to add a layer of
oversight to watch over the chief, said Councilwoman Tina
Podlodowski, chairwoman of the council's public safety committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a deep disappointment. That's one thing the council has
been screaming about,'' Podlodowski said. ``I'm hoping we can be a
little tougher than this group. The council has to address who is
watching the chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the panel's proposal, Stamper would remain accountable
only to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The chief was charged with underplaying misconduct cases after
revelations this year that at least eight officers, including an
internal-investigations sergeant, failed to report allegations that
a police detective stole $10,000 from the home of a city resident
who was killed in a shootout with police in October 1996. The money
was returned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper called the panel's suggestions ``bold and insightful,''
but declined to comment on endorsing specific remedies outlined in
the document. Likewise, Schell also would not bless any of the
specific reform proposals, other than to say ``one complaint is one
too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper acknowledged that it will be a challenge to weave the
proposed reforms into the ongoing contract talks, but said that he
will try to hammer the measures into the labor pact.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations have several hurdles, including gaining
approvals from the city council and the Police Officers Guild. The
panel outlined a dozen suggested policies the police union would
have to approve in this year's contract negotiations, talks that
already have snagged on reform ideas Stamper has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Current policies that trouble the panel were complaint
procedures that hamper effective misconduct investigations,
including a rule that calls for misconduct investigation files to
be destroyed three or four years after an inquiry is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The panel reserved its harshest language for these procedures,
tartly noting that Seattle's is perhaps the only law enforcement
agency in the nation that does not conduct in-person interviews of
employees that come before its internal investigations department.
Instead, the agency must submit written interview questions in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This current policy affords Seattle Police Department
employees more rights than those granted to citizens,'' the report
says. ``In essence, current policy obliges the Department to
conduct most investigations of misconduct by correspondence.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, head of the panel, was dismayed by that policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not find any other police department that does
that,'' Johnson said. ``In fact, we asked the lawyer for the union,
and he was unable to name any other place that does it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the King County Sheriff's Office conducts internal
affairs interviews in person, said sheriff's spokesman John
Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle policy has been in place only a few years, said
panel member Durkan, but already ``an erosion of management
function has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the police guild has shown a willingness to
discuss the issue at the bargaining table, she said.

<P>
   Sgt. J.D. Miller, guild vice-president and a former IIS
investigator, who said he hadn't read the report closely,
nevertheless questioned whether the practice had been accurately
portrayed in the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear accurate,'' Miller said, adding ``I would
disagree with the statement that we have additional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The city council will discuss the report Aug. 30.

SEAHAWKS MISFIRE AT FINISH, FALL TO 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ From an entertainment standpoint, it was a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   From an educational standpoint for a rookie quarterback, it was
invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brock Huard's two-point conversion pass kissed off the
outstretched hand of Michael Black in the end zone with nine
seconds remaining in 3Com Park Thursday night, the Seahawks had
lost their second preseason game in six days.
</P>
<P>
   This one was a wild 24-23 setback to the San Francisco 49ers
that featured an improved performance by the No. 1 offense in the
first half, but fell apart in the second half as Huard threw three
interceptions and special team's miscues led to 14 San Francisco
points in one dizzying 53-second span in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure after I see the film of this I'll feel a lot better
than I did after our first game,'' said new Seahawks coach Mike
Holmgren, whose homecoming was spoiled as the 49ers rallied for 21
fourth-quarter points. ``I liked our effort and hustle and the
first unit tackled well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers improved to 2-0 as defensive end David Richie, a
former teammate of Huard at the University of Washington, returned
the last of Huard's three interceptions 35 yards for the touchdown
that gave the 49ers a 24-17 lead with 1:51 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks set the table for Richie's game-winner earlier in
the quarter by allowing rookie Damon Griffin to return a kickoff 96
yards for a score and then, on the ensuing kickoff, giving the ball
back to the 49ers as rookie Charlie Rogers muffed the return to set
up Steve Stenstrom's 22-yard scoring pass to Na'il Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren didn't give up on Huard, who in turned refused give in.
The left-hander from Puyallup led the Seahawks from their own 29to
the 49ers' 9 with 24 seconds left. His pass to Mario Bailey,
another former Husky, was incomplete in the end zone. But 49ers
cornerback Wasswa Serwanga was flagged for pass interference,
giving the Seahawks a first down at the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Serwanga broke up Huard's first-down toss to Bailey and Huard
was hurried into throwing an incompletion on second down. On third
down, Huard went to tight Deems May, who beat 49ers linebacker
Anthony Peterson to the back of the end zone to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than go for the tie, Holmgren elected to go for two
points to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance to get out of here and catch the plane,''
Holmgren joked. ``Seriously, it was something I rarely get to do. I
think it's OK for the players to feel the excitement urgency of
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard played the entire second half, and finished with eight
completions in 16 attempts for 90 yards. But the pass he really
wanted _ the two-pointer to Black _ was thrown behind the former
Washington State running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you get rookies and inexperienced
guys in there, but the fact is we were inches away from winning the
game,'' Huard said. ``It was frustrating and humbling, but I'm sure
we'll learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement, and disappointment, of the second half all but
overshadowed an improved first-half performance by the No. 1
offense, which had managed just three points last Saturday night in
a 24-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Jon Kitna was much more active and
effective than in the opening loss. He completed 8 of 14 for 118 in
directing four first-half possessions. The Seahawks scored twice _
on a 1-yard leap into the end zone by Ricky Watters and a 33-yard
field goal by Todd Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   On the other two series, the Seahawks moved into 49ers territory
before Kitna's third-down pass to rookie Karsten Bailey was broken
up by 49ers cornerback Darnell Walker and Peterson slapped a
40-yard attempt off the right upright _ his second miss of the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also showed the run-after-the-catch element, so
vital to Holmgren's offense, that was missing in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   On the 12-play, 48-yard drive to Peterson's field goal, Kitna
dumped a 3-yard pass to fullback Reggie Brown, who turned it into a
20-yard gain with a nice run.
</P>
<P>
   On the 10-play, 75-yard drive to Watters' TD, Kitna found Sean
Dawkins with a 9-yard pass, but it turned into a 32-yard gain when
Dawkins ducked from the grasp of 49ers free safety Merton Hanks and
headed upfield.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams and defense also got into the act in the first
half. Charles Jordan returned a punt 18 yards to help set up
Peterson's field goal, and free safety Jay Bellamy intercepted a
Jeff Garcia pass to give the Seahawks the ball on the series that
ended with Peterson's miss.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all wasted when Huard's last pass fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sometimes harder to throw to a guy who is wide open,''
Huard said. ``I couldn't get a feel for whether he was going to sit
there or move. Still, it was a poor throw on my part.''

PAC-10 WOULD BE TOPS _ WITH TRADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We just got back from a listening tour of the Pacific-10
conference. We wanted to hear the coaches share their observations,
speak from their experience, give shape to their hopes and fears.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 college football campaign kickoff is nearly upon us.
What matters most to the coaches at this critical time is of
primary importance to us.
</P>
<P>
   We share their concerns. We are determined to help Pac-10
football reclaim its swagger. We can't wait to make those folks in
the Southeastern Conference eat their haughty cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC the best football conference in the country? That's what
one national publication is claiming. So is Mississippi State
offensive coordinator Sparky Woods, who was quoted as saying, `It
sure is. No doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not so sure. What we learned from listening to the Pac-10
coaches is the conference has an abundance of resources; they just
haven't been allocated right.
</P>
<P>
   With a little bit of deft re-distribution, we see no reason why
Arizona, UCLA and USC couldn't trump Tennessee, Florida and
Georgia. As for poor Vanderbilt, well, under our plan it would be
looking at the Beavers' tails for certain.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 schools just need to shift around a few players,
that's all. And don't tell us student-athletes aren't pawns in a
chess game, to be moved all across the board like their
counterparts in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   If the First Lady can claim an unfamiliar state as her own, for
no reason other than it has a job opening that suits her, why
should any athlete with ambition be held back? To paraphrase
Hillary Clinton, what's important is where you stand on NFL draft
day, not how you end up there.
</P>
<P>
   In the game all good politicians have down cold, like a
two-minute drill, the ends justify the means. So why shouldn't it
be so in the games our college athletes play?
</P>
<P>
   We submit that Washington's Joe-of-all-trades, Joe Jarzynka,
ought to be allowed to establish residency at USC. He could handle
the placekicking duties, lend his XXL heart to special teams, catch
a few passes in a pinch and teach R. Jay Soward a thing or two
about true passion in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Trojans senior center Matt McShane, who is on the verge of
losing his starting job to junior Eric Denmon, might feel more at
home in Seattle, where he would fill a huge hole on the Huskies'
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The ``J.P. Losman Rule,'' as we'll call it, would allow schools
to swap players with their permission. Kids interested in getting
their degrees and the most out of college would be awarded deferred
status. Everybody else would carry organ cards in their wallets
letting school authorities know their hearts may be transplanted in
another program if their football careers appear dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long shot, but maybe USC could persuade quarterback Mike
Van Raaphorst, whose feet are firmly on the ground, to take flight
to Cal to keep the starting job warm for freshman Kyle Boller the
same way he did for Carson Palmer. The Bears, in exchange, could
send down senior cornerback Drae Harris to help plug the holes left
by the losses of Daylon McCutcheon and Rashard Cook.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has the most explosive group of receivers in the nation,
but no dynamo has emerged yet to spark them. That's why a move to
Westwood could be good for Stanford junior Joe Borchard, who is
stuck behind incumbent starting quarterback Todd Husak.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Lewis is a resplendent running back who is dwarfed in
the Bruins' backfield by DeShaun Foster. Lewis could hightail it to
Stanford, which would probably be far enough away to bust out of
Foster's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard for Lewis would work for us (and most assuredly for
Bruins baseball coach Gary Adams, since Borchard is a bona fide
star in right field).
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Brian Jennings is sitting behind Kendrick Bates and
Todd Heap at Arizona State. A senior, his internal clock has to be
ticking loud enough to bust his eardrums. He could defuse a
potentially bittersweet end to his collegiate career by
establishing residence at Washington State. We're sure linebacker
Steve Gleason's backup, James Price, would shine with the Sun
Devils, given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Oregon State, owner of an NCAA-record 28
consecutive sub-500 seasons. The Beavers have a new coach with
big-league credentials in Dennis Erickson. They also have a
third-string center, Dustin Janz, who's as big as building blocks
come. The 308-pound sophomore doesn't figure to see much playing
time behind two-time letterman Keith DiDomenico.
</P>
<P>
   Janz, a Glendora High product, could do worse than establish
residency in Berkeley. Heaven knows the Bears' offensive line could
use some bolstering after yielding 58 sacks last year. Cal has a
stalwart center in John Romero, but new offensive line coach Ed
White, we're sure, would be delighted to deploy Janz at either
guard position.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are stacked with defensive linemen, so maybe redshirt
freshman Zech Whittington or junior Johnny Jackson could be
persuaded to live in Corvallis for a spell. This wouldn't make them
carpetbaggers, even if the Beavers do play on artificial turf. As
Hillary herself explained, ``It's where you stand, not where you
are from.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Pac-10 follows her game plan, the conference could stand
second to none. It would have our vote. &QL;

AFTER LONG JOURNEY, ABBOTT LIVING HIS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Others marvel at his resilience. Paul Abbott shakes
his head over the silliness.
</P>
<P>
   With almost religious zeal, he has wandered the countryside in
pursuit of his baseball dream. He has tried six major league
organizations, drawn paychecks in 15 different cities, left a
little of his soul in places such as Kenosha, Visalia and
Elizabethton.
</P>
<P>
   He was 17 when this quest began. He now has three kids, two
rapidly approaching their own teen years.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month from his 32nd birthday, Abbott has settled in
as a starting pitcher for the Seattle Mariners, enjoying his first
extended stay in the big leagues. It didn't have to take this long.
His arm never really betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent fun just got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the game for granted,'' Abbott says wistfully, ``which
will never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mariners clubhouse, this tall, slender Californian is an
unfailingly pleasant man, smiling and greeting everyone he passes.
With what he's gone through, it's a wonder he keeps his sanity, let
alone his fastball over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost too embarrassing to admit is how he got off track. Pull
up a chair; it's a long story.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a rainout in 1989, Abbott spent several hours in an
air-conditioned motel room in Knoxville, Tenn., vigorously working
the controls on a video game, unaware the muscles were tightening
in his throwing elbow until it was too late. He had strained the
joint.
</P>
<P>
   That still wasn't as painful as his mishap with the Minnesota
Twins during spring training in 1992, another awkward tale to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the time during batting practice, Abbott was hurt
playing ``500'' with fellow pitcher Scott Erickson. The game: 100
points for catching a fly ball, 75 for a one-hopper, 50 for a
two-hopper and 25 for a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott had a bead on a fly ball when he slipped and fell on his
shoulder, dislocating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was screwing around,'' he said. ``If it was on the field
(during a game), it would have been a different story. They weren't
too happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott had entered pro baseball full of promise, a kid with a
94-mph fastball, a third-round draft pick from Fullerton, Calif. He
was Orange County Register prep baseball player of the year. He was
offered a scholarship by college baseball power Cal
State-Fullerton. He signed for $50,000, significant money back
then.
</P>
<P>
   He made a steady climb to the majors, joining the Twins briefly
when he was 22. That was easy.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Abbott got two more callups, making 15 appearances
and winning three of four decisions for a Minnesota team that would
win the World Series. He didn't land on the postseason roster, but
his efforts were amply rewarded with a championship ring and
$60,000, a Series half-share.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, however, gave up on him after the shoulder
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott started knocking on doors, signing with the Cleveland,
Kansas City, Chicago Cubs and San Diego organizations. Only the
Indians gave him a major league look, bringing him up for five
games in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland was great to me,'' he said. ``They gave me every
opportunity to make it. I pitched terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the rebound, Abbott labored through Omaha, Des Moines and Las
Vegas, unable to make anything happen. He was often close but never
moved up. He tried winter ball in Puerto Rico. One day on the
island, he felt a ligament stretch in his elbow after throwing a
curve. That was a warning sign of worse trouble to come.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at his banishment to the minors and the reoccurrence
of pain, Abbott took stock of everything. He concluded he hadn't
been serious enough about the game. He changed everything _ eating
habits, workouts, outlook. No more pasta, french fries, Cokes or
video games.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Mariners decided to see what Abbott had
left and signed him in 1997. It was a perfect match, yet there
would be trying times before this relationship was cemented.
</P>
<P>
   At Tacoma, Abbott got off to an 8-4 start, was the Pacific Coast
League strikeout leader, and was close to joining the Mariners. He
felt his elbow throb. This had happened before, but with rest and
treatment he had always come back. This time was different. He sat
out for two months, went to Arizona on a rehabilitation assignment
and tore an elbow ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy John surgery was required, a major ordeal. Abbott never
once thought of giving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I struggled and hadn't been throwing the ball well, it
might have been different,'' he said. ``I was too close to have any
negative thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, the persistent Abbott was back on the
mound, first in Arizona, then Tacoma and finally with the Mariners.
He went 3-1 in four late-season outings in Seattle, drawing praise
from manager Lou Piniella and earning an invitation to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he could pitch up here and win up here with
regularity,'' Piniella said. ``When a pitcher can throw strikes and
command his pitches, he can almost pitch out of any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Abbott would stumble once more, literally. Preparing himself
for a second shot with the Mariners, he went to Puerto Rico for
winter ball. Covering first base, he tore up a knee, requiring more
surgery and putting him on the sidelines until June.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Mariners appearances later, Abbott has averted any
calamities. Just the opposite. He has been superb in the bullpen,
effective as a starter, mixing his fastball with a baffling
screwball changeup.
</P>
<P>
   He enters the weekend series against Cleveland with a 4-0 record
and 3.92 earned run average, coming off a career-high
nine-strikeout game at Toronto earlier in the week. He pitches
again on Monday, against the Indians' Charles Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, the Mariners are counting on Abbott to provide a
veteran touch to the rotation, to blend in with all the promising
rookies. He's certainly not lacking experience. Or tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure anybody who's gone through what's he gone through
must have a certain drive to get through any situation,'' Woody
Woodward, vice president of baseball operations, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done it the hard way,'' Mariners pitcher Jamie Moyer
said. ``He can look in a mirror and be happy with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   As Abbott enjoys the long overdue fruits from a sport he won't
abandon, his two sons play baseball and play it well. Trent, 11,
was a member of a California AAU team that recently won a national
championship in Orlando, Fla. Lance, 12, is part of another
California team that will play in a high-profile tournament next
week at Cooperstown, N.Y., site of baseball's Hall of Fame. Both
are pitchers and shortstops, and some of their dad's toughest
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rag me when I give up a home run to someone,'' Abbott
said. ``I have to pitch well to keep them off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball runs deep in this family. Abbott married his high
school sweetheart, Yvette, the sister of one of his American Legion
teammates. They have traveled the country together, with the kids
in tow, looking for stability. They didn't buy a house in Fullerton
until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Abbott boys want to pursue this crazy game on the
professional level, their dad can show them how to do it. Or how
not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He would advise them to be ready for anything, but mostly to
follow their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all I tell them is to take it as far as they want
to take it,'' Abbott said. ``They have a lot of talent. but so much
goes into it. It's a hard road.''
</P>
<P>
   He can draw them a map.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a battle between two giant publishing
companies, Walt Disney Co. has decided to sell its Fairchild
Publishing division, which publishes Women's Wear Daily and W, for
$650 million to Conde Nast Publications, the glossy, high-profile
publisher of magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair, Mademoiselle and
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would merge two of the fashion world's most powerful
publishing entities and their distinct publishing styles: the
frills-free but provocative style of Fairchild with the
no-expenses-spared ethos of Conde Nast, a company that will send
luggage overnight by Federal Express if a fatigued fashion editor
does not want to carry it on a flight. A Disney executive said the
agreement would be announced either Friday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications,
and Disney confirmed that S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde
Nast, had offered close to $650 million for the company _ which
includes influential trade publications like Women's Wear Daily and
Daily News Record and consumer fashion magazines W and Jane _ and
that Disney executives had accepted Newhouse's offer. Executives at
Hearst Magazines, the other bidder for Fairchild and the publisher
of magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country, would not
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which is not the largest financial transaction in the
magazine industry in recent years but one of the most influential,
will certainly alter the advertising landscape that preoccupies
magazine publishers. Fairchild publishes Women's Wear Daily, the
influential daily that covers the American fashion industry and
determines the fortunes of designers, and W, one of the
fastest-growing and profitable consumer fashion titles in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will assure Conde Nast's continued dominance in
the fashion magazine industry, in part because advertisers will be
offered package rates to advertise in several magazines at once,
including both Vogue and W.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes advertising rates more attractive because Conde Nast
can put W in with the rest of the package,'' said Roberta
Garfinkle, the director of print media at the McCann-Erickson
advertising agency. ``That's the key. And advertisers will be drawn
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And designers said that the purchase signaled Conde Nast's
continued confidence in the fashion industry. ``I think that,
unlike Harper's Bazaar, which has to change drastically, Women's
Wear and W are not going to change too much, because they are both
so successful,'' Bill Blass said. ``They both have a unique niche
in the fashion industry, and they are unlike anybody else. They are
daring, but with a certain restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   The merging of the companies means that Conde Nast will own more
fashion advertising dollars than any other magazine publisher. That
is an expanding field worth hundreds of millions of dollars in
revenue each year and includes advertising for toiletries and
cosmetics, apparel and accessories, home furnishings and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel and accessories advertisers spent $536 million in
American magazines from January to July this year, an increase of
8.8 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according to
the Publishers Information Bureau. Virtually every fashion designer
_ from Calvin Klein to Donna Karan _ is expanding into home
furnishings and supplies, an advertising category that is up 16.2
percent, to $614 million for January to July. And retail
advertising is up 32.2 percent, to $313 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the deal, W magazine, has taken apparel advertising
from magazines at both Hearst and Conde Nast. In 1998, W boasted
2,005 advertising pages for the year, while Harper's Bazaar _
previously second to Vogue _ lagged behind at 1,542. Vogue led the
field with 2,681 pages of advertising last year, and in second
place, with 2,068 pages, was Elle, published by the
Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere Group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, W generated $33.5 million in advertising revenue for
Fairchild, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, and by
1998 that figure had increased to $87.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet what Conde Nast proposes to do with the
numerous trade titles that Fairchild publishes _ small, profitable
publications like Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News
and Children's Business _ but one Conde Nast executive said that
the company would prefer to keep them because they turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Los Angeles magazine, also published under the
Fairchild umbrella, is also not clear. A Disney executive said that
Disney might prefer to keep that magazine as a kind of home-town
periodical.

   What is clear is that Disney has wrestled with the issue of
whether to sell Fairchild since 1995, when Disney _ never a
traditional magazine publisher _ acquired Capital Cities/ABC, then
the longtime parent company of Fairchild. And for a while,
Fairchild seemed destined for the auction block: in 1997, Disney
even announced a decision to sell the division, then retracted it a
week later. But Disney has been under pressure recently from Wall
Street to revive its core businesses, such as its theme parks and
movie studio and sell its nonstrategic assets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already sold some of the noncore assets it
acquired with Capital Cities. In April 1997, Disney sold four
newspapers acquired in the deal, including The Kansas City Star and
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Disney sold the trade publisher Chilton to the
British-Dutch company Reed Elsevier for $447 million and
Institutional Investor Inc. to Euromoney Publications for $142
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, was eager
to acquire Fairchild, a Disney executive said. And a deal with
Hearst seemed almost a fait accompli because the Hearst Corp. has
several affiliations with Disney: Hearst television stations are
affiliates of ABC, which is owned by Disney, and Hearst owns 20
percent of ESPN, of which ABC owns the balance. Hearst also owns a
small piece of ESPN magazine. And ABC and Hearst are both investors
in two cable services: Lifetime and Arts and Entertainment. But the
Hearst Corp.'s recent acquisition of The San Francisco Chronicle
for $500 million may have chilled the company's ardor for more
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for Disney and Hearst declined to comment. Maurie
Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast, said that the company did not
comment on acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In the famously gossip-prone magazine industry, where glee at
other's misfortune is freely displayed and fortunes rise and fall
with the speed of a season's hemlines, the purchase of Fairchild
further cements the intensifying rivalry between Conde Nast and
Hearst Magazines, which is as competitive as two avid New York
shoppers fighting for the last pair of discounted Manolo Blahnik
slippers at a Seventh Avenue sample sale.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tina Brown _ who edited two Conde Nast titles, Vanity
Fair and The New Yorker _ signed on with Hearst to produce her new
magazine, Talk. (The other partner in Talk is Miramax Films, a unit
of Disney.) In June, Hearst announced that Katherine Betts, the
fashion news director at Vogue, would become editor in chief of its
primary fashion title, Harper's Bazaar _ and Ms. Betts has hired at
least four of her former Conde Nast colleagues to accompany her in
remaking the magazine, earning the ire of her former co-workers at
Conde Nast.

`PACK ATTACKS' ON HOMELESS APPEARS TO BE DISTURBING PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were three teenage boys who liked dirt-bikes,
beer, metal music and hanging out in North Seattle parks.
</P>
<P>
   He was a homeless man who had seen hard times in jail and slept
alone under the freeway among broken glass and weeds.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors charged the boys Wednesday in the man's brutal
killing, the cruelty of the case jarred criminal-justice experts.
It also echoed recent cases in which the young and strong have
killed the weak and vulnerable for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, police arrested Jay Stewart, 17; Shelton Musgrave,
18; and Michael ``Vito'' Caffee, 18; after finding David
Ballenger's body with 18 stab wounds, five broken ribs and many
cuts and bruises. Ballenger had been killed where he slept under
the Interstate 5 overpass at Northeast Ravenna Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my understanding, I don't think there was a motivation
other than a rage thing. It almost sounds like a thrill kill,''
said Seattle Police homicide sergeant Cynthia Tallman.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors say they don't see a trend in juvenile
crime against transients, but do see a recurrence of savage ``pack
street attacks'' against a lone, vulnerable victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they're doing it just for fun,'' said Mike Lang,
a King County senior deputy prosecuting attorney in the juvenile
unit. About once a month, he sees a case involving young people
severely attacking someone for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a group of youths beat a Somali youth into a
coma in West Seattle, and another group converged on a Garfield
High School baseball player as he was leaving practice.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile killings of homeless people are rare, Tallman said.
``More often, with the transient population, the biggest group of
people they need to fear are other transients.''
</P>
<P>
   While the motive in Ballenger's killing defied explanation, the
attack was similar to these other recent cases involving youths and
transients:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last August, a 17-year-old boy and a 27-year-old man were
convicted of beating and robbing a homeless Everett man, whom they
dragged to a train track. Then they watched a train run over him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last June, a 14-year-old middle-school boy was charged with
using a knife and skateboard to kill a homeless man in a Queen Anne
park. He later bragged to friends that he killed ``a bum'' and
showed off his skateboard matted with blood and hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, two boys, 12 and 13, were charged with setting a man
on fire while he slept on a downtown bus bench, after one of them
said, ``Let's go mess with the drunk dude.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts were at a loss to explain the attacks, other than the
usual culprits: Violence in the media, lack of morals, bad
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Neil Low of the Seattle police juvenile unit said Thursday
he believes the severity of juvenile crime has increased, while the
frequency has remained low. He recalled a case last year in which a
group of kids had beaten a sleeping homeless man at Sixth Avenue
and Pine Street for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being disgusted, thinking, why do you have to jump
a homeless man sleeping in a bedroll?'' he said. ``Things like that
make you wonder what's going on with values.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets Thursday, many homeless people hadn't heard of
Ballenger's killing and said it had little effect on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard some dude got stabbed,'' said Johnny Stanford, a
38-year-old man working at the Bread of Life Mission. ``People die
all the time. You got to sleep with one eye open and one eye
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for the homeless said they often saw teenagers
pick on transients; others said it rarely happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen young kids hit and push on homeless people, cause
they can't defend themselves,'' said Loren Beason, a bookkeeper at
the Bread of Life. He recalled seeing seven to eight youths beating
on a homeless man on a wheelchair and going through his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see that, you don't want to get involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Richard, a 58-year-old man who's seen better days, was
sitting on a bench in Occidental Park. Suddenly, three young men
hollered, ``Where's your money?'' They began rummaging through his
pockets, but found nothing. Then one of the men crushed a burning
cigarette out on his cheek, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw red after that. It hurt,'' he said. He had been in the
Army, had worked as a cable splicer for Boeing, and had been
married in Portland, Ore. The attack made him wary of the streets
and wanting a gun, but he had nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel now, I don't fit in,'' he said. ``I never thought
it would happen to me, being an older man. They don't have respect,
these guys.''

Pick your poison.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Holt, the Astros' starting pitcher in Thursday's 6-5 loss
to Milwaukee, allowed singles to seven of the first 10 batters he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Barker, speedy but sometimes overaggressive, was caught off
second base after taking too wide a turn. Jeff Bagwell was thrown
out attempting to stretch a single into a double.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied in the ninth inning, Tim Bogar made an
ill-advised throw to first that sailed over the dugout and became a
souvenir for a fan sitting in the fifth row _ and set up the
winning run for the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching. Running. Fielding. All contributed to a one-run loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes, way too many mistakes to win,''
manager Larry Dierker said after the Astros' three-game winning
streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the things that went wrong in front of a crowd of
22,934 at the Astrodome, the outcome was not decided until the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled like crazy,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   After rallying from a three-run deficit, the Astros handed the
game right back in the final inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ochoa singled off reliever Jay Powell (4-3), the Astros'
third pitcher, to lead off the Brewers' ninth. Marquis Grissom
attempted to sacrifice Ochoa to second, only to wind up there
himself when Bogar thought he had a shot at a double play after
taking Powell's throw for a forceout on Ochoa. Bogar's bad throw
set up Kevin Barker's go-ahead single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have never thrown the ball,'' Bogar said. ``I didn't
have a good grip, but that didn't matter. Honestly, it was just a
bad decision. It came back to bite us.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker, making his major-league debut, also singled in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to fit in and hustle and make it fun,''
Barker said. ``I admit I was nervous. I hadn't been able to breathe
since batting practice. This should help, but I'm sure I will still
be nervous. It will probably last another week.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Banks had a career-high four hits and Grissom went 3-for-5
as Milwaukee pounded Astros pitching for 17 hits. The hit total was
the most allowed by the Astros since Minnesota bashed out 21 on
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers took batting practice off Holt with seven singles in
the first two innings, five in the second alone.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 2-0 lead in the second on run-scoring singles
by pitcher Scott Karl and Ron Belliard. The Astros tied it in the
bottom of the inning on RBI singles by Tony Eusebio and Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers went up 5-2 in the third. Geoff Jenkins doubled and
advanced to third on a groundout. Grissom followed with a slow
grounder that third baseman Ken Caminiti fielded. Caminiti decided
to go home, Jenkins and Grissom were both safe, and the Brewers
went on to score two more runs in the inning on a double by Banks
and a sacrifice fly by Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the one play that could have turned the whole game was
if Caminiti would have thrown the ball to first instead of home,''
Dierker said. ``That really put Chris in a hole and cost him a
couple of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 innings, had two
RBIs. He retired 11 straight Astros at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed five runs and a career-high-tying 13 hits in seven
innings, but after the third he limited the Brewers to three hits.
The five earned runs allowed by Holt in three innings were more
than in his previous 22 innings (four).
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some bad pitches, and some good pitches they got hits
off,'' Holt said. ``I wasn't sharp. I didn't have my best stuff. I
weathered it and was able to get through some innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who rallied in the eighth inning Wednesday, pulled
within 5-4 on a two-run homer by Eusebio in the seventh. Eusebio
went 2-for-3 with three RBIs and threw out two runners trying to
steal.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell tied the game with an RBI single off Rocky
Coppinger (2-1) in the eighth but was thrown out trying for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too aggressive,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Astros had a chance to tie or win in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With closer Bob Wickman on the mound, pinch hitter Bill Spiers
led off with a single and Bogar walked with one out. Pinch hitter
Daryle Ward struck out, and Craig Biggio, who went 0-for-5, lined
to center field as Wickman notched his 25th save.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ students are coming.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph
said parochial schools expected to exceed last year's enrollment of
14,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our enrollment is way, way up,'' said Rebecca
Summers. ``We just have to have the kids in the desks to count
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trish Harris enrolled her two daughters at Southwest Charter
School this year after trying both the public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Harris moved her daughters out of the Kansas City School
District several years ago when she said the quality of teachers
began to decline, the class sizes grew too large and fewer and
fewer parents seemed interested in their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   She then enrolled her daughters at Calvary Lutheran, the same
school she had attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my children would always be there,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the school could not offer the multicultural
environment that she thinks is important for her daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like the kids in the big wide world today need to be
able to look at things from many different perspectives, both
cultural and racial,'' Harris said. ``I think the charter is going
to touch on cultural diversity in a way the private schools
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The charter schools also are presenting a financial and staffing
challenge for the Kansas City School District.
</P>
<P>
   The district is estimating that it could lose millions of
dollars annually in state school aid that would follow district
students who choose to attend charter schools. State officials
estimate that Kansas City charter schools would receive a maximum
of about $5,100 per pupil based on the school foundation formula.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City charter school officials initially estimated that
the 17 schools would enroll as many as 9,000 students. The schools
have since cut that estimate to about 5,800 after several changed
the number of grades and classes they planned to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Some district schools, such as Foreign Language Academy and
Swinney Elementary, had to rebuild their teaching staffs after many
teachers left for the charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   District officials will not know until school begins Aug. 31
just how many students have abandoned the district for charter
schools. That in turn makes it difficult for officials to assign
the correct number of teachers to buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you don't want to staff schools and not have
students show up,'' said Eugene Eubanks, a member of the
court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee.

DEFENDING LITTLE LEAGUE CHAMPS RETURNING TO WORLD SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ Playing like the Little League World Series
veterans they are, Eric Campesi and Casey Gaynor led Toms River
East of New Jersey to a 3-0 victory over Middleboro, Mass.,
Thursday night in the East Regional championship game at the A.
Bartlett Giamatti Complex.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River, which won the Little League World Series last year,
will return to Williamsport, Pa., to defend its title. The
eight-team World Series begins on Sunday, when Toms River will play
Phenix City, Ala., at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River became the third team from the United States to
return to the World Series the year after winning the title. It
will be Toms River's third World Series appearance in all.
</P>
<P>
   Campesi and Gaynor are the only returning players from the team
that defeated Kashima, Japan, to win last year's world title.
Campesi accounted for Toms River's only hit of the game Thursday
night when he punched a two-run homer over the right-field fence in
the third inning. Gaynor, who was all but unhittable in this
regional tournament, struck out 10 batters, including five of the
last six he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor, who pitched in last year's victory over Japan, allowed
only one hit Thursday night _ a second-inning single _ in pitching
a six-inning complete game and earning his fourth victory of the
regional. He surrendered no runs and four hits and struck out 39
batters in his four appearances.
</P>
<P>
   It was immediately evident that this would be no offensive
free-for-all. Both pitchers _ Gaynor and Middleboro's Sam Cole _
were among the biggest players on the field, and they threw like
it, humming fastballs by what seemed to be an endless stream of
batters. Cole opened the game by striking out Campesi and Gaynor as
the Toms River faithful sat in stunned silence. Cole would go on to
strike out 11 batters, including seven in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor was nearly as dominant, striking out two in the first
inning. When he returned to the mound in the bottom of the second,
six of the game's nine batters had gone down on strikes, so a
feeling of uneasiness raced through the Toms River bleachers when
Middleboro's Kyle Jones ripped a single to center field on Gaynor's
first pitch. But the next three batters grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the game's turning point. After striking out Chris
Cunningham in the third, Cole walked Chris Fontenelli. With the top
of the lineup batting, the New Jersey fans grew excited, sensing
something special. Cole struck out Zack Delvento for the second
out, but Campesi then surprised everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Catching a Cole fastball with the fat part of his bat, Campesi
hit a homer over the right-field fence 200 feet away. The
opposite-field shot cleared the fence by only a couple of feet and
sent Campesi dancing around the bases to the cheers of the Toms
River fans.
</P>
<P>
   With Gaynor appearing to grow stronger as the game proceeded,
Middleboro could do nothing but lament. When Gaynor struck out the
side in the bottom of the fifth, the team and crowd from
Massachusetts seemed to know the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Middleboro's players looked defeated when taking the field in
the top of the sixth and last inning, and Toms River added an
insurance run. Delvento walked, moved to second on a grounder and
stole third. He scored to make the score 3-0 after a short popup by
Gaynor landed in front of Ryan Seaman, the Middleboro first
baseman. Unsure what to do, Seaman grabbed the ball, turned his
back and first stepped on the bag, allowing Delvento to sprint home
ahead of his throw.

INTEREST IN CHARTER SCHOOLS CONTINUES TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's experiment with charter schools
begins in earnest this fall, as 15 of the independently governed
schools are scheduled to be operating by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at several charter schools report strong interest from
parents and say they are pleased with early enrollment numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the schools, however, also are experiencing
last-minute problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of chaotic,'' said Lisa Mallow of the Learning
Exchange. The nonprofit educational group is tracking and providing
guidance for the Kansas City charter school movement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at one school, Banneker Charter Academy of Technology,
continued to negotiate for a permanent location as late as this
week, less than a month before the school's scheduled Sept. 13
opening. The school's principal said Friday that Banneker would
operate out of several temporary locations in churches and
community centers if a permanent site was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Several others have pushed back their opening dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be sure everything was done on time so there
wasn't chaos when the school opened,'' said Gina Valente, director
of operations for Scuola Vita Nuova, which moved its opening from
Sept. 7 to Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools were still awaiting word this week on whether the
Kansas City School District will provide them with cafeteria
service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the school officials are unsure of just how
much state money they will receive and when, making it difficult to
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would say there is confusion,'' said Gerri Ogle, the
state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education official
charged with overseeing the finances of charter schools. ``I
suspect they're not all clear on their budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   And some wonder whether it might all be for naught if a
challenge to the state law authorizing charter schools proves
successful.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed by the St. Louis Board of Education seeks to
block the opening of the first charter school in that city. The
lawsuit also alleges that the law authorizing charter schools is
unconstitutional. A hearing is scheduled for Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Observers at the Learning Exchange and elsewhere said the Kansas
City problems were characteristic of those found in other states
when charter schools began their first year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Allen, president of the Washington-based Center for
Education Reform, a nonprofit group that advocates school choice,
partly blamed the first-year problems on confusion of local and
state officials over how to deal with the new schools and the haste
of grass-roots organizers to get the schools open.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things that charter schools have to do right now are
things the public schools have had years to plan or perfect,''
Allen said. ``There tend to be an awful lot of last-minute snafus
not due to mismanagement of anybody in the charter, but just
because that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, the allure of the charter schools is
proving powerful for many Kansas City parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't only about my son,'' said Linda Fewell, parent of a
sixth- grader at the Kansas City Foreign Language Charter School.
``This movement has the potential to benefit generations to come.
That's an exciting opportunity and certainly makes it worth seeing
through any of the challenges that have come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewell, a former Kansas City School District parent, opted for a
charter school because of an atmosphere of high expectations and
the opportunity to more closely track and affect her child's
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are part of a national education reform movement
designed to offer alternatives to failing public schools and
expensive private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state has approved 17 charter schools for Kansas City. Two
are not scheduled to open until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools typically receive the same amount of state money
per student as any public school but are free of a district's
central office and much of the state's regulatory control. They are
governed by an independent board.
</P>
<P>
   The schools cannot charge tuition, must observe all federal
anti-discrimination laws and meet health, safety and accessibility
regulations. All students must have an equal opportunity to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Under Missouri law, as much as 20 percent of the school's
teaching staff can be exempt from state teacher certification
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   As of April more than 1,205 operating charters were serving
300,000 students in 36 states and the District of Columbia,
according to the Center for Education Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Actual enrollment figures for Kansas City charters will not be
known until several weeks after the schools open, but Kansas City
charter school operators report few problems filling seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a lot of interest, especially with the
kindergarten and first grade,'' said Vivian Roper, principal at the
Tolbert Community Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Roper said her school was considering whether to offer more
classrooms for kindergarten and first grades and fewer for second
and third grades than initially planned. Roper and others
speculated that parents of older students might be reluctant to
pull them from their current schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the grade level changes, Roper said she expected the
Tolbert charter school to meet its projected enrollment of 225
students.
</P>
<P>
   Several charters reported enrolling large numbers of former
private and parochial school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's parents who want a private school approach to education
but are finding it difficult to pay that price,'' Roper said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, from which schools those students are
coming. MORE

ALCOA AND REYNOLDS REACH MERGER AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert share prices in 2nd graf; rewrites 12th graf and
corrects Alcoa to No. 1 from No. 2; strengthens lede graf.)  (th) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcoa Inc., the world's oldest and largest aluminum company,
announced Thursday that it had reached a definitive merger
agreement with the No. 3 producer, Reynolds Metals Co., in a
relatively swift negotiation that left some Reynolds shareholders
grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In an all-stock deal, Reynolds' shareholders will receive 1.06
shares of Alcoa for each Reynolds share. At Wednesday's closing
price of $66.875 for Alcoa, this deal would be valued at around
$4.4 billion, or $70.8875 a share for Reynolds' stockholders. Alcoa
shares fell $1.6875, to $65.1875, Thursday, and Reynolds was off
$2.6875, to $65.5625. While accepting this deal, however, Reynolds
left open the door for another buyer to come along, as both
companies agreed to allow Reynolds to solicit takeover bids for the
next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, which made its first bid for Reynolds last week, agreed
to this somewhat unusual clause because Alcoa executives believed
that Reynolds would find no other bidders, people close to the
merger talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 day shopping-window allows Reynolds, which has been
looking for a potential buyer for nearly a year now, to placate
shareholders who have been angry at Reynolds' management for not
selling the company earlier and for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge against Reynolds is Richard Grubman, managing
director at Highfields Capital Management, a Boston firm that owns
6 percent of Reynolds. In a letter to the Reynolds' board Thursday,
Grubman said, ``You have allowed Alcoa to steal the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubman was especially angered by a rejection last March by
Jeremiah J. Sheehan, the chief executive of Reynolds, of a
1.42-a-share exchange offer from Alcoa. At the time Sheehan was
telling shareholders that no one was interested in acquiring
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your behavior is reprehensible,'' Grubman wrote, adding, ``You
sold us out.'' Grubman also accused Reynolds of ``squandering $2
billion of shareholder value'' and said that Reynolds ``effectively
lied to shareholders'' and ``has reached a new low in corporate
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Grubman nor Reynolds would comment on this letter
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day solicitation window also allows McCook Metals, owned
by the Chicago investment firm Michigan Partners, to make a bid, if
it is interested. Last week, McCook wrote to Reynolds expressing
interest in topping Alcoa's bid, but provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers close to the deal said McCook did not seem serious:
``There was no price, no financing, no nothing. It was all air,''
one said. Calls to McCook Metals were not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to make it difficult for anyone to halt this merger, the
agreement between Alcoa and Reynolds also contains a $100 million
break-up fee, which would increase the cost of acquiring Reynolds
by about $1.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, Alcoa would remain the world's No. 1
aluminum producer. APA, a new company to be created by the
three-company, two-continent merger of Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of
Canada, Pechiney in France and Alusuisse Lonza Group of
Switzerland, would have greater revenue. The three-way $17.6
billion merger was announced last week and would create a huge
global competitor for Alcoa, with projected revenues of $21.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   An Alcoa-Reynolds merger would create a company with $20.5
billion in projected revenues and 120,000 employees in 36
countries. But nearly all those revenues would be derived from
aluminum production, while around $4 billion of APA's projected
revenues would come from non-aluminum assets. This merger wave was
brought on by global overcapacity for aluminum and prices that have
plunged to five-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is good for Alcoa, good for Reynolds shareholders
and good for the aluminum industry,'' said Richard Aldrich, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``With fewer players, there will be
less redundant capacity, which is a long-term plus for the
industry.'' Aldrich dismissed Grubman's complaints as ``20-20
hindsight'' and said he doubted another buyer would come along, but
cautioned that ``anything is possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alcoa and Reynolds executives said they expected that combining
the two companies would realize around $200 million in cost savings
_ a number some analysts said was low _ and they expected antitrust
problems to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious antitrust problem is that the two companies
would represent more than 50 percent of the smelting capacity in
the United States, although analysts say the companies will
probably argue that smelting, a low-margin commodity business,
should be viewed as a global industry, and not as a domestic one.
</P>
<P>
   Other problem areas are minimal. Reynolds is best known for
making such consumer products as aluminum foil and beverage cans,
while Alcoa makes aluminum for heavy industries like planes and
autos. While both companies serve the auto industry, Alcoa is
bigger in castings like engine blocks, while Reynolds makes
aluminum components for wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The two overlap in producing alumina, a compound from which
aluminum is produced. In 1997, Reynolds sold an Alabama rolling
mill to another buyer, after the government rejected its sale to
Alcoa. As a result, say analysts, another antitrust impediment was
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that there won't be some asset divestiture,''
said James Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. ``But I do
believe that the companies are complementary. Alcoa's management
has said that Reynolds begins where Alcoa stops and I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Alain J.P. Belda, Alcoa's chief executive, said, ``The new
company will be better positioned to address the ongoing
globalization of the metals industry and the new competitive
landscape this is creating.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' chief executive, Sheehan, said, ``Reynolds
shareholders will receive an attractive price for their shares and
still have the opportunity to participate in the upside potential
of the combined company.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tumazos, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the proposed
union ``creates no problems, only opportunities.'' His only concern
was that the automakers, as major users of aluminum, might seek to
lock in long-term, low-price aluminum supply contracts from the
combined company to protect themselves from any potential
monopolistic pricing.

JUSTICE DEPT. PROPOSES BILL TO FIGHT COMPUTER ENCRYPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is proposing legislation
that would make it easier for law enforcement agents to thwart
computer encryption programs that they believe are being used to
cover up crimes, department officials said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which the department has drafted and hopes to
submit to Congress soon, would allow investigators to request
special permission from judges to enter suspects' homes or offices
to search computers for passwords or encryption programs as a
prelude to more invasive searches or wiretaps, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and law enforcement agencies have
grown increasingly worried about the use of software that encrypts
or scrambles computer files, making them unusable gibberish to
anyone without a special code.
</P>
<P>
   The push for the legislation was first reported Friday by The
Washington Post and confirmed Thursday night by department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The full details of the department's legislation remained
unclear. But the officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the legislation would make it easier for agents
investigating crimes to obtain special warrants to find and disable
the encryption programs.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has long pushed for such authorization, arguing that
investigators needed ways to thwart the elaborate efforts by
criminals to conceal fraud, drug trafficking, terrorism,
distribution of child pornography and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of tougher legislation winning approval on Capitol
Hill is uncertain at best. Although law enforcement officials have
justified the proposal as a necessary and constitutional step, the
idea of giving authorities more power to search computer files and
programs has raised alarm among civil liberations and many
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies can now search computers, but the new
legislation essentially would clarify circumstances in which they
could crack or disable encryption programs in order to carry out
investigations.

FREDERIC HSIEH, 54, MADE ASIAN-AMERICAN SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frederic Hsieh, the entrepreneur who helped turn
the Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park into the first U.S. city in
which Asians were a majority of the population by advertising it as
``the Chinese Beverly Hills,'' died on Aug. 8 while on vacation in
Las Vegas. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, according to the Echo News Agency of
Monterey Park.
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of Mandarin Realty Co., which bought land in
Monterey Park and sold it to newly arrived immigrants, Hsieh
(pronounced shay) placed advertisements in Chinese-language
newspapers with overseas readers describing Monterey Park's rolling
hills as similar to those in Taipei, Taiwan. He also used Monterey
Park's area code, which was then 818, as an enticement; in Chinese
numerology, the number 8 is believed to bestow prosperity and good
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh's efforts put Monterey Park on the radar screen of tens of
thousands of mostly affluent Chinese and Taiwanese and residents of
Hong Kong in the 1970s and '80s. Before long, the city was among
favorite destinations for Asian immigrants like Vancouver and
Toronto in Canada, Sydney, Australia, and the San Francisco Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 census, Monterey Park had 60,738 residents, with
Asians making up 57 percent of them, making it the first
Asian-majority city in the United States. The city's population
today is more than 62,000, and is about two-thirds Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey Park, which is in the San Gabriel Valley east of Los
Angeles, already had a large population of Japanese-Americans and
Chinese-Americans. But Hsieh is credited with recognizing that
changes in U.S. immigration policies in the 1960s would open the
door for more immigrants from the Far East, and that tensions
between China and Taiwan and the impending return of Hong Kong to
China in 1997 would motivate affluent Asians to seek a home and a
place to invest abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Fred Hsieh, I think many of the Chinese would have
relocated to many more traditional areas, like the San Francisco
Bay Area or New York, and may have bypassed Los Angeles or the San
Gabriel Valley completely,'' said Timothy Fong, the author of the
1994 book ``The First American Chinatown: The Remaking of Monterey
Park'' (Temple University Press). ``Moving to Monterey Park was a
sign of making it in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Hsieh was born in Guilin, in southern China, in 1945,
and attended schools in Shanghai and Hong Kong. He came to the
United States in 1963 and received a bachelor's degree and a
master's degree in civil engineering from Oregon State University.
In 1970, he worked for the City of Los Angeles as a civil engineer.
</P>
<P>
   He bought his first property, a four-unit building in the Echo
Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, when he could not find a landlord
who was willing to rent to him and his pregnant wife. Living in one
of the units, he rented the other three and then began buying
property in Monterey Park, finding potential in the city's nearness
to downtown Los Angeles, its easy freeway access and its reasonable
real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Hsieh began selling real estate there.
</P>
<P>
   As Asians and investment money began to arrive in great numbers
in the late 1970s and the '80s, there was considerable discord as
some longtime white residents and even some Asian homeowners
resented the large numbers of new immigrants. There was a drive to
pass an ordinance barring Chinese-language business signs and to
make English the city's official language. Both efforts failed,
though a watered-down measure was approved that required Chinese
shop signs to be in English as well.
</P>
<P>
   As Monterey Park grew to become Los Angeles' ``new Chinatown''
and ``Little Taipei,'' Hsieh became involved in the development of
the city's first Chinese housing complex for the elderly, called
the Golden Age Village. He also built a Sheraton hotel in his
native Guilin in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh's marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by a son,
Eric, and a daughter, Sophia.

QUAL-MED ORDERED TO PAY $250,000 FINE FOR EMERGENCY-ROOM CLAIM
DENIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Washington state Insurance Commissioner's Office
on Thursday fined QualMed Washington HealthPlan Inc. $250,000 for
improperly denying emergency-room claims, ending an eight-month
investigation into the handling of emergency room visits.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement followed a major investigation by Commissioner
Deborah Senn into emergency-room denials by QualMed and three other
large Washington state health insurers: Regence BlueShield, Premera
Blue Cross and Aetna U.S. HealthCare.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the denied claims reviewed involved people with broken
legs or head wounds, and people who were taken to an emergency room
by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, one of the largest ever against an insurance company
in Washington, is designed to set an example so other carriers will
not deny appropriate claims, Senn said at a news conference
Thursday. QualMed said no patients were denied emergency care and
called the problem ``administrative.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was triggered by complaints from emergency
room physicians, who said their patients were becoming hesitant to
seek emergency treatment for fear their claims would be rejected.
The physicians also said dealing with paperwork for denied claims
was eating up a growing percentage of their time, taking them away
from patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's ``prudent layperson'' emergency-care law,
insurers are required to cover the cost of screening and
stabilizing emergency-room patients when a prudent layperson would
have sought emergency treatment under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The law went into effect Jan. 1, 1998. The Insurance
Commissioner's Office looked at claims submitted between then and
April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Of 100,000 claims examined, about 15 percent had been rejected,
and more than half of those denials were illegal, Insurance
Commissioner spokesman Jim Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance reimbursement practices have been drawing increasing
fire from consumers, physicians and state officials. Two weeks ago
at an Insurance Commissioner's hearing in Spokane, a doctor told of
a patient who died after being admitted to a hospital with a heart
problem. The claim was rejected a few days later because the
patient was ``not sick enough to be in the hospital,'' Stevenson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fine, the QualMed settlement changes the
insurer's contract so that the carrier no longer has sole
discretion on whether to pay for emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The new language provides patients and their physicians with
more say in the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, QualMed said: ``It is important to note that at
all times, QualMed Washington members had, and continue to have,
full access to emergency room care. The issue in question was
administrative and dealt with how claims were processed by QualMed
Washington _ after emergency care was provided.'' QualMed has more
than 132,500 subscribers and is the fifth-largest insurer in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Regence BlueShield, Premera Blue Cross and Aetna U.S. HealthCare
all said Thursday they believed they were in compliance with the
law governing payment for emergency care but were cooperating with
Senn's office to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Senn said she hoped the other three carriers will follow
QualMed's lead and settle their own cases in favor of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a settlement that truly serves the state's insurance
consumers because it underscores consumer protections that already
exist in state law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Regence BlueShield said its own internal review
of 90,000 emergency room claims for a four-month period in 1998
showed that less than 14 percent were denied. Of those denials,
about half were denied because they were duplicate claims or
because coverage was not in effect at the time of the service.
</P>
<P>
   Another .01 percent were denied for not having referral
information. An even smaller number _ .001 percent _ were denied
because the member's condition was deemed not something a prudent
person would consider a medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to emphasize that the number of emergency
room claims that are ultimately denied by Regence BlueShield is
very small,'' the company said in a statement. ``Our members should
not be concerned about whether their emergency room claims will be
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Premera Blue Cross also defended its claims record.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 90 percent are approved the first time they are
submitted, and of those that are denied, many more are paid once
more information is provided,'' said Premera spokeswoman Clara Webb
Kinner.

MABIKA A LONG WAY FROM HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When she was around 12 years old growing up
in Kinshasa, Congo, formerly Zaire, she swept the dusty basketball
court at the nearby outdoor stadium just to get a chance to dribble
the ball. That was her reward, but it was worth it for the
youngster who later dreamed of playing with the big girls.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika didn't have to wait too long. She not only got her
chance to play with the big girls, but overshadow them to become
the youngest member on the national team at 14 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   She has gotten used to being the youngest player on many teams,
but her extraordinary athletic ability, raw talents and unlimited
potential always kept her a notch above the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My home was close to the basketball court,'' Mabika said.
``That was like my favorite, to go play basketball. I was always
watching the girls play. I wasn't on a team, but I know basketball.
One day a coach on that team told me that `You have to come play.
You have to come play on the team, You know how to play.' I said,
`No. I don't want to play.' After a year I decided to go (play).''
</P>
<P>
   She jumped from the third to the first team on the city team
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't always that easy for Mabika. She had to shed some
tears and convince the older players that she wasn't a pest hanging
around the basketball court. Sometimes the big girls didn't give
Mabika the ball to bounce around and she would run home crying.
When it happened too often, her mother turned a wooden box into a
makeshift basketball rim and hung it by the window and rolled
together some cloth to act as a basketball. At home, Mabika was
free to shoot at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to shoot the ball and learned how to be a winner,''
said Mabika, who played professionally in the African Championship
League and was the most valuable player when she was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't change much. Now arguably the most
athletically-gifted player in the WNBA, Mabika has the free will to
shoot the ball at her new home with the Los Angeles Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, she was the league's youngest player when she won a spot
on the team through tryouts in 1997. The year before she was in
Atlanta competing in the Olympics. Her national team finished last,
but she remembers fondly scoring 20 points against the U.S. squad
while being guard by Houston's Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a shooter and a scorer,'' said Lisa Leslie, the Sparks
center and USA national team member. ``Even then you could tell she
was very raw. She didn't necessarily have an understanding of the
game, but she could shoot and I think that's something she'll tell
you today, she loves to shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the 5-foot-11 forward-guard heard the rumors
about the soon-to-be WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of her team were reluctant to return home where a
civil war was engaged. But Mabika went home with the hopes of
returning to the United States to play in the WNBA. Thanks to
fellow countryman and Atlanta Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo, who she
met while playing on the national team when she was 16, she
eventually received her visa after being turned down once.
</P>
<P>
   She was intimidated when she arrived at the Sparks tryout to see
300 players vying for the couple of spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' said Mabika, who will return to her country
after the season for the Olympic trials. ``There was like 300
people - all these tall girls. I didn't have any muscles when I got
here. I was like, `God, they're going to kill me.' But I just
stayed confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie can attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the tryouts, she outhustled people for rebounds by jumping
over them and shooting and scoring, taking off from the free throw
line. I think what's amazing is she is really starting to learn the
game. In three years, you could see her improvement,'' Leslie said.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika, whose English is also improving, earned a starting role
at the small forward five games into last season, but this year she
has played mostly shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I put her in a situation where she has a lot of
freedom on the court,'' Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge said. ``She
understands that as long as she rebounds, plays good defense,
distributes the basketball, offensively she has the freedom to do
whatever she wants and she flourishes under that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabika leads the team is assists (3.3), is second in scoring
(11.3 points) behind Leslie, and third in rebounds (4.8). She'll
never forget the off-center shot she took to tie the score and send
the game into overtime against New York. She was so high in the
air, only she knew that the ball would fall in. The Sparks
eventually won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika's mother, Lunkeba Tezo Helene, doesn't miss any of them
now. She received a visa and reunited with her daughter last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to see her play,'' she said. ``She's playing a
good season. Now she is so happy because I am here. She doesn't
have to cook. I cook for her, I clean her clothes for her. I do
everything for her and she's very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are 19-11 and in need of one victory to gain
home-court advantage in the single-elimination game against
Sacramento next Tuesday.

RICHARD W. JENNINGS, A TITAN OF SECURITIES LAW, DIES AT 91
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard W. Jennings, who helped popularize the study of
securities law in U.S. law schools and helped export concepts of
market regulation to the postwar societies of Japan and Germany,
died at his home in Piedmont, Calif., on Aug. 9 after a brief
illness. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, he was a professor emeritus of Boalt Hall, the law
school at the University of California at Berkeley. He received his
law degree there in 1939, joined the faculty in 1947 and continued
to teach there well after his retirement in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the students who studied directly with Jennings over the
years, countless others encountered his passion for securities law
by using the pioneering casebook that he wrote with Harold Marsh
Jr., who taught at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A casebook is a collection of statutes, state and federal court
decisions and administrative and regulatory rules, the essential
elements of any study of a particular field of law. His securities
law casebook _ officially called ``Securities Regulation: Cases and
Materials'' but known to students simply as ``Jennings and Marsh''
_ was first published in 1961 and is now in its eighth edition.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling field of securities law had been brought into
focus a decade earlier, in 1951, by the publication of the first
securities law textbook, by Louis Loss, a professor at Harvard. But
it was the Jennings and Marsh casebook that allowed securities law
to become a standard element of legal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most influential casebooks of all time,''
said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of Law
in St. Louis. ``After four decades, it remains the leading casebook
in the field.'' Seligman wrote the recent editions of the study
guide along with John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wormington Jennings was born on Oct. 19, 1907, the son
of a banker in Bois D'Arc, Mo. A 1927 graduate of Park College in
Parkville, Mo., he briefly taught high school algebra before
beginning graduate studies in political science at the University
of Pennsylvania. But by 1937, his imagination had been caught by
the marked changes in business law that were ushered in with the
New Deal and he enrolled at the Berkeley law school in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   After a period of private practice and government service during
World War II, he joined the law school faculty. He and his longtime
co-author, Marsh, were described by friends and colleagues as ``The
Odd Couple.'' In contrast to Marsh's tough, blunt-spoken demeanor,
Jennings was ``sweetness and light,'' said Richard Buxbaum, a law
professor at Berkeley. As each wrote half of the casebook, ``the
personality of the early editions was utterly schizophrenic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' influence on securities regulation extended well
beyond the classroom. In the early 1960s, William L. Cary, the
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President
John F. Kennedy, recruited him as a consultant to the commission's
first full-scale investigation of the securities markets in 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Through his work on the study and his testimony at various
congressional hearings, he contributed to the public debate that
led in 1975 to the elimination of fixed brokerage commissions on
Wall Street. That change led to the collapse of many venerable
securities firms and radically altered the competitive forces in
the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time, from the 1950s through the 1970s, when there
were three people who towered over the field of securities law,''
Seligman said. ``They were Louis Loss, Bill Cary and Dick
Jennings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was invited in 1961 to serve as a Fulbright professor
at Tokyo University and helped introduce modern securities
regulation theory to the Japanese academic community. He was also a
mentor, along with Loss, to an influential group of young law
professors in Germany in the mid-1950s who helped add securities
regulation to the academic agenda there as Germany developed into
an economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was as a mentor to young lawyers that he is most
fondly remembered among his students, said Lawrence Sonsini, a
partner in Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,
who was his research assistant in the mid-1960's and later took
over some of Jennings' classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one who encouraged me to develop a securities law
practice at the firm when this was just beginning to be called
Silicon Valley,'' Sonsini said. ``He had a vision of what it could
be.'' The firm, with 570 lawyers, is now a legal powerhouse in the
high-technology economy of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, formal and gracious, was one of the last law
professors at Berkeley to abandon jacket and tie for ``business
casual.'' But other trappings of legal power did not impress him.
``We shared the same office for 13 years _ books, a steel desk,
some pictures _ and I don't think it had changed since he first
moved in,'' Sonsini said.
</P>
<P>
   On campus, he is best known beyond the law school for his
service as chairman of the faculty senate at the height of the Free
Speech Movement in the mid-1960s, a cultural collision between
campus liberals and the conservative establishment in Sacramento
that developed against the backdrop of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Herma Hill Kay, dean of the law school, said that his patient
but authoritative leadership of a sharply divided faculty was a
calming influence during those turbulent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, law school alumni expressed their affection for
Jennings and two of his colleagues _ Stefan A. Riesenfeld, who died
earlier this year, and Adrian A. Kragen _ by raising an endowment
for three faculty positions to be named in their honor.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is survived by his wife of 64 years, Elizabeth Robison
Jennings, of Piedmont; two daughters, Susan J. Stangeland and M.
Anne Jennings, both of Berkeley; a son, W. Thomas Jennings of
Sacramento; four grandchildren, and a great-grandson.

HANOCH LEVIN, 56, LEADING ISRAELI PLAYWRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Hanoch Levin, Israel's leading playwright, who spent
more than three decades trying to strip the nation of
self-congratulatory armor and force it to examine what he
considered its hypocrisy and self-delusion, died on Wednesday of
bone cancer. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Although his first plays caused enormous controversy when they
were performed in the 1960s and '70s, Levin's death was greeted
here with profound dismay at the highest cultural and political
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak called him ``one of the greatest
playwrights that Israel has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The education minister, Yossi Sarid, said he ``showed us what we
really looked like when we were still saying, `Surely, that can't
be us.''' He added, ``Levin saved us because without him we
wouldn't have known that the social and political ulcer was about
to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin came to prominence in 1968 with his play, ``You, Me and
the Next War,'' staged in a tiny club in south Tel Aviv. It was a
fierce critique of the euphoria that swept the country after its
victory in the 1967 Six-Day War when Israel captured East
Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula
and found itself the military ruler of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   For many Israelis, the play was the first clear statement that
the occupation would bring dire consequences. Those who agreed with
Levin felt that his point was borne out by the 1973 Yom Kippur War
as well as by the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   His next play, however, created an even bigger storm. Staged in
1970 and called ``The Queen of the Bathtub,'' it made merciless fun
of Prime Minister Golda Meir and her ministers as well as the war
of attrition in which they were engaged against Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Staged at Tel Aviv's Cameri Theater, the play engendered nightly
protest demonstrations. The government threatened to withdraw the
Cameri's state subsidy. The theater's management closed the play
after 18 performances. Levin was so upset by the developments that
he withdrew from the public and never gave another interview.
</P>
<P>
   He did not stop writing, however. In 1982 his satirical revue,
``The Patriot,'' was banned by Israel's Film and Theater Censorship
Board as harmful ``to the basic values of the nation, the state and
Judaism.'' The ban was defied in Tel Aviv and the revue, which
dealt bitingly with such issues as the occupation of the West Bank
and Israeli-Arab relations, was a smash hit.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Levin wrote 50 plays, although not all of them were
produced. Of the 34 that were, he directed many himself and was
throughout his life the most esteemed playwright in the Hebrew
language.
</P>
<P>
   A reclusive celebrity at home, he was far less well known
abroad. But he did win an award at the Edinburgh Festival and
several of his plays were translated and performed in London,
Berlin and New York.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has hardly been a theater season without
a new Levin play on one of Israel's main stages.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 work, ``Murder,'' examined the Palestinian-Israeli
violence that was sparked by Israel's 1996 opening of an
archeological tunnel near Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem. The play
blamed all sides equally for the violence and won Levin top honors
in the Israel Theater Prize awards.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Palestine in 1943 to parents who immigrated from Poland,
Levin is survived by a wife and four sons from his three marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Levin kept working until the very end, holding auditions for his
newest play, ``Whiners,'' from his hospital bed in Tel Aviv. The
play deals with terminally ill patients in a hospital ward.

PANEL FINDS HUGE FLAWS IN HOW SEATTLE POLICE INVESTIGATES ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL AND KIMBERLY A.C.WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An independent panel found major flaws in the way
Seattle police investigate themselves, recommending that a civilian
run a new office to pursue allegations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In a 37-page report issued Thursday by the panel after three
months of study of the Seattle Police Department, its members
offered a blueprint on implementing the most rudimentary police
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The document called for Police Chief Norm Stamper to declare
that lying, cheating and stealing will no longer be tolerated in a
department wracked by waning public confidence. And to win back the
public's trust, the department should clean up shoddy
record-keeping on misconduct investigation cases, respond better to
misconduct complaints and allow for face-to-face interviews of
accused police officers during inquiries _ a practice currently not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member panel stopped short of suggesting a full-fledged
citizen watchdog committee, citing a lack of ``systemic''
corruption in the department. Though it chided Stamper for
delegating ``too much of his responsibility'' on investigations, it
did not recommend firing the beleaguered chief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, panel members called for a hybrid option that blends a
civilian director overseeing existing police staff to run the
department's new Office of Public Accountability (OPA). Stamper
would hire the civilian investigations director, who in turn could
hire another civilian or police officer as second in command over
the eight-member investigations unit and auditors office.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson Collins, author of a recent book on police
accountability and senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, called
the recommended OPA an ``unusual set-up'' that is somewhat ``better
than absolute inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of another U.S. city that has tried to introduce
civilians over police in an advisory role,'' she said. ``Two things
are key to making it work: First, who will be made director of the
OPA and second, whether they'll blow the whistle on any discovered
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The OPA would act as an umbrella over the Internal
Investigations Section, the police office under fire for failing to
properly investigate misconduct allegations and for allegedly
erecting the ``Wall of Silence'' to protect fellow police officers.
</P>
<P>
   For the recommendations to go into effect, Police Department
leadership, union representatives and the Seattle City Council
would have to sign off on it. Ongoing collective bargaining
negotiations could soon touch on a little-known policy in the
department unearthed in the report that allows officers accused of
misconduct the right to not be interviewed face-to-face during
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, appointed by Mayor Paul Schell and chaired by retired
King County Superior Court Judge Charles V. Johnson, took 90 days
to craft the report, released amid troubled times for Stamper. He
has overseen the 1,260-member force since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The report described an investigations process that lacked
consistency: ``No single person in the department makes the key
decisions regarding discipline. Employees describe cases in which
seemingly arbitrary decisions have been made regarding whether to
initiate an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the report recommended adding more training on
ethics and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant reform,'' said panel member Jenny Durkan, a
Seattle attorney and former executive counsel to the governor.
``It's learning from other people's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file officers and community members concurred, but
reaction to the report varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, these problems in the department may not be as bad as
problems in New Orleans or Albuquerque, but I would have expected
tougher recommendations as far as the leadership of the department
goes,'' said a West Precinct patrol officer who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
offered a different perspective. ``I haven't seen the actual report
but from what I've heard, it ought to put some of the (recent) bad
talking about the Seattle Police Department to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriett Walden, a longtime activist for police accountability,
said the panel's recommendations to restore integrity and personal
responsibility to the Police Department were ``a step in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unhappy _ or I won't be if we can get these
recommended actions implemented,'' she said after the news
conference in the mayor's office at which the panel officially
released the document to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The panel outlined 23 major recommendations on oversight,
leadership training and rules, but failed to add a layer of
oversight to watch over the chief, said Councilwoman Tina
Podlodowski, chairwoman of the council's public safety committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a deep disappointment. That's one thing the council has
been screaming about,'' Podlodowski said. ``I'm hoping we can be a
little tougher than this group. The council has to address who is
watching the chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the panel's proposal, Stamper would remain accountable
only to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The chief was charged with underplaying misconduct cases after
revelations this year that at least eight officers, including an
internal-investigations sergeant, failed to report allegations that
a police detective stole $10,000 from the home of a city resident
who was killed in a shootout with police in October 1996. The money
was returned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper called the panel's suggestions ``bold and insightful,''
but declined to comment on endorsing specific remedies outlined in
the document. Likewise, Schell also would not bless any of the
specific reform proposals, other than to say ``one complaint is one
too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper acknowledged that it will be a challenge to weave the
proposed reforms into the ongoing contract talks, but said that he
will try to hammer the measures into the labor pact.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations have several hurdles, including gaining
approvals from the city council and the Police Officers Guild. The
panel outlined a dozen suggested policies the police union would
have to approve in this year's contract negotiations, talks that
already have snagged on reform ideas Stamper has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Current policies that trouble the panel were complaint
procedures that hamper effective misconduct investigations,
including a rule that calls for misconduct investigation files to
be destroyed three or four years after an inquiry is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The panel reserved its harshest language for these procedures,
tartly noting that Seattle's is perhaps the only law enforcement
agency in the nation that does not conduct in-person interviews of
employees that come before its internal investigations department.
Instead, the agency must submit written interview questions in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This current policy affords Seattle Police Department
employees more rights than those granted to citizens,'' the report
says. ``In essence, current policy obliges the Department to
conduct most investigations of misconduct by correspondence.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, head of the panel, was dismayed by that policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not find any other police department that does
that,'' Johnson said. ``In fact, we asked the lawyer for the union,
and he was unable to name any other place that does it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the King County Sheriff's Office conducts internal
affairs interviews in person, said sheriff's spokesman John
Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle policy has been in place only a few years, said
panel member Durkan, but already ``an erosion of management
function has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the police guild has shown a willingness to
discuss the issue at the bargaining table, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. J.D. Miller, guild vice-president and a former IIS
investigator, who said he hadn't read the report closely,
nevertheless questioned whether the practice had been accurately
portrayed in the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear accurate,'' Miller said, adding ``I would
disagree with the statement that we have additional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The city council will discuss the report Aug. 30.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SEVILLE, Spain _ For the largest portion of a career that spanned
nearly two decades, Merlene Ottey was the Silver Queen, an identity
that was equal parts homage to her many accomplishments and
reminder of the frustration from so many second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The margin between the ultimate joy and the ultimate
disappointment is so small,'' she once said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps getting larger because of her advancing years, which
might go some way toward explaining why the 39-year-old Jamaican
star withdrew from competition on the eve of the World Track and
Field Championships when it was confirmed she had tested positive
for an anabolic steroid at a meet six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, of course, released a statement expressing shock and
surprise, but the results from a second sample soon will be in
house, and if, as expected, it too is positive, then we will find
out if her imagination is as fast as her feet in offering an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   When tests caught U.S. sprinter Dennis Mitchell in the chemical
web of an abnormally high testosterone level, he made the argument
before the appeals board of the U.S. federation that it was the
result of excessive drinking and sex with his wife. Maybe the first
time monogamy has been held up as too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   But what sounds like fodder for endless one-liners is no
laughing matter to the International Amateur Athletic Federation,
the sport's ruling body, as another drug scandal threatens to
overshadow the events in the World Championships, second only to
the Olympic Games in terms of prestige.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old story. A tired story. But a story line that track
and field has been unable to shake for more than a decade and now
shows fresh legs entering the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of talking about Marion Jones' quest for four gold
medals here and at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, instead of talking
about Maurice Greene's setting a world record in the 100 meters,
instead of talking about the continuing feats of the amazing
Michael Johnson, all conversations are coming back to what's new
and cooking in the lab these days.
</P>
<P>
   For it is not only a case of Ottey and Mitchell in the cross
hairs. World high-jump champion Javier Sotomayor of Cuba was
suspended following a positive test for cocaine at the Pan American
Games. Former British Olympic champ Linford Christie and teammate
Doug Walker have been suspended for showing evidence of nandrolone,
the anabolic steroid found in Ottey.
</P>
<P>
   Ato Boldon, the defending world champ in the 200 who is sitting
out the meet because of a leg injury, recently claimed his sport is
at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Monaco, and in 24 hours, I see Dennis Mitchell get
banned, Linford Christie gets busted, Sotomayor gets busted and
you've got Ben Johnson wandering around the hotel lobby,'' Boldon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Johnson is, of course, the poster boy for steroid
abuse, having been stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters at
the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. He was banned for life after a second
positive test in 1993 but has been hanging around the fringes,
hoping to get back on the track until the IAAF rejected him
permanently this week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is gone, but his legacy lives on in a new generation of
athletes who are willing to break all of the old rules.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought says the recent rash of positive tests
could be the result of athletes unwittingly taking strength
supplements that contain banned substances. Others question the
tests themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, over the past couple of weeks, having
so many sudden cases, I'm not 100 percent sure I'm confident in the
testing procedure,'' Jones said. ``To say yes, I'd be lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ottey will come up with a perfectly reasonable or highly
implausible explanation for her test results. Perhaps she'll get a
Johnny Cochrane sound-alike to make her case in court: ``If the
urine sample isn't fit, then you must acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, where there's smoke, there's fire. Remember,
until the incomparable Carl Lewis came along and stretched out an
amazing career over four sets of Olympics (1984-1996), the sprints
were always a young man's (or woman's) game. Virtually no one
competed into their 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the big money that's at stake, you have Ottey, 39,
Christie, 39, and Mitchell, 33, all pushing at the limits, maybe
willing to do anything to get a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new story, an old story and one from which track and
field cannot seem to run.

FOR MARTINEZ: STORM BEFORE THE CALM 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You can call him Pedro or you can call him Lata de
Aceite (Oil Can) or you can call him Cohete (Rocket).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the top pitcher in baseball today, already one of the
best in Boston lore, righthander Pedro Martinez is suddenly
behaving like a mercurial millionaire ballplayer _ the latest in a
chorus line of Red Sox hurlers who pitched fits.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after he was banished to the bullpen for showing up
late at Fenway, Martinez (17-4, 2.52 ERA) returned to the mound
against Oakland Thursday &UR;  &LR; night and lost a 6-2 decision in which he
gave up three runs, fanned 11, and walked none in seven strong
innings.
</P>
<P>
   But he made most of his noise and news in the clubhouse before
the game when he unleashed an unprovoked tirade on his Godfather
General Manager, Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is (Sox manager Jimy Williams) going to apologize?'' Martinez
shouted to a silent Duquette. ``Is he going to shake my hand?''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Pedro was a different man. It was as if the Sox
had drilled a tranquilizer dart into his tiny butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just talking (with Duquette),'' he insisted. ``I'm just
a loud talker . . . My fans are fine. I'm fine with my teammates.
I'm fine with Jimy.''
</P>
<P>
   Weird. Very weird.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Saturday's bizarre spectacle, when the manager
publicly spanked his star pitcher, there had been great
apprehension about Pedro's start Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. There were silly
rumors that the habitually tardy Pedro might motor into Fenway
aboard the SS Nauticus accompanied by Peter Blute and Brandi
Chastain. Instead, Martinez arrived in a white Mercedes more than
two hours before game time, well within team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed that some cameras and reporters (``a couple of clowns,''
according to Pedro) recorded his arrival and were perhaps
suspicious that the usually invisible Duquette was ``checking up''
on him, Martinez unloaded on the GM in the near-empty locker room
while most of his teammates were out on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, Pedro was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it go,'' he told reporters. ``I didn't commit a crime or
anything like that. Let's go back to work. Jimy is not going to get
fired. I'm not going to get released or traded. It's time to let it
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it was Pedro who kept the story alive all week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his calm, measured postgame demeanor, there's evidence
of a growing split between Pedro and Sox management. First of all,
Martinez makes little effort to mind the wishes of pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan. Then there's residual bitterness over not being
allowed to pitch the fourth game of the playoffs last October (the
Sox were eliminated by Cleveland in four games and Pedro pitched
only once). More recently, the pitcher and the manager have
disagreed over the playing of music in the Sox clubhouse (Pedro
wants it, Jimy doesn't).
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Martinez told reporters, ``I'm ready to go home. Get
this season over with and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the tirade.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez backed away from his pregame anger and claimed he was
misrepresented by nosy reporters. His exchange with Duquette was
not for the benefit of reporters, but could not be ignored by
anyone within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in the clubhouse, you're not allowed to
say,'' claimed Pedro. ``The clubhouse is my house. If you sneak
into my house and I don't know you, I will shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox lore is littered with tales of disgruntled Boston hurlers.
Roger Clemens was famous for misbehavior. If he wasn't dissing his
manager by not showing up in Florida, he was complaining about
carrying his own bags. And who can forget Dennis ``Oil Can'' Boyd,
the Sox' wild child of the 1980s? The Can saw demons even where
there were none, and was admitted to the hospital for psychiatric
testing after he quit the team and threatened to kill a teammate
when he was not selected for the 1986 All-Star team. The inimitable
Vicente Romo once disappeared for a few days in Chicago in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to bizarro moments by Sox hurlers, none can
top the stunt pulled by Gene Conley in 1962. The 6-foot-8-inch
righthander got lit up on the Yankee Stadium mound, then got lit up
again with the help of 19 beers (``I counted the empties myself,''
said Dick Radatz) in the clubhouse. When the team bus got stuck in
rush-hour traffic on the way to the airport, Conley got off, saying
he was going to use a saloon restroom. He was not seen again for
two days. Conley wound up buying a plane ticket to Jerusalem but
could not leave without a passport. When he returned to Boston and
got called on the carpet by Tom Yawkey, the Sox owner offered him a
drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``No thank you, sir, I don't drink,'' replied Conley.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have Pedro, who was late for a start, blasted the GM
before his next start, then smiled and took all the blame after
pitching well in a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't commit a crime or anything like that,'' reasoned
Pedro. ``It was my mistake. I apologized to my teammates. I
apologized to Jimy. I never want to go through something like this.
But those reporters sneaking around today, those clowns, they make
it look like I'm a delinquent that committed a crime. That's why I
got a little upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro should know better. Clowns or no clowns, this is not
Montreal. This is Boston. Baseball matters. A $75 million ace
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Lata de Aceite. Or Cohete.

MARTINEZ'S TEAMMATES HAVE CATCHING UP TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ REACTION-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You could tell by the way Darren Lewis opened his eyes
wide that he knew nothing. John Valentin leaned in to learn what
had happened. Bret Saberhagen admitted from the start he would not
be much help. Even Ramon Martinez did not provide any special
insight.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox clubhouse was virtually empty prior to Thursday
night's game when Pedro Martinez voiced his displeasure about media
members lurking outside the players' parking lot. No teammates
witnessed his loud complaints in the clubhouse presence of general
manager Dan Duquette. They did not hear the ace was looking for an
apology from manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And the news traveled slowly before and after the game. A
contest with wild-card implications, a flight to Texas, and all the
luggage loading required for a road trip kept many of the players
ill-informed. While Pedro downplayed the significance of his
pregame outburst before a group of reporters five rows deep, his
teammates believed the large gathering was simply interested in
Martinez's first start since a controversial scratch for tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going on,'' said Valentin. ``I'm sorry.
I wish I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also pleaded ignorance and said, ``I was on the field
so how would I know what happened? I've talked to Dan. I don't have
any problem with Pedro. Everything's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen smiled his Cheshire cat grin as he offered no
comment. After learning more details _ particularly that the
display involved Duquette _ the injured pitcher saw an opportunity
to inject a little humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over and done with,'' said Saberhagen. ``I know nothing
(about the new developments). Are (Martinez and Duquette) still
friends? Now maybe if there were fists involved, I would have heard
about it. If there weren't fists, I guess they must still be
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, it sounded as if the general manager and the
team's highest-paid player were of the same mind on the matter.
Pedro requested that reporters drop it and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough. I would echo that,'' said Duquette as he
exited the ballpark. ``It's August and we're in a pennant race.
It's time to play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming schedule and playoff push seemed to be the only
concerns of Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too many things to worry about,'' he said. ``We have
to play every day. Sometimes we're back there watching video or in
the batting cage. We're not just sitting around.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who grew up with Pedro and continues to advise him would
not have handled the situation the same way. However, Ramon
Martinez feels for his younger brother. Ramon's years in Los
Angeles schooled him about the persistency of big-market reporters.
He understands the difficulty his brother has dropping all the
issues stemming from his late arrival last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole thing kind of got bigger than it was,''
said the elder Martinez. ``He was upset a little bit because he saw
the press hiding a little bit. I don't think that's fair. He
handled it his own way. All I can do is talk to him so it doesn't
bother him. It has to get over with.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pedro looks to end the scrutiny, his teammates have a
plane ride to catch up on the news.

RED SOX FIZZLE IN FINALE WITH A'S

<P>
   BOSTON _ When Pedro Martinez wakes up this morning, it will all
seem like a bad dream. Imagine, an 11-strikeout game and yet a loss
added to his impressive record. It doesn't seem right.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the reality of a 6-2 Red Sox setback to the Oakland
Athletics Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The scales were tipped in the sixth inning, when Oakland
shortstop Miguel Tejada hit a solo home run into the left-field
screen, breaking a 2-2 tie. Martinez left after seven innings, and
the Red Sox could not mount a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martinez had ``lost it'' a couple of hours earlier.
Frustrated over events involving his being scratched from his
previous start, Martinez went off in the Red Sox clubhouse in such
a manner that reporters were asked to leave. Martinez directed his
remarks at general manager Dan Duquette for several minutes. But
the harshest comments were aimed at manager Jimy Williams, who was
busy with pregame batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez arrived at 4:05 p.m., exactly two hours before he was
to make his 22d start.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and Williams apparently did not talk before the game.
And after the game neither wanted to admit there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he is too much of a professional to let any
dispute affect his performance. ``I'm always ready,'' said the ace
righthander, who issued a blanket denial of all that was said
Thursday afternoon. ``Whenever I get a chance to go out there, I'm
ready. I do my work and 30 minutes before a game all I need to do
is warm up my arm. I wasn't angry. I respect (the media). There is
no need for any slipping around and doing crazy things. I will
answer questions. You guys are making such big deal of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams: ``Everybody's feelings are important out there.
They're important to me. I don't worry about distractions. I
thought we played pretty good. We just got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez took the mound Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, he was sharp. He
had the full support of the sellout crowd of 33,393. Martinez was
their hero, and everything he did was magic. He struck out four of
the first five batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't last for long, as Oakland scored single runs in
the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings. The Sox got two runs in the
fifth off rookie Tim Hudson (8-1), but that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi singled and scored the first Oakland run in the
fourth. In the fifth, A.J. Hinch led off with a single and moved to
third on a sacrifice bunt and a ground out. From there he scored on
a double by Giambi, giving the Athletics a 2-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro pitched outstanding,'' said Williams. ``He walked nobody
and had 11 strikeouts. We'd probably let him go a little more, but
he's not that far removed from the disabled list and that shoulder
injury. He was around 115 pitches (actually 114). The Hudson kid
pitched good. Tejada hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics found a way to hurt the Red Sox in the eighth
inning, too. With Rheal Cormier pitching, Giambi and Matt Stairs
singled to lead off the inning. After newcomer Bryce Florie
relieved Cormier, Giambi and Stairs advanced on a wild pitch and
scored on a single off the wall by pinch hitter John Jaha for a 5-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had two baserunners with no outs in the ninth but failed
to score.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Oakland earned a split of the four-game series
and moved within one game of Boston in the American League
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he was pleased with his performance but not the
result. ``I feel I had everything I needed,'' he said. ``They were
a little bit better than I was, and (Hudson) did a better job. They
battled their heart out. Hope to get them the next time. That team
is better than anybody thinks.''

AGE, DECLINING MEMBERSHIP BRING THE DEMISE OF SEATTLE ENGINEERS'
CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Seattle club whose members built some of the
region's most lasting public-works projects has gone the way of the
slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   Over roasted chicken and potatoes and afternoon chitchat, the
Seattle Engineers Club met for its final lunch Thursday after 87
years of providing professional support to members, many of whom
helped build and shape this region.
</P>
<P>
   The group is calling it quits, blaming dwindling membership on
changing times and a failure to attract ``young blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of bittersweet,'' said Adrian Arnold, a former club
president who joined in the 1960s and whose father also held the
post. ``We've become outdated as an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the Seattle Engineers Club was the professional
group to join.
</P>
<P>
   Members worked on some of the region's largest public-works
projects _ bridges, tunnels and engineering feats _ which continue
to shape the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Club engineers helped design and construct the Alaskan Way
Viaduct, Seattle's downtown bus tunnel, the West Seattle bridges,
Shilshole's breakwater and the electrification of city bus lines.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``people involved in building this city,'' said Joyce
Lem, club president and a bridge engineer with HDR Engineering in
Bellevue. At 42, she may be one of the club's youngest members.
</P>
<P>
   In ``the good ol' days,'' club lunch programs once drew
heavyweights including chief engineers from the city, county, Port
of Seattle and railroads. At its height, the club buzzed with more
than 300 members who met daily for lunches in the Arctic Building
at Third Avenue and Cherry Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a prominent place to network,'' said Arnold, vice
president of Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs, civil and structural
engineering consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The club was established in 1912 to promote fellowship among
local engineers. From 1925 to 1968, the club was on the ninth floor
of the Arctic Building, where a kitchen, dining room and library
played host to engineers who came to unwind during long lunch
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the membership grew older and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The once-thriving institution has since dwindled to about 60
members, half of whom are retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing,'' said Lem, the club's first female
president. ``At the same time, it's difficult to keep something
like this going.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, said 91-year-old John Loux, club treasurer
and one of the club's oldest members. ``Young people aren't too
interested in clubs,'' Loux said. There's no longer an emphasis on
``sitting around and talking about ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   A final farewell bash celebrating the club's history will be
scheduled in late September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found we were swimming up a stream,'' said club manager Dan
Lyons during lunch at Rock Salt Steak House, formerly Latitude 47,
where the club has held luncheons since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He said the club knocked on the doors of the city's engineering
companies to recruit new members. The companies were receptive, but
younger engineers weren't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young engineers tend to be too busy now to come for a lunch,
even when their employers pay,'' said Lyons, 76, a retired
electrical engineer who joined the club in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons proudly rattles off the engineering achievements of his
fellow members.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gordon Snyder, a retired naval architect who was
instrumental in the design of Alaskan and Washington state ferries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's Gerald Van Faasen, a retired district engineer for the
Army Corps of Engineers who helped build the breakwater at
Shilshole Bay and worked on the large Fort Peck Dam in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   There's Roy Morse, a prominent city engineer who oversaw
important developments in Seattle's history. He joined the club in
1950.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, 18 members and guests reminisced and ate lunch during
a 2{-hour program.
</P>
<P>
   The guest speaker was Thom Mullins of Sparling Inc., the
electrical engineers hired to work on the Experience Music Project
at the Seattle Center. His topic was the future of technology.

MARTINEZ GIVES DUQUETTE AN EARFUL 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ At 4:05 p.m., all seemed well inside the Red Sox
clubhouse. Pedro Martinez leisurely strolled by a group of
reporters, went straight to his locker, and began to prepare for
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's start against the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   One minute later, all hell broke loose, triggered by the arrival
of Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who took the brunt of a
Martinez tirade that centered around manager Jimy Williams and his
decision to scratch Martinez from last Saturday's start against
Seattle. And Martinez was saddled with the loss in
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's 6-2 setback to Oakland. He's had better days.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was angry at not only Williams but also the media horde
that was waiting to see if he arrived within two hours of game
time, a team rule. Martinez took particular offense to the
newspaper and television cameras that awaited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to come over?'' said Martinez in a voice loud
enough to be heard by the reporters. ``Is (Williams) going to
apologize? Is he going to shake my hand?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people following me around. I don't like the
cameras. I'm tired of these clowns following me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had more to say, but reporters were asked to leave the
clubhouse by Kevin Shea, the team's director of communications and
baseball information, who declared, ``This is a private
conversation, and the locker room is now closed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Martinez defended the sanctity of the clubhouse
and said those who would report private statements made there were
``clowns'' and not reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in this clubhouse,'' said Martinez, ``(the
media is) not allowed to say anything. You should be more
professional and stop sticking your nose where you don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had arrived at the players' parking lot at 3:50 p.m. He
stayed in his vehicle for 10-12 minutes, then entered the clubhouse
exactly two hours before the 6:05 game time. Martinez had been
greeted inside the park by 10-15 reporters, all checking their
watches to see if he would be late a second straight time. He
wasn't. After discovering Williams was not in the clubhouse,
Martinez aimed his wrath at Duquette. At that point, the media were
asked to leave. But not before some spicy remarks were heard.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Martinez did what he said he wouldn't: carry the
story beyond the clubhouse. He repeated his apology to his
teammates and Williams. He acknowleged that he'd been late last
Saturday. His regret wasn't that he had been punished but that news
of what had happened had gone beyond the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was over after the game. Now some of the reporters are
trying to make a big deal out of it, and I don't see why,''
Martinez said. ``Jimy is not going to get fired. I'm not going to
get released. And I won't be traded. You guys need to let go.
Honestly, let go. Let me handle Jimy. Let me handle my clubhouse.
It was a great game out there today. Don't start digging into my
life with Jimy and my team in the clubhouse. The clubhouse is my
house and I don't know you, I will shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problems with Pedro,'' insisted Williams.
``He's an important part of our team. I think he showed that
tonight. Unfortunately, we didn't get a win. We just couldn't score
enough runs. If you go by the way he pitched, I don't know if he
can get much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he did not go to the clubhouse to act as a
peacemaker. ``Don't even go there,'' he said. ``If you're trying to
position me between the player and the manager, you're wrong. I'm
not between the two. Did I resolve anything? I don't have any
issues to resolve with (Martinez). As far as we're concerned, the
item last week is resolved. That's gone by. The rest of it is
difficult for me to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's said in the clubhouse should stay in the clubhouse,''
Williams said. ``You might not agree, but that's the way I feel.''

   BROOKLYN-BLACK-CULTURE (New York) _ In villages across Africa,
storytelling has long been an integral part of daily life. At
nights, even to this day, people gather in circles in courtyards
illuminated by a full moon and bright stars to hear gripping tales
from wise men and indelible stories from adventurous young men who
have returned to their hamlets from faraway places. This and other
African traditions are being kept alive in Fort Greene, Brooklyn,
which for years has been a mecca for black life but which within
the last three years has experienced an extraordinary burst of
cultural energy. The 135-year-old Brooklyn Academy of Music, which

were finally on our way, driving through the Green Mountains. We
turned onto the long, winding gravel road that marks the beginning
of the estate, at the southern end of Champlain, seven miles
outside Burlington. But as we left behind Route 7, with its
dispiriting artificial lights, fast-food outlets and strip malls,
we found the countryside illuminated by a full moon: the lake on
one side; pastures, woodlands and huge barns on the other. In the
distance, rising above a grassy hill, just as I remembered it, was
the rambling, Queen Anne-style, stone and red-brick building, with
its turrets, towers and 13 chimneys. Inside the curved and
diamond-shaped windows, the lights glowed. Nate reacted on cue:
``Wow.'' By Sara Rimer.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has run into a distracting and
potentially dangerous patch in his presidential campaign. The issue
is whether he ever used cocaine or other illegal substances during
his youth. Bush has been dancing around the question for several
days, creating the impression that he probably did experiment with
cocaine and that he believes evasion rather than an honest answer
is the best response.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton years have left Americans understandably ambivalent
about prying into the private lives of politicians. The country is
weary of Clinton's inability to control his behavior, and sorry for
the lost time it cost the president and the nation. But the Clinton
experience has also made clear that questions of character and
personal conduct can severely distort a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That is the environment that greets Bush and the new crop of
presidential candidates. While there is no clear-cut rule about how
much personal information they need to provide, more information is
almost invariably better than less. That is because efforts to
limit information usually just raise more questions, not only among
reporters but among voters. Evasion also diminishes those who
practice it. Sensitized by Clinton's 1992 campaign circumlocutions
on personal matters, Americans now fear such dodging may be a
signal of deeper flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Given this history and climate, Bush would be wise to quit
tiptoeing around the issue of drug use, and to stop complaining
that he is being unfairly questioned by the press. His statements
have become progressively more untenable. At first he refused to
respond or gave cryptic answers. Wednesday evening he told The
Dallas Morning News that he could satisfy the federal security
clearance requirement of not having used illegal drugs for the last
seven years. On Thursday he said he could pass a White House
background check under rules going back to 1989, when his father
became president. His spokesman later explained that this meant he
had not used illegal drugs since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush never used illegal drugs, he should say so. If he did,
he should 'fess up. For one thing, he might find that voters would
forgive a youthful indiscretion. Many members of his generation
experimented with illegal drugs when they were young. That ought
not to disqualify people from holding high office, provided they
gave up the habit. But Bush may need to square his own drug use as
a young man with the tough law enforcement policies he espouses as
governor for dealing with youthful drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot have it both ways on his personal life. He
voluntarily proclaimed his marital fidelity, which is surely the
most private of subjects. That only adds to the impression that he
is hiding something about other aspects of his life. The best
course for him is to be honest, and to let the country take his
measure. In his campaign, the governor has emphasized the
importance of assuming responsibility for one's own actions. He
should be thinking now about how to set a good example.

EDITORIAL: THE CASE OF WEN HO LEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Troubling accusations have been made, and denied, in recent days
that Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American citizen who is suspected of
leaking nuclear secrets to China, was singled out for investigation
and punishment because of his Chinese ethnicity. If those claims
are true, it would be a repellent act of discrimination by federal
government agencies. But based on the information now publicly
available, it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion
about whether or not Lee was unfairly treated.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone involved in this complicated espionage
investigation has some motive to twist the facts. What is needed
now is a careful review of the Lee case, carried out under the
leadership of a credible, independent figure who understands the
intelligence, national security and law enforcement considerations
bearing on this kind of investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee first came under suspicion in 1996 in an investigation of a
possible Chinese theft of nuclear weapons designs from the Los
Alamos National Laboratory. He drew the attention of investigators
because he was a computer scientist in the laboratory's weapons
design section who had traveled to China and had contacts with
Chinese scientists. Although scores of other Los Alamos employees
had also traveled to China, Lee soon became the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He was dismissed for security breaches in March of this year.
After his departure, investigators found that he had transferred
masses of secret bomb test and design data from the laboratory's
classified computers to less secure machines.
</P>
<P>
   Lee now contends that there was nothing wrong or unusual about
his transfer of computer data or his meetings with Chinese
scientists and that he was singled out because he is a
Chinese-American. A similar charge that the investigation was
ethnically biased was made this week by Robert S. Vrooman, the
former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, whose motives
have been questioned because he himself faces possible departmental
discipline over security failures at the lab. Chinese-American
groups also question Lee's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If those assertions turn out to be correct, Lee would be owed an
apology and the restoration of his reputation. The truth can best
be established by re-examining all aspects of the handling of the
Lee case by the Energy and Justice Departments. The review should
include a look at how the original list of suspects was assembled
and narrowed down to Lee, the significance of the computer data Lee
downloaded to unclassified machines and the nature of his contacts
with Chinese scientists. It is especially important to evaluate
whether or not Lee's conduct in these areas differed significantly
from that of other Los Alamos scientists who did not emerge as
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The review should be headed by a knowledgeable, authoritative
figure like former Senator Sam Nunn or Gen. Colin Powell. Whoever
is chosen, Lee is entitled to an independent look at this
politically and ethnically charged case.

EDITORIAL: QUESTIONABLE MERGERS IN ALUMINUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The sudden consolidation in the worldwide aluminum industry
raises troubling antitrust issues that must be addressed by
regulators in both Europe and North America before the mergers are
allowed to proceed. At a minimum, some divestitures are likely to
be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Alcoa-Reynolds deal comes on the heels of an agreement by
Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and Alusuisse Lonza
Group of Switzerland to combine into one company, APA, that would
have replaced Alcoa as the world's largest aluminum company. A
merger with Reynolds would vault Alcoa back into the top spot. The
two giant companies would then control 28 percent of worldwide
aluminum production, and nearly 75 percent of the North American
market. Both mega-mergers require careful scrutiny, and may need to
be blocked. There is a risk that European regulators might be
persuaded that the APA deal is needed to offset Alcoa, while Alcoa
tells the Justice Department that it must grow to confront APA.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum prices have been very depressed, in part because of
weak demand overseas and in part because Russia, a major producer,
increased exports to raise needed hard currency. The companies
contend that huge mergers will produce efficiencies that will
enable them to cut costs and operate more effectively in a
low-price environment. But some financial analysts think the
combined companies will be in a better position to raise prices
more than would otherwise be possible. It is that prospect that the
antitrust regulators should examine.

BRONFMAN DECLARES UNIVERSAL TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Seagram Co., which saw its Universal Pictures
bleed red ink for the past two years, proclaimed Thursday it has
solved the problems at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   The bold assertion from Seagram chief Edgar Bronfman Jr. was
delivered as part of the conglomerate's quarterly earnings report,
showing a $206 million operating loss from movies for its fiscal
year ended June 30. Bronfman, who began shaking up the executive
suite last year, noted that Universal is on a hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our film business is in the process of a turnaround,''
declared Bronfman in a statement. ``We have a new management team
in place. The recent releases, including `The Mummy,' `Notting
Hill,' `American Pie' and `Bowfinger,' have been very successful
and are early signs of a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal endured a hitless string of 20 movies between mid-1997
and late last year due to bad timing and questionable choices while
most rival studios posted improving results. Last November, film
studio chief Casey Silver and Universal Studios head Frank Biondi
departed after the release of a pair of high-priced flops, ``Meet
Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bronfman, the recent successes are sweet redemption
following years of brutal criticism on Wall Street over his 1995
decision to buy Universal Studios to launch the transformation of
Seagram from a liquor giant to an entertainment conglomerate. He
also said Thursday the studio has a ``strong slate'' of films for
the current fiscal year ending in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source forecasting service said ``Man
on the Moon,'' starring Jim Carrey as the late Andy Kaufman, may be
a holiday season hit, and ``Viva Rock Vegas,'' a ``Flintstones''
sequel, could perform well next summer. Other coming releases
include ``For Love of the Game'' with Kevin Costner, ``The Story of
Us'' with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer, ``End of Days'' with
Arnold Schwarzenegger and ``Erin Brockovich'' with Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones agreed Universal appears
to be on the right track but remained cautious, citing the highly
volatile nature of the film business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Seagram can turn its businesses around,'' she said.
``Do the current hits at Universal mean its difficulties are over?
That's hard to say because all studios go through good and bad
streaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's report included an $87 million operating loss in the
fourth quarter ended June 30 for the film division, but those
results were not a surprise since they reflected shortfalls from
``EdTV'' and ``Meet Joe Black.'' Bronfman reiterated his projection
that Universal will need several more quarters to move out of the
red. Bannister noted Seagram will not see much profit from its
recent successful films until the titles go into home video.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman also indicated Universal would continue to pursue
cofinancing and third-party funding for projects. ``We are seeking
to enhance returns by taking capital out of the business,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners said the
strategy makes sense for a major studio because it has more chances
at potential hits. ``The statement could also open the door to be
even more aggressive about laying off the upfront risk,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss in the film business, Seagram Co. posted a
smaller quarterly loss than expected due to strong results from
music, theme parks and alcoholic beverages. Excluding one-time
factors, Seagram lost $129 million, or 32 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $12 million in the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Seagram to post a loss of 42 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram shares gained 7 percent Thursday, rising $3.50 to
$53.625. The stock is up 40 percent this year, mainly due to
investors' increased confidence in Bronfman's strategy of making
Seagram the world's largest music company by buying PolyGram for
$10 billion.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Three major Japanese banks Friday announced an alliance
that will create the world's largest financial institution, with
$1.3 trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, confirmed through the Tokyo Stock Exchange that they
had come to an agreement on alliance plans that are to be put into
place over the next two years, sending their stocks shooting upward
in morning trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aspire to be a powerful player in the global market,'' said
the president of the Industrial Bank, Masao Nishimura.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the banks, which together have
41,000 employees in 772 branches in Japan and abroad, said they
expected to reduce their combined number of branches by 150 within
five years after forming a joint holding company and to reduce the
number of employees by about 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest step taken by individual Japanese banks to
overcome the effects of the nation's protracted recession, which
has left the banking industry hobbled by bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may face obstacles, however. The Fair Trade Commission
will examine the plan to check for possible violations of the
Anti-Monopoly Law, according to Friday's Nihon Keizai. The
commission declined comment on whether it had been consulted by the
three banks in advance about their collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sent the banks' stock prices shooting higher in
morning trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, adding to already
impressive gains from Thursday, when Japan's leading business
daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, first reported that the banks were
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Bank of Japan shares, which closed at $8.80 on
Thursday, traded at $9.70 Friday morning. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
shares rose to $9 from $8.15; Fuji Bank shares were at $9.30, up
from $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance may help the three banks adapt to the deregulation
of the financial markets here, which is creating new competition in
the banking and securities industries. The banks said they would
consolidate overseas branches ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup dominated newspapers, radio and television. Many
commentators said such mergers were an international trend and drew
comparisons to the huge merger of Citigroup and Travelers Group
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of basic shakeup is inevitable given the situation
of the financial industry,'' said an editorial in Friday's Nihon
Keizai.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting widely held opinion, the newspaper said there were
simply too many banks in Japan, with 17, counting just the top
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer magnitude of the three-way merger raises many
questions. Their combined assets surpass the $899 billion in assets
of Deutsche Bank (with Bankers Trust).
</P>
<P>
   It also surpasses what would have become the world's biggest
bank if Banque Nationale de Paris had succeeded in acquiring
Paribas and Societe Generale. The assets in that three-way deal
would have totaled around $1 trillion. Banque Nationale won
shareholder approval only from Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there will probably only be more consolidations in
an industry that remains bloated and inefficient. Many banks are
still struggling under the weight of hundreds of billions of
dollars in loans that soured when the Japanese real estate market
collapsed in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And though interest rates here have fallen to record lows, which
should stimulate more lending and help bank profits, the balance
sheets of many institutions remain weak.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks are among 15 that were beneficiaries of an
enormous government-financed rescue package in March. Although they
are all saddled with large bad debts, the banks concentrate in
different businesses that could complement each other, were they to
merge into one huge force.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Bank of Japan, for example, is the only domestic
bank that still specializes in long-term loans to Japanese
companies. Its two competitors, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
and Nippon Credit Bank, were seized by the government after they
became insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Bank could regain its presence in the securities business
through IBJ Securities, a subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of
Japan that is one of the most profitable securities operations in
the country. Fuji lost its securities business link nearly two
years ago when an affiliate, Yamaichi Securities, collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo, one of Japan's biggest lenders, will benefit by
gaining the customers of the two others.
</P>
<P>
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun's report Thursday, quoting unidentified
banking officials, said the three institutions would divide their
operations in retail, corporate and investment banking, hoping to
realize large economies of scale.

<P>
   TOKYO _ Three major Japanese banks Friday announced an alliance
that will create the world's largest financial institution, with
$1.3 trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, confirmed through the Tokyo Stock Exchange that they
had come to an agreement on alliance plans that are to be put into
place over the next two years, sending their stocks shooting upward
in morning trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aspire to be a powerful player in the global market,'' said
the president of the Industrial Bank, Masao Nishimura.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the banks, which together have
41,000 employees in 772 branches in Japan and abroad, said they
expected to reduce their combined number of branches by 150 within
five years after forming a joint holding company and to reduce the
number of employees by about 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest step taken by individual Japanese banks to
overcome the effects of the nation's protracted recession, which
has left the banking industry hobbled by bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may face obstacles, however. The Fair Trade Commission
will examine the plan to check for possible violations of the
Anti-Monopoly Law, according to Friday's Nihon Keizai. The
commission declined comment on whether it had been consulted by the
three banks in advance about their collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sent the banks' stock prices shooting higher in
morning trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, adding to already
impressive gains from Thursday, when Japan's leading business
daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, first reported that the banks were
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Bank of Japan shares, which closed at $8.80 on
Thursday, traded at $9.70 Friday morning. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
shares rose to $9 from $8.15; Fuji Bank shares were at $9.30, up
from $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance may help the three banks adapt to the deregulation
of the financial markets here, which is creating new competition in
the banking and securities industries. The banks said they would
consolidate overseas branches ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup dominated newspapers, radio and television. Many
commentators said such mergers were an international trend and drew
comparisons to the huge merger of Citigroup and Travelers Group
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of basic shakeup is inevitable given the situation
of the financial industry,'' said an editorial in Friday's Nihon
Keizai.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting widely held opinion, the newspaper said there were
simply too many banks in Japan, with 17, counting just the top
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer magnitude of the three-way merger raises many
questions. Their combined assets surpass the $899 billion in assets

SHINING LIGHT ON PRESEASON'S MANY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The NFL preseason is a time of many questions.
But here at your P-I searchlight of truth, we get to the answers,
as provided by Thursday night's earthshaker between the Seahawks
and San Francisco 49ers (Richter scale reading: 0.0).
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did ESPN call this a ``preseason special''?
</P>
<P>
   A. For the same reason your favorite greasy spoon calls
2-day-old meatloaf the house special. It's not good, but it is
plentiful and fills a hole. Besides, most people will buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the deal with 49ers GM Bill Walsh hiring the felonious
Lawrence Phillips? Didn't Walsh a few years back trash the
University of Washington football fans for hiring ``mercenaries''?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, you fans of hypocrisy never forget. When he was Stanford
coach in 1993, Walsh told a booster group that the Huskies were
``mercenaries'' who spend their time in ``an athletic department
compound'' and return to society with ``none of the skills you are
supposed to gain in college''; remarks for which he apologized
after being reprimanded by the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   His plunge from the moral high ground establishes that a guy
even as noble and principled as Walsh is entitled to change his
mind. As Wally Walker is apt to respond these days: Yeah, but he's
our thug now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did Phillips do Thursday night?
</P>
<P>
   A. He was stuffed for a yard loss on his first carry, then had a
short pass bounce off his shoulder pads. He finished with six yards
on three rushes, 12 yards on three catches and, at press time, zero
arrests. That should wipe the slate clean, no?
</P>
<P>
   Q. How come right tackle Howard Ballard didn't play?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ballard's arthritic joint is so bad that doctors are
replacing the old wood beams with steel, exchanging the old ropes
for bridge cable and strapping the whole thing with concertina
wire. He'll be fine tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of the missing, where was Joey Galloway?
</P>
<P>
   A. Joey Stayaway was reportedly home in Columbus, still waiting
for financial anointment as World's Greatest Receiver Who Hasn't
Done Anything. Expect Stayaway to sign with the Seahawks as soon as
the team is no longer in Cheney, which he hates. Once signed, you
can also expect him stay away from contact.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was there any improvement in the Seahawk quarterbacking?
</P>
<P>
   A. Until a 32-yard catch-and-run with Sean Dawkins early in the
second quarter, starter Jon Kitna appeared to be on a post-surgery
regimen of soft toss, only he never had surgery. He threw sideways,
even backwards, rarely downfield. But in the second quarter, he
completed all three pass attempts that made for a 75-yard touchdown
drive, Kitna's first of the preseason. Coach Mike Holmgren was
believed to have fallen to his knees, sobbing with joy.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren did a little more weeping when rookie backup Brock
Huard took over with the second unit in the second half, but the
tears had a different flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Huard's first pass was intercepted. A fourth-quarter drive was
killed by another pick. Then came the backbreaker, a misread by
Huard that resulted in a pass returned 35 yards for a touchdown by
a former Husky teammate, defensive end David Richie, that became
the difference in San Francisco's 24-23 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a linebacker blitz on and dropped a defensive lineman
into the zone I was throwing to,'' Huard said of the Richie pick.
``I just didn't see him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you learn,'' said Holmgren, who was taking the
defeat much more stoically than six days ago. ``Right now, both
quarterbacks are not only having to play the 49ers, they have to
learn a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard hustled back valiantly from the precipice, taking the
Seahawks 81 yards in the final 1:42 for a touchdown. But his
two-point conversion pass to Michael Black, alone as a Republican
in Berkeley, sailed wide right for no particular reason.
</P>
<P>
   For now, too much Husky, too little Seahawk.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What else was noteworthy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Seahawk free safety Jay Bellamy made a lunging sideline
interception of a pass late in the second quarter; moments later,
Seahawk center Kevin Glover made a great block on a blitz that
saved Kitna and completed a 21-yard pass play; in the third
quarter, a flock of five pelicans flew in tight formation over the
stadium; and field goal kicker Todd Peterson hit an upright from 40
yards in 3Com Park's swirling gales, a feat rated slightly more
difficult locally than hitting a bee with a BB at a quarter mile.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was that noise following back-to-back special teams
screwups that resulted in 14 San Francisco points in less than a
minute of the fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
   A. Former special teams coach Dave Arnold, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the biggest difference between the old regime of
Dennis Erickson and the new one?
</P>
<P>
   A. The players no longer think they know more than the coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Seahawks are 0-2 in the preseason with one touchdown
scored by the first-unit offense. Is this what the franchise calls
Now Time?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not quite. Right now, this is No Time, as in no time for fans
to care much about pro football results.

 MCCAIN GETS BOOST FROM BUSH'S TROUBLES  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., found himself the object of some new interest
Thursday _ in part because of the current troubles of front-runner
George W. Bush, now being dogged by questions about whether he used
cocaine in the past.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was met by a standing ovation in a speech before 800
Commonwealth Club of California members at the Hyatt Regency Hotel
in San Francisco, where he unveiled to the tech-savvy audience a
proposal to boost the number of visas for skilled foreign high-tech
workers.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on a radio talk show and also addressed The
Chronicle's editorial board.
</P>
<P>
   But in a campaign day which keenly illustrated the ripple
effects of the Bush controversy, McCain was repeatedly pressed at
each appearance about the Texas governor's handling of questions
about possible past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters Thursday that he could have passed drug
tests when his father, George Bush, became president in 1989.
Later, his campaign expanded on that statement, effectively ruling
out Bush's use of illegal drugs since 1974, when he was 28.
</P>
<P>
   That left other presidential hopefuls like McCain, campaigning a
coast away, fielding questions ranging from whether the commander
in chief should be held to the same standards as his subordinates
(yes), to whether Bush should answer the question (it depends).
</P>
<P>
   The growing discussion of Bush's past was reflected in the views
of some voters who came to hear McCain, citing the controversy as a
factor in their changing views of the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Republican loyalist Virginia Stafford of Moraga said she
traveled to hear McCain's Commonwealth Club speech Thursday in part
because ``Bush's demeanor is beginning to bug me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his handling of the drug question, ``he seems short-tempered,
and I don't think he's going to handle the tough problems with
what's required,'' she said. ``I think McCain's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trying too hard to be Mr. Personality,'' said Joan
Herron of Pacific Heights, who also came to hear the Arizona
senator. ``I want to hear the issues debated. ... It irritates me
that (Bush is) being carried in by way of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the national discussion about Bush revved up, some
political insiders in rival camps were all but licking their chops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years, 15 years, 25 years,'' said one GOP strategist.
``I guess the stuff really does affect your memory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot continue to take the Fifth (Amendment) and get away
with it,'' said Democratic Party campaign adviser Bob Mulholland.
``He's probably trying to remember what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain admitted being ``very uncomfortable'' with
the continual questioning of Bush. ``The media and the American
people have the right to make a judgment about him ... (but) the
governor is entitled to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done things in my life I'm not proud of. ... I'm a
believer in redemption, and my life has been less than exemplary in
many respects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responsible for the breakup of my first marriage ... but I
don't want to go into the details,'' he told KGO's Ronn Owens.
</P>
<P>
   But asked at The Chronicle editorial board meeting if the
cocaine question was a fair one for a presidential candidate,
McCain, 63, said he had never used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But ``in my case, (it) was a no-brainer. I grew up in the
military. I was in prison when most of this stuff was going on,''
said McCain, referring to the 51/2 years he spent as a prisoner of
war in North Vietnam. ``So it's almost unfair. ... I was never
tempted. In all candor, if everybody around me were using cocaine,
I hope to God I wouldn't have used it ... but I wasn't subject to
that temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said, ``The American people and the media will
somehow sort this whole thing out _ what is private, what is
public, and what determines the qualifications of the president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more honest than Bush,'' Anne Smith of San Francisco said
of McCain. Smith cited the way Bush is ``handling these drug
questions'' as a main concern, saying Republican leaders ``made a
hell of a fuss'' about Clinton's appearance of evasiveness on
personal troubles. Now Bush ``is doing the same thing,'' she said.

 A WHOLE LOT MORE BALL THAN PARK  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to No-Park Park, new home of your San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants open next season in their cool new ballpark in China
Basin, and lack of parking has become the major concern.
</P>
<P>
   OK,  &UR; one  &LR; of the major concerns. Starting pitching and Barry
Bonds' state of mind are other ongoing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Solution? Of course I have a solution to the parking problem.
Two.
</P>
<P>
   One, take a couple aircraft carriers out of mothballs, dock 'em
next to the ballpark, load 'em with cars.
</P>
<P>
   Portable parking lots! In keeping with the ballpark's
dock-o'-the-Bay motif and ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Two, turn the players' parking lot over to the fans. Where will
the players park? At home.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could make a huge breakthrough in public relations
and promote fan-player bonding by asking _ requiring _ the players
to take public transit to work.
</P>
<P>
   In New York back in mid-century, Yankees and Dodgers commonly
rode the subway to work. When Bob Welch pitched for the Oakland A's
and lived in the Marina, he frequently rode BART to the ballpark
and says nobody bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Bussin' with Barry.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS SCHOOLS aren't teaching evolution anymore, and Peter
William Brown thinks maybe that decision is justified because
evolution hasn't occurred in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's all part of a plan to simplify education. In
biology, for instance, Kansas will eliminate weeks of study of
human reproduction, replacing that section in textbooks with a
full-page cartoon of a stork.
</P>
<P>
   PROHIBITION is a hit at Moose's restaurant in North Beach.
That's cell-phone prohibition; booze is still served,
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   On each table is a stand-up card with a cartoon of a moose
making a cell call, with the universal don't-do-this slash.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Moose's clientele consists entirely of Himalayan wise
men, English poets and mimes.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, Ed Moose says his diners are taking the cards for
use at work and home.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told Ed she put the card on her bedside table, a
subtle message to her cell-addicted companion.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a cute idea, but maybe what this woman needs is
mating-call-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   STEALTH BUS? A guy I know was driving on Market, found himself
behind a brand-new Muni electric bus. A sign in the rear window
said, ``Experimental bus, not in service.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus' trolley pole was lowered, unconnected to the overhead
power-supply cable, yet the bus was purring along.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be ... a bus powered by some kind of cosmic energy?
</P>
<P>
   I'M NO EXPERT on farmworker transportation, though I play one on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed new law to make seat belts mandatory in vans
hauling farmworkers might not be the real solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   What about reports that the vans are old and rickety,
overcrowded even by sardine-industry standards and sometimes driven
by unqualified drivers who sell beer to the thirsty riders?
</P>
<P>
   Until those problems are addressed, all seat belts will do is
prevent dead people from leaving the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   HOT RUMOR in Marin County is that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston
are home-shopping in Ross, which is already an official suburb of
Hollywood. The rumor is they're eyeing the ``Jack'' house, a
magnificent Victorian used in the filming of the Robin Williams
movie ``Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, they'd better close the deal soon. Property values are
skyrocketing, and Brad and Jen could find themselves priced out of
the market by the bonanza kings of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   MUNI YANG: A rider reports that a 22 Fillmore bus arrived one
minute earlier than indicated on the new NextBus info screen. New
Muni technology that works!
</P>
<P>
   And, an off-duty Muni driver, in uniform, driving a pickup, was
involved in a collision when a red light was run. And it wasn't the
Muni driver's fault!
</P>
<P>
   MUNI YIN: Kurt Rossetti was riding a 1-California bus when a
cockroach appeared on the shoulder of the female rider in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   When informed of the situation, the woman did a few frantic
pirouettes, then got off at the next stop. Nobody called after her,
``Hey lady, you forgot your cockroach.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO MORE IDEAS for the Giants:
</P>
<P>
   1. Instead of a dreary organist or canned music, invite a
different local musician or musical group to perform at every game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ladies and gentlemen, now playing ``Take Me Out to the &LR; 
 &UR; Ballgame,'' Carlos Santana. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2. Give out 100 free tickets every game to fans who show up
outside with the best costumes, gimmicks or enthusiasm. Call it the
``Let's Make a Deal'' rooting section.
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT DICTIONARY: ``caboosed'' _ Stuck behind a heavy smoker
on a crowded sidewalk or escalator.

   It was going to have roughly the effect of a neutron bomb attack
on Main Streets and shopping malls. The buildings would be left
standing but the people would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the superior efficiency of selling things via the
Internet that brick-and-mortar stores would be unable to compete on
price, choice or even service.
</P>
<P>
   Book and music sellers had already been ``Amazoned.'' Soon
Web-based ``category-killers,'' in everything from toys to pet
supplies, would overwhelm their physical-world competitors.
Shoppers would never be more than a mouse-click from the best
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers, terrified of cannibalizing sales and
destroying the value of their expensive properties, were already
too late to meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some categories,'' said Mary Meeker, a seer of the Internet
at Morgan Stanley, ``it's already game over.''
</P>
<P>
   These are convenient beliefs for anyone justifying some
e-commerce share prices, but they are already mostly wrong. The
reasons should surprise no one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not a dominant technology but rather a network
of people. It is a rich and highly flexible means of communicating
that is rapidly achieving pervasiveness because more and more
people find it easy and convenient to use. But it is those people's
preferences that will count; and for most people, shopping is more
than just a means to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Internet provided a perfectly efficient way to shop
it would not provide a satisfactory alternative to the physical
enjoyment of sniffing a ripe melon, say, or trying on a cashmere
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some products, such as music and banking, can be
distributed electronically with success and cost savings. But most
purchases cannot be reduced to digital code. And distributing
physical goods is cumbersome and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Behind even the most exciting user-interface there are
old-fashioned warehouses and trucks; customers who decline to sit
at home waiting for purchases to arrive; and goods that must be
rewrapped and expensively returned.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the cost of getting goods to customers' homes so
often soaks up the notional price advantages of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   What Internet shoppers have quickly realized is that the Web is
an addition to, and not a substitute for, their shopping habits. It
is wonderful for gathering up-to-date information about products
and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue, a research firm, estimates that in 1998 23
million Americans sought information online, but then made their
purchases offline, compared with only 17.7 million who did the
whole thing online.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more bullish forecasters doubt whether online retailing
in America _ the country at the furthest e-frontier _ will amount
to much over 6 percent of the total by 2003. What happens after
that will depend mainly, not on the new specialists of the online
world but on the traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most big retailers had seemed reluctant to
experiment much with e-commerce. Apart from the risk of
cannibalization, they were put off by the sheer complexity of
integrating their in-house information technology with the demands
of selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But now firms such as Macy's, Wal-Mart and CVS drugstores are
linking their offline operations into a new and forceful presence
on the web. By blending the best of both offline and online worlds,
they can reflect the desire of consumers to shop pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
   They can use their physical stores both to advertise their
websites and to support old-fashioned shopping: why not order
online at work and then pick up your purchases on the way home? Or,
if an online purchase is not what you wanted, just swap it at the
shop you pass every day.
</P>
<P>
   With established brands, legions of loyal customers, physical
presence and real-world profits, traditional retailers who embrace
the Web wholeheartedly _ and have flexibility and technological
competence _ will be unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   And what, then, for the electronic pioneers? If they are wise,
they will use their inflated share prices to buy up some bricks and
mortar. Their chances of surviving against the might of the mall
will be improved if they are there too. &QL;

enjoyment of sniffing a ripe melon, say, or trying on a cashmere
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some products, such as music and banking, can be
distributed electronically with success and cost savings. But most
purchases cannot be reduced to digital code. And distributing
physical goods is cumbersome and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Behind even the most exciting user-interface there are
old-fashioned warehouses and trucks; customers who decline to sit
at home waiting for purchases to arrive; and goods that must be
rewrapped and expensively returned.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that the cost of getting goods to customers' homes so
often soaks up the notional price advantages of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   What Internet shoppers have quickly realized is that the Web is
an addition to, and not a substitute for, their shopping habits. It
is wonderful for gathering up-to-date information about products
and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue, a research firm, estimates that in 1998 23
million Americans sought information online, but then made their
purchases offline, compared with only 17.7 million who did the
whole thing online.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more bullish forecasters doubt whether online retailing
in America _ the country at the furthest e-frontier _ will amount
to much over 6 percent of the total by 2003. What happens after
that will depend mainly, not on the new specialists of the online
world but on the traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most big retailers had seemed reluctant to
experiment much with e-commerce. Apart from the risk of
cannibalization, they were put off by the sheer complexity of
integrating their in-house information technology with the demands
of selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But now firms such as Macy's, Wal-Mart and CVS drugstores are
linking their offline operations into a new and forceful presence
on the web. By blending the best of both offline and online worlds,
they can reflect the desire of consumers to shop pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
   They can use their physical stores both to advertise their
websites and to support old-fashioned shopping: why not order
online at work and then pick up your purchases on the way home? Or,
if an online purchase is not what you wanted, just swap it at the
shop you pass every day.
</P>
<P>
   With established brands, legions of loyal customers, physical
presence and real-world profits, traditional retailers who embrace
the Web wholeheartedly _ and have flexibility and technological
competence _ will be unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   And what, then, for the electronic pioneers? If they are wise,
they will use their inflated share prices to buy up some bricks and
mortar. Their chances of surviving against the might of the mall
will be improved if they are there too. &QL;

   It was going to have roughly the effect of a neutron bomb attack
on Main Streets and shopping malls. The buildings would be left
standing but the people would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the superior efficiency of selling things via the
Internet that brick-and-mortar stores would be unable to compete on
price, choice or even service.
</P>
<P>
   Book and music sellers had already been ``Amazoned.'' Soon
Web-based ``category-killers,'' in everything from toys to pet
supplies, would overwhelm their physical-world competitors.
Shoppers would never be more than a mouse-click from the best
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers, terrified of cannibalizing sales and
destroying the value of their expensive properties, were already
too late to meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some categories,'' said Mary Meeker, a seer of the Internet
at Morgan Stanley, ``it's already game over.''
</P>
<P>
   These are convenient beliefs for anyone justifying some
e-commerce share prices, but they are already mostly wrong. The
reasons should surprise no one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not a dominant technology but rather a network
of people. It is a rich and highly flexible means of communicating
that is rapidly achieving pervasiveness because more and more
people find it easy and convenient to use. But it is those people's
preferences that will count; and for most people, shopping is more
than just a means to an end.

<P>
   As a good story, it is hard to beat. Give the Almighty five
days, and He completes the heavens and the earth and assorted
beasts and creeping things. One more day, a scoop of dust and a
puff of divine breath and hey presto! there is Adam.
</P>
<P>
   The poetic language of the first few chapters of the Book of
Genesis has kept painters busy for centuries. As an account of the
beginnings of life, it is certainly easier reading than Charles
Darwin's ``Origin of Species,'' the book that laid the foundations
of evolutionary biology in 1859.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is no wonder that, in the United States, some
people are so moved by the Genesis account that they refuse to
believe any other explanation of the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they say, no eyewitness observed humanity emerge from
primeval slime or evolve from apes, while at least God was there to
record His own acts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, creationists have managed to undermine the teaching of
evolution in schools in Alabama, New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest triumph has been to persuade the State Board of
Education in Kansas to make teaching evolution an optional extra to
the standard science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In future, Kansas schoolchildren will neither have to learn, nor
be tested on, the origin of species through natural selection, or
the idea that the universe began with a cosmological big bang.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your religious beliefs, there are several oddities
here. One is that, whereas in 1859 Darwin's book stirred up outrage
among churches and churchgoers, nowadays his views are no longer
seen as inextricably alien to the Bible and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   They can be a basis for atheism, for sure, and often are; but
they can also be seen, by the many believers who take the Bible's
words as impressionistic rather than the literal truth, as merely a
depiction of the way divine creation has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Another, though, is a more American oddity. There is no more
Darwinian society than the United States, no society that operates
so clearly according to selection by experimentation and the
constant elimination of mistakes. And yet many Americans still
believe that Darwin was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In America companies rise and fall with the certainty of
species. Predators weed out the weak; new mutations launch
successful IPOs; organisms grow more nimble as they evolve to fit
their particular niche.
</P>
<P>
   For the individual, little in the way of a social safety net
stands between success and social extinction. Indeed, America's
economic success over the entirety of the 140 years since 1859 is
surely explained by the fact that, while the United States embraces
a Darwinian approach to economic life, competitors in Europe are
keener on Darwin as a work of scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   That is the real, natural America, for which children need to be
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Darwinism is even the basis for the agriculture on which Kansas
depends: the biological revolution that began with Darwin's work
has provided the basis for much of modern farming (America is the
world's biggest agricultural producer); and now for new industries
based on biotechnology and genetics (in which America also leads).
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another Kansas tradition, that of ``The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' As they were wandering down the yellow
brick road, Dorothy asked the scarecrow to tell her a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been so short,'' he replied, ``that I really know
nothing whatever. I was only made the day before yesterday. What
happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought that he had no brain and no knowledge. But then he,
Dorothy and their pals triumphed over the wicked witch.
</P>
<P>
   Survival of the fittest, again. Or pure luck. Darwin's theories
could accommodate both. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is one person who stands above America's
fledgling presidential campaign, it is Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Most presidential hopefuls heap respectful praise on the head of
America's central bank and, from Al Gore to Elizabeth Dole, have
recommended that he should be reappointed when his term as Federal
Reserve chairman formally ends next May.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Washington, Greenspan is credited with an
unsurpassed understanding of America's economy, as he has steered
monetary policy to achieve rapid growth, low employment and low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, his acumen will be more necessary than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, there are reasons aplenty to fear inflationary
pressure. A batch of recent economic statistics hinted that tight
labor markets are at last pushing up wage costs.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets tumbled in early August after the employment
cost index, a quarterly measure of overall labor costs, leapt 1.1
percent between April and June, compared with 0.4 percent in the
first quarter. In the year to July, hourly earnings rose by 3.8
percent, up from a low of 3.5 percent in the year to May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were convinced that these numbers provided enough
evidence of an overheating economy to guarantee another
quarter-point rise in interest rates, or maybe more, when the
Federal Reserve next meets on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, inflation itself has not yet picked up.
Statistics released in the past week show that the major inflation
gauges _ the producer and consumer price indices _ are still
extremely well behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices for finished goods rose a mere 0.2 percent in
July (compared with 1.5 percent a year ago), and consumer prices
only 0.3 percent (2.1 percent a year ago).
</P>
<P>
   This news calmed the financial markets. Although the consensus
on Wall Street is still that the Fed is likely to raise rates next
week, some economists suggest that this is no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is a mistake to take either the labor-market figures
or the inflation statistics too literally. Wage pressures are
building up slightly, but this is after months of very modest wage
gains.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the April-June rise in the employment cost
index was a payback for an extraordinarily small rise in the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that the labor market is tighter than ever,
and on an unsustainable track.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 new jobs were created in July, much more than
most analysts had expected and three times more than the growth of
the labor force could normally sustain. The number of unemployment
claims is at its lowest in this economic cycle, and virtually every
Federal Reserve district has noted widespread labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the benign inflation numbers should not be taken
at face value. First, the central bank has to worry about future
inflation threats when it decides whether or not to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since it takes several months for the full effects of changing
interest rates to be felt in the economy, it can be dangerous to
wait until there is actual evidence of accelerating prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even today's figures show a worrying price pressure
behind the benign headlines. Oil prices have risen sharply, and
commodity prices in general are firmer.
</P>
<P>
   As the economies of Europe and Asia show signs of more vigor,
the dollar has been sliding, especially against the yen. On Aug. 18
it passed Yen112, its lowest since January.
</P>
<P>
   Higher commodity prices and a weaker dollar have removed an
important source of imported disinflation for America, and firms'
input costs are now rising.
</P>
<P>
   The producer-price index for core intermediate goods _ those
goods such as paperboard and plywood that firms use as part of the
production process _ has risen at a 4 percent annual rate over the
past three months, the biggest rise in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no certainty that firms will pass on higher
input prices as higher goods prices (if firms raise their
productivity they can absorb the extra cost). But, as Bruce Kasman
of J.P. Morgan points out, every stage of Federal Reserve
tightening over the past two decades has been accompanied by an
acceleration of core intermediate producer prices.
</P>
<P>
   How much the Federal Reserve must raise interest rates depends
on how far the economy can be trusted to slow by itself. At first
sight, it seems to be doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Recent retail-sales figures suggest that consumer spending may
be slowing. According to economists at Goldman Sachs, consumer
spending, after adjusting for inflation, is likely to rise by 3.6
percent at an annual rate between July and September, certainly
much less than the 6.7 percent real rise in the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But history suggests caution. America's economy in recent years
has continually surprised analysts with its strength. And the next
few months could be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending is still strong by historical standards. The
housing market, an important engine of demand (because people have
realized capital gains as they sold their houses, received cash as
they refinanced their mortgages and boosted construction demand by
building new houses), is still extraordinarily vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sharply higher mortgage rates, housing starts rose by
5.7 percent in June, though the rate of mortgage refinancing has
slowed sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The replenishing of firms' inventories could provide another
short-term boost to growth. Currently, inventories are low. Between
April and June firms added only $19.4 billion to their inventories
compared with $38.7 billion in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect a sharp rebound during the next few months,
and as companies prepare for the uncertainties of the millennium
bug they may well add to their stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a strengthened demand for exports as economies in
Europe and Asia accelerate, and it is hard to see much chance of
the economy slowing down. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Two important _ and related _ uncertainties could cloud this
picture. One is the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street shrugs off higher interest rates entirely, as it
did in June, an orderly slowdown will be harder to achieve.
Conversely, a big correction in the stock market could precipitate
an uncomfortably sharp slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The other unknown is how foreigners will behave. America's trade
deficit rose to a record $24.6 billion in June, and the country is
heading for a current-account deficit of 4 percent of GDP this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As the economies of Europe and Asia perk up, foreign investors
who are financing this sizeable deficit may demand substantially
higher interest rates to do so. The recent slide in the dollar and
the strengthening in bond yields could be but the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign sentiment turns sharply, America's much-needed
economic slowdown could occur more suddenly than anyone expected.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is one person who stands above America's
fledgling presidential campaign, it is Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Most presidential hopefuls heap respectful praise on the head of
America's central bank and, from Al Gore to Elizabeth Dole, have
recommended that he should be reappointed when his term as Federal
Reserve chairman formally ends next May.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Washington, Greenspan is credited with an
unsurpassed understanding of America's economy, as he has steered
monetary policy to achieve rapid growth, low employment and low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, his acumen will be more necessary than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, there are reasons aplenty to fear inflationary
pressure. A batch of recent economic statistics hinted that tight
labor markets are at last pushing up wage costs.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets tumbled in early August after the employment
cost index, a quarterly measure of overall labor costs, leapt 1.1
percent between April and June, compared with 0.4 percent in the
first quarter. In the year to July, hourly earnings rose by 3.8
percent, up from a low of 3.5 percent in the year to May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were convinced that these numbers provided enough
evidence of an overheating economy to guarantee another
quarter-point rise in interest rates, or maybe more, when the
Federal Reserve next meets on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, inflation itself has not yet picked up.
Statistics released in the past week show that the major inflation
gauges _ the producer and consumer price indices _ are still
extremely well behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices for finished goods rose a mere 0.2 percent in
July (compared with 1.5 percent a year ago), and consumer prices
only 0.3 percent (2.1 percent a year ago).
</P>
<P>
   This news calmed the financial markets. Although the consensus
on Wall Street is still that the Fed is likely to raise rates next
week, some economists suggest that this is no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is a mistake to take either the labor-market figures
or the inflation statistics too literally. Wage pressures are
building up slightly, but this is after months of very modest wage
gains.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the April-June rise in the employment cost
index was a payback for an extraordinarily small rise in the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that the labor market is tighter than ever,
and on an unsustainable track.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 new jobs were created in July, much more than
most analysts had expected and three times more than the growth of
the labor force could normally sustain. The number of unemployment
claims is at its lowest in this economic cycle, and virtually every
Federal Reserve district has noted widespread labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the benign inflation numbers should not be taken
at face value. First, the central bank has to worry about future

America are disproportionately foreign.

   The two economists began by consulting the membership rolls of
the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of
Engineering _ America's top scientific and technological clubs _
for the past 20 years. They also included the authors of the papers
and patents cited most frequently in scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, they culled lists of scientists from the boards of
selected American biotechnology firms. This dream team of
researchers is one that befits a nation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all of the above categories, across almost all
disciplines, the proportion of foreigners is greater than it should
be considering their proportion of the scientific community as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1980 only about a fifth of the scientists in
America (those with doctorates, at any rate) had been born abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Over the subsequent decade, 60 percent of the American-based
authors of the most-cited papers in the physical sciences were
foreign-born, as were nearly 30 percent of the authors of the
most-cited life-science papers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a quarter of the founders or chairmen of the
biotechnology companies that went public in the early 1990s also
came originally from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The main victims of all this, according to Ms. Levin and Ms.
Stephan, are Germany and Britain. Superficially, the reason is not
hard to find. It is money.
</P>
<P>
   British spending on research and development, as a fraction of
GDP, slumped this year to a record low of 1.8 percent. Germany's
was 2.4 percent. In America, it was 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to check the outward flow, a lobby group, Save British
Science, has been pushing the British government to double its
spending on science over the next nine years. Germany has pledged
to double its spending by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But that may miss the point. The proportion of research financed
by the taxpayer is falling in almost all industrial countries. It
is private spending that is rising. But Europe is behind America
here, too: and that is not so obviously open to a quick government
fix.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is not alone in its worries. China and India are also
watching the American statistics, since the 2000 census is expected
to show a fairly sharp increase in the supply of immigrant
scientists from there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Skilled Asian immigrants are snapping up visas as fast as
America can dole them out. In California's high-tech industries,
Asians already hold over 50,000 jobs and produce $17 billion-worth
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   So, as other countries watch their talent wooed away, America is
left to cope with an embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   But every silver lining has its cloud. If foreign scientists are
so successful in America, it follows that at least some native
researchers are losing out in the competition for senior positions.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to immigration has classically come from the bottom
rungs of American society. Is a nativist backlash possible in the
quiet groves of academia as well? &QL;

   Since the 1970s, a lot of the immigrants coming to the United
States have arrived with PhDs burning holes in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   As a study published in this week's Science magazine shows,
America has incorporated this influx of talent so well that the top
ranks of its scientific establishment are now replete with
foreign-born workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Friday, Saturday and Sunday _ take the Sabbath of your
religious inheritance or choice _ America's places of worship are
filled with the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Americans out of every ten polled say that religion is
either ``fairly'' or ``very'' important to them; seven out of ten
claim affiliation to a religious group; four of every ten regularly
attend a church, synagogue or mosque.
</P>
<P>
   For all that the Constitution's very First Amendment seeks to
separate church from state, there is no denying that America, by
its history and its evolution, is a more religious nation than most
(in infidel, or at least insouciant, Britain, barely a tenth of the
population is religiously observant).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even America's supposedly feckless young proclaim their
faith: witness their proud hymn-singing after last April's
high-school slaughter in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder America's politicians are also avowedly religious.
Congress begins each day's session in solemn prayer; ``God bless
America'' is a plea that comes automatically to any modern
president's lips (along, in Bill Clinton's case, with biblical
quotations and words of contrition); and among the nation's 100
senators only Colorado's Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Washington's
Patty Murray admit to having no religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite that First Amendment, America's
politicians will invoke God's name and espouse the virtue of faith
as readily as, say, politicians in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So one should not expect George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee-apparent, to be any different. Bush has recently been
outlining ``a different role for government, a fresh start, a bold
new approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of ``the failed compassion of towering, distant
bureaucracies,'' America's poor, its drug addicts and its socially
inadequate will have access to ``a quiet river of goodness and
kindness that cuts through stone,'' he told an audience in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every instance where my administration sees a
responsibility to help people,'' he went on, ``we will look first
to faith-based organizations, charities and community groups that
have shown their ability to save and change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith-based?'' Al Gore, on the Democratic side, has discovered
the concept too, and finds it rings nicely on the hustings.
</P>
<P>
   But is this not code for steering the taxpayers' dollars to
religious groups, in defiance of that supposed traditional wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   It seems a long way from President Ulysses S. Grant, who once
declared: ``Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the
church and the private school, supported entirely by private
contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it depends on how you define separation. ``In God We
Trust'' was first engraved on American coins in 1864, when
President Grant was just General Grant, and became mandatory for
all coins and bills in 1955, just a year after the phrase ``under
God'' was added to the pledge of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks the House of Representatives has voted to
allow public schools to post the Ten Commandments on their walls,
Kansas has joined the states where the teaching of evolution is
merely optional, and the House only just fell short of the
two-thirds majority needed to pass a resolution calling on
Americans to ``observe a day of solemn prayer, fasting and
humiliation before God.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, all this is more ``gesture politics'' than substance.
But what of the 1996 federal welfare-reform law?
</P>
<P>
   Now widely praised across the political spectrum, this law
specifically provides for ``charitable choice,'' permitting
faith-based groups to receive federal cash for job-training
programs and other welfare-linked services so long as there are
secular alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Add the increasingly popular notion that children may receive
federal vouchers to attend private religious schools, and it is
hardly surprising that First-Amendment zealots react with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulation, they believe, will unavoidably follow the
use of government dollars. Religious and irreligious alike have
been warned.
</P>
<P>
   The risk will presumably be worse if a future President George
Bush expands ``charitable choice.'' After all, it is hard to see
the Scientologists or the Moonies being as politically palatable as
Episcopalians and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Is the George W. brand of compassion therefore something that
will insidiously, albeit unintentionally, undermine a social order
based on the notion that America has no established religion and
that its citizens have absolute freedom of belief?
</P>
<P>
   Surely not for a long time _ and meanwhile there is plenty of
evidence that faith-based groups, be they the Salvation Army or the
Nation of Islam, do a much better job than any government agency of
weaning the young away from drugs and street crime.
</P>
<P>
   The better criticism of George W.'s compassion is that it is so
partial. Of course America's prisoners, and their 1.3 million
children, will benefit if faith-based organizations and charities
have a bit more money with which to help them. (Bush talks of
giving $8 billion to them, and many other deserving causes, through
various tax incentives in the first year of his presidency.)
</P>
<P>
   But in a country as rich and generous as the United States, why
should this be necessary? Already almost half of the nation's
adults do some form of voluntary work, and last year gifts to
charity rose by 9 percent to $175 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One answer may well be that government programs are the
inefficient products of ``towering, distant bureaucracies.'' But
another is that God-fearing politicians such as Bush have too often
helped to create the problems they seek to cure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush bemoans the fact that so many children have parents in
prison. ``These are the forgotten children _ almost six times more
likely to go to prison themselves _ and they should not be punished
for the sins of their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   So would it not be sensible to put fewer parents in prison in
the first place? (America's prison population has tripled in the
past 15 years.) Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   These are, to be sure, complicated issues. But in George Bush's
Texas the prison population at the last count (for 1996) was over
132,000, more than in any other state except California.
</P>
<P>
   The governor takes pride in a tough approach which, for example,
makes sure that drug offenders get jail rather than treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatism'' may be a catchy campaign slogan,
but the element of compassion clearly has its limits. &QL;

makes sure that drug offenders get jail rather than treatment.

   ``Compassionate conservatism'' may be a catchy campaign slogan,
but the element of compassion clearly has its limits. &QL;

   PRAGUE _ Ten years ago, dissident intellectuals helped topple
Czechoslovakia's Communist regime. Arty sorts _ playwrights,
painters, philosophers _ held office in the transitional government
that followed, perhaps expecting an artistic flourishing of Czech
life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the currency of Czech intellectuals has been
devalued by a decade of cynicism, pop culture, and the advent of
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a group of the Czech Republic's leading
intellectuals, including Cardinal Miloslav Vlk, the country's top
churchman, academics, actors and writers, united for the first time
in ages to sign ``Impuls 99,'' a manifesto urging politicians to
stop bickering, to behave with less arrogance and to govern
properly.
</P>
<P>
   A comeback of sorts for the Czech intellectual? Or just a doomed
attempt to return to the days when people actually cared what a
poet thought?
</P>
<P>
   The signatories of Impuls 99 say they simply want to give their
politicians a kick in the pants. A recent poll suggested that 76
percent of Czechs are ``disgusted'' by their politicians. But these
days they are not turning to intellectuals for answers. And
politicians are more likely to regard intellectuals as a liability
than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was the collapse of communism that began to
undermine the position of Czech intellectuals. Until 1989, they _
or at least the heroic few with a dissident orientation _ had a
system to hate. Post-Cold-War, this target collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Motives were suddenly suspect. Were you a socialist, a
neoconservative, a Catholic revivalist, or did you simply want to
make money?
</P>
<P>
   Though the brain drain abroad after 1989 was somewhat offset by
the return of emigres, the internal loss of Czech intellectuals to
commercialism has proved more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Among the greatest contributors to this trend is Vladimir
Zelezny, once a Czech dissident and co-founder of TV Nova, the
country's most popular television station. Nova now feeds Czechs a
brain-numbing diet of soap operas, American cop shows, and, yes,
stark-naked weathergirls.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals complain that Nova is exploiting the ``moral
vacuum'' left by communism. If it improved the quality of its
shows, they argue, Czechs would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny is unapologetic: ``We just show what the market wants.''
If opera were as popular as guns and naked women, he says, Nova
would show opera.
</P>
<P>
   With a playwright for a president (Vaclav Havel), and a fine
literary tradition of their own (Milan Kundera, Ivan Klima, Bohumil
Hrabal) Czechs have not abandoned high culture altogether.
</P>
<P>
   They remain avid theatre-goers, even in the provinces, and _
despite the obliging efforts of TV Nova to supply lowbrow fare _
enthusiasts for opera and classical music, for which tickets are
still partly state-subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   Czech cinema, more thoughtful than its Hollywood counterpart,
just about holds its own. Publishing houses continue to put out
provocative books, albeit with smaller print runs. But the gradual
withdrawal of state subsidy and the opening up of the market has
inevitably promoted popular culture at the expense of the highbrow
version.
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny says his former dissident friends now shun him for
revealing a hard truth: most Czechs never particularly liked
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this myth among dissidents in communist times that
ordinary Czechs were secretly reading Proust,'' says Zelezny. ``Our
market research showed Czechs were not refined intellectuals at
all. They weren't interested in Proust at all. No! We discovered
what they were: beer-drinking, working-class Catholics, rather like
Belgians but less cultured.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the kind of talk to infuriate intellectuals. ``If he had
his way we'd all be watching his soft porn,'' sneers one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ The story of the creation of Daewoo was also the story
of the rise of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Over just three decades, Kim Woo Choong, a former shipyard
worker of modest means, built, through energy, guts and
determination, a global industrial giant that reached from
automobiles and electronics to financial services and construction.
</P>
<P>
   The conglomerate's allegorical power has therefore given its
decline an uncomfortable significance for South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, Daewoo's long-suffering creditor banks announced a
government-orchestrated plan to dismantle the sprawling group,
signalling what they hope will be the final chapter in a protracted
crisis that has cast a cloud over South Korea's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   When that cloud clears, Daewoo (``Great Universe''), the name
Kim chose in 1967 when the firm was just a tiny speck in what was
then one of the poorest countries in Asia, will remain only on its
cars and trading operation, according to the plan. The rest of its
dozens of Korean businesses are to be sold off by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has already announced that an investment group of
American banks has agreed to buy most of its electronics business
for $3.2 billion. In exchange for all this, the government will
prevent the creditor banks from forcing the firm into bankruptcy
and liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Daewoo's long-standing financial troubles, led by its
$50 billion in debt, the near-collapse of the group in July still
shocked many Koreans. They had believed that Hyundai, Daewoo,
Samsung and LG, the four biggest chaebol or family-controlled
business groups, were too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they were right. For all the government's tough talk
and Kim Dae Jung's televised speech on Aug. 15 in which he claimed
he would be the first South Korean president to dare to reform the
chaebol, neither government nor banks plan to liquidate a single
Daewoo company, for fear of rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo companies and their subcontractors employ some 2.5
million people in Korea alone, which _ as a government official
admits _ is the main reason for rescuing the group.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any mention of Daewoo's scores of overseas
subsidiaries, which are often tangled in complicated business and
financial relationships that go far beyond South Korea's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Even achieving the restructuring announced this week will be
tough. There are more than 60 Korean creditor banks in the
negotiations, and not all of them are controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks, which together extended $9.9 billion of loans to
Daewoo, are even harder to keep in order. Cash and loans flowed
freely between Daewoo subsidiaries regardless of shareholder
interests and so, if any one of the creditors calls in loans and
bankrupts a Daewoo company, it could pull the whole lot down.
</P>
<P>
   Finding buyers for Daewoo's businesses will be hard too. The
group announced last April that it wanted to sell its shipbuilding
operation but has yet to find a taker.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors hope General Motors (GM) will take over a controlling
stake of Daewoo Motor, but the American car giant is refusing to be
rushed into a deal. After a joint venture fell apart in 1992 over
Daewoo's plans to enter the American car market, relations between
the two companies have been prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors want to merge Ssangyong Motors, which Daewoo acquired
last year, with Daewoo Motor as part of the deal. But when Daewoo
and GM signed a memorandum of understanding early this month to
collaborate on new car production in South Korea, Ssangyong was not
included (the fact that it lost $417 million last year may have had
something to do with that).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any buyer of Daewoo Motor will have to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in plants that Daewoo left
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's financial trouble came to a head only last month, but
its failure was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the economic crisis forced most of the chaebol
to cut back, Daewoo brazenly added 14 new firms to its existing 275
subsidiaries _ and this in a year where the group lost a combined
550 billion won ($458 million) on sales of 62 trillion won ($51
billion).
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, South Korea's four biggest chaebol averaged
debt of nearly five times their equity. But while Samsung and LG
cut back during the subsequent year of economic crisis, Daewoo
acted as if nothing had changed: it added 40 percent more debt.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not alone in this: Hyundai's already large debt grew
larger, and it, too, went on an acquisition spree, buying Kia
Motors, LG Semicon and an oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai and Daewoo are the only top chaebol that are still run
by the mercurial tycoons who founded them. Kim is used to making
investment decisions on the spot, based on hunches.
</P>
<P>
   Although officially retired, Hyundai's Chung Ju Yung still
exerts strong influence on the group's affairs and few of his
managers will challenge his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's managers defer to him absolutely. Why is Kim, and not
Chung, now facing the humiliating public dismantling of his
business empire?
</P>
<P>
   The answer boils down to politics and paper. The government
believes that the recovering economy can now handle one big
corporate crisis, but worries it might tumble again with two _
especially one involving South Korea's largest firm. Besides,
Daewoo's finances really are worse than Hyundai's.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from having a higher debt-to-equity ratio than Hyundai, it
was particularly dependent on short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the government put a ceiling on the total value of
bonds and commercial paper which the top five chaebol could issue,
thus cutting off Daewoo's access to capital and eventually
precipitating its near-bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing Daewoo to the brink, President Kim has shown he can
indeed challenge the chaebol. But he has yet to prove he can save
them. &QL;

   Creditors want to merge Ssangyong Motors, which Daewoo acquired
last year, with Daewoo Motor as part of the deal. But when Daewoo
and GM signed a memorandum of understanding early this month to
collaborate on new car production in South Korea, Ssangyong was not
included (the fact that it lost $417 million last year may have had
something to do with that).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any buyer of Daewoo Motor will have to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in plants that Daewoo left
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's financial trouble came to a head only last month, but
its failure was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the economic crisis forced most of the chaebol
to cut back, Daewoo brazenly added 14 new firms to its existing 275
subsidiaries _ and this in a year where the group lost a combined
550 billion won ($458 million) on sales of 62 trillion won ($51
billion).
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, South Korea's four biggest chaebol averaged
debt of nearly five times their equity. But while Samsung and LG
cut back during the subsequent year of economic crisis, Daewoo
acted as if nothing had changed: it added 40 percent more debt.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not alone in this: Hyundai's already large debt grew
larger, and it, too, went on an acquisition spree, buying Kia
Motors, LG Semicon and an oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai and Daewoo are the only top chaebol that are still run
by the mercurial tycoons who founded them. Kim is used to making
investment decisions on the spot, based on hunches.
</P>
<P>
   Although officially retired, Hyundai's Chung Ju Yung still
exerts strong influence on the group's affairs and few of his
managers will challenge his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's managers defer to him absolutely. Why is Kim, and not
Chung, now facing the humiliating public dismantling of his
business empire?
</P>
<P>
   The answer boils down to politics and paper. The government
believes that the recovering economy can now handle one big
corporate crisis, but worries it might tumble again with two _
especially one involving South Korea's largest firm. Besides,
Daewoo's finances really are worse than Hyundai's.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from having a higher debt-to-equity ratio than Hyundai, it
was particularly dependent on short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the government put a ceiling on the total value of
bonds and commercial paper which the top five chaebol could issue,
thus cutting off Daewoo's access to capital and eventually
precipitating its near-bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing Daewoo to the brink, President Kim has shown he can
indeed challenge the chaebol. But he has yet to prove he can save
them. &QL;

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ The story of the creation of Daewoo was also the story
of the rise of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Over just three decades, Kim Woo Choong, a former shipyard
worker of modest means, built, through energy, guts and
determination, a global industrial giant that reached from
automobiles and electronics to financial services and construction.
</P>
<P>
   The conglomerate's allegorical power has therefore given its
decline an uncomfortable significance for South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, Daewoo's long-suffering creditor banks announced a
government-orchestrated plan to dismantle the sprawling group,
signalling what they hope will be the final chapter in a protracted
crisis that has cast a cloud over South Korea's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   When that cloud clears, Daewoo (``Great Universe''), the name
Kim chose in 1967 when the firm was just a tiny speck in what was
then one of the poorest countries in Asia, will remain only on its
cars and trading operation, according to the plan. The rest of its
dozens of Korean businesses are to be sold off by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has already announced that an investment group of
American banks has agreed to buy most of its electronics business
for $3.2 billion. In exchange for all this, the government will
prevent the creditor banks from forcing the firm into bankruptcy
and liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Daewoo's long-standing financial troubles, led by its
$50 billion in debt, the near-collapse of the group in July still
shocked many Koreans. They had believed that Hyundai, Daewoo,
Samsung and LG, the four biggest chaebol or family-controlled
business groups, were too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they were right. For all the government's tough talk
and Kim Dae Jung's televised speech on Aug. 15 in which he claimed
he would be the first South Korean president to dare to reform the
chaebol, neither government nor banks plan to liquidate a single
Daewoo company, for fear of rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo companies and their subcontractors employ some 2.5
million people in Korea alone, which _ as a government official
admits _ is the main reason for rescuing the group.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any mention of Daewoo's scores of overseas
subsidiaries, which are often tangled in complicated business and
financial relationships that go far beyond South Korea's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Even achieving the restructuring announced this week will be
tough. There are more than 60 Korean creditor banks in the
negotiations, and not all of them are controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks, which together extended $9.9 billion of loans to
Daewoo, are even harder to keep in order. Cash and loans flowed
freely between Daewoo subsidiaries regardless of shareholder
interests and so, if any one of the creditors calls in loans and
bankrupts a Daewoo company, it could pull the whole lot down.
</P>
<P>
   Finding buyers for Daewoo's businesses will be hard too. The
group announced last April that it wanted to sell its shipbuilding
operation but has yet to find a taker.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors hope General Motors (GM) will take over a controlling
stake of Daewoo Motor, but the American car giant is refusing to be
rushed into a deal. After a joint venture fell apart in 1992 over
Daewoo's plans to enter the American car market, relations between
the two companies have been prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors want to merge Ssangyong Motors, which Daewoo acquired
last year, with Daewoo Motor as part of the deal. But when Daewoo
and GM signed a memorandum of understanding early this month to
collaborate on new car production in South Korea, Ssangyong was not
included (the fact that it lost $417 million last year may have had
something to do with that).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any buyer of Daewoo Motor will have to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in plants that Daewoo left

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a secret war. At least 500 Anglo-American air strikes
against Iraq this year. More than a hundred dead. Well over a
thousand sorties. And yet scarcely a headline.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we have become immune to NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
Allied jets bombed Iraq again over the past fortnight. Eight dead
on July 29, nine dead the following day, according to the Iraqis.
And yet each British or American raid produces little more than a
paragraph in the western press. There is no political debate in
Washington, no questions in the House of Commons in London.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing Iraq has become routine, an ``acceptable'' war. In the
first five weeks of this year, there were 70 air strikes against
Iraq, inflicting more damage than the pre-Christmas ``Desert Fox''
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Americans and British received new rules of
engagement _ to attack Iraqi military installations even if they
were not directly threatening the RAF or the U.S. Air Force _ the
bombings went on unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet eight months later, President Saddam Hussein's vicious
regime appears to be as impregnable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting the facts of the air strikes. On Feb. 1,
U.S. and British aircraft attacked an Iraqi missile site and two
``communications sites'' at Al-Amarah and Talil.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, American jets _ in one of the heaviest raids on Iraq
in two months _ dropped more than thirty 2,000-lb. and 500-lb.
laser-guided bombs on ``communication sites, radio relay sites and
anti-aircraft artillery sites'' near Mosul ``in response to radar
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi oil pipelines were bombed, provoking condemnation from the
U.N.'s ``oil-for-food'' program director in Baghdad, Benon Sevan.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Iraq claimed that bombs had been dropped on a
farm near Basra. By March 14, Allied spokesmen were reporting ``an
unspecified number of bombs'' dropped on ``Iraqi radar posing a
threat to coalition aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was bombing Yugoslavia, Iraq experienced a brief lull
in bombing. By April 5 _ at the height of the bombardment on
Yugoslavia, the raids on Iraq had recommenced.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman announced that an American F-16CG aircraft,
a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet and an RAF Tornado had attacked
surface-to-air missiles sites 110 miles south of Baghdad while
other planes had bombed ``communication sites'' near al-Salman and
Nukayeb.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Iraq said two people were killed when
planes bombed surface-to-air sites south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-American offensive has infuriated both the Russians
and the French _ again with little reporting or public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The French were deeply troubled when an American AGM-130 missile
exploded in a Basra housing complex in February, killing 17 people
and wounding almost 100, according to the United Nations. Six women
and 10 children were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said _ in words that would become familiar
during the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia two months later _ that
``we are not targeting civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on Feb. 4, when the Americans claimed that British and U.S.
aircraft had destroyed 40 missile batteries, not a single
dissenting voice was heard in Congress or the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, Iraq said that three people had been killed when 18
bombs were dropped on Iraqi ``civilian and military (sic)
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Iraq said 12 people had been killed in civilian areas
of Mosul after U.S. and British aircraft had fired air-to-ground
missiles at farmers' tents around the ancient city of Ninevah. By
the end of the month, the Americans were recording attacks on
``Iraqi air defenses near Mosul.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that Saddam Hussein was an even more brutal man than
Serbia's president-cum-ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic, it was
inevitable that the U.S. government would use the same mantra to
excuse civilian casualties in Iraq as it had in Yugoslavia, where
all ``collateral damage'' was blamed upon Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, on July 19, James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said that ``every effort is taken to avoid any
casualties to civilians... Ultimate responsibility for these events
(sic), however, lies with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other disturbing parallels with the NATO bombardment
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO said it was bombing the Serbs because they were
``ethnically cleansing'' hundreds of thousands of Albanians from
Kosovo _ most of whom were still in their homes when the NATO
bombardment began _ so U.S. and British spokesmen at the Turkish
base at Incirclik, from which many of the fighter-bombers are
taking off, say that they are trying to protect the Iraqi Shiites
and Kurds from Saddam Hussein's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Yet statements from the Iraqi opposition make it clear that
dozens of Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein are being tortured and
summarily executed in the areas which British and American jets are
daily overflying.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have meanwhile resorted to the usual economy with
the truth _ as have the Iraqis. According to Rear Admiral Craig
Quigley on Aug. 5, only 108 attacks had been made against Iraqi
targets this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant General Shaheen Yassin, the commander of Iraqi
anti-aircraft defenses, said that U.S. and British planes had
carried out 10,977 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, of course, is that each raid recorded by Quigley
could constitute at least a dozen separate air strikes. And
``sorties'' include transport, refuelling and surveillance aircraft
on a single mission.
</P>
<P>
   Figures calculated for the past eight months suggest that
British and American aircraft have individually undertaken more
than 500 bombing missions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth recalling that two prominent British defense
magazines _
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated and Jets _ concluded that even the ``Desert
Fox'' bombardment of last December had no effect on Saddam
Hussein's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated said that 25 percent of the attacks missed
their targets and that ``all but one of the Weapons of Mass
Destruction (the supposed target of coalition jets) escaped severe
damage'' in an operation which ``achieved little more than
face-saving.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are we doing bombing Iraq? &QL;

<P>
   Yet statements from the Iraqi opposition make it clear that
dozens of Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein are being tortured and
summarily executed in the areas which British and American jets are
daily overflying.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have meanwhile resorted to the usual economy with
the truth _ as have the Iraqis. According to Rear Admiral Craig
Quigley on Aug. 5, only 108 attacks had been made against Iraqi
targets this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant General Shaheen Yassin, the commander of Iraqi
anti-aircraft defenses, said that U.S. and British planes had
carried out 10,977 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, of course, is that each raid recorded by Quigley
could constitute at least a dozen separate air strikes. And
``sorties'' include transport, refuelling and surveillance aircraft
on a single mission.
</P>
<P>
   Figures calculated for the past eight months suggest that
British and American aircraft have individually undertaken more
than 500 bombing missions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth recalling that two prominent British defense
magazines _
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated and Jets _ concluded that even the ``Desert
Fox'' bombardment of last December had no effect on Saddam
Hussein's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated said that 25 percent of the attacks missed
their targets and that ``all but one of the Weapons of Mass
Destruction (the supposed target of coalition jets) escaped severe
damage'' in an operation which ``achieved little more than
face-saving.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are we doing bombing Iraq? &QL;

<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to devalued Asian currencies, we've been getting TVs,
microwave ovens, and computer chips at bargain prices, so our
consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

 By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between Jan. 15 and April 15, Mexico's IPC index, or Bolsa,
jumped about 65 percent, the best performance by a major stock
index this year.
</P>
<P>
   Had you been brave enough to buy Mexican stocks in mid-September
last year, while Brazil, Russia, and Long-Term Capital Management
were turning wealth into waste, you would have nearly doubled your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us were so brave, however: The pundits were warning us
that Brazil _ as the next domino after Thailand, Malaysia, and
Indonesia _ would soon topple the rest of Latin America, including
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But economists underestimated the confidence and resilience of
U.S. consumers, who bought more than 85 percent of Mexico's
exports. As long as American families kept shopping, Mexican
factories ought to keep humming to meet our demand for cars,
clothes, and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mexico exports hardly anything to Brazil, a
key point overlooked during the frenzied sell-off last year in
Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Mexicans speak Spanish does not mean their economy
is linked more closely to Latin America than to North America.
Indeed, our 6 percent gain in gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter of 1998, despite tumbles in the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq, was an excellent signal that Mexico would not collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As American consumers swiped their credit cards, Mexican
businessmen wiped their brows with relief. The several thousand
factories just south of the U.S. border _ in an area known as
Maquiladora _ have continued to thrive in 1999, with overall
exports increasing at a 7.7 percent pace in February.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of watching their economy shrink in 1999, as
Brazilians, Argentines, and Venezuelans will, Mexicans will see
their GDP rise by 2 to 3 percent. (In further tribute to the
country's resilience, the jobless rate fell to just 2.7 percent in
March.)
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind the Bolsa's bounce is the rise in the
price of oil. Crude jumped from about $11 per barrel in December to
$18 by mid-April, thanks to an OPEC deal to cut production,
stronger economic prospects in Asia, and the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico exports oil, higher prices improve Mexico's
expected trade balance and its budget revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the Bolsa hitting 5430 in the second half of April,
investors in Mexico might want to book some profits now, because
there are a couple of dangers looming.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mexicans will head to the voting booths to elect a new
president in July 2000. Months before the 1994 election, wealthy
Mexicans began sneaking their funds out of the country to the
safety of U.S. banks in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They may get antsy again, recalling that the last presidential
election was marred by the assassination of the leading candidate,
rising inflation, and ultimately a collapse of the peso, which
triggered a deep recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the reigning PRI party, which has dominated Mexican
politics for 70 years, has been bloodied in recent years and even
been forced to share power with its rivals on the right (PAN) and
the left (PRD).
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo's interior minister, Francisco Labastida, is a
candidate, but other cabinet ministers may challenge him for the
PRI's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A second possible trouble spot is the peso. It looked awfully
strong earlier this year, actually rising by more than 5 percent
against the U.S. dollar through mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexican exporters start bellyaching about how a stronger peso
hurts their ability to compete with other countries, investors
should head for the exits with their profits in tow. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Between Jan. 15 and April 15, Mexico's IPC index, or Bolsa,
jumped about 65 percent, the best performance by a major stock
index this year.
</P>
<P>
   Had you been brave enough to buy Mexican stocks in mid-September
last year, while Brazil, Russia, and Long-Term Capital Management
were turning wealth into waste, you would have nearly doubled your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us were so brave, however: The pundits were warning us
that Brazil _ as the next domino after Thailand, Malaysia, and
Indonesia _ would soon topple the rest of Latin America, including
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But economists underestimated the confidence and resilience of
U.S. consumers, who bought more than 85 percent of Mexico's
exports. As long as American families kept shopping, Mexican
factories ought to keep humming to meet our demand for cars,
clothes, and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mexico exports hardly anything to Brazil, a
key point overlooked during the frenzied sell-off last year in
Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Mexicans speak Spanish does not mean their economy
is linked more closely to Latin America than to North America.
Indeed, our 6 percent gain in gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter of 1998, despite tumbles in the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq, was an excellent signal that Mexico would not collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As American consumers swiped their credit cards, Mexican
businessmen wiped their brows with relief. The several thousand
factories just south of the U.S. border _ in an area known as
Maquiladora _ have continued to thrive in 1999, with overall
exports increasing at a 7.7 percent pace in February.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of watching their economy shrink in 1999, as
Brazilians, Argentines, and Venezuelans will, Mexicans will see
their GDP rise by 2 to 3 percent. (In further tribute to the
country's resilience, the jobless rate fell to just 2.7 percent in
March.)
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind the Bolsa's bounce is the rise in the
price of oil. Crude jumped from about $11 per barrel in December to
$18 by mid-April, thanks to an OPEC deal to cut production,
stronger economic prospects in Asia, and the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico exports oil, higher prices improve Mexico's
expected trade balance and its budget revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the Bolsa hitting 5430 in the second half of April,
investors in Mexico might want to book some profits now, because
there are a couple of dangers looming.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mexicans will head to the voting booths to elect a new
president in July 2000. Months before the 1994 election, wealthy
Mexicans began sneaking their funds out of the country to the
safety of U.S. banks in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They may get antsy again, recalling that the last presidential
election was marred by the assassination of the leading candidate,
rising inflation, and ultimately a collapse of the peso, which
triggered a deep recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the reigning PRI party, which has dominated Mexican
politics for 70 years, has been bloodied in recent years and even
been forced to share power with its rivals on the right (PAN) and
the left (PRD).
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo's interior minister, Francisco Labastida, is a
candidate, but other cabinet ministers may challenge him for the
PRI's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A second possible trouble spot is the peso. It looked awfully
strong earlier this year, actually rising by more than 5 percent
against the U.S. dollar through mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexican exporters start bellyaching about how a stronger peso
hurts their ability to compete with other countries, investors
should head for the exits with their profits in tow. &QL;

 &HT;    PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 22 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland _ On a sunny mid-August afternoon,
two painters on scaffolds work on a three-story mural portrait of a
girl with a haunting gaze.
</P>
<P>
   A lone figure watches intently from the sidewalk below. William
McGavigan stoops slightly with his hands tucked in his trouser
pockets. He stands motionless in the cool breeze, which whips the
locks of his white hair. The girl is his daughter, Annette, who was
shot to death 28 years ago during the dark days here in the
Bogside, the Catholic neighborhood that has endured the worst of
The Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   McGavigan, a retired truck driver, says he will never forget
Annette, who was 14 when she was struck by one errant police
bullet. ``She was just eating an ice lolly, and then she was
dead,'' he says. ``She was such a lovely girl.''
</P>
<P>
   As he watches and remembers, McGavigan also worries. Northern
Ireland's fragile peace is in clear danger of collapse. A short
walk from the mural, workers on Wednesday were clearing charred
debris from a shop torched during an outbreak of rioting last
Saturday. A block away, the road was scorched by the outline of a
car set afire during the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   These images raise the chilling specter of the sectarian
violence that killed Annette and thousands more over the years. The
peace process was supposed to render such images a thing of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going well, not well at all,'' McGavigan
says as he watches the artists work around his daughter's soft
brown eyes. ``So, many people have suffered, so many people have
been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Northern Ireland was supposed to begin charting its
own future with a government comprising both sides of the bitter
divide, the momentum in the peace process has ground to a halt and
threatens to slip into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The peace deal was heralded by President Clinton during his
triumphant tour of Ireland last September, and it won Nobel Peace
prizes for its main architects, Unionist leader David Trimble and
Republican John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations now seem premature as the process has been
reduced to a sobering struggle with old realities of mistrust and
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's Unionists, who support Northern Ireland's continuing
as part of Britain, refuse to enter into the government with its
longtime adversary Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish
Republican Army. Both Sinn Fein and the IRA want Northern Ireland
to become part of the Republic of Ireland to the South.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point is the Unionist demand that the IRA surrender
its weapons before Sinn Fein takes its place in the would-be
government.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sinn Fein has argued that such a disarmament _ referred
to here as ``decommissioning'' _ is not required by the 1998 Good
Friday peace accord. Sinn Fein insists that decommissioning will
commence once the Unionists show good faith by allowing the
coalition government to be seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an ideal world and a perfect political process
where people trusted each other then maybe we would be further
along,'' said Mitchell McGlaughlin, the Sinn Fein chairman for
Northern Ireland. ``But why do people have guns in the first place?
It bespeaks a lack of confidence, a lack of trust in rival
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen from the IRA is a cessation of their
military campaign. We don't see operations carried out at the rate
of four or five a day. We don't see mortar bomb attacks. We don't
have car bomb explosions. We don't have sniper attacks on the
security forces. People want more, yes. But at what cost?''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of talks, in which British Prime Minister
Tony Blair has taken a major personal role, there seems little room
for progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clearly the situation _ and the agreement _ is
unraveling and I think there is a failure of politics,'' said Sinn
Fein official Martin McGuinness last week(CQ) during talks in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Things have deteriorated so far that former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, the arbiter of the peace accord, has been summoned to
help. Mitchell is scheduled to conduct a review of the situation
next month, with both sides expressing confidence that he will find
the other at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating an already complex issue, the Unionists are
accusing the IRA of violating its two-year-old cease-fire, an
allegation that could lead to Sinn Fein's being expelled from the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has been implicated in five murders since the start of
the peace process in April 1998 as well as a foiled attempt to
smuggle arms from the United States. The IRA has denied having a
role in these incidents, but the denials have been widely
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists last week(CQ) repeatedly expressed their
determination to stick by their guns. ``The Ulster Unionist Party
is steadfast in its resolution that no terrorist-linked party will
participate in executive government in Northern Ireland now or
ever,'' said Ken Maginnis, the party spokesman. ``Government must
deal with terrorist organizations and terrorist-linked parties
according to the promises that were made to us the day the
agreement was signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders argue that the incidents -- even if proven
true -- do not constitute a violation of the IRA's pledge to end
its military campaign. They also seem to argue that the cease-fire
remains in force because the five people killed were Catholics, in
one recent case a police informant.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Unionists are pressuring Marjorie ``Mo''
Mowlam, the British Northern Ireland secretary, to declare that the
cease-fire has been breached. Mowlam met through the week with both
sides as well as police authorities. She is expected to issue a
ruling early next week after consulting with Blair.
</P>
<P>
   She has little choice but to infuriate hardliners on one side or
the other. If she fails to appear tough enough on the IRA, the
Unionists have hinted they will walk away from the peace process.
If she moves to expel Sinn Fein she will provoke the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians worry that if something doesn't happen people
will give up on the political process. ``Unless we are producing
evidence that the political process is working people are going to
conclude that the politicians have let them down yet again,'' said
McGlaughlin, the Sinn Fein leader who is also a city councilman in
Londonderry. ``I can see quite clear evidence that there is an
evaporation of the confidence that was so manifest a year or a year
and half ago,''
</P>
<P>
   The process and its rhetoric have tended to confirm rather than
dismiss the distrust that has plagued any move for compromise for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes our job of selling the idea of political discourse
between the Republicans and the British government and Republicans
and Unionists that much harder,'' McGlaughlin said. ``For all of us
this entails great risks and challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   For Margaret Wair the failure of the political process is a
foregone conclusion. Her apartment in a drab Protestant
neighborhood of Belfast is festooned with Unionist flags
celebrating the Marching Season. Each year, Unionists hold marches,
often through Catholic neighborhoods, to commemorate the 1689
Protestant victory over the Catholics in Ireland that maintained
British rule. This season, which closes at the end of the month,
has been one
</P>
<P>
   of the most confrontational in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I love the marching season,'' she says, admiring the
flags. ``I'll keep them up 'til I replace them with my Christmas
lights.''
</P>
<P>
   She has three sons, but Wair sees little prospect that they will
grow into manhood in an undivided community. ``There can't be no
peace, never,'' Wair says. ``There's just too much hatred, too much
hatred on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Martin Watson shares a Guinness or two with
his friends in a Catholic pub. The entrance is protected by a steel
cage and above the bar where you would expect to find a soccer game
on the television is the pale blue flicker of a security monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has enjoyed the peace and hopes it will last. ``Now I can
walk the street without worrying every time a car stops behind
me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He remains hopeful about the process. ``Nobody wants to go back
to war,'' he says. ``I can't see Mo Mowlam coming out against the
IRA. But if she does, that could be the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are signs of a return to the old ways. Last
weekend, a march by the Apprentice Boys through Londonderry sparked
a riot that led to the unleashing of more than 100 gasoline bombs
and the burning of businesses and cars in the city's center. On
Wednesday, police officers and British soldiers in armored cars set
up a roadblock on the road between Londonderry after a long
absence.
</P>
<P>
   These were familiar and unsettling images.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clear view is that if we don't make the Good Friday work,
then those conditions for conflict which continue to exist will
reassert themselves,'' McGlaughlin said. ``We know what fills a
political vacuum anywhere in any society and we certainly have
experience with that over the last 30 years here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Bogside portrait of Annette McGavigan are two important
symbols: A rifle and a butterfly. Tom Kelly, one of the artists,
says the rifle represents violence and the butterfly represents
metamorphosis _ the prospect of change.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly worries that rifle may yet win out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who are planning to foster the
notion that the peace is dead and create the climate for that to
happen,'' Kelly said. ``But the overwhelming majority are aspiring
for peace and are fed up with the politicians. If you were to round
up all our politicians and give them a long weekend here on their
own or in Bosnia, it might do them a world of good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might just learn that peace is essential, and that the
prospects of change and growth far outweigh one or two issues no
matter how serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might learn that answers have to be found, and that
violence is used only by those who feel powerless.''

 &HT;    ELDERLY MIGRANT WORKERS CLAIM MEXICAN GOVERNMENT OWES THEM $3
BILLION
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRAPUATO, Mexico _ They gathered by the hundreds here for a
protest, some hobbling on canes, others peering through thick
glasses, all with faces scored by wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``braceros,'' just a handful of the 4.5 million
Mexican guest workers who were recruited to work on American farms
for 22 years, beginning during World War II. Decades later, they
have formed a movement and are claiming the Mexican government owes
them as much as $3 billion, money that was deducted from their
paychecks and deposited into Mexican bank accounts that have
mysteriously disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because my husband can't walk anymore,'' said
Irene Sanchez Lopez, 74, the stooped, shawl-draped wife of
Margarito(CQ) Romero Troncos, 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went up there five years. I was left at home with two
little ones, suffering and wondering if he'd ever come back. We're
still poor now,'' said Sanchez Lopez, who attended a rally for the
former guest workers and their families Monday in this city in
Guanajuato, a state with a long history of migrant labor.
</P>
<P>
   The lost savings accounts, which the Mexican government admits
existed, date back to 1942, when men in the United States went off
to battle and Mexico agreed to send contract workers north to
Texas, California, Arizona, Arkansas and other states to pick
seasonal crops.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were known as ``braceros,'' literally, a pair of
arms, and American farmers became so hooked on their cheap labor
that they pushed Congress to extend the U.S. Labor
Department-supervised program until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   For some if not all of that time, the Mexican government
deducted 10 percent of the men's wages as part of the Farm Worker
Savings Fund, a program designed to ensure that the men would not
return empty-handed from their work abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that no more than 1 percent of our affiliates ever
received their money back,'' said Ventura Mendez Gutierrez of the
Union of Mexican Farm Workers and Emigrants, the group that
organized Monday's rally to demand the Mexican government locate
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The union has registered 15,000 former braceros in Guanajuato
and seven other Mexican states and is trying to contact more
workers or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez said his organization, which represents the interests of
migrant workers, began researching the whereabouts of the fund when
elderly ex-braceros first came to him with inquiries about a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bosses said that money was taken out by the Mexican
government and that we would get it when we got back to Mexico,''
said Panfilo Soria Garcia, one of those workers.

<P>
   Now 77, Soria picked cotton in La Mesa, Texas, among other
seasonal jobs north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally in front of Irapuato's town hall, Soria carried a
little plastic bag filled with yellowed documents, including a
laminated guest worker card issued to him in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds of men and widows of braceros gathered at
the rally clutched similar documents -- precious bits of history
proving they worked in the United States and might be entitled to
the savings.
</P>
<P>
   They swapped stories about the back-breaking work they
performed, picking cotton, lettuce, oranges and other crops. The
braceros were usually housed in barracks, and were not allowed to
bring their families or join unions.
</P>
<P>
   Consuelo Delgado, a frail 70-year-old widow, said her husband
died 15 years ago, but had talked about a savings fund. ``He went
to Arizona many times,'' she said, leaning on her granddaughter.
``He was strong then.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Morelos Gutierrez, 81, who picked cotton in Texas and
fruit and vegetables in California, said, ``We sure could use a
little of that 10 percent they took out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the workers said they attempted to find out about the
savings years ago, but never had any success.
</P>
<P>
   ``One needs help sometimes figuring out how to track things
down,'' said Nicolas Galvan, 66, who harvested cotton in Texas for
three years in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last Friday in Mexico City, a
representative of Mexico's Foreign Ministry acknowledged the fund's
existence, but said the government stopped taking out deductions
from braceros' checks after 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means the period we are talking about is between 1942 and
1950,'' said Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, a legal consultant with
Mexico's Foreign Ministry, which is investigating the savings
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The deductions may have been deposited in three banks that later
merged into one institution called Banrural, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't know,'' he added, ``is what amount was in the
fund, how it operated -- if there were individual or group accounts
-- and what became of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez said that the union doesn't yet accept the government's
claim that deductions stopped in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27, he said, the government is supposed to disclose the
findings of its investigation so far.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government proves it didn't deduct money after 1950,
Mendez said, his union's position is that the Mexican government
should give the other workers credits to use for Mexico's social
security system or some other compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion figure the union claims is owed is based on how
much several million braceros would be entitled to if deductions
were taken out over the duration of the guest-worker program -- and
interest were added. If the government proves it stopped deducting
money after 1950, the actual amount of the claim might be smaller
but still substantial, Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Bustamante, an immigrant expert at Mexico's College of the
Northern Border in Tijuana, said he confirmed the fund's existence
more than 20 years ago when he served on Mexico's National
Commission on Migratory Labor.
</P>
<P>
   He said a Banrural official told him that the bank had issued an
advertisement years earlier warning that braceros who didn't pick
up their savings would lose them. Bustamante said he researched the
claim, and found that the bank couldn't legally strip the men of
their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice of the government taking out deductions continued
beyond 1950,'' Bustamante added, but he wasn't sure for what
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Carlota Botey, a Mexican housing activist who also served on the
commission, said that she suspected that Banrural may have
erroneously used some of the money for rural development projects,
including loans to big farms.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez's union is also urging that the government help find out
what happened to deductions from the checks of 100,000 Mexicans who
were recruited to work on American railroads during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The men paid dues to American unions, Mendez said, and also had
deductions taken out by the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered what happened to that money,'' said Jose
Avila Munoz, 74, who worked for 14 months in Arizona building
railways.

   TBILISI, Georgia _ From the sidelines, it may seem like a small
war. But looks are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest military conflict in its southern republic of
Dagestan has far-reaching implications for the stability of the
former superpower and the well-being of the oil-rich Caspian Sea
region.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has launched an extensive air and ground campaign to
vanquish an Islamic rebel uprising begun two weeks ago(CQ) in the
remote Caucasus Mountain republic. With its feeble economy and
dilapidated army, Russia is struggling to prevent its southern
territory from being nibbled away by guerrilla separatists
determined to rid the region of Moscow's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fighting is essentially a war that began in 1994.
Russia's battle with the breakaway republic of Chechnya ended only
because it retreated in 1996, withdrawing its forces which were
unable to end the jihad, or holy war. Chechnya declared
independence; Moscow's prestige and army were in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Russian authorities are facing old foes from
Chechnya, who have crossed into the predominately Muslim republic
of Dagestan to foment a revolution. Once again, Moscow is promising
to crush the guerrillas with a full-scale military operation of the
kind that inflicted heavy civilian casualties but failed to win the
war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan, Russian forces suffered their worst single-day
losses with 18 soldiers killed and at least 20 wounded on
Wednesday, according to the Defense Ministry. But President Boris
Yeltsin and the new prime minister, Vladimir Putin, have vowed to
relentlessly protect ``the links in the chain'' that make up the
Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But the view from Russia's southern neighbors in the Caucasus is
not a promising one. For most of this decade, since the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union, civil wars and economic uncertainty
have plagued the independent Caucasus republics of Georgia, Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the fighting in Dagestan, there is concern that the
unrest could spread beyond Dagestan's borders and that a prolonged
fight will sap Russia's already weak economy, ruining the entire
region's promise for security and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia faced a full political and military defeat in Chechnya.
What happens now in Dagestan is extremely dangerous,'' said Peter
Mamradze, chief adviser to President Eduard Shevardnadze of
Georgia. ``If it ends badly it will mean bad consequences for the
entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies have a large stake in what
happens should the conflict in Dagestan spread into neighboring
states or promote further challenges, from Russia's far-flung
republics to the central authority in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia's southern republics
form the western rim of one of the world's largest deposits of oil
and natural gas -- the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies are developing fields in the Caspian and
the United States has bestowed hundreds of millions of dollars in
foreign aid and expertise to help the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the security future of the world will be
decided,'' said Alexander Rondeli, a political scientist and
advisor to Georgia's foreign ministry. ``Whoever wants stability in
the world cannot ignore it. America understands this _ you have to
be here in this region, somewhere, somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia understood the territory's strategic importance in the
16th century, when Peter the Great annexed the region and began a
military campaign to make the northern Caucasus part of the Russian
empire.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-19th century, Russia finally crushed the resistance
led in Dagestan by the legendary Imam(CQ) Shamil, who dreamed of
establishing an Islamic state. But throughout the Soviet period,
the Islamic roots and tightly knit clans of Dagestan and Chechnya
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia has much at stake in Dagestan. It is Russia's
oil-pipeline link to the Caspian Sea and is home to Russia's only
all-weather Caspian Sea port.
</P>
<P>
   If oil weren't critical enough, Russian authorities fear that a
defeat in Dagestan could produce a ``domino effect'' that would
embolden other republics in the Russian Federation to seek
independence, or simply drift further from Moscow's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal power has been weakened to such a degree that for many
regional governors it has already turned into a fictional idea,''
human rights activist Boris Pustintsev wrote last week in the
Russian daily, the St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the forceful military reaction to events in Dagestan,
he said: ``Yeltsin does not want to go down in history as the man
who presided over the destruction of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Moscow, earlier promises have disappeared that the
fighting in Dagestan would be over in two weeks or less.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the rebels still control at least five villages,
including the tiny hamlet of Tando. And on Thursday, Deputy
Interior Minister Lt. Gen. Igor Zubov told the Interfax news agency
that the Russians have lost 40 troops and 160 have been wounded
since the conflict began in early August. He claimed that up to 500
rebels had been killed, though the rebels say the figure is hugely
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, military authorities now suggest that Russia will
have to send at least 10,000 troops _ and perhaps as many as 15,000
_ to force the rebels out of Dagestan and back into neighboring
Chechnya. So far, Russia has sent about 4,000 soldiers and
paramilitary forces. Moscow estimates guerrilla troop strength at
up to 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers mean little. Russia had superior forces in
Chechnya only to see its campaign there fail.
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan, Russia's conventional forces face similar problems
fighting the guerrillas and little time before winter sets in,
according to military analysts. The terrain in Dagestan's Botlikh
region, where the guerrillas have dug in, is extremely isolated and
difficult to negotiate. Furthermore, at the upper altitudes snow
will being falling in six weeks or less, limiting visibility for
Russian aircraft and artillery and obstructing mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   Unless commanders have learned the lessons from Chechnya, ``the
Russian military may be in for another major disaster,'' warned
Pavel Felgenhauer, military affairs correspondent for Russia's
Sevodya newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Russia's favor, so far, is little evidence that the
uprising in Dagestan has garnered widespread public support among
the republic's 2 million inhabitants. The fighting is mainly led by
Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev, a shadowy Jordanian-born
commander known as Khattab and their Chechen and Dagestani
followers.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla movement appears to be relying on the hopes that
local discontent with Moscow will prompt their fellow Muslims to
join the rebellion rather than ally with Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the most unpredictable country in the world right
now, and extremist movements are unpredictable by their nature,''
said Revaz Adamia, defense committee chairman of the Georgia
parliament. ``It is difficult to predict, because all the players
are unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chechnya's independence is a model few would want to
emulate. The two-year war wrecked the economy and infrastructure
and left rival warlords battling over the ruins the Russians left
behind. While there is a federal government, there is no rule of
law. Organized crime and kidnappings are rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, a predominately Orthodox Christian country with
virtually no armed forces of its own, fears the Islamic militants
could turn an eye to its territory, too. But the more immediate
threat comes at the borders it shares with Chechnya and Dagestan.
Officials are concerned that the current fighting could spread to
their soil or send tides of refugees into Georgia. ``And suddenly,
you're involved in the war without any wish to be involved in the
war'' said Rondeli, the Georgian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the Russian campaign, a warplane dropped
cluster bombs on a Georgian village near the border with Dagestan.
Russian officials have yet to acknowledge that it was one of their
pilots who dropped the bombs and say their investigation into the
incident continues.
</P>
<P>
   But more potentially serious is the threat that a defeat in
Dagestan poses to the stability of Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's economy took a beating last August when the Russia was
beset by its economic crisis. Russia represents the largest market
for Georgia goods, mainly wine and mineral water. Despite the two
country's deep political differences _ Georgia has accused
``elements'' in Moscow of being directly linked to several attempts
on Shevardnadze's life _ their economies remain closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   Should Russian forces fail in Dagestan, some Georgian officials
wonder if Russia's other fringe republics would declare open season
on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And they say the problems are Moscow's own creation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leaders have retained an imperial view of the former
Soviet Union, officials in Georgia complain. Russia could have more
allies and fewer risks had the Russian government from the outset
of the fall of communism approached the former Soviet republics,
and its own republics that remained in the Russian Federation, as
equals instead of subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it lacks the economic and the military might to impose its
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, we don't wish to see Russia fail. There is nothing in
it for us. Georgia can be unstable; that's not dangerous for
Russia,'' said Rondeli. ``But an unstable Russia is a disaster for
Georgia.''

HUGH GRANT AND THE MISSUS TAKE ON THE MOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a
weekly entertainment column with color and black-and-white art.)
 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Hugh Grant in
``Mickey Blue Eyes.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When Hugh Grant, the ever-so-polite British actor, was getting
ready to shoot his new mob comedy in the thick of New York's urban
jungle, he discovered he had a secret weapon: enter producer
Elizabeth Hurley, his glamorous partner in life and in art.
 &HT;    Grant and Hurley's ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is their second film, a
rollicking romantic comedy with Grant playing a straightlaced
Englishman at a New York auction house who is about to marry an art
teacher played by Jeanne Tripplehorn.
 &HT;    There's a catch, however: Tripplehorn's father is a low-level
gangster (played by veteran actor James Caan) who wants Grant in
the family business.
 &HT;    The 38-year-old actor says Hurley not only wore the producer's
hat but played a more crucial role: With her British charm and
upper-crust accent she cajoled their underworld contacts into
smoothing out those pesky union-related glitches and street-level
hassles which routinely plague the Big Apple's film crews.
 &HT;    Thanks to Hurley, the movie was completed for about $30 million,
a sum considered moderate by today's Hollywood standards.
 &HT;    ``We wanted the film to be very real and not have comedy or
Hollywood mobsters,'' Grant says. ``So my director friend Mike
Newell (``Donnie Brasco,'' 1997, and ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral,'' 1994) introduced us to guys with names like Rocco the
Butcher and Vinny Sevenheads. And gradually we got further and
further immersed in their world.''
 &HT;    Looking relaxed in blue jeans, a T-shirt and tennis shoes, Grant
recalls that he and Hurley spent a number of pivotal evenings
dining with Rocco, Vinny and the gang.
 &HT;    ``We finished up with some unbelievably heavy drinking ... They
couldn't have cared less about me, but I watched Elizabeth flirt
with them very, very successfully,'' Grant says.
 &HT;    ``She may be successful in the movies and as an Estee Lauder
model, but that's nothing compared to her skill with the guys with
the broken noses and diamond pinkie rings. She quickly had them
eating out of her hand.
 &HT;    ``At the end of the evening they'd say, `Elizabeth, you're a
princess. Anything we can do for you in New York, just say the
word.'''
 &HT;    It was an offer Hurley could not refuse. And when she ran into a
problem, she didn't hesitate to call on her newfound friends.
 &HT;    ``They opened every door for us,'' Grant says. ``There was
nowhere we couldn't film. Once we had helicopters overhead making a
terrible racket and ruining our shots. So Rocco or someone grabbed
his cellphone and called the tower at JFK Airport, and suddenly ...
no helicopters.''
 &HT;    ``Many of the mob characters showed up as extras in the movie's
big wedding scene,'' Grant says. ``They loved the script and it
tickled them to be in our picture.''
 &HT;    The ultra-suave Grant seems an unlikely casting choice for the
part of a mob suitor: in the original script, the principal
character is a neurotic Manhattan lawyer.
 &HT;    ``(The script) was funny but it was all a bit familiar,'' Grant
says. ``However, Elizabeth and I tailored the role for me. I wrote
a lot of my own dialogue because I know how words come out of my
own mouth.''
 &HT;    Nicknamed ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' by his new mob acquaintances,
Grant's bumbling Brit becomes heavily involved with and eventually
transformed by the ``wise guys''.
 &HT;    In one of the film's funniest scenes, Caan tries to teach the
Englishman to ``fuhgedaboutit!'' and coaches him in rudimentary
Italian-American street lingo.
 &HT;    ``I was a bit intimidated by James when we first met, and in the
scene he was really getting frustrated because I couldn't deliver
the joke lines, or get the fractured pronunciations right,'' Grant
says.
 &HT;    ``Jimmy's the kind of guy who likes to do the scene once or
twice and then leave,'' he adds. ``But we spent the entire day
doing the one scene, and the frustration you see in his face is
real. Plus the fact that I get car sick and every so often we had
to pull over so I could throw up.''
 &HT;    Caan remembers the day well:
 &HT;    ``Hugh's this nervous British guy who is actually playing
himself in the movie,'' he says. ``From the first day I realized my
trick for our scenes was to try and keep Hugh Grant the actor
nervous all day long so that his character in the film would be
edgy. Hugh is such an easy mark. I had him scared out of his skin
some days.''
 &HT;    Grant snaps back with mock derision:
 &HT;    ``I loved him as Sonny Corleone in `The Godfather' (1972) _ I
was a kid when I saw it. We had to pluck Jimmy from his old
people's home so he could work with me. And all he did was insult
me, calling me `a little wimpy guy.' He gave me no respect.''
 &HT;    The film comes hard on the heels of Grant's summer hit ``Notting
Hill,'' in which he romanced Julia Roberts. While the new Mafia
comedy has been well-received in previews, Grant says he is wary
about its scheduled release so soon after the earlier film.
 &HT;    Could two Hugh Grant vehicles in three months be one Hugh Grant
too many?
 &HT;    ``I'm the world's worst career planner,'' Grant says. ``I do
nothing for a couple of years, and then I'm in two movies in the
same summer. Bloody silly. I modeled my career plans after the
London bus system. You wait for an hour and nothing comes along,
and then suddenly 20 buses show up going to the same place.''
 &HT;    Grant is hoping his and Hurley's second production will fare
better than their first, the box-office disappointment ``Extreme
Measures'' (l996). And the pair are planning ``Her Majesty's
Homey,'' a third film together as producer and star in which Grant
will play (no great stretch here) a British royal emissary caught
up in New York's hip-hop community.
 &HT;    And Grant has completed a starring role in a new and as yet
untitled Woody Allen film.
 &HT;    ``I play a sophisticated guy living in New York who is hired by
a very vulgar, nouveau riche couple from Brooklyn (played by Allen
and Tracey Ullman) to teach them about wine and art and stuff,''
Grant says.
 &HT;    ``Woody faxed me the job offer and I said `yes' right away. Then
he sent me 27 pages of script, but just my part. He told me nothing
else. He's unbelievably silent as a director. You show up, do your
scenes and you're home in time for lunch.''
 &HT;    In the wake of ``Notting Hill's'' success, Grant has been
offered a lot of money to star in other big-budget movies. And
while he may be tempted to turn them down for the sake of his art
and peace of mind, Grant says the memory of his years as a
down-and-out Londoner keeps him hungry and on his toes.
 &HT;    ``I've talked about my fantasy _ to act less and write. But it's
always very difficult to say `no,' specially when you've spent
years and years as an unemployed, penniless actor ... You tend to
hoard everything you can get.''

 &HT;    AARP discovers sex sells
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the almost daily shocks in my life
is the recent news that I have to share my Golden Years with baby
boomers becoming eligible for the rocking chair league. Other than
a father-son relationship with two of them, we don't have much in
common. Boomers are defined as those born between 1946 and 1964.
They listen to James Brown and Gladys Knight and the Pips (whoever
they are) rather than Glenn Miller and Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons, senior
citizenship begins at age 50. Old age in this country gets younger
by the year.
</P>
<P>
   This is because AARP is mainly a business enterprise on the
lookout for another marketing ploy. The hired executives who run it
can make more money by rolling back the age qualification so they
can collect more fees and magazine subscriptions from more people.
Pretty soon my granddaughter, who is only 14, will qualify for
membership.
</P>
<P>
   I've never belonged to the AARP, the Ku Klux Klan or a political
party. I'm a nonjoiner. After being expelled from the Rotary Club
for spotty attendance, the only thing I belong to is the Methodist
church, which in our family comes with the birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   This may change. I found a newspaper story about the August
issue of Modern Maturity, the magazine published by AARP, highly
interesting. (FYI: Copies of Modern Maturity are available in
doctors' offices, along with 1988 Reader's Digests in large print).
</P>
<P>
   The August cover features Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon
in a sexy pose, wearing a clingy red dress with a large V in the
right place. Although she looks about 22, probably thanks in part
to Hollywood plastic surgeons, Susan is 52, which qualifies her for
a 10 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   The teaser headlines on the August Modern Maturity cover say:
</P>
<P>
   ``GREAT SEX: What's age got to do with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Along with younger membership in AARP, Modern Maturity has a new
strategy and a new editor. He is 50 years old and has made a
startling discovery: People over 50 do actually engage in sex.
Therefore, the AARP publication is going to feature sexual topics
so senior citizens will be better informed about things previously
thought to recede into fond memories after the Big 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Since I haven't been sick enough to go spend a day in Dr. Sams'
waiting room lately, I haven't actually read the Modern Maturity
story about ``great sex.'' I assume the editors decided to make the
subject a cover story after a survey turned up startling
information indicating that some Americans 45 and older enjoy
active sexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Being as this is a family newspaper, I'd never thought I'd write
a column about sex. I wouldn't now, except that with so many young
editors running things, a lot of misleading information is getting
into print.
</P>
<P>
   Having arrived at the stage in life when it's prudent to check
the obituary page before the sports or the funnies, I've become a
regular reader of the obits. What I read convinces me that the
people writing them must be in junior high. I was disturbed to read
a sentence that read something like this: ``He was active into his
seventies.'' The deceased was only 71 years old!
</P>
<P>
   As you get older, you do begin to wonder what the newspaper will
say about you at checkout time. The best I have hoped for is a
small headline that almost spells my name right: 'Jim Winter,
worked for papers.' With the new style of writing obits to include
human interest tidbits, maybe they will add a line pointing out how
that even at an advanced age I was able to do my own grocery
shopping every Wednesday so I could get the 10 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the over-the-hill category, I'm grateful for
advice meted out to senior citizens, even when it comes from
editors and writers barely out of the acne stage. As previously
mentioned, the company where I once was gainfully employed is
thoughtful enough to keep retirees supplied with an abundance of
helpful hints on topics from diet to driving a car.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to be reminded to take our vitamins every day; to eat
more fiber and cut down on coffee; to get a flu shot; to keep our
hearing aids turned on when driving; and instead of making left
turns, circle the block and make a series of right-hand turns.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens have been overwhelmed with advice on everything
except sex. As I'm always looking for a way to supplement my Social
Security, I thought I saw an opportunity. I mentioned it to my wife
after reading the revelation about people over 50 having sex, and
how Modern Maturity is using sex stories and pictures to sell the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only the magazine segment of the market,'' I pointed
out. ``Why don't we do a husband-wife newspaper column about senior
sex? I bet we could syndicate and make a lot of money?''
</P>
<P>
   I thought her answer was unnecessarily sharp. ``Just go pick
your butter beans,'' she said.

 &HT;    Animals are people, too _ Or so think America's newest 'civil
rights' attorneys
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's new proof that lawyers are going to the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   An emerging branch of animal jurisprudence will supply lawyers
with employment until the cows come home, if the cows want to come
home.
</P>
<P>
   No one should force a cow to come home against her will. Animals
have rights. They must not be considered property.
</P>
<P>
   Do not scoff. Animal civil rights lawyers are winning court
cases. Two of America's finest law schools _ Harvard and Georgetown
_ are preparing to offer animal law courses for bright young
students eager to make their mark in this new field.
</P>
<P>
   Last year an animal rights lawyer won a court case that gave
chimps the right to reside in group-living housing with appropriate
ape amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, according to the New York Times, was filed under
1985 amendments to the Federal Animal Welfare Act that specifically
require ``the psychological well-being of primates.''
</P>
<P>
   A human visitor to the Long Island Game Farm Park and Zoo
thought that the rights of Barney (the zoo's chimpanzee) were being
violated. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Barney's case continues to climb the judicial appeals tree.
Barney does not. A zoo employee killed Barney after he escaped his
ape-inappropriate living quarters, tossed a sign at a
merry-go-round and bit someone. The incident smacks of a vast
anti-animal-rights-wing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of lawyers across the nation are handling lawsuits on
behalf of animals. This new field of law promises to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups must hire lawyers skilled in fighting cases
brought by animal lawyers who can tap into millions of dollars
collected by animal welfare organizations that want to overturn the
principle that animals can be the property of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Wise, the lawyer scheduled to teach the Harvard Law
School animal law course, once sued an aquarium on behalf of
Rainbow, a dolphin held captive by aquarium owners, according to
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   A staff lawyer for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, according to
the newspaper, is studying legal precedents involving the
emancipation of slaves that can be used to assist animals.
</P>
<P>
   An animal law professor at Rutgers University has suggested that
gorillas should be considered ``persons'' under the U.S.
Constitution and granted constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Animal lawyers point out that environmental and civil rights
lawyers also were ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   If animal rights activists and their lawyers succeed in
overturning the legal principle that animals are property, then
people cannot own animals.
</P>
<P>
   If ranchers cannot own their cattle herds, surely they would
have to go to the courthouse and legally adopt each cow, bull,
steer and heifer by name. A few ranchers might object, but some
people always resist change.
</P>
<P>
   Once a rancher has adopted his cattle _ and all his sheep,
goats, chickens, dogs, cats and fish in his stock tanks _ the next
legal hurdle would come when he gave them up for adoption to a
slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   No, it just won't work the old way.
</P>
<P>
   You can't take animals to market unless you can buy and sell
them. You can't buy and sell animals if they are not property. And
if you can't buy and sell animals, then you certainly have no right
to slaughter and consume your constitutionally protected animal
companions.
</P>
<P>
   So that's it. This new field of law is a one-way trip to
vegetarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Animal law will be an adjustment, of course. It's the next step
that worries me. That's when lawyers and law schools turn their
attention to plant law.

 &HT;    Woodworking builds respect for craftsmanship, tools
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Recently a correspondent on rec.woodworking asked
everybody how they got into woodworking and some of the answers
were rather striking. I'd like to share a few with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepfather was a minister and a carpenter,'' replied one
woodworker. ``He was from the old school and could frame a house
using a handsaw and hammer and nails just about as fast (and much
more accurately) as any framer I ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   He made me work in costruction as a kid. While I thought it was
cruel back then, I gained a tremendous work ethic from him and I
owe a lot of my personal success to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am substantially older and haven't had to work with my
hands in a while and can finally afford good tools. When I have the
time, I really enjoy making something that I can be proud of. I
also enjoy the problem solving. I never do a project directly from
plans. I use plans as a guideline and then try to improve on them
or make some changes. Finding solutions that allow you to turn out
a truly worthy piece is fun and challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a 70-year-old house and I couldn't afford to have
other people work on it. I taught myself from books. Later on, I
worked as a carpenter's helper before I found a job as a computer
programmer (pays better).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm trying to make nice furniture. It's a whole new ball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And another:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with a great, loving reverence that I use tools that
belonged to my great grandfather, that I remember my father using,
no doubt with the same reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My projects may not be masterpieces, but the soothing sound of
a plane slicing wood, or the sonorous tone of a hand saw cutting a
kerf is a relaxing therapy for my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow replied to that:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well said. I often tell people that my woodworking is therapy
for me. That's one reason why I've moved more towards handtools for
my work. If my intent is to relax and unwind, then quieter tools
are the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also appreciate your idea of reverence for the tools
themselves. When I pick up an old plane, I am reminded of the man
who may have used it to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, from a soldier:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was about 7 or 8 years old my dad was laid off from his
job as an operations manager at a power plant. The only job he
could find was delivering flowers 3 days a week. The rest of the
time he turned what had been a hobby into a business. I remember
many hours watching him work in an unheated metal outbuilding
making potato bins, bread boxes, signs and all sorts of stuff to
sell. Between that and mom working in a grocery store we got by. We
were never rich but there was always food on the table and clothes
on our backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my junior year in high school I went to the local
vocational school and took carpentry. We built a 3,200-square foot
house my senior year. I joined the Army after high school and
didn't do any woodworking for about seven or eight years until I
moved into a place where I almost have the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I work in my carport out of a 5' x 8' storage closet where
my tools are stored. I spend my days at work teaching young
soldiers methods of destruction, so I balance that by creating
things when I'm at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my tools were passed down to me from my dad, who
doesn't woodwork as much anymore because of arthritis. Whenever I
pick up one of his old tools it takes me back to the days when we
froze or baked together in that old metal shed. We never got rich,
but in a way I guess we were.''

features of larger CD players. The player can be programmed to
repeat single tracks, play the entire album, select favorite tracks
and play in specified or random order.

<P>
   The radio offers digital tuning and 10 station presets. The CD
Shower Companion has a large liquid crystal readout screen and
large simple buttons that can be easily manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   It can play the audio portion of television programs on its VHF
band.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to leave the shower CD in the shower. It comes
with a countertop stand, a wall-mount bracket and hanging hooks. It
runs on four C batteries, or it can be plugged into a wall outlet
with an AC adapter. (The adapter doesn't come with the basic system
but can be ordered separately.)

<P>
   It's compatible with standard headphones and measures 10 1/2 by
6 1/2 by 2 inches. It weighs 28 ounces.

 &HT;    Dalai Lama brings message of love to sacred event in Indiana
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. _ A college cultivates a certain worldliness
in the community that surrounds it, and Indiana University is no
exception. Students from around the world bring pieces of their own
culture to this small southern Indiana town, and it makes for a
pleasant, mostly peaceful alchemy. It's a town where you can choose
from three Tibetan restaurants, or a number of bars with a good
selection of country-western on the jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   But just south of town, the country takes over. The narrow roads
dip and curve, and barn swallows dive crazily over open fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan Cultural Center keeps its distance here, located
about a quarter-mile off the road, on 90 acres of private property.
Still, it's been clear that something big is going on this week.
White tents have been erected inside the fence, and sheriff's
deputies keep traffic moving.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday afternoon, a group of bikers parked their Harleys
and formed a prayer circle in the yard next door to the Cultural
Center. ``Jesus, make the ground shake here tonight!'' A man
shouted and held his Bible high, while a woman swayed and spoke in
tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Martindale was part of this spontaneous gathering of
Christians, a response to what's going on next door. ``Idolatry,''
he whispered. ``They're the anti-Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are heating up spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are.
</P>
<P>
   While a small number of Christians spoke in tongues outside, a
larger number of Buddhists were chanting inside the largest tent _
expected to hold 5,000 this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The event is called the Kalachakra for World Peace 1999 _ one of
the most sacred of Buddhist rituals. It is being led by the Dalai
Lama, head of the Tibetan Buddhists, who have been driven into
exile by China.
</P>
<P>
   Security is tight at the Cultural Center. Nobody is allowed to
bring things in with them, and everyone passes through a metal
detector. Newspaper and television photographers have their
equipment checked by a dog trained to sniff out explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has made the rounds in the United States this
week, speaking to an adoring crowd in New York City's Central Park
last weekend; speaking in Indianapolis on Monday; participating in
a forum on youth violence Monday night, then at a public address
Wednesday in Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
   So, far, his message has been easily digestible across cultures
and religious traditions: Mankind is essentially loving and
compassionate; the 21st century will bring us to a ``oneness of
humanity.'' Call it Buddhism Lite.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kalachakra is a 2,400-year-old ritual, mysterious to
Westerners, with its sonorous chanting and clanging of cymbals. The
Dalai Lama, who is 64, has performed it only 25 times since his
exile in 1959. The Bloomington ceremony will end next Friday with
the public viewing and dismantling of a mandala _ a meditational
diagram, assembled grain by grain of colored sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kalachakra is considered an almost magical thing, like a
communion,'' said Robert Thurman, professor of Tibetan studies at
Columbia University, who is attending the event. Kalachakra means
``wheel of time,'' in the sense that time is human evolution.
Buddhists are not monotheistic, but they believe in powerful,
all-loving deities who guide the world toward a time when it really
will be a better place, Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kalachakra, a window in time opens, when participants
can get a glimpse of this ``fulfilling, joyful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The mandala will be a representation of a palace, where the
deities can reside, according to Lhakdor, who serves as an English
translator for the Dalai Lama. Each particle of sand will be
transformed and visualized into the deities and the mansion. But
before that process begins, the monks seek permission from the
ground to build the mandala; then they bless the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The clanging of cymbals are ``offerings of sound, music _
everything that is good to the eye, the ear, and touching.'' Rice
is thrown as a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Kalachakra ritual and offering dance will be
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the tent, the proceedings may be exotic, but outside, on
the grounds of the Cultural Center, it's an all-American scene.
Vendors hawk prayer beads, books, Buddha statues, ``Dharmaware,''
Coke, candy bars, even Arby's roast beef sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how many of those on hand for the event are
practicing Buddhists. Monks wearing maroon robes, with shaved heads
and Adidas sandals, roam the grounds or tool about in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the people here are dressed in secular garb. Allison
Kane came here from Canada. On her way to the tent, she stopped to
bow under the Kalachakra Stupa, a 45-foot-tall monument topped by a
copper and gold leaf spire. ``I'm just soaking up this good
sunshine and these good vibes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Daily events begin at 7 a.m. and last as late as 4:30 p.m., with
related evening events, such as a film festival, an art exhibit,
and lectures taking place elsewhere in the community. An interfaith
vigil for world peace will be held Monday at St. Charles Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are advised to arrive two hours early for events at the
Tibetan Cultural Center.

Despite its roots in Paris avant-garde art and politics, the

Balanchine was brought here to build a ballet company; when Martha
Graham and the other founding mothers of modern dance established
their companies; when film and theatrical dance blossomed. This

   REL-OVER _ ATLANTA _ The New World was a beacon across the
Atlantic, calling to people looking for a fresh start, sick of the
old ways of the Old World. The Reformation shattered the old
Christendom, but also unleashed new energies, forces that would
sustain a people in a distant land. Protestants translated the
Bible into vernacular languages and encouraged lay learning and

Despite its roots in Paris avant-garde art and politics, the
epicenter of dance moved across the Atlantic around 1930, when
Balanchine was brought here to build a ballet company; when Martha
Graham and the other founding mothers of modern dance established
their companies; when film and theatrical dance blossomed. This

   JOHN McGAIN: THE CANDIDATE WITH A PELLET
GUN  c
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. John McCain was in town Thursday, and I
didn't ask him the ``did-you-ever'' question.
</P>
<P>
   He made himself an easy target, too. He said of George W. Bush's
nasal privacy problems that ``the American people have a right to
know a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the media and the people decide the limits of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to refrain from asking: ``Did you ever in the last 7,
15 or 25 years (or whatever Bush has established as a statute of
limitations on boyish naughtiness) shoot any beer cans with your
pellet gun?''
</P>
<P>
   Guns are of more interest to California voters than any
candidate's history of cocaine use. But I didn't want to get that
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I read that all the major party presidential
candidates have toted guns, with the exception of Elizabeth Dole,
who seems so tough she doesn't need one. McCain's gun, according to
the story, is a pellet gun.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one more reason for moderates to like McCain. He
doesn't keep and bear a firearm. He keeps and bears a pellet gun.
</P>
<P>
   And because of his military record, right-wingers can't accuse
him of being a wimp who only shoots BBs.
</P>
<P>
   But California voters further to the left, which is a lot of
voters, might want to know more about that pellet gun, like if it's
an assault pellet gun.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't want to go there. McCain _ a Republican from
Arizona _ faces enough potential problems on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the Commonwealth Club on Thursday, McCain
wriggled on gun control, calling for gun locks, tighter controls on
gun shows, development of high-tech gun safety devices, enforcement
of existing gun laws and an effort to restrain violence in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rhetorical equivalent of a pellet gun, with a lot of
air propelling a small, ineffectual projectile that could put
McCain's eye out. His gun-control stance (duck, basically) is
certain to offend both gun-owners and gun-haters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is going the in-between route on both guns and abortion
in California, basically asking why Republicans can't all get
along.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? McCain has character, principles, a real record
as an intelligent maverick and a sense of humor, even if it
sometimes gets mean. What's a sense of humor for, after all?
</P>
<P>
   And the press, Democrats and liberals love him. That's three
more reasons, besides character, he doesn't have a chance to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the press and Democrats like McCain is that he is an
actual, card-carrying human running for president as a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a knowledgeable and reasonable speech ranging from China
policy to labor issues in Silicon Valley, ending with references to
John F. Kennedy and a call to end cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place there's an illiterate adult, there's a great
cause,'' he said. ``Every place there's a hungry child, there's a
great cause...''
</P>
<P>
   OK, McCain sounded a little too much like Henry Fonda at the end
of ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' but most of the time he sounded like
John McCain, talking about big-money corruption of American
politics and making jokes about coming to California to visit
Arizona's water.
</P>
<P>
   Another winning quality to McCain is that he's edgy. After the
speech, he told a group of reporters, ``I'm ready to respond to any
questions, comments or insults.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure I heard him say the same thing to the press a
few months ago. There's a prickliness to his humor that dares you
to take him on. The press likes that, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the press was more interested in getting McCain to
comment on Bush's problems than McCain's problems. That's the way
the game goes.
</P>
<P>
   The rich boy with $50 million in campaign funds has made his
first gaffe. Bush foolishly tried to avoid dumb questions about
past drug use by playing numerical games the way Bill Clinton
played grammatical games. That really put him in the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Just as members of the media love seeing a front-runner in the
barrel, they love goading an opponent into poking him with sticks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain played the game his own skillful way, saying that his
personal opinion is that Bush is entitled to his privacy about any
past drug use, but noting there is a balance between privacy and
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very delicate thing that we're going through,'' he
said. ``The American people are sort of feeling their way through
this, as is the media.''
</P>
<P>
   See why members of the media like this guy?
</P>
<P>
   McCain even said, ``I admire the way the media has treated
Chelsea Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   When I reminded him that a year ago he told a Republican crowd a
very offensive joke about Chelsea Clinton and Janet Reno (just from
the names involved you can guess how bad it was), he said he
regretted saying something so ``stupid, senseless and cruel'' and
hopes he never says anything like it again.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed genuinely remorseful. It's no fun shooting yourself in
the foot, even with a pellet gun.

EVERYBODY LOVES `RAYMOND' (REALLY) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At this time last year, the consensus was
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' was roadkill, toast, a cancellation
waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were dead,'' co-star Brad Garrett said. ``I
thought we were history. I thought they were setting us up for the
kill. I thought I would be waitering at Friday's again.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS had decided to move the sitcom last fall from 8:30 to 9 p.m.
on Monday nights. So at the new time, with all the guys watching
``Monday Night Football,'' and all the women watching ``Ally
McBeal,'' just who would be left over to watch Ray Romano's sitcom
about a New York sportswriter and his extended family?
</P>
<P>
   Romano shivered at the memory of the moment: ``We were scared
(blank)less.'' Then two things happened. One was the show improved
markedly in its third season. That was not the surprise. What threw
critics, Romano and everyone else was that people tuned in, a lot
of them, propelling ``Raymond'' into the Top 20 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked more than anybody that we were getting the
numbers we were getting,'' Romano said. ``There just must be a ton
of people watching television on Monday night, because we thought
our days of coming in the Top 30 were over.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Garrett: ``We really, really found an audience, oddly
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Now cemented at 9 p.m., ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' has been
nominated for six Emmys, including outstanding comedy; lead actor
(Romano, as Ray Barone); lead actress (Patricia Heaton, as Romano's
wife, Debra Barone); supporting actor (Peter Boyle, as patriarch
Frank Barone); and supporting actress (Doris Roberts, as mom, Marie
Barone).
</P>
<P>
   Romano said the ratings and Emmy nods are great. ``You kind of
fantasize about it, and then you go back to work,'' he said, but
they have not lessened the pressure. That's because after 75 shows,
comedies must work hard to stay fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure now is that it's the fourth year,'' Romano said.
``Being funny is pressure no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Romano, who noted wryly that he has twice hosted the People's
Choice Awards, even though he was never nominated for one of their
awards, has some trouble believing he is in line for an Emmy just a
few short years after having to take acting lessons just to make
the transition from stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Y2K glitch (come) early,'' he said. Then he
concluded that, well, maybe it was just his turn.``I thought there
was nobody left,'' he said. ``I mean literally. There are a lot of
ensembles _ `Friends,' `Just Shoot Me' _ (but) there is no lead
actor. There weren't many eligible. I thought I might just get in
on that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ray Romano is in. He is on Mondays at 9 p.m., and likes it.
He was this year's winner of the individual achievement in comedy
award from the Television Critics Association. The man who makes
his living portraying glum resignation does not have much to be
bummed about. In fact, only one thing would get him down and, no,
it's not if he lost out in the Emmy balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I'm going to be disappointed if I don't win the
Emmy is if I come up with a funny (acceptance) speech,'' he said.
``Writing comedy is hard. If you got a killer speech and can't use
it, that is going to (tick) me off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is something Ray Romano doesn't mind worrying about.

RECOVERY REMAINS DISTANT YEAR AFTER POWERFUL FLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 22)   (EDs: Photo available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ On a blueprint spread flat on his kitchen
table, one corner anchored by a half loaf of bread, Juan Pablo
Infante displayed the familiar design of a spacious new house he is
itching to build for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already bought another lot, on higher ground. All we're
waiting for is the money from the city,'' the burly carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to buy my lot there. They are offering me
$30,000, but it was a two-story house and I think it was worth
$67,000. We're still negotiating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Infantes, who now live in a government-issued mobile home,
were among several hundred Del Rio families who became homeless a
year ago when a killer flood ripped through the city's San Felipe
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people died and about 700 families were displaced when the
San Felipe Creek, fed by 20 inches of rain from Tropical Storm
Charley, burst its banks early on the night of Aug. 23, 1998, in
this border city 140 miles west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The flood caused $35 million in damage in Del Rio, the Val Verde
County seat with 35,000 residents, and triggered a massive and
extended relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost all the outside help is gone.
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary of the flood arrives, a small city staff
continues to grapple with the destruction and displacement wreaked
upon its oldest and poorest neighborhood, San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most daunting task is that we had a 100-year-old community
where people enjoyed a tremendous quality of life on a very low
income. They raised good kids. There was no crime, and then Mother
Nature ripped that neighborhood and hundreds of families from their
homes,'' said Thomas Nymann, the city's special projects director.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in some sense, we have to address the chemistry and sense
of community that was destroyed. To simply ask these residents to
go out and replace their housing, even if they had the means,
fragments the community,'' Nymann said.
</P>
<P>
   Housing remains the most pressing problem, and Del Rio has
formulated a program whereby homeowners in the flood plain can sell
their damaged homes to the city, which then demolishes them.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the structure is less than 50 percent damaged,
the homeowner is allowed to repair it and return there to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no condemnation involved. It's totally voluntary, and
very few have said they do not want to be involved,'' Nymann said.
</P>
<P>
   More than $5 million in state and federal money is available to
buy flood plain property in San Felipe. The open lots will later be
used for parks and green spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Houses in the flood plain that are more than 50 percent damaged
can be rebuilt only if they are elevated, up to a dozen feet or
more, above the 100-year flood line. But for most, such
modifications are impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Already 50 families are involved in the purchase program, and by
Sept. 8, they will all have received buyout offers, Nymann said. A
second buyout phase will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he continued, about 170 houses in San Felipe will be
demolished. About half are already gone, and last week, wrecking
crews were busy tearing down more.
</P>
<P>
   Although clear lots and new parks have replaced the storm debris
and wreckage the flood left behind, much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   In San Felipe, scores of empty, flood-ruined houses marked for
demolition by green spray paint, sit waiting, many looking just as
they did the day after the flood.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown's Plaza, the 90-year-old heart of the community, bright
new paint adorns the kiosk and iron benches, but in the evening,
the flood-ravaged buildings that surround the square loom above it
like old ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the businesses here, only the Texas Rural Legal Aid office
has reopened.
</P>
<P>
   And of the 134 homeless families who last year moved into
manufactured housing provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, 121, including the Infantes, remain in their borrowed
mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   All will have to leave by February. Some will buy the trailers
at reduced prices and move them to other sites. Others, like the
Infantes, will use the property buy-out money to build or buy
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the money will come from sale of property in San
Felipe, but so far, the city has yet to close its first flood
buy-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are desperate. We've had a lot of meetings but
nothing happens. The money was available almost a year ago,''
Infante said.
</P>
<P>
   City workers say the complex program is slowed by unavoidable
red tape, and because in many cases, appraisals must be made of
houses that no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of hurt and confusion, and we get a lot of
complaints. What hurts San Felipe is being illiterate to a lot of
the process,'' said Jesse Rodriguez, of the city's special projects
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have to understand that this is something that
never happened before and may not happen again for 500 years,''
Rodriguez said of the massive flood.

   Liz Elizalde, supervisor of mobile home operations for the Del
Rio Housing Authority, said ambivalence about selling and moving to
higher ground is typical of flood victims, particularly the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them had lived there all their lives and paid for
their homes, and at this point I see confusion as to what to do
next. They are having to make decisions they never thought they'd
have to make,'' Elizalde said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say, `FEMA can take back everything they've
given me. Just give me back my one-bedroom house.' That's the
paradigm they live in, and its hard to adjust,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizalde said that of the 121 people currently in mobile homes,
81 plan to buy them, 30 are repairing their flood-damaged homes,
and 10 intend to buy or build a home elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Memo ``Blondie'' Calderon, well-known pianist and owner of a
riverside restaurant by the same name, will soon be reopening,
after surviving yet another flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here 63 years. We had a flood in '35, another in
'47, '52, '63, '75 and then the big one last year,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the glistening new dining room is a 1928
Steinway baby grand piano, purchased in part with donations from
Blondie's fans to replace the one ruined by the flood.
</P>
<P>
   But, Blondie said, he got little help in refurbishing his
flood-prone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent $38,000, and I'm not through yet. It took a year
because I didn't get a loan. FEMA helped me a little bit with my
house but not here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `If you want to get me out of here, you'd better
bring some ammunition,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Del Rio Recovers, an interdenominational housing
relief agency, closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rehabilitated close to 40 homes which means 40 families are
back in their homes,'' said Denita Patuel, the director of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   But, Patuel said, long after everyone who was flooded out in San
Felipe has a place to live, the damage will endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult part is overcoming the loss of all their
belongings. The flood hit the lower-income sector of the
population, and whatever they had took them years to accumulate,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lost everything, how do you show your child what your
father looked like? The picture is gone. The child will no longer
know what the grandfather looked like. Those are things you can
never replace,'' she said.

JUSTICE FOR JIMMY THOMPSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In part, at least, government exists to help
people through periods of hard luck. Sometimes it works, and
sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes government just takes its own
sweet time.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Thompson knows all about that time thing. He began to
learn about it when he was working as a transmission mechanic. He
asked for a raise. Sometime later, he got into a disagreement with
a boss and ended up fired.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Thompson did the sensible thing. He applied for
unemployment benefits. The employer challenged his application.
Pretty soon, Jimmy Thompson found himself in front of a hearing
officer at New York State Labor Department headquarters in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   He described his firing. The employer testified that Jimmy
Thompson really had quit. Ultimately, the hearing officer found for
the employer. I've read the transcript of that hearing. The hearing
officer must have been from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Jimmy Thompson appealed his case. He figured he'd
gotten stiffed, and he had. He didn't know it at the time, but he
was only one of many New Yorkers the system was supposed to protect
who'd systematically been denied due process and a fair shot at
benefits by New York's woefully inept unemployment system.
</P>
<P>
   After Jimmy Thompson's case was decided, New York state
government settled a lawsuit filed by a coalition of labor groups.
The state admitted that it had failed to protect the rights of
hard-luck claimants like Jimmy Thompson. In a consent decree, the
state promised that it wouldn't do that any more. It also promised
it would reopen 50,000 unemployment cases, review them and rectify
its earlier mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   That consent decree was signed in 1983, two years after the
system had worked over Jimmy Thompson. The other day, Jimmy
Thompson's lawyer, Richard Silber, got a thing in the mail. The
state finally had gotten around to reversing its decision that
denied Jimmy Thompson his unemployment benefits on Dec. 3, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, he'll get this,` Richard Silber told me, ``but at what pay
rate? His 1981 pay? I don't know. I've never seen anything like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the New York State Labor Department says it's
now down to only 2,000 open cases, and it's trying hard to find the
people it shafted so long ago. The Pataki administration also
points out that this mess is one it inherited, that what went wrong
had gone wrong under the Democrats between 1977 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, though, is much consolation to Jimmy Thompson. He
was a man in his 40s when this thing happened to him. He had an
eighth grade education. He went into the hearing without a lawyer
because he couldn't afford one. And the system screwed him royally,
as it was screwing so many others at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He went through a long period of unemployment. He finally got
into construction work and ended up injured. Then he fought a long,
bitter battle with Workers Comp to get disability. Jimmy Thompson
is now 63, banged up, and his working life is over. He'll be happy
to take whatever money the system might give him, although I did
tell him that he ought to sue the system for some hefty interest,
if he can manage it.
</P>
<P>
   But he really could have used those unemployment payments back
then. The protection that government is supposed to offer working
people who fall on hard times would have come in mighty handy for
Jimmy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you was a worker,` Jimmy Thompson told me, ``you couldn't
say nothing ... But, you know, there's been a lot of times in life
where I didn't get no justice. This is only one. There you go.''

SACCO AND VANZETTI DIDN'T HAVE A FAIR TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Aug. 23 is the anniversary of the executions
of Sacco and Vanzetti, two of the most famous and controversial
defendants in 20th century history.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two years after their deaths in 1927, few people know
much about them other than their forever-linked names. But their
courtroom battle in 1921 was the first ``trial of the century,''
dividing the nation and sparking worldwide protests.
</P>
<P>
   And the issue raised by their case _ the right to a trial which
is completely and unquestionably fair _ remains critical.
</P>
<P>
   For the rule of law to have any real meaning, everyone,
regardless of origins or politics _ regardless, even, of guilt _
must be entitled to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how the affair convulsed first the nation and then
the world, the facts of the crime are simple. On April 15, 1920, in
South Braintree, Mass., a paymaster and a guard were gunned down
and killed. The motive was robbery: $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days later, anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo
Vanzetti were arrested. Both insisted _ and never wavered _ that
they were innocent. Both supplied alibis.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, both carried guns possibly linked to the
robbery, and both lied when questioned about their April 15
whereabouts. Both were indicted, tried and convicted, and both died
in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not have been worse. The years just after the
Russian Revolution saw anti-immigrant sentiment in the United
States merge with anti-Bolshevism. It produced widespread loathing
of foreigners, political radicals and, especially, foreign
radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists were particularly feared, thanks to an orgy of
homemade bombs, including one which nearly killed the U.S. attorney
general. When a crime like the one in South Braintree took place,
foreigners were immediate suspects. When the suspects turned out to
be foreign radicals, they barely seemed to deserve a trial.
</P>
<P>
   And they barely got one. The trial judge, Webster Thayer, had
recently tried _ and convicted _ Vanzetti for armed robbery; for
him to be predisposed against Vanzetti isn't surprising, but his
prejudice toward the entire defense team (``those damn fools''),
especially attorney Fred Moore (``that long-haired anarchist from
California''), resulted in blatant bias which badly hurt both
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it help that each motion to retry (eight in all) had to
go before Thayer himself, who _ after rejecting motions 2 through 6
_ called the defendants ``anarchistic bastards.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was flawed in other ways. Because of Sacco's and
Vanzetti's anarchism, it was assumed the trial was really about
politics; therefore, the defense team transformed their clients
into pulsing symbols of the oppressed Left.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy backfired, annoying the jurors, further
antagonizing Thayer and leaving problems with the prosecution's
case largely unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there was the Massachusetts state supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped by both legal technicalities and loyalty to a fellow
jurist, they supported all Thayer's rulings, however prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the rejected appeals, one was especially egregious.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, a convicted killer, Celestino Madeiros, sent Sacco a
note confessing to the murder. Madeiros was clearly an
untrustworthy creep but, since he had nothing to gain from
confessing, he seemed believable. The defense requested (again) a
new trial. But Thayer denied (again) their motion, saying Madeiros
was lying; the state supreme court (again) supported him. And that
almost was that.
</P>
<P>
   But not quite.
</P>
<P>
   In March '27, the case _ now a worldwide cause celebre _
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Angrily labeling the entire affair a perversion of justice whose
meaning went far beyond the trial itself, Harvard law professor
(and future Supreme Court Justice) Felix Frankfurter all but called
Thayer not only biased but stupid.
</P>
<P>
   His public fury, combined with the death sentence pronounced by
Thayer one month later, prompted the governor to assemble a
committee for one last look at the details of the case. Had the
trial been fair? This committee said ``Yes.'' So Sacco and Vanzetti
died.
</P>
<P>
   Are they guilty? Ballistic tests in the 1960s convinced some
people that Sacco was; others questioned the authenticity of the
bullet tested. The '80s saw new revelations, new books and no
definitive answer. The question of guilt may never be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the trial was biased. The judge
consistently favored the prosecution. Anarchism was presented first
as a character trait, then as a sign of guilt. Startling new
evidence was ignored. And the whole affair was conducted in an
atmosphere of rampant bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   If a trial is unfair but the guilty are punished, has justice
been done?
</P>
<P>
   Or is justice impossible without a fair trial?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are best left to legal philosophers. What we do
know is this: An unfair trial, whatever the guilt (or innocence) of
those being tried, strikes a heavy blow to our justice system _ so,
heavy that its results, in the end, are as socially costly as crime
itself.

<P>
   Since Arianna Huffington floated the idea of a Warren Beatty
presidential campaign last week, the actor's ambitions have been
the summer's most delectable political story. The jokes abound:
what Warren would do on the Oval Office carpet, whom President
Beatty would hire as his intern, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Beatty has stayed virtually silent, but his
friends are encouraging speculation: ``Warren has been consulting
with Democratic and Reform Party activists,'' they say. ``Warren is
taking this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Wife Annette Bening, they report, is enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The right thinks Beatty is a ridiculous, preening glory hound
who would preach limousine-liberal ideas. The left thinks he can
illuminate a grand populist vision with pure charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides mistakenly assume that because Beatty is an actor,
he, like Ronald Reagan, could flatter, seduce and inspire voters.
He charmed Natalie Wood, Madonna, Faye Dunaway, Julie Christie,
Isabelle Adjani, Diane Keaton, et al. Surely he could charm a few
million disaffected Democrats. (And even if the only people who
vote for Beatty are women who slept with him, he could make a
strong showing in the California primary.)
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has always been, in the words of film critic David
Thomson, ``a very uneasy actor.'' Beatty is too cool and distant to
be great on screen. He has made his mark on Hollywood more as a
producer and director, and it is this that explains his political
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The media snicker at the actor-politician, who presumes to speak
on the day's great issues. But consider Beatty as a self-made
businessman. Beatty sympathizers such as Huffington rightly ask why
Steve Forbes, who inherited his millions, is a serious candidate,
while Beatty is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has shown a ruthless, brilliant talent for manipulating
the politics of his industry. In Hollywood, where no one gets his
way all the time, Warren Beatty has got his way forever.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind chronicles how
Beatty parlayed the heartthrob status he'd won from 1961's
``Splendor in the Grass'' into a controlling position as a
producer. He almost single-handedly brought ``Bonnie and Clyde'' to
the screen in 1967 and made his fortune off it by negotiating a
contract for 40 percent of the gross.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, he bullied screenwriters and directors into making
``Shampoo'' and ``Heaven Can Wait'' his way. In 1981, during the
height of the Cold War, he persuaded Gulf &AMP; Western to pony up $25
million for ``Reds,'' a movie sympathetic to communism.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he got Columbia to spend the
then-preposterous figure of $40 million on ``Ishtar.'' It flopped,
but Beatty walked away unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he compelled Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox to
put up $35 million for ``Bulworth'' and to give him absolute
creative control over the film, even though 1) it was a political
movie and hence a lousy investment, and 2) it propounded ideas
Murdoch detests.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless stories about how Beatty charmed or threatened
or kneecapped this director or that executive into doing what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty brought those same skills to his second career as an
activist. Ron Brownstein, who chronicled Beatty's politicking in
``The Power and the Glitter,'' notes that Beatty may be the only
star in Hollywood history who preferred to participate in politics
from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty doesn't need the ego gratification of public politics. He
has been famous his entire adult life. In 1972, Beatty gave
speeches on George McGovern's behalf, but he disliked the
high-profile role. He was an awkward, embarrassed speaker. ``He
understood why the public is skeptical of a guy who makes $10
million a year talking about the class struggle,'' Brownstein says.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty excels at the backroom nitty-gritty. In 1972, he
aided McGovern most by organizing fund-raisers, even persuading
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel to reunite for a McGovern benefit. (If
that isn't great politics, nothing is.)
</P>
<P>
   When he advised Gary Hart in 1984 and 1988, Beatty remained in
the shadows, planning media and campaign strategies. ``Political
pros in that campaign thought he was a positive force,'' Brownstein
says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the few public statements Beatty has made about his potential
campaign, the most revealing is this: ``There has to be someone
better (than me).'' This is not modesty--Beatty has no modesty. It
is his cool and honest pragmatism. He recognizes that he'd be a
better operator than candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's supposed to be a liberal icon, Beatty lacks the
crystallizing vision of a Reagan. His politics are a muddle. It's
not happenstance that he is backed by such an odd assortment of
people, ranging from Republican populist Huffington to earnest
liberal Bill Moyers. Beatty is not cynical: He desperately believes
the political system is broken and needs fixing. He just seems
unable to explain how it's broken and how it should be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Beatty repeatedly chokes when asked for specific
political ideas. He seems vaguely to believe that there is too much
money in politics, corporations are too powerful, welfare reform
was wrong, and race is a big problem. He says he wants to conjure
up the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth,'' the closest thing to a Beatty political platform,
is a mess as political science--an incoherent, condescending slop
about the evils of lobbyists and the innate decency of black folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' is fabulous on day-to-day campaign tactics. This is
Beatty's curse: His political principles tell him to deplore
gamesmanship, but gamesmanship may be what he understands best.
Similarly, Beatty spends a lot of time savaging Washington
corruption, yet he cultivates friendships with folks such as Henry
Kissinger, Larry King, and John McLaughlin, Washington incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is meticulous, even anal. As an actor, he is famous for
demanding take after take till he's sure it's right.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars can control their images. Beatty can forbid
interviews, decline to answer questions, and refuse to appear in
public. He didn't speak to reporters from the late '70s till the
early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians must answer questions, take abuse, and keep
smiling. The first thing candidate Beatty would have to learn, says
Huffington, is ``to get comfortable with ridicule.'' It's not clear
that Beatty is willing to do that.
</P>
<P>
   He's too cautious. After all, he twice declined opportunities to
run for office in the '70s, when he was a much more credible
candidate than he is now. According to Brownstein, Beatty led the
polls in the 1974 race to succeed Reagan as California governor but
refused to run. And in 1976 Beatty resisted pleas to make a late
primary challenge to Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's flirtation with the presidential campaign may be a
canny political tactic. He doesn't really want to run, but perhaps
he can use the threat of a candidacy to make himself a
behind-the-scenes player, the guy who delivers the left to Al Gore
or Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Beatty turned down the opportunity to play
John F. Kennedy in a movie, then became a producer. This year,
Beatty may turn down the opportunity to play Robert F. Kennedy in a
campaign, then become a power broker.

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Since Arianna Huffington floated the idea of a Warren Beatty
presidential campaign last week, the actor's ambitions have been
the summer's most delectable political story. The jokes abound:
what Warren would do on the Oval Office carpet, whom President
Beatty would hire as his intern, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Beatty has stayed virtually silent, but his
friends are encouraging speculation: ``Warren has been consulting
with Democratic and Reform Party activists,'' they say. ``Warren is
taking this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Wife Annette Bening, they report, is enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The right thinks Beatty is a ridiculous, preening glory hound
who would preach limousine-liberal ideas. The left thinks he can
illuminate a grand populist vision with pure charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides mistakenly assume that because Beatty is an actor,
he, like Ronald Reagan, could flatter, seduce and inspire voters.
He charmed Natalie Wood, Madonna, Faye Dunaway, Julie Christie,
Isabelle Adjani, Diane Keaton, et al. Surely he could charm a few
million disaffected Democrats. (And even if the only people who
vote for Beatty are women who slept with him, he could make a
strong showing in the California primary.)
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty has always been, in the words of film critic David
Thomson, ``a very uneasy actor.'' Beatty is too cool and distant to
be great on screen. He has made his mark on Hollywood more as a
producer and director, and it is this that explains his political
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The media snicker at the actor-politician, who presumes to speak
on the day's great issues. But consider Beatty as a self-made
businessman. Beatty sympathizers such as Huffington rightly ask why
Steve Forbes, who inherited his millions, is a serious candidate,
while Beatty is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty has shown a ruthless, brilliant talent for manipulating
the politics of his industry. In Hollywood, where no one gets his
way all the time, Warren Beatty has got his way forever.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind chronicles how
Beatty parlayed the heartthrob status he'd won from 1961's
``Splendor in the Grass'' into a controlling position as a
producer. He almost single-handedly brought ``Bonnie and Clyde'' to
the screen in 1967 and made his fortune off it by negotiating a
contract for 40 percent of the gross.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, he bullied screenwriters and directors into making
``Shampoo'' and ``Heaven Can Wait'' his way. In 1981, during the
height of the Cold War, he persuaded Gulf &AMP; Western to pony up $25
million for ``Reds,'' a movie sympathetic to communism.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he got Columbia to spend the
then-preposterous figure of $40 million on ``Ishtar.'' It flopped,
but Beatty walked away unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he compelled Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox to
put up $35 million for ``Bulworth'' and to give him absolute
creative control over the film, even though 1) it was a political
movie and hence a lousy investment, and 2) it propounded ideas
Murdoch detests.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless stories about how Beatty charmed or threatened
or kneecapped this director or that executive into doing what he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty brought those same skills to his second career as an
activist. Ron Brownstein, who chronicled Beatty's politicking in
``The Power and the Glitter,'' notes that Beatty may be the only
star in Hollywood history who preferred to participate in politics
from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty doesn't need the ego gratification of public politics. He
has been famous his entire adult life. In 1972, Beatty gave
speeches on George McGovern's behalf, but he disliked the
high-profile role. He was an awkward, embarrassed speaker. ``He
understood why the public is skeptical of a guy who makes $10
million a year talking about the class struggle,'' Brownstein says.
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty excels at the backroom nitty-gritty. In 1972, he
aided McGovern most by organizing fund-raisers, even persuading
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel to reunite for a McGovern benefit. (If
that isn't great politics, nothing is.)
</P>
<P>
   When he advised Gary Hart in 1984 and 1988, Beatty remained in
the shadows, planning media and campaign strategies. ``Political
pros in that campaign thought he was a positive force,'' Brownstein
says.
</P>

LIKE HIS FILM, SOUTH AFRICAN TRIES TO UNDERSTAND HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRIS WORRELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the animated short film ``Felix in Exile,''
Felix Teitlebaum is a sensitive artist trapped in a country scarred
by tragedy and trauma. Made in 1994, just prior to South Africa's
first post-apartheid election, the film explores ``the condition of
someone trying to understand history,'' said the filmmaker, William
Kentridge.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Kentridge himself.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed white South African artist has devoted much of his
career to chronicling the horrors of apartheid and post-apartheid
life in his homeland. The artist, former actor, designer and
theater director has found international attention with his stark
animated portrayals of the country's troubled history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The films have to do with traces of the past in the present,''
he said in a recent telephone interview from his home in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Kentridge, who began making films a decade ago, uses a primitive
technique to create his films, which are typically four to eight
minutes in length. He draws and redraws each sketch in charcoal,
filming the state of each drawing as he goes, thus creating rough,
textured, flickering images that change and mutate, the traces of
which are plainly visible. The artist makes about 20 drawings for
each film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no animation training or skill,'' said Kentridge, who
noted that his style (which he sometimes refers to as
``stone-age'') ``developed organically.'' He started out filming
his drawings, just to record what they looked like as they evolved.
It didn't occur to him until later that he could put them together
to create moving images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animation has gotten really high-tech,'' said Katherine Myers
of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in Lenox. ``His
technique is hand-drawn. Not to say he's not sophisticated, but
it's much more raw. You see the hand of the artist much more. The
technique is very intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique is reflective of Kentridge's focus on the ``memory
and process'' involved in both politics and art. Kentridge was 6
years old when he first came across a set of photographs of the
1960 Sharpeville Massacre, during which the South African police
fired on a group of black demonstrators at the village of
Sharpeville, killing 67 and wounding 186. It was the first time
Kentridge realized that the world was not as he thought it was.
Since then, he has tried to recreate for audiences the experience
he had when he first saw those pictures that is, to get back to
that first sense of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's art in the service of social change,'' Myers said.
``There's a story to his films. They're not overtly political. They
are more subtle than that.''
</P>
<P>
   By focusing closely on the lives and inner struggles of several
characters, Kentridge's films aim to see the political through the
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Other than ``Felix in Exile,'' Kentridge's ``Stereoscope''
(1999) features another recurring character, Soho Eckstein, whom
Kentridge describes as ``the quintessential industrialist'' _
white, wealthy, pin-striped. As mobs of people protest in the
streets, Soho sits at his desk, guilt-ridden and weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The films are about his weaknesses as opposed to his strengths
his anxieties, his guilt,'' said Kentridge. As the name implies,
``Stereoscope'' explores ``the divided self.''
</P>
<P>
   ``History of the Main Complaint'' (1997) finds Soho comatose in
the hospital, with ``the body as a metaphor for the psyche,''
Kentridge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ubu Tells the Truth'' (1997) was gleaned from Kentridge's 1997
theater production ``Ubu and the Truth Commission,'' which
incorporated live actors, puppets and animation, and fashioned
after the title character in Alfred Jarry's trilogy of plays. The
film, which was a finalist for the Guggenheim Museum's Hugo Boss
Prize in 1998, features a mixture of animation and archival
material from apartheid history, including footage of the
Sharpeville massacre, the 1976 Soweto uprising and the recent
hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in South Africa during the last 30 years, politics was
so much a part of what was eaten and breathed that it would be
difficult not to be influenced by it,'' the artist said.
</P>
<P>
   Kentridge's work has been shown in Istanbul, Havana, Sydney and
Johannesburg, and, in this country, in Houston, New York, Santa Fe
and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his animation work, Kentridge, 44, has created
documentaries, full-length features and puppet productions. He is
at work on a new film titled ``Procession,'' which will be shown in
Turkey next month.

</P>
<P>
   If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of
all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't
pretend you forgot.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, be grateful that you have avoided the ``intra-oral
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little
gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television
magnifies your gums and the dinge of your smile.
</P>
<P>
   A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks
like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a
broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of
straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in
your mouth,'' says one recent victim of the camera. ``You can't
believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to
shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a
case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and
still prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While
they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities
during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their
revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by
half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because
they didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government funded dental-school
construction, spilling new dentists into a saturated market. Many
found themselves cleaning teeth for $10 an hour in mall clinics. In
1984, Forbes magazine forecast the end of the profession. Only a
few lonely dentists would survive to fill the few remaining
cavities, the last vestiges of a once-great civilization on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the number of dentists has jumped 20 percent, and the
average salary soared from $76,000 in 1987 to $124,000 in 1996.
What happened? In part, the oversupply of dentists and the
declining demand for fillings forced the profession to change.
Dentists had to become nicer and visits less unpleasant. The
Marathon Man has been replaced by Dr. Soothe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an
ass, patients would not come to you,'' says Dr. William Hartel, a
St. Louis dentist. Many dentists' offices let you don virtual
reality glasses and watch movies on them. Others offer massage
therapy and hot tubs. Does your dentist have a certificate of pain
management on her wall? I bet she does.
</P>
<P>
   The most important discovery dentists made was the endless
vanity of aging baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing now with the boomers who are the runners and
the joggers and the dieters, and they are very concerned with how
they look,'' says American Dental Association President Dr. Timothy
Rose. Since going to the dentist was no longer a necessary evil,
dentists made it an unnecessary pleasure. They allied themselves
with the self-improvement movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still go for the needs, for the cavity that has to get
filled, but more and more people ... come here to feel better about
themselves,'' says Dr. Stephen Friedman, a Maryland dentist.
</P>
<P>
   People used to be happy if they made it to old age with enough
choppers to chew. But boomers, lured by media images of the Great
American Smile, expect more. According to an ADA poll, the
percentage of people who are ``very satisfied'' with their teeth
has dropped from 57 percent to 46 percent in the past decade.
Dentists have learned to play on this vanity and anxiety,
encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but
attractive to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you went to a physician for a treatment for a
disease and he said you needed a nose job,'' says Dr. John Dodes,
author of Healthy Teeth: A User's Manual.
</P>
<P>
   To flog $500 teeth whitenings and multi-thousand dollar adult
orthodontic treatments, dentists run computer simulations of your
whitened, straightened teeth. Tooth color is measured on a scale
that starts at A1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dentist showed me these disgusting color charts and told
me, 'You're an A2 now, but by the time you want to get married you
are going to be an A4. And no one wants to marry an A4,''' says one
woman who got her teeth bleached.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists also prod patients to replace perfectly functional
gray-metal fillings with tooth-colored plastic ones and to dump
their solid gold crowns for white porcelain. Other dentists sell
the psychology of tooth appearance. One dentist specializing in
porcelain caps advises that male bosses with small teeth seem
``weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dentists dress up these cosmetic measures in medical scare
talk. A friend of mine just quit a dentist who was pressuring him
to whiten his teeth as a ``preventive measure.'' (To prevent what?
Yellow teeth?) Many dentists claim, without scientific evidence,
that the mercury in amalgam fillings is dangerous. They urge
patients to replace the excellent amalgam with plastic fillings at
four times the price.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists make a killing on bad breath--or ``halitosis,'' as they
prefer to call it. Breath clinics have sprouted up all over the
country and are heavily advertised on the Web. They terrify
patients with a ``halimeter,'' a new gadget that measures a nasty
smelling chemical called methyl mercaptan. Armed with the halimeter
proof, the dentist then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue
scrapers in front of the patient. Never mind that you can get the
same results for free with careful brushing and basic
tongue-scraping.
</P>
<P>
   The machine makes the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there is this machine that can document your
complaint and can put a number on it, it motivates a patient to
actually do something about it. But the treatments available now
are the same ones that have been available for 15 years,'' says
Hartel.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial dentists market this elective care with trained
aggression. Dental management organizations often require their
employees to recite a quasisales script guiding patients toward
profitable cosmetics. Ads in the Journal of the American Dental
Association and on the Web promote tapes and classes on marketing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   One person I know quit his dentist when he spied a pamphlet in
the office instructing the dentist in how to get his patients to
``trade up'' to more expensive treatment. The ADA's annual
conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as ``how to
move your patients to 'yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The industry calls this technique ``treatment acceptance,'' a
marvelous euphemism for parting you from your money. According to
the ADA's journal, this year's ADA conference will include an
all-day ``Treatment Acceptance'' seminar ``for the dental team that
is fed up with patients accepting only what insurance covers or
asking for alternative cheaper treatment plans. Involve the entire
team in creating the strategies for patients to accept optimum
care.''
</P>
<P>
   This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that it isn't
in other medicine because of the profession's brutal economics.
Dental insurance covers only 44 percent of Americans (compared to
more than 80 percent for health insurance), and provides skimpy
coverage for those who do have it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, patients pay most dental costs--about 60 percent of
them--out of their own pockets. Dental care is just another way to
spend discretionary income, competing with a vacation or a new car.
Dentists have to make patients want adult orthodontics in a way
physicians don't have to make patients want a quadruple bypass.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to dismiss the whole industry as a scam,
particularly when dentists keep coming up with new ailments such as
bruxism (teeth grinding), periodontal disease, malocclusion (bad
bite), and microcracks. But these ailments are real, and our
awareness of them shows how far dentistry has come. A generation
ago, dentists filled teeth and cast dentures because that's all
they knew. Decay killed so many teeth that fancier problems seldom
arose. Since then, researchers have studied bonding, implants, and
periodontal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists can now make crowns that last forever, bridges that
stay anchored, dentures that behave almost like real teeth. A
generation ago, implants were a joke. Today's implants, affixed to
your jawbone by a titanium screw, can hold for the rest of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned how bacteria can build up in gaps in the
gum, cause infection, weaken the jawbone, and eventually murder
teeth. New research links these periodontal bacteria to heart
disease, diabetes, low birth-weight babies, and other nastiness
you'd expect from bacteria running wild in the bloodstream. This is
why your dentist hectors you to rubber-tip your gums, brush with a
superconcentrated fluoride toothpaste, and wear a night guard to
control your bruxing (which loosens teeth, opening pockets between
teeth and gum, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   It's also why your dentist may bully you into gum surgery. It
all seems unpleasant and slightly absurd--the night guard is ``an
excellent form of birth control,'' as one wearer puts it--but the
alternative is losing your teeth at 40, getting dentures, and
gumming your food. Dentistry is a hassle now because it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think back a couple of generations, it was considered
inevitable that people would lose their teeth when they reached
midlife. Around 40 or 45, you would have your teeth taken out.
Periodontal disease was not understood, and decay was rampant. But
now teeth are resistant to decay and are lasting a lifetime. I have
gone in 18 years from learning how to make dentures and thinking it
is OK for people to lose teeth to being appalled if anyone loses
teeth. It is a failure,'' says Dr. Judith Penski, my own fabulous
D.C. dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the irony of dentistry's comeback: Just as
patients love the dental care they should suspect, they resent the
care they should appreciate. Aesthetic dentistry is the most
profitable segment of the business because it is an easy sell. Put
a camera in your mouth and you'll want whiter teeth, too. It is
much harder to convince someone to poke her gums every night with a
piece of rubber, to sleep with a choking plastic tooth guard, and
to undergo four surgeries to fix a gum flap, all for a benefit that
is decades away.
</P>
<P>
   The very success of dentistry has raised expectations so high
that patients now object to any inconvenience. Americans under 60
believe keeping all their teeth is an entitlement: Telling them
they need gum surgery to preserve their teeth makes them angry, not
grateful--even though those teeth would have been goners 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I surveyed 100 friends and acquaintances about their dental
complaints, few bitched about cosmetic dentistry that was foisted
on them. They like their whiter, straighter teeth. No, they griped
about the medically advisable treatments that their dentists
prescribed, especially gum surgeries and mouth guards.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor dentist who abjures cosmetic dentistry but
vigorously protects patients' teeth. Patients don't like
periodontal treatment, so they suspect it's a rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   This could not be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dentists are aware of providing what patients want,'' says
Hartel. ``I had a woman come in with a terrible toothache. She
needed a root canal, but she did not want it. But she did want her
teeth bleached, and she paid cash for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the triumph of American dentists: If they can't sell you
what you need, they'll sell you what you want.

</P>
<P>
   If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of
all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't
pretend you forgot.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, be grateful that you have avoided the ``intra-oral
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little
gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television
magnifies your gums and the dinge of your smile.
</P>
<P>
   A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks
like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a
broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of
straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in
your mouth,'' says one recent victim of the camera. ``You can't
believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to
shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a
case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and
still prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While
they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities
during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their
revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by
half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because
they didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government funded dental-school
construction, spilling new dentists into a saturated market. Many
found themselves cleaning teeth for $10 an hour in mall clinics. In
1984, Forbes magazine forecast the end of the profession. Only a
few lonely dentists would survive to fill the few remaining
cavities, the last vestiges of a once-great civilization on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the number of dentists has jumped 20 percent, and the
average salary soared from $76,000 in 1987 to $124,000 in 1996.
What happened? In part, the oversupply of dentists and the
declining demand for fillings forced the profession to change.
Dentists had to become nicer and visits less unpleasant. The
Marathon Man has been replaced by Dr. Soothe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an
ass, patients would not come to you,'' says Dr. William Hartel, a
St. Louis dentist. Many dentists' offices let you don virtual
reality glasses and watch movies on them. Others offer massage
therapy and hot tubs. Does your dentist have a certificate of pain
management on her wall? I bet she does.
</P>
<P>
   The most important discovery dentists made was the endless
vanity of aging baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing now with the boomers who are the runners and
the joggers and the dieters, and they are very concerned with how
they look,'' says American Dental Association President Dr. Timothy
Rose. Since going to the dentist was no longer a necessary evil,
dentists made it an unnecessary pleasure. They allied themselves
with the self-improvement movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still go for the needs, for the cavity that has to get
filled, but more and more people ... come here to feel better about
themselves,'' says Dr. Stephen Friedman, a Maryland dentist.
</P>
<P>
   People used to be happy if they made it to old age with enough
choppers to chew. But boomers, lured by media images of the Great
American Smile, expect more. According to an ADA poll, the
percentage of people who are ``very satisfied'' with their teeth
has dropped from 57 percent to 46 percent in the past decade.
Dentists have learned to play on this vanity and anxiety,
encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but
attractive to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you went to a physician for a treatment for a
disease and he said you needed a nose job,'' says Dr. John Dodes,
author of Healthy Teeth: A User's Manual.
</P>
<P>
   To flog $500 teeth whitenings and multi-thousand dollar adult
orthodontic treatments, dentists run computer simulations of your
whitened, straightened teeth. Tooth color is measured on a scale
that starts at A1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dentist showed me these disgusting color charts and told
me, 'You're an A2 now, but by the time you want to get married you
are going to be an A4. And no one wants to marry an A4,''' says one
woman who got her teeth bleached.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists also prod patients to replace perfectly functional
gray-metal fillings with tooth-colored plastic ones and to dump
their solid gold crowns for white porcelain. Other dentists sell
the psychology of tooth appearance. One dentist specializing in
porcelain caps advises that male bosses with small teeth seem
``weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dentists dress up these cosmetic measures in medical scare
talk. A friend of mine just quit a dentist who was pressuring him
to whiten his teeth as a ``preventive measure.'' (To prevent what?
Yellow teeth?) Many dentists claim, without scientific evidence,
that the mercury in amalgam fillings is dangerous. They urge
patients to replace the excellent amalgam with plastic fillings at
four times the price.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists make a killing on bad breath--or ``halitosis,'' as they
prefer to call it. Breath clinics have sprouted up all over the
country and are heavily advertised on the Web. They terrify
patients with a ``halimeter,'' a new gadget that measures a nasty
smelling chemical called methyl mercaptan. Armed with the halimeter
proof, the dentist then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue
scrapers in front of the patient. Never mind that you can get the
same results for free with careful brushing and basic
tongue-scraping.
</P>
<P>
   The machine makes the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there is this machine that can document your
complaint and can put a number on it, it motivates a patient to
actually do something about it. But the treatments available now
are the same ones that have been available for 15 years,'' says
Hartel.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial dentists market this elective care with trained
aggression. Dental management organizations often require their
employees to recite a quasisales script guiding patients toward
profitable cosmetics. Ads in the Journal of the American Dental
Association and on the Web promote tapes and classes on marketing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   One person I know quit his dentist when he spied a pamphlet in
the office instructing the dentist in how to get his patients to
``trade up'' to more expensive treatment. The ADA's annual
conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as ``how to
move your patients to 'yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The industry calls this technique ``treatment acceptance,'' a
marvelous euphemism for parting you from your money. According to
the ADA's journal, this year's ADA conference will include an
all-day ``Treatment Acceptance'' seminar ``for the dental team that
is fed up with patients accepting only what insurance covers or
asking for alternative cheaper treatment plans. Involve the entire
team in creating the strategies for patients to accept optimum
care.''
</P>
<P>
   This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that it isn't
in other medicine because of the profession's brutal economics.
Dental insurance covers only 44 percent of Americans (compared to
more than 80 percent for health insurance), and provides skimpy
coverage for those who do have it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, patients pay most dental costs--about 60 percent of
them--out of their own pockets. Dental care is just another way to
spend discretionary income, competing with a vacation or a new car.
Dentists have to make patients want adult orthodontics in a way
physicians don't have to make patients want a quadruple bypass.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to dismiss the whole industry as a scam,
particularly when dentists keep coming up with new ailments such as
bruxism (teeth grinding), periodontal disease, malocclusion (bad
bite), and microcracks. But these ailments are real, and our
awareness of them shows how far dentistry has come. A generation
ago, dentists filled teeth and cast dentures because that's all
they knew. Decay killed so many teeth that fancier problems seldom
arose. Since then, researchers have studied bonding, implants, and
periodontal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists can now make crowns that last forever, bridges that
stay anchored, dentures that behave almost like real teeth. A
generation ago, implants were a joke. Today's implants, affixed to
your jawbone by a titanium screw, can hold for the rest of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned how bacteria can build up in gaps in the
gum, cause infection, weaken the jawbone, and eventually murder
teeth. New research links these periodontal bacteria to heart
disease, diabetes, low birth-weight babies, and other nastiness
you'd expect from bacteria running wild in the bloodstream. This is
why your dentist hectors you to rubber-tip your gums, brush with a
superconcentrated fluoride toothpaste, and wear a night guard to
control your bruxing (which loosens teeth, opening pockets between
teeth and gum, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   It's also why your dentist may bully you into gum surgery. It
all seems unpleasant and slightly absurd--the night guard is ``an
excellent form of birth control,'' as one wearer puts it--but the
alternative is losing your teeth at 40, getting dentures, and
gumming your food. Dentistry is a hassle now because it works.

THE ADVENTURES OF ADOLESCENT WHIMSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the big highs of Tod Williams' ``The Adventures of
Sebastian Cole'' is the way its hero with the oily black locks
never talks to the camera. He never shoots us a sideways glance or
addresses his audience in a voice-over that would presume to tell
you everything a lesser filmmaker was too inept to show you.
</P>
<P>
   More ``Rushmore's'' Max Fischer than Ferris Bueller, Sebastian
Cole (Adrian Grenier) is an underachieving high school junior
trying to graduate early so he can leave his upstate New York
microcosm.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to abandon it but keeps returning like it's
some ultra-vivid primal scene. He doesn't need to talk to us
because his charming delinquency speaks for itself. If there's
anything self-conscious about Williams' 17-year-old creation,
Sebastian Cole, it's that he lives life as if it were truth 24
frames per second, all cinema all the time. But he's neither the
insouciant camcorder brat of his Reagan-era times nor the
media-ravaged cynic that would follow them. Rather, Sebastian is a
more atavistic strain of disaffected youth, one who feels like he's
been lifted from the Louis Malle sketchbook.
</P>
<P>
   He's aimless, lonely but searching for some kind of
magnificence, even if it's just in something as evanescent and
dastardly as laying a smacker on his girlfriend's best friend
(Merit Weaver) in the rush of having just done whippits with her;
or something as quasi-valiant as rescuing a part-time prostitute
from her lazy pimp called Chinatown (Rory Cochrane).
</P>
<P>
   Williams' is a remarkable debut that instantly conjures Hal
Hartley in its mild deadpan stylings. But there's a heart beating
under all the pallor, and where Hartley manufactures irony,
Williams discovers it as if its participation in his movie was
completely out of his hands. It's a talent that director Wes
Anderson and his co-writer Owen Wilson have in spades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sebastian'' also has in Grenier and Clark Gregg as Sebastian's
stepfather, Hank, a poignant duo reminiscent of the rapport Jason
Schwartzman had with Bill Murray in Anderson and Wilson's better
structured, more adventurous ``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Early, Williams' script has difficulty finding its footing in
how best to tell Sebastian's story. He walks awkwardly into Hank's
disclosure that he intends to become a transsexual. It's an
announcement that sends Sebastian's mother (Margaret Colin) packing
back to her native England and lands his sister (Marni Lustig) on
the back of her boyfriend's (Gabriel Macht) bike headed for her
freshman year at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   It's Sebastian who remains close to Hank, forging a filial bond
with him more substantial than the one he has with his biological
father (John Shea). In an auspicious, affecting performance,
Grenier walks the fine line between obnoxiousness and congeniality,
pretentiousness and endearment. The 23-year-old has the face of a
teen-age Peter Gallagher with the mop-top hair and self-destructive
restlessness of an Oasis' Gallagher brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has Sebastian serving as his object of whimsy,
10-speeding through the school halls in a ski mask, uselessly
chasing his school bus as Flock of Seagulls' ``I Ran'' races over
the soundtrack, attempting to graduate by filling his phys ed
requirement. Sebastian does this with a demonstration of a
proficiency in karate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautifully stupid scene stripped of soundtrack noise and
filled with only the sound of Grenier's sputtered ``hi-yas'' as he
crashes to the gym mats and an undistinguished panel of P.E.
teachers look on in relative astonishment, blinded by the organic
marvel of the moment in all its clumsy glory.

IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN, `MRS. TINGLE' FAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably won't see a more pathetic sight this year than
Helen Mirren, wrists strapped to each end of a headboard, splayed
on the mattress as though she were the general's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But Mirren's torturers aren't the frat boys of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   They're a trio of high school seniors who've taken their
vengeance too far in ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' an infuriatingly
indulgent piffle of adolescent wish-fulfillment hellbent on taking
its own vengeance too far. Freeze-frame on that image of a
relatively helpless Mirren, for a sec. It's courtesy of Kevin
Williamson, the 35-year-old teen-man credited for ushering in the
capitalist deluge/youthquake called Teensploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood and newsweeklies swarmed Williamson as if he'd
invented the cynical overstimulated teen-ager; he just gave it some
cliches to bust. Since Williamson materialized as a screenwriter in
1996 from the seemingly thin air of a moribund slasher genre with
``Scream,'' it was only a matter of commercial breaks until the
``Dawson's Creek'' creator tried to bust a movie of his own. When
word came that his directorial debut was to be ``Killing Mrs.
Tingle,'' a thriller he'd written about three students who take
their vicious history teacher hostage until she mellows, the
potential product had the suitable sting of catharsis. Who hasn't
fantasized about making a draconian teacher repent?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was five or six high-school blood baths, seven
``Dawson's'' knockoffs and one rain-checked ``Buffy'' season finale
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever felt conceptually bracing about ``Mrs. Tingle'' 18
months ago is now grist for Pop Culture Court. ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle'' still has three 12th-graders holding a grumpy teacher
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   But Williamson has written this thing with so much worship for
his 25-and-below audience that he's incapable of giving an adult
something edgewise to counter his dangerous
``teens-are-everything'' sycophancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Tingle'' is filled with enough post-grunge Prozac pop on
the soundtrack and sardonic lines delivered in a single breath to
choke VJ Carson Daly and a ``Party of Five'' cast member. (``You're
on the wrong side of glib, Mrs. Tingle,'' warns co-captor and ``7th
Heaven'' dreamboat Barry Watson as the dumb but unnaturally
articulate boozer.)
</P>
<P>
   Williamson has no idea what to do with himself here, happy to
let his cooler-than-you cast run amok in his riskless, conceited,
half-conceived and misguided comic-thriller. Trapped in a fun house
of incidental self-parody, he can't even make entertaining kitsch
of Molly Ringwald in a small part as a Mrs. Tingle sub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Tingle'' is so afraid of disappointing its audience that
it requires its three leads to do less than they do on their shows
_ or in co-captor Marisa Coughlan's case, will do; Williamson made
her the star of post-teen-age ``Wasteland.'' But there's a certain
irresponsibility in crafting a clan of mini-heckraisers with zero
functional intelligence, marginalized psychologies and the
emotional depth of a soap dish that makes ``My So-Called Life''
look positively avant-garde and ``Kids'' seem like the apocalyptic
last testament.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson is the youngest grown-up in Hollywood trying to
parlay memories of adolescence into billions of dollars, showing
them in a retail mirror _ warped to appear skinnier, hotter, more
willing to spend. And in the wake of the casualties from one
ruptured vessel in the Heartland to the next, Miramax (via its
Dimension Films) even decided to step down from ``killing'' Mrs.
Tingle to just ``teaching'' the old bird a lesson. But what exactly
has she learned? Namely, that it doesn't pay to be an authority
figure _ especially when you are, as Mrs. Tingle is, sound enough
of mind to be disgusted with the lot of trendsetters and
ne'er-do-well Abercrombie shoppers to whom you've been assigned to
teach 12th-grade English. Mrs. Tingle seems to have honed her
student-body-wide contempt on one innocent little looker named
Leigh Anne Watson (``Dawson's'' Katie Holmes).
</P>
<P>
   Williamson wants you to believe that a) Mrs. Tingle is the
teacher from hell and b) she's preying on Leigh Ann because Leigh
Ann lives in a smaller house than her friends and has a disgraceful
waitress mom (Lesley Anne Warren) who dozes off in front of the
television every night. Neither of these proves to be accurate,
which brings us back to Mirren being tied to that bed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tingle's been strapped there for having caught Leigh Ann
with Jolynn (Coughlan) and Luke (Watson), in the gymnasium holding
a copy of her final exam _ a test she needs to ace if she's gonna
win the only scholarship that'll get ``Mommie's little writer'' out
of her podunk suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Mirren plays Eve Tingle in an Anjelica
Huston-as-Morticia-Addams funk, all arched eyebrows,
elongated-uninflected phrasings and the hint that she might be a
little bit kinky. But because Williamson's most developed character
is the one he presents of himself to the media, it's up to Mirren
to figure exactly what to do with her character. Her verdict is
that she can find nary a reason to play her as a monster, so she
tries making her an interesting hostage, smarter than, but
vulnerable to her captors.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment you feel for her is edible as she watches
Coughlan do an ``Exorcist'' impersonation in a scene that is
nothing more than a glamorized outtake _ most of the film feels
assembled this way _ that Coughlan beats you into laughing at.
Mirren just rots there in Williamson's wasteland, seemingly wishing
she were in a movie revolution-minded enough to let a teacher knock
off her pupils.

   SEATTLE _ Summer day camp for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Fun, fun, fun ...
</P>
<P>
   ... NOT!
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: those off-key counselors crooning corny
clap-along songs; the arts and crafts sessions of scratch pads and
broken Crayolas; and games so boring that time seriously fails to
fly.
</P>
<P>
   But a different picture of day camp is unfolding at The
Evergreen School in north Seattle, where the annual rite of
childhood summer is undergoing a state-of-the-art makeover,
courtesy of billionaire Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are soaking up art _ from music and drama to film and
sculpture _ while working alongside master artists and counselors
who nurture budding talent and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The campers _ between the ages of 8 and 14 _ also are exposed to
technology during the two-week sessions, which gives them a strong
sense of how science relates to art.
</P>
<P>
   Interested in computers? Whisk over and learn animation and Web
design. Like music? Then create a CD or write a musical score.
Enjoy movies? Make a documentary. Prefer the stage? Act. Got stage
fright?
</P>
<P>
   Bone up on backstage production.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these camp projects, surprise guests drop by and
share slices of their personal lives. Now in its second year, the
camp's current and past visitors have included jazz vocalist
Ernestine Anderson, glass artist Dale Chihuly, actor Tom Skerritt,
members of the rock band Presidents of The United States of America
and even, as one young camper put it, ``that guy who did the
special effects for `Jurassic Park.' What's his name again?''
</P>
<P>
   Call it day camp for the next millennium, though its official
name is the Experience Arts Camp. The program is part community
outreach, part educational extension of Allen's Experience Music
Project, the $100 million-plus interactive multimedia and learning
museum that will open next spring at the Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   In camp-speak, the program, which ends its second summer this
week, could very well be dubbed: ``Camp Follow Your Bliss.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because everyone - from camp organizers to counselors to
esteemed visitors - echo a common belief that bright, young people,
if given a little guidance and responsibility, should be allowed to
roam vast artistic pastures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about giving kids a great sense of their potential by
exposing them to opportunities they may have never had before,''
says Zoe Melendez, special projects manager for Experience Arts
Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a practicing artist who is successful and give
kids a chance to work with them, that connection is profound,'' she
says, adding, ``Kids will push beyond what they thought they could
ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the young campers are experiencing a creative
blossoming. One father said his daughter, after hearing Anderson
last week, rushed home on wings of inspiration and wrote a song.
</P>
<P>
   Treaudain Christian, an unfailingly polite camp participant who
wears an oversize Sonics T-shirt, tells his mother and counselors
that he wants to be an actor. No. Playwright. No, wait. . . . His
mind seems to change each day because, well, he is encountering new
things that are attention- grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, Treaudain digs the arts; his mother, Angye
Alexander, who volunteers at the camp, appreciates his zeal. She
says she is pleased that campers find kinship over the course of
the two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these kids, before they come here, believe they are
the only one who keeps a journal,'' Alexander says, watching
children play a day-camp staple - kickball - during a lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think, `Nobody else is like me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are 80 children enrolled in this year's second two-week
session geared to ages 11 to 14. The session held earlier this
summer had the same number but was designed for those between 8 and
12. (The age groupings are created primarily to accommodate
different maturity levels among the kids, who fill out an
application for the program.)
</P>
<P>
   The camp costs $575 a session, but 30 percent of the campers
qualify for scholarships that are funded through private donations.
Melendez says the cost of the non-profit camp is comparable to
other day camps, and is far below the actual cost of what it takes
to put on the program. The camp draws high-caliber teachers and
accomplished guest speakers, who are paid a nominal fee. And costs
are incurred on field trips to artists' workshops and museums.
</P>
<P>
   Base camp this summer is Evergreen, a private school the camp is
renting because it is quasi-urban, quasi-pastoral and all-round
conducive to the artistic learning that is at the program's core.
Its first year was conducted at the University Child Development
School in the University District.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the value of the program is measured by the campers.
Let's take a look:
</P>
<P>
   Inside a red, wood-sided structure 18 campers are hanging on
every note luffing from the harmonica of Lee Oskar. Their ears
never heard Oskar's musical wizardry in the 1970s when his tunes
helped to define the sound of War, the funkadelic band.

FARMERS FACE CRITICAL LOSSES IN YEAR OF WITHERING HARVEST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   POMEROY, Wash. _ It is hot as the Devil's kitchen in the fields
of this year's failed wheat crop. A searing wind kicks up dust from
the roads and drags it into the empty blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cox sways from side to side in his dull-silver combine,
coming up a hill and gazing out at a field of spring wheat that is
much thinner than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's almost-black eyes do a flat, sad stare under his blue ball
cap as he looks out and wonders how he's going to pay bills this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The dryland farmers _ those who farm without benefit of
irrigation from the Oregon border straight up to the Okanogan
Valley and from the Columbia River to the Idaho border _ are
getting hammered this summer. Nowhere is the wheat crop worse than
in the southeastern pocket of the state, in Garfield, Franklin,
Walla Walla and Whitman counties.
</P>
<P>
   In an age where small American farms are struggling to survive,
a season like this summer could bring many Washington farms to
their end.
</P>
<P>
   When it costs $3.29 to produce a bushel of wheat but farmers can
get only $3.12 when they sell, there's not much to believe in these
days, except that maybe next year will be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is mortgaged,'' Cox says. ``We had equity in the
mid-'80s, we were on our way to building a retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   The same heat that baked the country and caused 285 deaths in
the East has been equally fierce in Washington's breadbasket this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the rich, golden brown they should be, wheat fields
are a hard, sun-scorched brown or bleached-out white, like the
field Cox is combining.
</P>
<P>
   This is farming, and bad years are expected.
</P>
<P>
   But no one ever expected things to get this bad _ a result of
poor yields, the federal government using wheat as a bargaining
chip in foreign relations and a glut of wheat producing nations on
the world market.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Gov. Gary Locke asked the federal government to
declare the southeastern part of the state a disaster area to get
federal relief funds; the federal government has yet to respond.
Wheat farmers are hoping to meet with Sen. Slade Gorton and Rep.
George Nethercutt, both Washington Republicans, to plead their case
for disaster relief subsidies and low-interest loans to help them
get through until next year and, hopefully, a better crop.
</P>
<P>
   All of the meetings are to help farmers like Cox, who saw his
fields produce 40 bushels per acre of winter wheat this year, when
their average proven yield is 54 bushels per acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter wheat was our best crop; spring wheat looks like it
will be 50 percent off the average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at our overall production off the farm, this is the
worst I've seen in 22 years,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   It started last winter, which was mild until the week before
Christmas. Then the temperature plummeted below zero and the ground
froze, followed by a heavy snow which melted in a warm flash before
it had a chance to seep into the ground. Spring was cold and wet,
and the weather delayed planting a week to 10 days for most
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the summer, where no rain fell. Or little enough rain
that it didn't make the least bit of difference.
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm would blow in and wet the soil, then the winds
would pick up to 30 mph and two hours later there wouldn't be a
drop of moisture left on the field or in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the rains came. Last week. When area farmers were
trying to get their wheat in.
</P>
<P>
   In short, everything that could go wrong this year has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I do real well with the weather,'' Cox says.
``Sometimes I don't. The other morning it was raining and I was so
despondent about it that I had to go off and be by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The book of troubles
</P>
<P>
   Every setback in the weather is recorded in black and white. The
farmers write down rainfall, crop yield, crop conditions _ all the
information in longhand in little black books with rubber bands
around them or in big loose-leaf notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The books this year all read the same, no matter where in
southeastern Washington the farmers were: more rain fell the week
of Aug. 9 than fell the entire months of June and July.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Neff, who dryland farms in Franklin County near Pasco, can
look in his little black book and see that June brought one-tenth
of an inch of rainfall, July fourteen-hundredths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Garfield County, David Ruark can look in a
folder of rumpled papers and see that .92 inches fell in June and
.13 inches came down in July.
</P>
<P>
   Or he can look at the spring barley in his fields and see that
this year he'll get only 60 percent of what he expected, the rest
lost to drought.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Koller lives about 15 miles east of Ruark, north of
Pomeroy, and his weather book is about as depressing as the crop
yield.
</P>
<P>
   The year has not been good for Koller, his wife and two sons.
Winter wheat was off between 10 percent and 30 percent, depending
on the field it was harvested from.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rains have rendered him unable to get into the fields
to see what his spring crop is like.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon found him squatting in one of his fields
overlooking the Snake River, testing a sample and finding it too
wet. Wet wheat doesn't play well with the granaries, who find that
it molds and gets hot in the silos when it comes in with a moisture
content of above 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The granaries will dock a farmer for anything. Hot weather can
make wheat too light, and that's worth a few cents per bushel off.
Wet weather can cause mold, and that, too, pushes prices down a few
cents per bushel. Getting the grain in at the right time is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   But with this year's crop, there may not be a right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my neighbors cut into his wheat the other day to make a
road,'' Koller says. ``And he said (the wheat) wasn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   Koller has been holding out harvesting his spring crop, hoping
it dries out enough to be salvageable. He estimates it will be 30
percent to 40 percent off the average.
</P>
<P>
   His family has been farming the area since the early 1900s;
Koller lives in a house his great-uncle built in 1916. In August
1973, he saw wheat selling for $3.47 a bushel in Portland, Ore.,
where most of the area's grains go.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, wheat was selling for $3.12 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a good year would make up for a bad year,''
Koller says, sitting in a kitchen decorated with Washington State
University paraphernalia and school drawings from his kids. ``Now
it's like every bad year takes two years just to get out of.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to be able to have a down year and it wouldn't bother
you so much. Now, you need the crops on a yearly basis. It seems
like we're farming year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   But they know the band's songs, including ``Low Rider'' and
``The Cisco Kid,'' either because they've looked it up on the
Internet or gotten tips from their parents. When Oskar stops
playing and talking, the kids swarm him as if he were a Beastie
Boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say thank you,'' says 13-year-old Michael Nunes
of Seattle. ``Some of your theories about music were really, really
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Oskar, slightly embarrassed, later explains the message he hoped
to impress upon the kids: ``It's not about the scales and the
lessons and the theory - those are just tools,'' the 51-year-old
Redmond resident says. ``But it takes people to make music.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Ennis, a songwriter for the rock band Heart and a master
artist for the music class, adds: ``Some kids have never just
opened up and played,'' she says. ``Once these young people learn
there is no wrong way to do anything, it opens up their world of
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   In an adjacent room, Nancy, a pretty girl with long hair and big
dimples, is touching up glass artwork that is real old school. She
is employing grisaille, a method dating back to the medieval period
that involves etching intricate leadwork on the back of a glass
sculpture. After the glass is fired and painted, the result is a
milky iridescence of colors that is vibrant when light passes
through the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy gets bold. She recommends that a buddy use blue for her
glass plate. Never mind that Nancy is an 11-year-old camper and the
buddy she is advising is Cathy Chase, an accomplished artist and
class teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, art is like my life,'' Nancy says, drawing hoots of
praise from Chase and Cappy Thompson, the course's master artist,
who appreciate Nancy's moxie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy God gave me this talent,'' Nancy coos, bounding
away with her left shoelace untied.
</P>
<P>
   Across the school's campus, the students in the film class are
hatching an idea to put together a final documentary loosely
paralleling ``The Blair Witch Project'' horror flick.
</P>
<P>
   But in their version, a group of students making a documentary
are uncertain of what they are searching for; as of earlier this
week, the idea was still - to borrow the Hollywood parlance - in
development.
</P>
<P>
   The campers' notions about film are less embryonic. At times
they sound as if they go to the University of Southern California
film school, speaking about story arcs and dramatic tension, their
knowledge greatly expanded after they spend time with Roger
Baerwolf, a producer on the movie ``Smoke Signals,'' Craig Barr
(the person who handled the mechanical special effects for the
tyrannosaurus rex in ``Jurassic Park'') and their classroom
teacher, Brad Tollefson, a digital filmmaker who lives in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson has done plenty to give the kids a crash course in
film. They've discussed film theory. Written on a board are the
words ``wide angle,'' ``low,'' ``depth,'' ``opposite'' - terms for
camera positions and use. And there is a quote: ``A safe filmmaker
lives long enough to become a . . .'' with two blanks at the end of
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``GREAT filmmaker!!!'' a couple of kids sound off, thankfully
filling in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned the real definition of drama,'' 13-year-old Lacey
Stuart explains, ``is when you have to provoke actors with a
situation that involves, um, conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, crisis!'' cuts in Kimberly Manning, an aspiring magazine
editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, crisis,'' Lacey corrects, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly adds: ``We also learned a saying about plots in movies:
`You want to chase an actor up a tree, throw rocks up at him for an
hour and bring him back down. Then the audience will be
interested'.''
</P>
<P>
   She eyes a reporter writing in a notebook. ``Are we overwhelming
you with all of this information?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughs.
</P>
<P>
   When the students leave Experience Arts Camp, each will have
completed a project. In Nancy's case that means a cool-looking
glass sculpture. For other campers there will be CDs, self-designed
Web pages, a short play they will perform, or a song or short film.
</P>
<P>
   But Alycia Long Allen, camp director, said the most important
aspect of the kids' experience is the process of learning, not the
product. (And camp instructors, many of whom took part because they
love children, say they learned from the kids!)
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Poitier, who has been teaching the students who chose to
focus on drama, sums it up this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``What we teach is passion!'' says Poitier, who delayed
development of a television sitcom project in the Bahamas because
she was so enthusiastic about being a part of the camp. ``They are
free to express themselves. No inhibitions, no qualms.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore her point, Poitier - daughter of actor Sidney
Poitier - mentions a recent class in which, during just three
hours, campers learned a whole play, ``Why Mosquitoes Buzz in
People's Ears,'' based on West African folklore. For good measure,
the kids added a complex Brazilian martial-arts dance to the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours? Start to finish?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one told them they couldn't do it,'' Poitier says, beaming.
``You break down those walls and they go right ahead and do it. And
we hope that is one lesson they will take with them for the rest of
their lives.''
</P>

<P>
   Low prices and bad yields are expected in farming; one area
farmer jokes that his grandfather farmed the land for 41 years and
saw one ``normal'' year. But this year has heaped insult after
insult onto injury after injury.
</P>
<P>
   The state's agriculture department projects the winter wheat
harvest statewide to average 58 bushels an acre, a third higher
than many farmers in southeastern Washington expect to get.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, the state was projecting this year's harvest
at 60 bushels per acre, but adjusted downward after reports from
the field began trickling in.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers underscore the point farmers in southeastern
Washington have been making. ``I see on TV all about the droughts
in the Northeast,'' Cox says. ``No one seems to have noticed us.''
</P>
<P>
   But a government bailout, even if it comes, may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Through 1996, the state's farmers have run up an estimated
$3.125 billion debt.
</P>
<P>
   A study earlier this year by Veribanc, a bank research firm,
found the rate of delinquency for agricultural loans in Washington
jumped to 1.57 percent in the first quarter of 1999, up from .87
percent the year before, and .68 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer we sat down and refinanced and laid everything
out,'' Koller says. ``And we weren't alone. There were a lot of
people doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   `You do without'
</P>
<P>
   Poor crop yields in the United States used to mean good wheat
prices. But in a global market, supply and demand doesn't work that
way. Argentina will dump its wheat on the market this year at
cut-rate prices, the way it always does, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's state-controlled agriculture can undercut U.S. wheat.
Australia looks like it will have a good crop year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the U.S. government has injected politics into the
equation, using wheat as a foreign policy weapon. When the nation
cuts off agricultural aid as a matter of protest _ like it did
recently to Pakistan _ American wheat is stored, not sold. Other
nations step in to fill the void, and American farmers lose market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces translate into low prices in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is that anytime wheat falls below $4
Portland, you better start pushing a really sharp pencil,'' Koller
says.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sharp pencil'' runs right out of the accounting ledger
into real life. It pokes hard, especially in Koller's second
straight year of farming where he's taking a loss on the wheat he's
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do without,'' says Walt Neff of Pasco, whose crop was down
more than 30 percent from last year. ``You don't buy anything. And
you hope that nothing breaks down _ like that tractor, for
instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff nods out the window at an older tractor on which a
hydraulic line gave way Tuesday afternoon. There are precious few
farmers who have new tractors and combines these days _ the costs
are too high, the returns too low.
</P>
<P>
   How does someone losing almost a dollar per bushel afford a new
$200,000 farm machine?
</P>
<P>
   Koller drives a 17-year-old combine, and his two tractors are
from the early 1980s; a new back tire costs $4,000. The sharp
pencil has cut into the family's life, because the farm is
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, we haven't gone anywhere this summer,'' he says
in his kitchen. ``I had to give a (World Trade Organization)
seminar in Spokane a few weeks ago, and we stayed overnight and
took the kids. You know kids, an overnight stay and a pool is a
vacation for them. And we went to the Alabama concert in Spokane
and stayed overnight there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were our vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem rains
</P>
<P>
   The sky is a painful blue this day north of Kahlotus, or it is
until the wind gets going and the rising thermals start picking up
soil and weeds and send dust devils spiraling into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast calls for thunderstorms this night. The farmers
hope they will go north towards Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   They need two more weeks of dry weather to finish the spring
wheat harvest, then rain to moisten the soil for winter wheat
planting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is gone,'' Chris Herron says, kicking at the dirt.
``This year is a bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron manages about 5,000 acres around Kahlotus. His crop yield
this year was about 12 bushels to the acre; a good year is about 30
bushels to the acre.
</P>
<P>
   The crops in Franklin County were worse than the ones in
Garfield or Adams or Walla Walla counties, and Herron couldn't get
work doing custom cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high price of farm equipment, many farmers
contract out their combine work. Herron made pretty good money
doing it, he says, except that this year every one of his customers
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it goes bad'' he says, ``it just won't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just farmers feeling the pinch. The custom cutters are
an obvious victim of the area's drought. So are the towns _
Pomeroy, Kahlotus, Prescott _ that serve as centers for
southeastern Washington's farmers.
</P>
<P>
   They are fairly empty, now, as they usually are at harvest. But
there is more traffic than usual, testimony to the relative dearth
of crops to harvest. It is a false busy _ lots of activity, but
little spending of money.
</P>
<P>
   Koller talks about the sense of depression in these towns as the
merchants watch their clients go out of business, get foreclosed
on, flat give up. He's had one neighbor go under this year and
fears for another.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about the low prices of grain, about the neighbor who
didn't use herbicide at all this spring trying to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about pushing the sharp pencil, of trusting old farm
equipment, of believing that next year will be wet and well-timed
enough for a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   What he is talking about is survival, and the Washington State
knickknacks and his master's degree in international relations
don't matter when it comes to that, because this is more than
survival of the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to lose what my dad left me,'' he says. ``I don't
want to lose my legacy.''

   When last we left Hugh Grant, he was being semi-miraculously
transformed from a Hollywood outcast with a stalled career to the
only man brave enough to listen to Julia Roberts' ``I'm just a
girl'' speech and still respect her in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been given back his halo and was free to stroll among the
beautiful people. He strolled himself straight from ``Notting
Hill'' to the Upper West Side, where he sells paintings for an
auction house and is dogged by the goodfellas in his new girl's
family.
</P>
<P>
   He's taken up with Jeanne Tripplehorn in ``Mickey Blue Eyes.''
It's a Grant vehicle with non-stop mob screwballing and a barrage
of ethnic joking held together by Grant flapping, fopping,
squinting, stammering and pulling himself into one long constipated
face. It's almost persuasive enough to make you forget that the
movie steamrolls Little Italy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who for the sake of clarification plays a Brit named
Michael, has been dating Tripplehorn's Gina for three months, the
exact three months since that amicable split from Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Grant's fluster-chic is
challenged by holdovers from ``Analyze This'' and ``The Sopranos,''
if not actual cast members and other stock characters looking to
get his dander up, like the feisty Chinese lady (Lori Tan Chinn)
who foists on Gina the fortune cookie containing Michael's marriage
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is a nicely handled little riot that gets a lot of
mileage out of Tan's militarism. (Maybe she knew the couple chose
her Chinatown eatery only after they lost their reservation
somewhere else.) Gina says ``no'' to Michael because she fears
he'll be dragged into the nightmare that is her big Italian family,
led by her father, Frank Vitale (James Caan), and her uncle (Burt
Young). She doesn't want them controlling his life with their mob
favors. But he doesn't care; he loves her. Grant has as much
chemistry with Tripplehorn as he can with his girlfriend Elizabeth
Hurley producing the film.
</P>
<P>
   Tripplehorn smiles big and bounds around with large make-believe
gestures for the first 20 minutes like she's selling Revlon and
Pantene. Gina's the golden child in the Vitale family, and the
bit-heavy script by Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn makes sure you
know this by giving her a trendy mentally ill brother (Paul Lazar).
</P>
<P>
   She's actually the only non-stereotypical Italian ``Mickey Blue
Eyes'' can find. Gina agrees to marry him as long as they don't let
her gangster family do them any favors. But the movie piles on the
offers Michael can't refuse anyway. Those painting shipments his
Sothebys-like employer was having trouble receiving on time? Taken
care of.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Michael is expected to auction off an awful painting
by Gina's hothead cousin Johnny (John Ventimiglia of ``The
Sopranos''). Director Kelly Makin hands the film over to Grant,
whose frustration and stuttering turn the auction scenes with
Johnny's paintings _ which depict a gun-toting Jesus and look like
art-school Thomas Hart Benton forgeries _ into something for the
Grant highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
   He's great because he manages to remain in opposition to the
ethnic chaos, but every time he thinks he's out, ``Mickey Blue
Eyes'' has pulled him back in. Soon a key member of the family is
dead, sort of at Michael's hands, and he's digging ditches with the
warm 'n' fuzzy Caan near the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Once Michael gets sucked into mob ways, he appears to enjoy it
as much as hates it, reminding himself to rent ``Godfather'' and
``Casino,'' taking his cue on how to speak Italian-American from
the stuffed gorilla Gina gives him. Grant squares his jaw and
mumbles like he should be dragging his knuckles and hanging out
with Gina's brother Ritchie. And Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam''
caught flack for being anti-Italian because what?
</P>
<P>
   Grant's throwing himself headlong into the Italian/British
juxtaposition is often as winning in its conception as it is in his
execution. Everybody's a clown, everybody's here to amuse you. But
the film is as insulting as taking the queen to the Olive Garden.

PATRIOTS DEFENSE MISSING THAT CERTAIN CHEMISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ On many days, the Patriots invite business
groups, advertisers, and other folks friendly to the team to sit in
tents in roped-off areas and watch practice.
</P>
<P>
   One group yet to be welcomed is the Concerned Chemists of New
England. And all chemists, not to mention a few coaches and fans,
should be concerned because developing chemistry in the New England
defense just might be the key to whether the Patriots have a
successful 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   And the key to that chemistry is whether a player or two step
forward to become the leader of the unit. Already, the Patriots are
without safety Willie Clay (waived) and middle linebacker Ted
Johnson (injured), two acknowledged leaders, and the fuss so far
has been whether Chris Carter is the right man to replace Clay and
if rookie Andy Katzenmoyer can step in for Johnson. Scant mention
has been made of replacing the intangible quality of leadership
that Johnson and Clay provided the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to be more vocal,'' said cornerback Ty Law,
who is neither suited by position _ few cornerbacks can lead
defenses simply because they are lined up so far from the center of
the field _ nor by temperament. ``I'm not a rah-rah guy and I don't
jump up and down in the locker room. I can't act out of character
but I realize I have to try and be more vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   Law is like most cornerbacks in that ``I have to lead by
example, by what I do on the field.''. So, ``as for leadership of
the defense, we're all going to have to play a different part than
we're used to playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter has made strides toward replacing Clay, coach Pete
Carroll said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has really solidified that spot in the first few weeks,''
Carroll said. ``He's very sharp and in command of his decision
making on his calls. And he works well with (fellow safety Lawyer)
Milloy.''
</P>
<P>
   But a clear indication of the adjustment that must be made is
Law's admission that ``I still can't tell what's going on in the
defense. I just cover my man. And when Willie was there, I knew I
didn't have to think a lot. I just had to do my job. Willie was the
brains of the secondary and Willie was able to watch everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, too, is smart ``and he has brains _ hey, the guy's was
in medical school,'' Law said, ``but I can't lie. I'm going to have
be more aware of the (overall) defense.'' Milloy, too, was
comfortable in his role _ hitting people _ while Clay watched if
defenders were out of position when opponents lined up in
unfamiliar formations.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is more perilous at linebacker. Even the most
optimistic scenario won't have Katzenmoyer accustomed to the middle
until late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have (repetitions),'' said veteran linebacker
Marty Moore. ``That's the only way you learn and feel comfortable,
by seeing things over and over. It took me a full season before I
felt comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer's crash course has a domino effect as Tedy Bruschi
and Chris Slade have to keep one eye on the rookie and the other on
their own responsibilities. Katzenmoyer, in effect, is being
tutored on the complexities of middle linebacking. Nobody, of
course, had to worry if Johnson was doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just not been comfortable,'' said Bruschi of his own
play. And part of that discomfort has been the added responsibility
of calling defensive signals. Not to mention tutoring Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more calls that Andy starts to learn,'' Bruschi said,
``means the less calls that I have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Thomas, Chad Eaton, and Willie McGinest are leaders of the
defensive line. Slade has stepped up his leadership role, while Law
and Milloy say they have to take a more active role in the
secondary. Carter, of course, may develop into ``the guy with all
the smarts,'' as Law described Clay.
</P>
<P>
   The New England defense will have 11 bodies on the field. But
whether those 11 form a cohesive unit is dependent on coaching, of
course, but also chemistry and leadership.

ESPN ANALYST MAGUIRE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE GAMES ARE REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Maguire has been around summer football camps for the last
four decades, and, to tell the truth, he's sick of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the cheeriness.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is personal. When he turned professional in 1960 with
the Los Angeles Chargers, the team had six weeks of camp. Players
wore full pads for both daily practices. They also played six
preseason games. Maguire was one of the fortunate ones. By the time
the first game rolled around, the team was down to two linebackers.
The rest were out with injuries. A lean Maguire, fresh out of the
Citadel, where Al Davis was head coach, was summoned to duty.
</P>
<P>
   He had started both ways at the Citadel, playing linebacker and
wide receiver, and led the nation in touchdown receptions with a
whopping total of 11.
</P>
<P>
   With the Chargers, he was in the right place at the right time
and didn't get hurt. He started for four years. It helped that he
also could punt.
</P>
<P>
   His playing days are long gone. Maguire is a little rounder
nowadays and has been working in the broadcast booth for years. He
is with ESPN now and Saturday night will work the exhibition
between the Patriots and Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   He still can't wait for the regular season to start. ``No matter
what coaches tell you now, things will always be different when the
season starts,'' Maguire said. ``The interesting thing about
preseason is that the teams play the starters for a short period of
time and then they play everybody else. They want to take a good
look at everybody. They don't run anything too complex. It's all
vanilla offenses and defenses. For most teams, not all, preseason
is about looking for competent backup people.''
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable injuries are bound to change the makeup of teams.
Drew Bledsoe goes down with a little ankle injury. No big deal at
the time, but Maguire has been around long enough to know that some
of those injuries can take a long time to heal fully. Maguire said
that Randy Moss, for instance, was never at 100 percent last year
because he started the season with an ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire said that part of the problem is that the athletes of
today are better conditioned than those of the past, almost
overtrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, preseason camp was for players to get in
shape,'' Maguire said. ``Players of today are in shape when they
come to camp. These guys are overtrained, and it seems they all
come down with muscle pulls or some muscle tear. Think about it.
It's nice to hear that a player has 2 percent body fat. That means
they are all muscle and bone. When you tear one of those muscles,
they are hard to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire always finds a way to put humor in his analysis. ``I
always thought that the NFL was a great place in the world for fat
people,'' Maguire said. ``I tried not to get in good shape when I
played. It's a shame when a guy is in great shape but can't play
because he has a muscle pull.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire doesn't quite know what to make of the Patriots this
season. The team has lost Ted Johnson and is anticipating the
emergence of rookie Andy Katzenmoyer to fill his shoes at
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of confidence,'' Maguire said. ``I would imagine
that they will try to protect him as much as possible until he
settles down and becomes comfortable. The pro game is much quicker
and faster than the college game. But he played four years at Ohio
State and he has seen most everything. But he has to play and he
has to play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll has his own problems to worry about.
``Word around the league was that Carroll was in trouble last
year,'' Maguire said. ``He'd better put a superior product on the
field this year, because if it comes down to any question of
coaching, then Carroll could be out. Hey, the longest tenure of any
active coach is Denny Green at Minnesota with eight years. They
don't give you long, and as far as I can tell, this is Carroll's
second chance. The players feel it. They sense Carroll's sense of
urgency.''

MOTHBALL SMELL IS HARD TO GET RID OF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 22, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My old wood chests smell strongly of mothballs. How can I get
rid of that odor? The chests are lined with some sort of paper that
is not just set in, but sticks somehow.
</P>
<P>
   PETER CERUNDOLO, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. This question comes up often, and over the years there have
been no improvements or sure-fire ways to dissipate the odor. The
original way, ventilation, is still as effective as any. The more
you ventilate, the better; keep the chests out in the sun for as
long as you can.
</P>
<P>
   That paper has probably absorbed much of the odor, so removing
it will make a big difference. However, if the chests are antiques
and valuable, then removing the paper might reduce their value.
</P>
<P>
   If you are reluctant to remove the paper, then try to pull the
odor out of the paper this way: Dampen it with a wet sponge, not
too much but not too little, either. Most paper will take some
dampening. If your paper begins to disintegrate from the water,
stop, unless you want to remove the paper altogether. Then sprinkle
baking soda liberally on the wet surface; leave it for half a hour,
sweep up, and dispose of it. Repeat as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no concern over value, with or without the paper,
remove the paper. Then wet the wood underneath and treat with the
baking soda. The baking soeda will not do its job of absorbing the
odor if the paper or wood is dry.
</P>
<P>
   If you have removed the paper and treated the wood, and still
have the odor, line the chest with Contact paper. Contact paper, by
the way, is easily removed when necessary. The old paper used to
stick like crazy and was extremely difficult to remove. Not the new
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our family room is over a crawl space. We would like to get
rid of the wall-to-wall carpeting and put down hardwood. Is a
hardwood floor OK over a crawl space, or would too much moisture
damage it? We thought of ceramic tile, but wouldn't it be cold?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN AND PAULINE PANTANO, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No problem at all in putting a hardwood floor over the
plywood left after removing the carpeting. If there is moisture in
the crawl space, you can get rid of most of it by ventilating that
space; open vents or windows, or make vents that you can keep open
from April to October. You can also put heavy plastic on the
earthen floor of the crawl space, to prevent water vapor from
coming into the space from the ground; this will happen no matter
how dry the earth feels.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, insulate the crawl space ceiling; put the vapor
barrier (paper backing on the insulation) up, touching the plywood
above.
</P>
<P>
   The ceramic tile will not be cold if you insulate the crawl
space ceiling under it.
</P>
<P>
   Two myths and a truism about ceramic tile: It is not cold if you
insulate below it. It is not hard on the feet if it is applied over
a plywood underlayment. The truism: Say goodbye to anything
breakable that you drop on ceramic tile. It (the glass, plate,
bowl, etc., not the tile) is guaranteed to break. Another truism:
It is great stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some weird grass in my small lawn that is spreading
like crazy. It is beautifully green in spring, but turns yellow in
winter, even as early as fall. What is it, and how can I keep it
from spreading?
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH WOODS, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds like Zoysia grass, a mail-order grass popular in
recent years. It spreads by underground roots, and is tropical, amd
therefore goes dormant (turns into yellow hay, it seems) in late
summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   You might be able to halt its spread by building a deep border
wherever desired: 2 x 6 or even 2 x 12 pressure-treated boards.
Both may be deep enough to keep underground roots in their place.
To get rid of the grass, root it out physically or kill it with
Roundup, which biodegrades into a harmless material in a matter of
days. Then root it out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is less than two years old and is well insulated,
except for a gap beween the wall stud and the fireplace, where the
fireplace goes through the exterior wall. The gap is apparent on
both sides of the fireplace. How can I fill it?
</P>
<P>
   JIM KANGA, Pepperell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The gap is probably only on the inside, because any joint
like that on the outside should be caulked or closed to make it
weatherproof; if that is so, it is unlikely it is losing much heat,
but it won't hurt to plug it. For inside, you can fill it with
fiberglass insulation, sticking it in tightly with a screwdriver.
Or use the expanding foam called Great Stuff, but be careful that
you don't put so much in that it expands excessively. Or, instead,
use a latex foam; it does not expand as much as the Great Stuff,
but will fill the gap nicely. Then cover the gap with wood trim.
</P>
<P>
   If there is already wood trim there, you could take it off,
caulk or fill with foam, and replace the trim.
</P>

STILL WAITING FOR THAT NEW YEAR'S INVITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know it's only Aug. 20, but I'm getting antsy. About New
Year's Eve, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is already coming up in conversation, sort of
casually, but with a discernible edge. People who've already locked
in plans clearly enjoy the upper hand. A couple I know said they
plan to usher in the next millennium in a cottage, alone, on Mt.
Desert Island. Nervous jokes about Bangor Hydro Electric's Y2K
preparedness ensued.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like I don't have options. But a part of me still
awaits that call from Teresa Heinz's social secretary, inviting me
out to Sun Valley for the bash of all bashes. I'm sure her husband
John Kerry has forgiven me for all those lies I published about his
plastic _ sorry, dental _ surgery earlier this year. If only I had
been nicer to Boston University! Special collections czar Howard
Gotlieb's New Year's Eve hoedown at the Fairmont Copley Plaza
promises to be especially grand this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I'm an Aquarius, I haven't been too faithful a
water-bearer for the Democratic Party, so it's quite unlikely that
Massport hack-turned-Federal-Aviation-Administration-boss Jane
Garvey is going to invite me on her Dec. 31 late-night flight
across America's time zones. The purpose of this ultimate
white-knuckle voyage to nowhere is to demonstrate the Y2K
preparedness of our air traffic control system. ``Don't be anwhere
near an airplane on Dec. 31,'' a smart friend says, and I'm taking
her advice.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenslea and Barron families of Wellesley have scarfed up the
entire Children's Museum for a combined grown-ups/kiddie party for
about 400 guests, with the cost shared among the invitees. Ms.
Kenslea seemed ready to invite me, but I assured her mine was a
journalistic, not a nest-feathering inquiry. Happenin' guys Harvey
Allen (liquor) and Richie Balsbaugh (media) haven't summoned me to
their ur-cool Mistral shindig; a holdup with the mail? I'm about
half an alphabet short of Barbara Jordan's A-list friends, so I'll
be on the outside looking in at her sensational Four Seasons bash.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations haven't yet been mailed for the Boston Bar
Association/First Night benefit/blowout at the new Federal
courthouse. At $500 a head, it's a little rich for my blood, even
with a perfect view of the harbor fireworks. As things stand now,
I'll be cooling my heels in front of the JumboTron on the Boston
Common all night, watching a considerably warmer Keith Lockhart
conducting from inside Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Malcolm
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When we last checked in on the Museum of Fine Art's Hermann
Goering painting _ the 16th-century Flemish landscape by Herri met
de Bles that graced the Nazi Reichmarshal's office during World War
II _ the MFA had proposed binding arbitration to settle the
disputed ownership of the painting. Christine Koenigs, a
granddaughter of the painting's former owner, attended an early
August meeting with MFA officials to discuss the handover of the
painting, a piece of Nazi-looted art that the museum has supposedly
been trying to return for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   But now all bets are off. The Dutch government, which requires
repatriation of all art seized on its territory during World War
II, has told the MFA to go fly a kite. The chief of the Dutch
Inspectorate for Cultural Heritage, Charlotte van Rappard-Boon, has
written to MFA director Malcolm Rogers, ``I must dismiss your
suggestion that the matter be resolved by arbitration.'' Van
Rappard-Boon explains that Koenigs and others are litigating their
claims to the painting in Holland. Thus, ``I feel it is essential
for the question of title . . . for this painting to be decided by
the Dutch courts, in accordance with Dutch law.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Rappard-Boon goes on to request ``the speedy return of the
painting to the Netherlands. While awaiting the decision of the
competent Dutch court who is the rightful owner of the Bles
painting, I suggest that the painting be handed over to the keepers
of the State Art Collection as temporary custodian.'' In the past,
the MFA has said it is willing to return the painting, but only
after a definite resolution of the ownership question. ``We're back
to square one,'' an MFA spokeswoman said.

THE TRAGIC TALE OF A PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE 
Starring: Halle Berry, Brent Spiner, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Loretta
Devine 
Directed by: Martha Coolidge 
On: HBO, Saturday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich story of Dorothy Dandridge has been sitting in the back
of Hollywood's closet for decades, since the African-American
actress's death by overdose in 1965. It's the story of racism in
America, and in Hollywood, in the 1940s and '50s, and how talented
actresses were relegated to playing plantation mammies and
secondary roles because they were black. It's the story of what
celebrity can do to its most fragile chosen ones, from Dandridge to
Marilyn Monroe, as they masochistically salve their insecurities
with harmful men and pills. And it's the story of how, despite some
important growth, American entertainment (particularly TV)
continues to suffer from amnesia and apathy when it comes to people
of color.
</P>
<P>
   Dandridge, sultry and dynamic, was the first black movie star in
the iconic way Monroe and Audrey Hepburn were stars. She was the
first black woman to get a best actress Academy Award nomination,
in 1954, for ``Carmen Jones,'' the all-black version of Georges
Bizet's opera. The role brought her a deal with Twentieth Century
Fox that, miraculously, paid her the same amount as Ava Gardner,
and she landed on the cover of Life magazine. And she was a
nightclub sensation in an era when clubs were hot spots, headlining
major hotels in Las Vegas, Miami, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But after signing her for a three-picture deal, Fox balked at
putting a black woman in leads. And Dandridge was frustrated by the
fact that many of the hotels in which she performed would not allow
her to stay in their rooms. One famous story has a Las Vegas hotel
draining its pool after Dandridge stuck her toe in the water.
Despite her fame, she was never exempt from professional
demoralization and oppression. Dandridge's personal life also
conspired to drag her down. Two ill-advised marriages, a
brain-damaged daughter, a doomed affair with Otto Preminger, sexual
abuse by her mother's girlfriend _ it's a list of sad events that
leaves a scriptwriter with an embarrassment of dramatic material.
</P>
<P>
   What a shame it is, then, that ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge,'' on HBO Saturday at 9 p.m., so poorly conveys the
promise and tragedy of the actress. Despite the best of intentions
from star Halle Berry, the biopic is painfully fragmented and leaps
from scene to scene without connective tissue or emotional
momentum. It even fails to capture a sense of Dandridge's
electricity onstage, although there are a few lip-synched
performance scenes. From the beginning of the movie, when the
applause at the Oscars melds into the applause at the Cotton Club
for a flashback, you know that it's going to trade shamelessly in
biopic cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the entire movie is framed by the biggest cliche in the
book as, at the end of her life, Dandridge tells her life story on
the phone to her best friend as she fingers through photographs
that become scenes. As if out of central casting, we get the
true-blue manager and the jealous, drunken sister who quite
unexpectedly yells, ``I'm more than Dorothy Dandridge's big
sister.'' How odd to stuff the life of such a groundbreaking woman
into such limited conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Berry is a sweet presence in a role that requires harder edges.
Her facial expressions aren't quite distinct and sharp enough, and
she never quite succeeds in defining Dandridge's psyche _ the
personality traits that led her to make bold choices in the
industry and bad choices in her family life. When Dandridge finally
dies, it's hard to know what drove her to it. Berry's best work was
behind the scenes, mobilizing a movie that creates an appetite for
a deeper look at an essential figure.

ENCORE   FOR NELSON FREIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Thirty-one years ago a young Brazilian pianist made
his first recordings _ concertos by Grieg, Schumann, and
Tchaikovsky that were issued with great fanfare by CBS/Columbia and
greeted with rapture by the international musical press, which
acclaimed the arrival of a major new artist. ``A hurricane of
pianistic power,'' is what Irving Kolodin called Nelson Freire in
the Saturday Review. Time Magazine called him ``one of the most
exciting new pianists of this or any other age,'' and a European
newspaper dubbed him ``the jaguar with velvet paws.''
</P>
<P>
   Freire made a spectacular debut with the New York Philharmonic
in 1970, playing Rachmaninoff's Fourth Concerto, and played his
first New York recital the very next day. He arrived in Boston in
1977 to play a superb, unforgotten recital for the Peabody-Mason
Foundation in Sanders Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, this nervous young critic interviewed an equally
nervous young Freire in New York. Any lingering romantic notions
about the glamorous life of prominent young pianists took a beating
that day _ Freire was not staying in a posh hotel attended by
liveried servants, but sleeping on the floor of a friend's
apartment, like a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon Freire returns to New England for the first
time in 22 years to play Chopin's F-Minor Concerto with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Charles Dutoit at
Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Freire has not performed very often in America over the last 20
years, although he is a favorite of the Baltimore Symphony and its
former music director David Zinman, and he is a favorite of
audiences in Florida and in Carmel, Calif. Freire's recording
career has been fitful as well, and only a handful of his discs
remain available _ most of his early recordings, including the
debut concertos, the Chopin Preludes, and a magical set of Schubert
Impromptus are available on Sony's ``Essential Classics'' series at
budget prices, although sometimes in couplings you wouldn't choose.
His boldy imaginative Chopin Preludes, for example, share a disc
with the Ballades in boring perfrmances by Philippe Entrement. A
glorious volume in Philips Classics's new Great Pianists of the
20th Century series has now reawakened worldwide interest in
Freire, who does indeed sound like one of this century's pianistic
giants on these recordings, several of them collected from
hard-to-find CDs of Freire recitals recorded live on small labels.
</P>
<P>
   Freire lives in Brazil today, and maintains a pied-a-terre in
France. Speaking by phone from South America earlier this week, the
pianist said: ``I don't know why I haven't been so much in America,
because I have been all over every place else, mostly in Europe,
but also in Japan, Australia, and South America. Also, I don't like
to play as many concerts as most other pianists do; that's it.''
(Freire plays 30-50 concerts a year, about half what some of his
more famous colleagues play.)
</P>
<P>
   As to recordings, Freire said: ``The reason I haven't made so
many is a mixture of things. Also for my part, I always have a
dislike to learn certain pieces just for a record, and this is not
very commercial. I have a certain dislike to make commercial
things. Nowadays, too, there is a crisis in the record business, so
it has been quite a long time without recordings _ just a few
exceptions of three or four things I did with my friend Martha
Argerich. I would like to record again _ I am just waiting for a
proposition, and it has to be the right one. I think it is quite
important that records should be distributed all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of the two-CD Philips set are performances
of Godowsky's ``Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes from `Die
Fledermaus' '' and Godowsky's transcription of Richard Strauss's
``Staendchen'' _ performances that are at once on the highest level
of technical brilliance and of musical distinction. If they had
been recorded on scratchy 78s, they would have been constantly
reissued as historic treasures of piano playing, like Ignaz
Friedman's Chopin Mazurkas. Instead these performances have rested
in the archives of a German radio station, where Freire recorded
them in 1972. ``I was asked to record some free repertory,'' Freire
recalled, ``and maybe a little bit some exotic things. Those
performances were almost an improvisation; I played them through a
couple of times and then recorded them for the radio. But I thought
it was a good idea to put these performances on the CD because
these pieces are not so much played any more. The Mozart Sonata and
the Schumann Fantasy on the CD were also recorded in live
performances, one in Miami, one in Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto recital unfolded in an atmosphere of crisis, the
kind that Freire appears to thrive on. ``I had been playing a
series of concerts with Martha, and then I flew to Toronto. I
thought the concert was two days later, but it was the next day.
`At least I can sleep in,' I thought, but then I learned the
concert was in the afternoon. I hardly had time to test the piano,
but sometimes these things turn out for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Freire was born in Boa Esperanca, Brazil, in October 1944, and
at 3 had his first piano lessons from his sister, who was 14 years
older. Then he traveled five hours each way across unpaved country
roads to the nearest city, Varginha, to take weekly lessons. After
only three months, his unusual gift was abundantly apparent, and
his family reached the difficult decision to move to Rio de Janeiro
where their child could study seriously with Nisi Obino and Lucia
Branco, who had studied with a pupil of Liszt's. Later, when Freire
was 12, he played Beethoven's ``Emperor'' Concerto to such effect
that the president of Brazil awarded him a scholarship that enabled
him to go to work with Bruno Seidlhofer in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   An important friend and mentor was the great Brazilian pianist
Guiomar Novaes (1895-1979) _ who was characterized in an earlier
era as ``The Paderewska of the Pampas.'' The omission of this great
artist from the Philips Great Pianists series has been heavily
criticized, and Freire swells the chorus. ``I think I am the single
most angry person about that. She was quite important for my
musical life, and one of my favorite pianists. She was a very
special kind of artist, natural, different from the average, with a
very deep intuition. She spoke in the language of a housewife and
had a way of saying things that would maybe sound funny to some
people, but if you paid attention, there was a lot of depth in what
she said. And then she spoke mostly with her eyes, which was
marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   Freire says that Novaes was not perhaps ``a recording person,
although she made lots of records. On the stage she was much more
spontaneous.'' Spontaneity is a central aspect of Freire's own art,
and so is the bel canto beauty and variety of his sound _ another
characteristic of Novaes's playing. ``The recordings she made for
Vox didn't really capture the quality of her sound _ although in a
way they are still marvelous. I love her records of Schumann's
`Papillons' and `Kinderszenen,' and Beethoven's sonata, `Les
Adieux.' They have just issued now some recordings she made in the
1920s, and these are marvelous, and I have a few live performances
that are wonderful. She playes the Chopin F-Minor Concerto with
Geroge Szell, using an orchestration by Paderewski _ but I like
Chopin's original. And there is a Schumann Concerto with the New
York Philharmonic and Andre Cluytens in 1957 which is the best I
have ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Freire first played the Chopin F-Minor Concerto in public in
Lisbon in 1967, with his friend David Zinman conducting. But he had
studied it earlier, when he was still 16. ``I remember playing it
in Seidlhofer's master class back in 1960, which was when I met
Martha for the first time _ I asked her to play the orchestra part
on the second piano. She did, and we became close friends for the
rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Seidlhofer's reputation rested on his teaching of the Viennese
classics and Chopin was a little outside his usual line. Freire
says he doesn't remember what he had to say about his performance
with Argerich. ``I was so in love with this piece that it really
didn't matter what he said. I still love it; it's beautiful.''

NOTHING LEARNED FROM `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TEACHING MRS. TINGLE 
Written and directed by: Kevin Williamson 
Starring: Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson, Marisa
Coughlan, Jeffrey Tambor, Liz Stauber, Molly Ringwald, Vivica A.
Fox 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (thematic content, violence, sexuality, language and
some teen drinking) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' Kevin Williamson has finally
become what he has been making fun of, namely a maker of shlock
horror movies. The film's problem isn't so much that it panders
shamelessly to teen audiences, but that it panders so emptily. It
has almost none of the cool irony that marked his scripts for
``Scream,'' ``Scream 2,'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''
and enabled him to keep scare movies going a while longer. Even if
he had tapped another vein of self-referential wit, it may just be
that his kind of scare movie is passing out of fashion in favor of
the more primal kind of horror represented by ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' ``The Sixth Sense'' and imminently, ``Stir of Echoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' is mostly a screenful of
nothingness. Its bashing of adult authority figures is so crudely
drawn that its real crime is its total waste of the supremely
stylish Helen Mirren. She's Mrs. Tingle, a spiteful history teacher
thirsting on the eve of graduation for ways to shoot down a few of
the pupils she envies because they're getting out of the backwater
they live in, whereas she didn't. When she discovers three kids in
the gym doing things that look worse than they actually are, her
lips curl into a cruel smile and her eyes shine with a jackpot
glow. Katie Holmes' would-be valedictorian, Leigh Ann, who had been
hoping for a scholarship, is hardest hit. But her careless pal,
Marisa Coughlan's Jo Lynn, and Barry Watson's Luke, the guy they
both have a crush on, are torpedoed, too.
</P>
<P>
   They go to her Victorian house seeking clemency, but the
sadistic sarcasm with which she delightedly makes them squirm makes
it clear that they haven't got a chance. One thing leads to
another, and Tingle wakes up tied to her bedposts, bondage-style,
by the kids, who hadn't planned to have it go this way, and are
trying to seize the upper hand. Mirren is not only the best thing
in it, she's practically the only thing the movie has going for it.
Her Mrs. Tingle is more focused than her captors and less afraid.
Even when tied down, she's the most dangerous one in the room. The
clash of wills is no contest, given that Tingle is no slouch at a
form of combat for which these kids hardly qualify, namely mind
games.
</P>
<P>
   But hostage movies are hard to bring off because they turn
inert, especially this one. Even Mirren's brilliance can't hide the
fact that Williamson is giving us little more than heavily
manipulated cartoon figures who get bogged down early on. The fact
that Williamson is also a first-time director accounts only partly
for the film's sluggishness. Most of the problem lies with his
perfunctory script and the shrug with which he seems to have
written the characters. The deck is stacked against the adults.
Their ranks, filtered through Williamson's contempt, include an
alcoholic principal, a lecherous coach, and, in a sad comedown,
Molly Ringwald, as the school secretary. Nor do naughty photos and
a lethal crossbow give the film the lift it needs. ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle'' underwent a title change in the wake of the Columbine High
School shootings. It had been called ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' an
inaccurate title at best, unless it referred to the ever-present
possibility of boring her to death.

TOUR DE FRANCE WINNER HEADS FOR THE MOUNTAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DOVER, Vt. _ It sure looked like Tour de France winner
Lance Armstrong, but something was different.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the yellow jersey he proudly wore on the podium in
Paris last month, Armstrong was wearing a short-sleeved dark blue
sportshirt. Instead of talking about the sleek road bike he rode to
win the Tour, Armstrong was chattering about the dual suspension on
the knobby-tired bicycle he'll use this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As if it wasn't enough that Armstrong, 27, overcame a battle
with cancer to become only the second American to win the Tour de
France, the Austin, Texas, native is turning heads again.
</P>
<P>
   This time it's by competing in the finals of the Chevy Trucks
National Championships, a series of six races sanctioned by the
National Off-Road Bicycle Association. Even though Alison Dunlap of
Colorado Springs, Colo., and Steve Larsen of Bend, Ore., lead the
women's and men's cross-country races, respectively, it's obvious
Armstrong is the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   So the NBC crew, which coincidentally was assigned to this
weekend's race anyway, suddenly had to train its cameras on the
Tour winner. And fans were lurking for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   As Armstrong settled down behind the microphones to face the
media  &UR; last night &LR; , he immediately asked and answered the question
he knew was on everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all of the questions are going to pertain to why am I
here,'' he said. ``The reason is, not only did I make a commitment
to Trek (bicycles) last year to ride in mountain bike races, and I
feel it's important to honor that commitment regardless what
happened in the summertime. It's also something that I find
enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what he does, he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's a road bike, a mountain bike, or a tandem bike, I
enjoy riding a bike,'' he said. ``So this fits into what I consider
my job description, and that's racing bicycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who rode one mountain race last year in Park City,
Utah, had a different result than he had in France _ he didn't
finish. But he liked the sport that he has used for offseason road
training, and last spring agreed with Trek to race mountain bikes
for them. (Trek also makes the bicycles Armstrong and his US Postal
Service teammates use on the road.)
</P>
<P>
   This will be Armstrong's first major American race since he won
the Tour. He remained in Europe briefly to ride some criteriums,
came back home to be on talk shows, went back to ride a race in
Spain, then returned to be honored by his hometown and to visit the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, not on the roads, but on a mountain usually
covered with snow.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is different than what he's used to, Armstrong said,
because it's ``more athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What mountain bikers do and the skill that it takes are
different that a road racer needs,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
road racers who could never do this because of the technical stuff
and the coordinaton it requires. I'm one of them, I think. This
makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   So even though Armstrong was in the front pack almost every day
in the Tour de France, he insists he won't be a ringer when he
takes part in the cross-country races with about 95 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I can stay upright,'' he said.

KEEPING PEACE A FULL-TIME JOB FOR REVOLUTION GM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Revolution general manager Brian O'Donovan's diplomatic,
interpersonal, and crisis management skills are being severely
tested this week. The accumulation of the Revolution's problems,
combined with a 1-0 loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny, ignited
frustrations among fans, players, and a player-coach Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donovan found himself counseling the team's two oldest
players, recently-acquired midfielder Leonel Alvarez and
player-coach Walter Zenga, who was in a combative mood after the
defeat, which seriously damaged the Revolution's playoff hopes
going into Friday's game at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, 38, engaged in an argument with a fan while signing
autographs about 45 minutes after the game. The conflict was broken
up by other fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans have a right to say what they want, but this was way over
the top,'' O'Donovan said. ``Clearly, this sort of thing can't be
allowed to happen, but we have to do a better job of protecting our
coaches, just as we do with football coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga had been reluctant to meet with fans or media after the
Revolution's sixth successive defeat. After consulting with
O'Donovan, though, Zenga conducted a revealing press conference in
which he expressed his incredulity about the team's failures and
took responsibility for the defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while walking in front of the Foxboro Stadium offices,
Zenga was beckoned by a vocal, supportive group of fans and he
approached them to sign autographs. But one fan taunted Zenga,
calling the Revolution a ``Serie B'' (second division) team, then
blaming Zenga for Italy's defeat in the semifinals of the 1990
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a guy like Walter Zenga to come out and sign autographs
after a loss like . . . ,'' O'Donovan said. ``But no matter what
happens, a coach should never engage in (an argument) like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alvarez, 34, had threatened to return to Dallas if
MLS failed to extend his contract. But after the game, Alvarez
enlisted the help of public relations assistant Jurgen Mainka to
interpret as he voiced his concerns to O'Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with contracts,'' O'Donovan said. ``It
was the same thing as Zenga. Leonel was saying we need to keep our
hearts in this, keep our focus, our spirit. We need to keep a
positive attitude and he said, `You can depend on me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonel had a contract problem before when he went to Mexico
and people were worried about it. But it didn't affect his play.
When he steps on the field, Leonel Alvarez doesn't know how not to
give everything he's got. We've gotten what we've expected with
him, and that's a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Revolution are not going into the dark night of a
losing streak lightly. And O'Donovan believes the adversity could
galvanize the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players on our team have that same passion,''
O'Donovan said. ``I genuinely believe in this team. It's the best
group of players we've ever had in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction we are going is the right one. We need a break
and we need to change the mode from desperation to determination,
and that is happening. My role is not the football side of the
operation, but to monitor the pulse of the situation, and this is a
team that believes in itself and has passion. And if we lose that
passion we are finished.''

$21.4M LOSS RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT FILENE'S BASEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Filene's Basement Corp. has been on the brink before,
only to bounce back and confound critics who say the concept of
bargain-basement retail is hopelessly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case in 1995 when a bankruptcy filing was rumored,
but an earnings report issued this week suggests that the
90-year-old Boston-area legend could now be in for the fight of its
life.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of its current fiscal year, the Basement lost
$21.4 million, more money than it lost for its last two fiscal
years combined. For the most recent quarter, ending July 31, the
Basement lost $14.9 million on sales of $144 million.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the losses are related to the launch of the
Basement's Aisle 3 chain, the numbers are still cause for concern
for the Wellesley-based retailer, which reported sales of $588.5
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Basement has said some vendors have been
reluctant to ship it goods. And Thursday the price of Basement
shares fell 1/32, to close at 1. In the last month, share prices
have dipped below a dollar more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Calls made to Basement headquarters over the last four days were
not returned, but others outside the company weren't so reticent
about commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for Filene's Basement is grim at best,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   One problem may be that some of the company's stores are
faltering. In all, the company runs 51 stores under the Filene's
Basement name. But few have captured the magic of the original
flagship store in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Basement's immediate concerns is that some
vendors have been reluctant to ship merchandise, presumably out of
fear they won't be paid. Vendor jitters can start a debilitating
cycle for a retailer. When store shelves aren't fully stocked,
sales can drop, and problems get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new $125 million credit line, ``vendors still remain
concerned, and the company is continuing to experience problems
with receiving adequate quantities of inventory,'' the Basement
noted in the earnings report it issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vendor jitters come at a bad time. For most retailers, it's
crucial to have enough merchandise on the store shelves for the
important back-to-school and holiday selling seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a cause for hope in the launch of Aisle 3, the
Basement's warehouse-store chain that opens for business only on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aisle 3, from what I heard, is doing great,'' said Stewart
Cohen, chief executive of Paragon Capital of Needham.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon is one of the lenders behind the Basement's new line of
credit, part of which has been earmarked for expanding the Aisle 3
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Aisle 3 may offer the Basement its best opportunity for growth.
Four stores are up and running, and several more are set to open
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend-only store has two advantages over seven-day-a-week
retailers: Payroll costs are lower, and stores are open when
consumers do most of their shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Basement isn't the only struggling bargain-basement
retailer. A few months ago, Loehmann's Inc. of New York filed for
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two chains seem so similar and because the Basement
continues to report losses, vendors have grown nervous about
shipping the Basement goods.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the two chains together, some observers even wonder
whether the bargain basement may soon go the way of the
five-and-dime store.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned there's no longer a place for stores like
Filene's Basement and Loehmann's in the marketplace,'' said Gary
Wassner, president of Hilldun Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Firms such as Hilldun are known as factors, and they play a key
role in New York's Garment District, often deciding whether a
struggling retailer will hang on or go under.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, factors guarantee that vendors will be paid for
the goods they ship to retailers. When retailers buy goods from
apparel vendors, it's akin to a consumer making a credit-card
purchase. The consumer gets the goods today, but the bill doesn't
come due for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the factors lose faith in a retailer, some vendors won't ship
goods unless they're paid right away. But many retailers would be
hard-pressed to pay upfront. Only after they've sold the
merchandise do many have the money to pay the vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factors control Seventh Avenue,'' said Cohen. ``If you don't
have factor support in the Garment District, it's very difficult''
for a retailer.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, stores such as Filene's Basement and Loehmann's
were places where department stores could unload goods they
couldn't sell at full price.
</P>
<P>
   Now many department stores discount slow-moving merchandise
themselves, and in the last 10 years or so, many have opened their
own outlet chains. Computerized inventory has also cut back the
amount of excess apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain basements were famous for their scruffiness. Consumers
would put up with a low-rent shopping experience and rummage
through messy bins in hope of landing a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, comparable deals can often be found in department
stores during their many sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't need to shop in a place that's unpleasant to get
a good price,'' Wassner said. As practiced by small off-price
chains like Filene's Basement and Loehmann's, the bargain-basement
``concept doesn't make sense any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the economy booming, Wassner added, why should vendors
risk shipping to an ailing bargain basement when so many healthy
retailers are eager to buy the same goods?
</P>
<P>
   Other problems loom. As the price of Basement shares
occassionally dips below a dollar, there's some risk the company
could eventually be de-listed from Nasdaq, though the stock would
have to remain below a dollar for more than 30 trading days to risk
being de-listed.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from not being included in the stock listings printed
by many newspapers, the actual impact of being de-listed is
minimal, said Harry K. Eisenberg, editor-in-chief of Walker's
Manual of Penny Stocks. By the time a company is booted off a
mainstream stock exchange, a lot of bad things have already
happened to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a stock starts trading below $5, most investors lose
interest,'' Eisenberg said. Being de-listed simply means a company
is ``one level further removed to obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   But that obscurity may not be permanent, he noted. A company can
recover and requalify to trade again on a major stock exchange.

REYNOLDS DEAL LEAVES ONE HEDGE FUND MANAGER STEAMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hedge fund manager Jon Jacobson has been hammering
managers at Reynolds Metals Co. since March, urging them to unlock
shareholder value by considering a sale of the aluminum and
packaging company.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson seemed to get his way Thursday, when Reynolds agreed to
be purchased by Alcoa Inc. for $5.9 billion in stock and assumed
debt. So why is he so steamed?
</P>
<P>
   ``This board sold us out,'' said Jacobson, whose Highfields
Capital Management became the largest single Reynolds investor by
spending more than $220 million for 4.3 million shares. ``It's a
great deal for Alcoa shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson complains that Reynolds managers and directors were
dragged kicking and screaming to the point where they put the
company up for sale, and only when they were faced with a hostile
takeover battle from Alcoa. Then they botched the sale
negotiations, quickly accepting an inadequate offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa's opening offer in its hostile &UR;  &LR; takeover bid on Monday was
$65 per share in cash. The friendly deal announced Thursday
amounted to $70.89 per share in Alcoa stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board in this situation is accountable,'' said Jacobson,
best known for generating huge stock investment returns for Harvard
University's endowment at Harvard Management Corp. until last year.
``I think these guys are asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Highfields wrote to Reynolds directors Thursday afternoon, hours
after the Alcoa deal was announced. On various points, it
complained the company ``effectively lied'' to shareholders about
previous interest from Alcoa and that the board ``failed
miserably'' to manage the sale process once it was under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your behavior is reprehensible and . . . you will forever be
remembered for your failure in this matter,'' said the Highfields
letter, signed by managing director Richard Grubman.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds officials did not return a call Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to believe amid the noise, but Highfields is
still in a position to make a substantial profit on its Reynolds
investment. Highfields, which began buying Reynolds stock in
January and was still adding to its investment as recently as Aug.
11, spent an average of $51.09 per share, according to the hedge
fund's latest public disclosure statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Reynolds sale price, which could go up or down based on the
future value of Alcoa stock, would represent a profit of about 35
percent over Highfields' average purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson clearly thought Reynolds was worth more, and so did
many others. In March, Highfields pressed its case for the sale of
Reynolds in public and suggested the company was worth $85 to $95
per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't think that's far off,'' Jacobson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, who left Harvard Management Corp. to create his hedge
fund last fall, is accustomed to making big bets on companies in
the midst of mergers or acquisitions, sometimes in the middle of a
takeover contest.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson first criticized Reynolds managers in March, after
Highfields had accumulated 5.5 percent of the company's stock,
arguing they were not ``fully committed'' to maximizing shareholder
value.
</P>
<P>
   He kept on them for months, but it was rival Alcan's deal this
month to buy Pechiney SA of Paris and Zurich-based Algroup's
aluminum and packaging units that sent aluminum leader Alcoa
publicly after Reynolds in a swift industry consolidation play.
</P>
<P>
   After Reynolds turned down a friendly offer of $65 per share
from Alcoa last week, the suitor turned around and launched a
hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Once Reynolds quickly agreed to explore its options, Jacobson
said, the company failed to establish a committee of independent
directors to run the process and rushed into the arms of Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys had time and they just (wasted it) by caving in
after two days without contacting other potential buyers,'' said
Jacobson. ``It sounds like they did nothing but negotiate with
Alcoa from a very weak position.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said he was aware of at least two industial firms and
one financial firm that had interest in all or part of Reynolds but
were never contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds can still get out of the deal and take a better offer,
but only at the cost of a $100 million breakup fee.
</P>
<P>
   All Highfields can do is campaign for another offer and possibly
vote against the Alcoa proposal. ``It's an option we'll retain,''
said Jacobson. ``We'll see how the process unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   The Red Herring

with Arnold Palmer at the pro-am event for the BankBoston Senior
Classic golf tournament at Nashawtuc Country Club? We hear it was
BankBoston chief Chad Gifford and merger partner/Fleet Financial

BLUEFISH ADD DIMENSION TO A CONTEMPLATIVE SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ Few sports lead to quite the state of
introspection as fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers, for example, do not go around wondering why they play
golf, as if there were some archetypal truth beyond the club, the
ball, and the hole in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do golfers' cousins, bowlers and pool players, so question
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But fishing is different, somehow at another level of being than
mere pastime.
</P>
<P>
   At a cemetery near my house a gravestone inscription reads
simply, ``Gone Fishing,'' with an engraved scene of lovely foliage
enclosing a stream with a leaping trout.
</P>
<P>
   So here was a guy whose love of fishing was so profound he
wanted to be known for all the ages for that passion, rather than,
say, any war he may have fought in or kids he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Another fishing friend once told me he hoped that if any of his
kids got married in the summer they would videotape it because he'd
hate to miss the wedding. I think it was a joke. But I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts were in mind on a matchless August afternoon as
we drifted along the rip water between Great Point and Sankaty Head
trolling for bluefish. It is much more fun and satisfying to catch
blues up on top with dry flies and plugs, but the fish don't always
cooperate, so we had to go down to them.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean fish cannot be ``called'' to the surface.
Sometimes the sound of a popper imitating a crippled fish will
bring the blues or even striper up to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   I was with a friend, John, and Colby, his 24-year-old daughter,
on a Nantucket vacation on which a 16-year-old son was pursuing his
own passion of surfing on the oceanfront beaches while John and his
daughter fished.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was just getting acquainted with his gorgeous new
34-foot Blackwatch, which made the seaway feel like flat water as
we charged along to the east toward Brant Point, cleaving perfect
twin curls of wake behind us.
</P>
<P>
   Underway, we rigged a few rods with various plugs, Hootchies,
pork rinds, leadheads with dressing of one kind or another. For a
while we tried drifting near the rip, casting plugs into the water
where it roiled as the deep incoming tide hit the shallows and
began to roll blue and white.
</P>
<P>
   Nantucket is surrounded by shoal water, which is what made the
island so dangerous in the age of sail. On the south side, the Old
Man Shoal sets up a curling wave so high you can sometimes, when
the wave is backlit, see the dark, torpedolike bluefish swimming
down through it. As in bonefishing, you can select the fish you
cast for.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the fishery was threatened with collapse a short
15 years ago, striped bass somehow command more respect among most
anglers than do bluefish. In fact, there is a school of mystical
literature surrounding stripers that casts the fish in the sacred
role of demigod, as the Indians regard cows.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass are given credit for humanlike intelligence,
warriorlike bravery in battle, and an ambrosia quality as
nourishment. In fact, stripers do sometimes seem to exhibit
reasoning powers, especially when compared with bluefish, which,
when excited by the smell of blood in a kill, become little more
than chopping machines hitting anything in front of those deadly
snouts.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with sharp teeth, a bluefish can be downright dangerous,
and has removed parts of fingers from many an angler unwise enough
to try to unhook it without benefit of pliers. Encountered in
frenzied schools that chop through whatever they encounter,
including their brothers, bluefish ``blitzes'' are exciting to
witness, especially with rod in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those teeth are the reason some idiots club a bluefish
unconscious, but there's also some tribal macho thing going on as
well. I know few experienced anglers who kill their fish this way,
and it is absolutely ruinous to the meat. If sudden dispatch is the
point, a shot of vodka in the gill will do just as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why catch buefish?'' goes the introspective voice that
sometimes comes to practitioners of the blood sports as they age.
Younger hunters and fisherpeople rarely ask this of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the act of watching new anglers go through the
experience of catching one of their first fish holds a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Colby was up on the bow of the boat, pumping her rod as the
fishing guide showed her to do earlier this summer. Then, slam, it
bent double, and after waiting a correct interval, she pulled to
set the hook on the first fish of our day.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was typically bluefish, a wild, thrashing attempt to
escape. Colby kept the pressure on at critical moments, not letting
the line slack when the fish made a run. She stayed with the fish,
even when it lept out of the water shaking its head violently to
spit the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, Colby let out a whoop of delight as she fought
this fish, bringing it finally to the boat, where we inspected it
before releasing _ slate blue on top with pearly white underside
and deep red gill fans working in and out. After the fight with a
feisty, thrashing 14-pounder, Colby was breathless, glowing with
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting this deeply with the natural world, reaching into its
depths and finding its power in a creature's will to survive, is
profound. For many men and women, it is simply the most exciting
interaction they ever have with nature. I have known new anglers to
become absolutely disabled by the excitement in fishing, losing the
ability to tie a knot or cast the line. I saw one guy overwhelmed
and trembling as he tried to cast into a breaking school, and I
have often thought how interesting it would be to slap the blood
pressure cuff on an angler hooked up to an 18-pound bluefish on a
salmon rod.
</P>
<P>
   That day off Nantucket, Colby caught the first fish and the
most. We released them all, and her reaction became distilled into
a simple declaration. ``I want to get a really big one,'' she said.
``I want to go sharking. Tomorrow.''

NOT LUXURY, BUT NOT SUCH A BAD DEAL

 (For release Sunday, August 22, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 56 years old, have over 25 years with my current
employer, and plan to work as long as I am able. I do realize,
however, that at my present age and salary I cannot take my job for
granted. I contribute 7 percent of my $85,000 salary to my 401(k).
We have a modest home with a $25,000 mortgage, a few thousand in
cash, a few thousand owed on credit cards, and about $30,000 in
stocks. My primary question is whether, at my age, I should be more
conservative with my 401(k) account. My current balance is
$256,677, spread over these funds: $27,396 in Janus Worldwide,
$27,401 in American Century Ultra, $126,014 in Fidelity Contrafund,
and $75,857 in Legg Mason Value Trust. My contributions are
allocated so 40 percent goes to Contrafund, 30 percent to Legg
Mason Value, and 15 percent each to the two remaining funds. In
addition, I have a choice of a few other Fidelity funds, a
Templeton foreign stocks fund, and some conservative to aggressive
strategies put together specifically for my company's 401(k)
program. Since I am in for the long run, I've always figured I
could ride out any bumps in the market. Have I positioned myself
for doomsday should I need to begin withdrawing from my 401(k) at
the minimum age of 59 1/2? I can probably count on at least $20,000
to $30,000 from my employer's retirement fund, depending on how
long I work, but if I should lose my job before age 59 1/2, I'm not
sure I can pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   L.J., Poway, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Boy, you're certainly in a gloomy mood. The way it looks to
me, you're likely to be quite a bit ahead of the typical situation
for retirees, although as you note, still pretty far from the lap
of luxury. I base this on the typical budget that calls for an
individual to need 60 percent of his preretirement income stream
once he retires. In your case, that would be $51,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If you earned a $25,000 pension from your employer, and received
about $12,000 a year from Social Security, that would mean your
savings would need to produce an income stream of only about
$14,000 to put you in a solid, if not necessarily comfortable,
position.
</P>
<P>
   Since you seem to be focusing on age 59 1/2, let's look at what
your savings might be after 78 months. If you continue with your 7
percent contributions, which work out to $495.83 a month, and if
your 401(k) and your stock holdings produce average annual returns
of 8 percent during that time, you would have $523,363 accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   If you then invested half of the accumulation to produce an
income stream, that would bring you $17,009 a year, presuming a 6.5
percent average yield from a fixed-income portfolio. The remaining
funds could be left in a fairly conservative growth portfolio,
designed to protect you against the ravages of inflation in the
later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think you can live in retirement on about $54,000,
you could change the formula a bit and still be fairly safe. If you
put two thirds of your total savings on the fixed-income side, you
would get a $22,678 income stream, taking your total income near
$60,000, using the same assumptions as above.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you notice that I used an 8 percent growth assumption when
I projected the accumulation at age 59 1/2. This is partly a
function of my sour feelings about the current near-term prospects
for the stock market, but more so because I agree with your worry
that your position is too aggressive, and I am suggesting two
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to get a broader allocation among various
stock-market sectors in your 401(k), and the second is to begin
building the fixed-income side of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   You don't specify what common stocks you hold, but I calculate
that 93.3 percent of the 401(k) portfolio is in either the
large-cap growth (American Century Ultra) or the large-cap blend
categories. The only diversification away from these sectors is the
63.3 percent of the Janus Worldwide portfolio, which is in foreign
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   All of your funds are excellent, but that's too much reliance on
large-cap domestic stocks. I suggest you look at the Templeton
offerings available through your 401(k), seeking an international
fund (which is wholly invested in foreign stocks) rather than the
world stock fund you hold, which holds 36.7 percent of its
portfolio in US stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I think after looking at the low one-star Morningstar rating for
Alliance Quasar and Morningstar's warning that the fund is ``for
the adventuresome investor,'' I would give that a pass.
</P>
<P>
   But you might look at some of the other offerings particular to
your 401(k), seeking vehicles with good records that will give you
exposure to the small- and medium-cap market sectors. I'd also like
to see a small position _ perhaps 10 percent at most _ in a
health-care sector fund, if such is available.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is to begin work on the fixed-income side, to
get both more diversification and more safety. I would begin by
moving about 10 percent of the portfolio to the best intermediate
term bond fund that's available and then in each of the next two
years move another 10 percent to fixed-income holdings.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, I would reassess the situation. If after three
years you continue to feel as little job security as you felt when
you wrote your letter, you might continue the 10-percent-a-year
process into a fourth year; if you feel more secure at that point
and reckon that you are likely to continue working well past age 59
1/2, I'd hold the fixed-income side at 30 percent until you think
you're about three years from retirement, at which time you can
begin the process of transferring the final 20 percent to bond
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 29-year-old single mother or a 4-year-old boy, and
each month I have about $500 in discretionary income. I'd like to
begin saving for my retirement and my son's education, but my
knowledge of investment plans is virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make sense for me to start a separate education fund for
my son, or should I just withdraw money from my own investments a
year or so before he goes to school?
</P>
<P>
   Second, I had planned to put my discretionary income toward
early repayment of my $45,000 in student loans, which have an
interest rate of about 8 percent. Is this a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   Also, what is the Morningstar Mutual Fund?
</P>
<P>
   T.B., Mattapan, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I'd suggest a little bit of each course. Certainly
beginning your IRA _ and making it a Roth IRA if you can afford to
absorb the slightly higher tax burden that comes with it _ is the
best first step, accounting for $166 of your monthly surplus. If
you were just embarking on a 10-year schedule of payments on the
loan, you would be paying about $539 a month. If you increased the
payment by $233 a month, the loan would be paid off in 73 months
rather than 120.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave $100 free, which could be put in a savings
account earmarked for your son (but in your name, so as to optimize
his access to financial aid should it be necessary and available).
After the 73 months of student loan prepayments, you could then
increase the level of the college savings, as well as perhaps start
a supplemental savings plan for your own retirement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to learn about mutual funds is from the
fund companies themselves. If you call Fidelity or Vanguard or any
other mutual fund company and ask for introductory information on
mutual funds, IRAs, and particular funds you suspect might interest
you, they will be happy to flood your mailbox with literature.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Mutual Funds isn't a fund company, but rather a
company that tracks and grades the mutual funds of other companies.
It produces detailed reports on mutual funds on a biweekly basis,
but they're fairly pricey, and a great deal of their very detailed
reports on mutual funds is available free on the Internet at
www.morningstar.net.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Under threat of losing its cargo facility at the
San Francisco International Airport, the Federal Express Corp. has
agreed to comply with a court order to offer a limited package of
benefits to employees with unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, announced Thursday, came just before the deadline
to comply with an order by U.S. District Court Judge Claudia Wilken
regarding the city of San Francisco's Equal Benefits Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   In an offer that complies precisely with Wilken's ruling,
Federal Express said it would offer bereavement leave and
discounted flights to unmarried partners, but would limit the
benefits to its employees in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is much narrower than the package offered in
recently by three passenger airlines, United, American and US
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies offered employees with same-sex and opposite-sex
partners not only the flight discounts and bereavement leave, but
also medical and dental care, pension benefits and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions have come while Federal Express, United and the
Air Transport Association, a trade group for the nation's largest
airlines, continue their legal fight against San Francisco's
2-year-old landmark law. The law requires companies doing business
with the city to provide the same benefits to workers with domestic
partners as they give to married employees.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have filed a lawsuit, seeking exemption from the
law. Their position is that only the federal government, not local
jurisdictions, can make such mandates on the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling in May, Wilken said the airlines don't have to
provide health and pension benefits, but must offer bereavement
leave, discounted flights and other perks, but only to employees
who work in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are appealing the ruling, but while the case makes
its way through the higher courts, Wilken ordered the air carriers
last month to carry out her order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll comply with the court order,'' said Jess Bunn, a
spokesman for Federal Express, which is based in Memphis, Tenn.
``But in the meantime, we're going to vigorously pursue our
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco law only kicks in when a new contract is
forged or an old one is extended. So far at the airport, the law
only has applied to United and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express recently signed a 10-year lease for a new $59
million cargo warehouse and office complex at the airport to be
shared by three airlines. The company is paying the city-owned
airport $2.7 million per year in rent.

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ The crowd on the edge of the tarmac was the
smallest to greet Air Force One during President Clinton's five
vacations on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The White House blamed the relatively sparse turnout of 500
supporters and gawkers on airport renovations that have limited
parking availability.
</P>
<P>
   But on the island, where the president is usually warmly
received, there are subtle signs that the Vineyard is beginning to
wind down its greetings as the presidency does.
</P>
<P>
   Along the streets, only a few banners hung.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Scoops ice cream parlor in Edgartown was running
late on his usual choosing of an honorific flavor. Thursday
afternoon, he decided on mango. Same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of the nearby By the Sea/Vineyard Gear clothing
shop dragged out to the porch those same old cardboard cutouts of
Bill and Hillary, which are slightly faded from too much sun and a
little tattered at the edges. Even the suits the first couple wears
in the lifesize likenesses are dated; the president's hair doesn't
look so gray.
</P>
<P>
   Shop owner Lois Boudreau said she just got fresh replacements
for the wilting figures (but has not yet put them on the porch) so
tourists can take snapshots with the fake couple as long as they
make an accompanying donation to a cancer charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more interested in the cancer funds than they are the
first family,'' Boudreau said, adding that during the Clintons'
first vacation here in 1993, ``There was huge hype. To be honest
with you, it's very low-key.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential visit, of course, will hardly go unnoticed. The
state police warned that there will be the usual traffic jam.
Restaurants and stores will still be consumed when one of the
Clintons stops by, Secret Service and the curious in tow.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to solve the traffic problems when a large
motorcade snakes through a place with many narrow, one-way streets,
said Beth Toomey, West Tisbury chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood is different this year. ``We had a big incident in
July _ Kennedy,'' Toomey said. ``I think people are just looking
for normalcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cited scandal fatigue. ``Last year was the icing on the
cake,'' said Jack Rudy, a registered Democrat from the Philadelphia
area. ``Ho-hum is putting it nicely. I won't go any further than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, pausing from a family bicycle ride, said he was
considering going to the airport for the Clintons' evening arrival
_ but only to check out the Air Force One DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are only spending nine days at the Oyster Pond
estate of Boston businessman Richard Friedman before trading the
weathered cedar shingles for the unrelaxed Hamptons, for the East
Hampton home of movie maker Steven Spielberg. The Vineyard, locals
said, feels less like a destination and more like a pit stop on
Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, she has been shopping for residences and votes
in New York and, for obvious reasons, wants to be seen vacationing
in that state. After doing some heavy fund-raising on the Long
Island gold coast, she and the president will dart upstate to the
upscale, polo-playing finger lake village of Skaneateles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to see that part of the country,'' Julie
Mason, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said brushing aside all
talk of campaigning. ``And to be in a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   Robby Bick, manager of the Bunch of Grapes Bookstore in Vineyard
Haven, touched on the attention shift to the first lady in a letter
to the Clintons that accompanied reading material _ including the
second volume of Eleanor Roosevelt's biography by Blanch Weisen
Cook _ he set aside for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Mrs. Clinton received a copy of the galleys, but
a bound copy is so much more lasting,'' Bick wrote. ``Since this
volume covers the period when Mrs. Roosevelt moved out of the home
onto the world stage, `Eleanor Roosevelt Vol. 2: 1933-1938 seems a
particularly timely gift.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nantucket, traditionally a Republican stronghold, there has
been some outright hostilty about the Clinton's planned day-trip
there Friday, involving a fund-raiser for the American Ireland
Fund. The Nantucket Golf Club snubbed the president's request to
play the 18-hole private course that members spend fortunes to
join.
</P>
<P>
   The Vineyard, meanwhile, remained low-key.
</P>
<P>
   In Oak Bluffs, the only noticeable tribute to the president was
a small chalkboard sign hung outside the general store, owned by
Susan Krueger, whose husband Steven, originally from Hot Springs,
Ark., went to the same high school as Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And even that easily erasable scrawled welcome was vague.
``Presidents from Arkansas,'' ``Future Senators from N.Y.,'' and
``One particular (Stanford) student,'' were invited in for coffee
and soda.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if such visits had become routine, Susan Krueger, seated
behind the cash register, said: ``I don't know if `used to it' is
the proper verb. I would pour coffee for him.''

WHY HASN'T THE GOP FLOURISHED IN MASSACHUSETTS? NOW YOU KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which photograph is more obscene? The one showing a brash young
blonde on the Nauticus flashing her breasts? Or the one showing two
boozy, backslapping pols, taking care of business, private and
public, compliments of the taxpayer?
</P>
<P>
   As eye-catching as the blonde might be, the second photograph is
more outrageous. Because it shows, as graphically as possible, how
low the business of state politics can sink in Massachusetts, along
with the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits keep asking why the state GOP can't capitalize on
the fact that Republicans have held the state's highest office
since 1991. Why can't the GOP grow? Why can't it build an
infrastructure and organization like the Democrats and field
strong, credible candidates for Congress and statewide office?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer lies in the puffy, dissolute face of
Alexander ``Sandy'' Tennant, lobbyist, political consultant, and
onetime executive director of the Massachusetts state Republican
Party. This perpetual bad boy is brazen, reckless, and successful _
because up until now, Governor Paul Cellucci let him be.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant drinks and swaggers his way around town, bragging about
his powerful connections. He insinuates that all political business
is a political fix, and if he isn't hired to do the fixing, the
business won't get done.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Blute, a former US representative and now former executive
director of the Massachusetts Port Authority, paid a high price for
his bad judgment in associating with Tennant. But if Blute ignored
the signals, so did Cellucci. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last few months, Tennant survived in high Republican
circles despite a reputation for indiscreet womanizing; a
drunk-driving arrest (he entered a plea of not guilty); and his
hypocritical questioning of Texas Governor George W. Bush about the
Republican presidential frontrunner's past drinking. Only after the
booze cruise was exposed did Cellucci pronounce Tennant unwelcome
in the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tennant is raking in big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed recently with the Massachusetts Secretary of
State show that Tennant has not registered as a lobbyist. Tennant's
firm, New England Strategic Development Corp. earned $219,500 in
lobbying fees just since January. That may not represent all the
money Tennant gets from lobbying: ``We are not satisfied that the
records are complete,'' says Secretary Willim F. Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question political operatives like Tennant can earn
millions. There's also the possibility that their tactics scare
good, decent people away from politics and, in this case, the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   John Brockelman, director of the Massachusetts Republican Party,
says the booze cruise ``has zero impact on the party. It's not
going to affect our candidate recruitment or our gathering of
signatures for the tax-rollback petition. Paul Cellucci just won a
convincing victory. He is probably the most popular elected
statewide official. If we stick with tax cuts and fiscal
discipline, we're going to win on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Republican insider, who is close to Cellucci, says
that while the Tennant controversy ``is not indicative of where the
party really is, it might hurt the party's progress. This is the
kind of stuff the Republican Party used to be known for. It brings
back all those crazy old Republican stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP can't find challengers willing to take on any one
of the Democrats in the state's 10-member congressional delegation.
State Republicans have put out the word that Plymouth County
District Attorney Michael Sullivan ``might'' launch an underdog
challenge against Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Imagine asking for
money and support from national Republicans, with the booze cruise
photo spread making the national political circuit?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans account for only 13 percent of Massachusetts'
registered voters. Brockelman is trying to build a statewide
organization and, since March, has raised $600,000 in GOP
contributions. So, even while he insists the Massport debacle has
no impact on the party's future, he also says that as of now
Tennant is no longer a Republican state fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the big picture problem for Massachusetts
Republicans is bigger than Tennant. It's the Cellucci
administration from the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci should ban Tennant from the State House until he gets
the help he needs, and he should refuse to do business with anyone
who does business with Tennant.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a good first step, for himself and the state
Republican Party. The second step would be to start acting like a
governor with a future, instead of acting like one destined for a
single term.

THE FRIGHTENING REALITIES ABOUT NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ If you live in small-town New England, you
take or send your trash to the dump.
</P>
<P>
   But if your trash is radioactive, it's very hard to find a dump.
And just as ``deaccessioning'' is the polite word museum operators
have for getting rid of the stuff they no longer want, the nuclear
industry's term for shutting down a nuclear power plant is
``decommissioning.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of all bottom lines for nuclear power is the simple
question: what do you do with the deadly radioactive junk that's
left over? There is no permanent answer on what to do with the
lethal high-level waste that is the inevitable byproduct of all
those uranium-generated kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Augusta, an obscure 10-member state rule-making
outfit, the Board of Environmental Protection, met to debate
intervening in the Maine Yankee utility company's scheme to build a
concrete pad on a gravel base to store spent nuclear fuel rods. An
earthen berm would be piled up around the ``hot'' rods, which will
remain dangerous to all forms of life for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Yankee's old nuclear plant in coastal Wiscasset is now
shut down. But it continues to soak up dollars. Old nuke plants,
like old soldiers, never die; but neither do the radioactive sites
just fade away. They require constant monitoring, tending,
fretting, re-construction, and spending. Lots of spending.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has treated the nuclear power-for-profit
industry like the mother of all welfare mothers. And cleaning up
after this prodigal parent is a pricey proposition. Over two
decades, Washington dumped $3 billion into the Yucca Mountain
storage facility in Nevada, the intended resting place for the
worst of the waste. Nevada's state government has been trying to
block this scheme for years. But no way are the 49 other states
volunteering to receive the radioactive stuff. This is the ultimate
``hot'' potato.
</P>
<P>
   What will be stored here, if scientific fears about leaks,
earthquakes and water pollution are resolved, will be 70,000 tons
of extremely dangerous radioactive garbage, in miles of tunnels,
1,000 feet underground. The site is about an hour's drive east of
California's Death Valley, which may be the most aptly-named
national park in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you can dig a hole in the ground, bury the stuff, and
pray there'll be no earthquake, floods, asteroid hit or other Act
of God. Because the technical problems have proven insurmountable
to date, a lot of the 100-odd nuke plants in the United States have
become ``temporary'' storage sites for the radioactive waste that
is constantly generated.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reports that at least one storage cannister
of the more than 10,000 cannisters envisioned would fail within the
next thousand years. And after 10,000 years, all of the cannisters
would degrade, turning the lethal juice loose into the earth. The
stuff would remain dangerous for ``hundreds of thousands of
years,'' and there's no way to keep it out of the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with high-tech solutions to challenging scientific
problems is that huge mistakes are made _ almost as a matter of
routine. The Apollo One launchpad fire killed three prized
astronauts. Seven more died in the Challenger spacecraft. The
Titanic sank on its first trip. Things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness of the potential for disaster is what fired protests
against the use of plutonium to power the Cassini spacecraft that
just curved around the earth like a slingshot and is on its way to
study the rings around Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   If this bus-sized machine had crashed into the earth during its
tricky manuevering around our home planet this month, we would have
had to swallow a very-bitter taste of our own nuclear medicine. We
don't want to be anywhere near this stuff. What makes you think the
Americans of the year 3000 will want it any more than we do?
</P>
<P>
   We are stuck now with what we have. We spend $30 billion a year
on nuclear weapons, which means we are creating more detritus. We
no longer build nuclear power plants because they only last 25 or
30 years, and are hideously _ and endlessly _ expensive to
``decommission.''
</P>
<P>
   The cold realities about waste storage effectively killed the
industry's expansion dreams. Their last gasp was the claim that at
least uranium-generated electricity didn't contribute to global
warming. True enough. Now, could I perhaps interest you in a nice
mountain vacation home with a wonderful view from atop Yucca
Mountain? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign contributions that nuclear installation contractors
and utility execs gave to pro-nuke politicians bought the industry
about 30 or 35 years of political protection in high places. But
eventually, cold facts conquer even cold cash. There's no place to
put it; we're stuck with it. But it is mindless to keep producing
more of what eventually has to kill many, many of our fellow
humans.

A HEARTFELT INSIDE LOOK AT LIVING WITH DIABETES

SWEET INVISIBLE BODY 
Reflections on a Life with Diabetes 
By Lisa Roney 
Holt, 297 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crafting a compelling memoir is a daunting task for any writer.
Those by celebrities often succeed, but that has more to do with
our own lust for their starry lives and less with their writing
talent. It's the ordinary folks, however, who must rely purely on
the content of their story and their ability to spin it to succeed
in our cutthroat, memoir-happy culture.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Lisa Roney, for example. She has lived a life
most 39-year-old women might recognize, except that she is
diabetic. In Roney's first book, ``Sweet Invisible Body,'' she
reflects upon the everyday challenges of living through her
teen-age years, and as an adult, with a disease that affects 16
million people in the United States and is the seventh-leading
cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Just before her 12th birthday in 1972, doctors diagnosed Roney
with diabetes mellitus, a chronic disease that requires her to
monitor and regulate her blood sugar continually.
</P>
<P>
   Roney's Tennessee childhood soon became an everyday challenge as
she coped with the little things of life. Walking home from school
or going to the movies was transformed from perfunctory to taxing.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes forced Roney into constant awareness of her mental and
physical states, which in turn, led her to this therapeutic
literary medium. Seemingly, the author spares us not a moment of
her life: She introduces family, friends, and pets; she writes at
length about Carleton College (Minn.) roommates, about loves won
and lost, and about her years as an English teacher. Occasionally
you're reminded of Bobbie Ann Mason, as the story details a
Southern life jolted off track but restored by gritty stamina.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sweet Invisible Body'' is only sometimes sweet and funny;
at other times, it's burdened with a hackneyed style and disjointed
anecdotes. From the beginning, Roney alternates between flat
phrasing and cliche, with occasional melodramatic touches:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just about no condition I can think of that I hate
more. Is this, I wonder, what it's like to be psychotic, to have
multiple personalities, to move in and out of reality?'' She tells
us that she adores sleep, and ``longs for it like a fleeting
lover.'' And if Roney had to take only three insulin injections a
day, rather than having to constantly calibrate her health minute
by minute, just how happy would would she be? ``As a clam.''
</P>
<P>
   In recalling racism in Memphis (where she ``chose a smiling
brown girl named Suzette as my playmate'') and homophobia in
college (where she roomed with lesbians), Roney writes proudly of
her rebellious alignment with those who are outsiders. But it
becomes increasingly difficult to appreciate her sympathetic
qualities under the weight of her lackluster writing.
</P>
<P>
   Roney does succeed in capturing the queasy moments when
hypoglycemia has rendered her dazed, disoriented, even manic.
</P>
<P>
   And when she describes visiting a hospital inexperienced in
treating diabetics, she observes the sloppy blood-sampling
procedures with a keen eye: ``Try as she might, the nurse could not
get the needle to pierce my veins. As my entire body clenched in
pain, the nurse moved the needle back and forth under my skin,
twisting it sideways to try to nick the vein, turning it this way
and that at various depths of penetration. I felt as though a molly
bolt had been screwed into my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Invisible Body'' does offer diabetics (especially
younger women) a detailed portrait of what it's like coping with
life's daily minutiae bearing a seemingly invisible onus. Roney is
at her most colorful when she speaks most plainly _ when she
doesn't try too hard.

A MULTIBAND BRAIN TRAIN HITS THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The multiband tour goes under the heady tag of ``The First
International Music Against Brain Degeneration Revue'' and, indeed,
it offers a smarter, more complex brand of contemporary music than
you might find on, say, ``The Family Values'' tour or at the
``Ozzfest.'' This antibrain degeneration package _ with the veteran
Oklahoma-based band Flaming Lips at the top of the bill, followed
by former Massachusetts and now West Coast lo-fi kings Sebadoh,
English singer-songwriter-guitarist Robyn Hitchcock, Japanese
pop-ster Cornelius (a.k.a. Keigo Oyamada), and Uqu _ should
challenge and entertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all stuff that you would want to listen to,'' explains
Hitchcock, ``not just music to crash your car to. It gets your
attention and Wayne (Coyne of the Lips) makes a point before the
show each night to the audience that you just let your mind go, and
that your brain will grow if you exercise it. That might sound too
educational; it actually is a bit more fun than it sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour also has a psychedelic bent to it. Which, these days,
might be defined as . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Music that could have been made on drugs,'' offers the Lips
singer-guitarist Coyne. Operative word: could. ``When I think of
psychedelic I think of Jimi Hendrix and the Grateful Dead, but I
come from the old school. I do see how a lot of young people when
you say `psychedelic' they just mean stuff that isn't dance or
rap.''
</P>
<P>
   Drugs may or may not play a part in the creation of psychedelic
music, which could be said for music in general or virtually any
art form that reaches beyond the norm. Musically, speaking
neo-psychedelia is about sonic exploration, off-center twists on
conventional rock and blues riffs, unorthodox instruments coloring
the mix. It's about expansiveness, about dreamscapes, about music
as open-ended and adventurous. This is where Coyne and his mates,
drummer-turned keyboardist and guitarist Steven Drowzd and bassist
Michael Ivins, live. (Longtime guitarist Ronald Jones recently
left; the drums, played by Drowzd are on tape.) As evidenced by
their latest effort, the stellar ``The Soft Bulletin,'' the Flaming
Lips, in its 15th year, make music that has warmth and uplift, even
if it traverses some fairly gnarly territory. There may even be a
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was one by design,'' says Coyne, ``even
though the songs tie in nicely. I can see they are all talking
about the same thing and one sort of bookends the other. The themes
involved are of love and death and isolation and desperation,
yourself vs. the universe type of thing.'' Which is not to say the
mundane doesn't come into play. ``Buggin' '' concerns the summer
nuisance of mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   The Flaming Lips' music has little to do with the wave of hard
rock and metal out there _ ``A lot of people would prefer nothing
more than to be bludgeoned to death,'' says Coyne _ and the band
favors movement and variety over the course of an album. ``People
forget that adults actually like variety,'' Coyne says.
</P>
<P>
   To the Flaming Lips, notions of orchestration and sophistication
are not bad things. Coyne likes the idea of a big, dense sound that
can be ``soft and loud at the same time,'' and, ``with the right
movements behind some of the lyrics you really do get this sense of
hope, this triumphantness.'' ``The Soft Bulletin,'' with its
frequent piano-based melodies, has a sense of quiet grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things that I do,'' says Coyne, ``I realize sometimes
hit people as being absurd or strange, sometimes just plain
unwanted, really. We take our lumps as they come and proceed on. I
just think this monster that is musical evolution has go somewhere
and will do with or without me. So, I figure that I am making my
contribution the best I can. I look at it this way: The music
industry, and the music evolution, is like a giant whale and I am
just a little flea on the back of it, flying through the ocean. I
try to place myself somewhere where I can best position myself to
have the most impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the Lips drift into the mainstream _ they had a
hit with ``She Don't Use Jelly'' in 1994 _ but it always comes as a
shock. ``We're never prepared to have it,'' says Coyne.
``Sometimes, the momentum builds. I really do want to reach as big
an audience as we can, and at the same time, I want to reach them
with what I want to say (as) opposed to with what they want to
hear. What people want to hear is always changing and we are always
changing. Sometimes, the spheres collide, naturally, accidentally.
It's hard to tell if it's going to be like that horrible train
accident in India or whether they just melt into each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do what we would like to do,'' Coyne adds, ``and hope
that we can convince people it's hip regardless, even if it is not.
Being ahead of the curve is something, well, you don't actually
know what a curve is and if you are ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Coyne, Robyn Hitchcock, once of the Soft Boys and
Egyptians, now touring solo, probably has no idea of a curve
either. He has long been used to swimming in a peculiar pool of his
own design. A sharp pop songwriter, weaned on Bob Dylan and Syd
Barrett (of the early Pink Floyd), Hitchcock favors odd, yet
affecting, lyrical metaphors, and a wide-ranging musical palette
that runs from folk to rock. He also likes insect songs. Wasps,
flies . . . ``Antwoman'' is the offering on Hitchcock's latest CD,
``Jewels for Sophia,'' his strongest effort in years.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the insects? ``You see people watching baseball
or football in bars all over the world,'' Hitchcock says, ``and you
could be looking at photographs of ants. I know people identify
with sports figures; I guess I am the exception. But I find insects
incredible; there is a danger about them. It is a visual thing too.
I write about things I like the look of and less about computers
and sports.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Jewels for Sophia,'' where Hitchcock is joined by guests
like R.E.M.s Peter Buck, former Bostonian Jon Brion, and ex-Soft
Boys' Kimberly Rew, there is a mix of soft and hard, pensive and
full-tilt with wit and whimsy informing most everything. ``I have
managed to get my personality on there,'' says Hitchcock, ``but I
think it is the most comforting sound we have put out in the last
10 years. The latest albums have all been quite somber. I think
this is like me staring out over the lake, shaking my hand over a
glass of wine during twilight. It may be a bit more
life-affirming.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some dark passages. The disc starts off with ``Mexican
God,'' with Hitchcock singing ``Pray for amnesia to finish you
off/This is the evil I wished on so many/Time will destroy you like
a Mexican God'' and ``The horror of you floats so close to my
window/At least when I did, your memory will too.'' By the end of
the song, Hitchcock is on the grill, secure ``at the end of your
rod.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like crawling through a deep tunnel before emerging into a
dome of a bright strange loft,'' Hitchcock offers, of the song and
its placement. ``It took a very long time to organize the
placement.''

Fuji Bank and IBJ _ say they will form a joint holding company by
fall of 2000 and then cut jobs by a fifth and close nearly 150
branches of the combined operations. The plan may give a lift to a
troubled national industry that has fallen behind in an
increasingly competitive global business. But others are skeptical
whether such a deal would solve the deep-seated problems in Japan's

RAITT AND COMPANY TO TOUR IN HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They've all sung on each other's records, shared each other's
musicians, and done benefit shows together. So it figures that
Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Shawn Colvin, and Bruce Hornsby would
eventually tour together, which they're doing this summer at a time
when ``none of us is trying to be a rock star,'' says Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   The artists have no new records to promote, so instead what
they're promoting is camaraderie and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing it because of the high regard we have of each
other's music, and the love of one another,'' Browne says of a
national tour that begins at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield,
Mass.Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you get to be a fan living out your fantasies by
working with your favorite singers,'' says Colvin. ``Expect a lot
of harmony singing. We all know each other's records.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We rehearsed for two weeks, then took a few weeks off to do
our own things. We'll be winging it a little bit when we get back
together, but there are a lot of good songs in there. I'm looking
forward to it,'' says Hornsby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 35 songs to remember,'' says Raitt. ``It will be a
little hairy to do the first show, but luckily it's in Boston,
where we have a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minor miracle that we could have worked out our
schedules so we could do this tour at all,'' adds Colvin, a new
mother who is bringing her 1-year-old daughter on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the recent Bob Dylan/Paul Simon tour on which the artists
teamed for just part of the night, this new tour is ``more
adventurous,'' says Browne, and will see the participants play in
different configurations on each song. ``People will be on and off
the stage all of the time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The format is still being worked out (``It won't just be a
jukebox of hits,'' says Browne), but ``we're basically each other's
band,'' Raitt says. Additional members include violinist David
Lindley, guitarist George Marinelli (who now tours with Raitt but
used to be with Hornsby), organist J.T. Taylor (now with Hornsby),
percussionist Wally Ingraham, and Browne's rhythm section of Fritz
Lewak on drums and Kevin McCormick on bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no musical director,'' says Colvin. ``It's fairly
democratic. The only rule is that everybody is in charge of their
own repertoire. You're responsible for the seven to 10 songs that
you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour grew out of some benefits that Raitt, Browne, and
Hornsby did to help victims of Hurricane Mitch. Colvin and Lindley
were then enlisted, followed by the rest of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Each artist will play some hits, but also lesser-known numbers
from their archives and often in rearranged settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some quiet, unplugged stuff and some wonderful, scary
funk that's very powerful,'' says Browne. ``There are all these
places that we can go.'' Adds Colvin: ``During rehearsals, on
certain songs somebody would jump in and that would change it.
Maybe it would be a different singing part. And then, other songs,
like Jackson's `The Pretender,' are very much like the recorded
version.''
</P>
<P>
   Colvin may try some new material (she has started making her
next album), but Browne says he'll stick with past tunes because he
fears that any new tune would be bootlegged immediately and ``put
on the Internet where you don't have control of it. There's just no
privacy anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the artists will tape some of the shows, and there's a
chance a live album will come from it, plus a home video. ``We
haven't made a definite deal yet on these things,'' says Colvin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hornsby is doing his two New England dates with Fleck
this weekend. The two are old friends and have jammed together in
the past. Expect some bluegrass (Hornsby did a bluegrass reworking
of his hit, ``Jacob's Ladder,'' at Woodstock). Eventually, Hornsby
wants to make a bluegrass record, though his next album will be
with an orchestra, possibly the Roanoke Symphony, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt calls Hornsby the ``focal point'' of the new touring group
coming to Tweeter on Thursday. She cites his versatility in
switching styles with such seeming ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music just pours out of him,'' Raitt says. ``I'm so in awe
of him and all the people in this lineup. There's a tremendous
amount of delight and spontaneity in being part of this.''

HUGH GRANT DISARMS THE MOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MICKEY BLUE EYES 
Directed by: Kelly Makin 
Screenplay by: Adam Scheinman, Robert Kuhn 
Starring: Hugh Grant, James Caan, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Burt Young,
James Fox, Joe Viterelli 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (brief strong language, some violence and sensuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Hugh Grant not only brings off his
second comedy hit this summer, but caps his career rehab in the
unlikeliest of ways by relocating his bumbling Brit persona from
``Notting Hill'' with Julia Roberts to a married-to-the-mob spinoff
in Manhattan without her. ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is in the same
ballpark as ``The Sopranos'' and ``Analyze This.'' It brings an
enlivening wit to a comedy of culture collision that begins with
Grant's East Side art auctioneer proposing marriage to a teacher
named Gina, who is also a reluctant mob princess.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the wit comes from Grant himself, contributing an
uncredited rewrite consisting mostly of ironic asides and
rapier-like retorts that amount to the only real weapon the proper
Brit has when it comes to dealing with his in-laws-to-be. At first
Jeanne Tripplehorn's Gina turns him down, on the grounds that her
family will chew him up. Nonsense, he insists, in his most boyishly
self-deprecating manner. He can handle it. Besides, Gina's father,
a restaurateur in Little Italy who calls his establishment The La
Trattoria, likes him, he points out. What can possibly go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   In no time, his relatives-to-be are flushing unspeakably awful
gangland execution-themed surrealist paintings through the hitherto
respectable auction house in a money laundering scheme. The FBI
starts leaning on the auctioneer, and the auctioneer is finding it
impossible to get his fluted tones around everyday words he needs
to learn, like ``Fuggedaboudit!'' If the last echoes ``Donnie
Brasco,'' it's intentional, right down to the casting of a mob
soldier with a physical resemblance to Al Pacino. There's no way
``Mickey Blue Eyes'' isn't going to be genre-referential, and the
movie wisely not only accepts this, but embraces it to accelerate
the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   James Caan, in a drolly tacky maroon suit that has '70s written
all over it and a take-charge manner that falls a little short of
really taking charge of anything, of course resonates with his
``Godfather'' role. The obligatory ``GoodFellas'' reference
involves Caan and a corpse in the trunk of a car, but it's a
crowded trunk, stuffed with stolen Cuisinarts. The film's title
comes from a scene in which Caan tries to pass Grant off as a
Kansas City hit man nicknamed Mickey Blue Eyes. Caan doesn't have
to work very hard in it because Grant is so funny trying to
unsuccessfully get his perfect diction around mobspeak.
</P>
<P>
   Tripplehorn is given little to do beyond emit distress signals,
but she does so engagingly and, by the end, in savvy ways when
she's wised up to the auctioneer's disastrous attempts to
ingratiate himself with her family. Burt Young skillfully gets the
job done as Uncle Vito, the one everybody is afraid of. Joe
Vitelli, the beefy henchman Billy Crystal slapped around in
``Analyze This,'' is another plus, but then more than a few of the
smaller roles are flavorfully performed _ always a good sign.
That's another reason ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' is cleverly able to have
it both ways. It wrings one more entertainment out of Mafia
mythology and finds a few new ways to play it for laughs, starting
with Grant's funny cluelessness. Don't fuggeddaboud this one.

TAKING STEPS TOWARD U.S. AUDIENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Don't be alarmed if you haven't heard of Steps _
you're not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   During the U.K. group's recent appearance in Houston, its five
members casually walked in and sat down in the lobby of the Aerial
Theater without the slightest fan flutter. No pleas for autographs,
no Backstreet-worthy squeals of excitement. The only interest came
from a clueless Page Parkes representative who was scouting the
area for potential cover girls. She approached member Claire
Richards with an application, which incited riotous laughter from
the rest of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The coed pop outfit, currently one of the opening acts on
Britney Spears' U.S. tour, is just getting started stateside.
Steps' first U.S. single, the love-lost dance anthem ``One for
Sorrow,'' was recently released and is also featured in the
upcoming Melissa Joan Hart flick ``Drive Me Crazy.'' Steps' U.S.
debut album, Step One, is a compilation of the group's two U.K.
discs and is due in October.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Richards, Lisa Scott-Lee, Faye Tozer, Lee Latchford
and Ian ``H'' Watkins are superstars. ``Step One,'' the group's
first U.K. album, has been certified triple platinum and boasts
five hit singles. In October, the group (which has rightfully
earned comparisons to Swedish pop supergroup ABBA) returns home for
the release of a new album and a tour _ the biggest U.K. arena tour
in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   Steps was formed in 1997 after each member answered an ad in a
British newspaper looking for singers and dancers to form a pop
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same kind of story as the Spice Girls,'' quips
Watkins, nicknamed ``H'' for his hyperactive personality.
</P>
<P>
   The group's first single, ``5, 6, 7, 8,'' peaked at No. 18 on
the U.K. charts. The next five were Top-10 hits and secured Steps'
place among Europe's current pop heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Steps is content playing second, third or even
fourth fiddle to its U.S. touring partners. (Spears' show features
four opening acts, including Tommy Jeans model Michael Fredo and
boy-band C Note.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely the opposite (in the United States),'' says
Latchford, 24, the oldest and quietest member of the group. ``It's
good, though, because it brings us all back down to earth in a way.
In the U.K., we can't walk down the street. To come here for the
first time, do a huge tour like this and be a support, it's like a
breath of fresh air. No one really knows us. We can go out. We can
have a good time. Hopefully, it will start a big wave _ we won't be
able to come back and walk down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the lobby of the Aerial Theater, the members of Steps
play off each other like an old group of high-school chums.
Throughout the interview, Watkins pinches and plays with the girls
in the group, inciting squeals of ``That hurts!'' He is armed with
a camera and is videotaping everything around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're waiting backstage to go out it's like, `Are they
gonna like us? Are they gonna join in?','' says Scott-Lee, 23. ``At
home, we know the minute we go out and do a show that all the kids
are gonna be singing along and doing all the dance moves. Sometimes
you may get an audience that will just sit there, and they don't do
a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case during Steps' brief but spirited set in
Houston. The group proved energetic and original, teaching the
young crowd a few quick dance routines (that's where the name Steps
came from) between songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiences are brilliant. Steps is about dancing as well as
singing,'' says Tozer, 23, the most talkative member. ``We weren't
sure if they'd join in over here, 'cause ... we're quite Euro-pop.
Having dancing breaks down all the barriers between the musicians
and the audiences. Everyone can interact with each other. It's a
lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Steps' giddy pop sound appeals to the usual crop of
young teens. Their parents dig it, too, because it's squeaky clean.
The group has broadened its horizons to include British college
students (with whom they have a kitschy cult following).
</P>
<P>
   Potential cover girl Richards, 21, believes the keys to Steps'
success is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because we do look like we're having a good time,
and we do,'' she says. ``We all get on really well with each other.
I think that comes across to the audience, the kind of chemistry
between the five of us. With normal pop groups, there's like this
myth of pop stars (being) this untouchable kind of person, but we
try to break down all those barriers, and say, `No, come on, we are
accessible.' The clothes we wear are ones that you can go out to
the shops and buy, if you really want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Give them time. If Steps makes the right moves with American
audiences, they could find a few look-alikes in the crowd the next
time around.

BOROWITZ LIGHTS UP SCREEN IN `ILLUMINATA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ILLUMINATA 
Directed by: John Turturro 
Screenplay by: Brandon Cole, Turturro 
Starring: Turturro, Katherine Borowitz, Susan Sarndon, Christopher
Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Donal Donnally, Bill Irwin, Ben Gazzara,
Matthew Sussman, Rufus Sewell, Georgina Cates, Leo Bassi, Aida
Turturro, David Thornton 
Running time: 119 minutes 
Rated: R (sexual content, nudity and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Affection slugs it out with heavy-handedness in ``Illuminata,''
John Turturro's farcical salute to theater folk. Ultimately,
affection prevails. What saves the day _ and the play _ is
Turturro's warm embrace of the world of the stage and its mix of
egos, aspirations, insecurities, and lusts. Turturro _ the
producer, co-writer, and star _ hasn't made it easy for himself and
his colleagues by serving up his playwright protagonist as
unrelievedly earnest and self-absorbed, then playing him for
sensitivity and not for laughs. It's a strategy that did a lot for,
say, ``Bullets Over Broadway,'' to say nothing of ``Shakespeare in
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Turturro plays Tuccio, an ambitious writer in a
turn-of-the-century Manhattan repertory company, whose play is
thrown onstage before it's ready and is savaged by the most
powerful critic of the day, a gay dandy played by Christopher
Walken as if hellbent on becoming the Oscar Wilde of Park Row. The
film enters the realm of fantasy when the critic, Bevalaqua, is
induced to give the novice writer's play a second chance and a
second review. He's motivated by a visit from an actor who has
caught his eye. Played in crisply amusing horrified fashion by Bill
Irwin, the actor is cast by the company as a sacrificial victim and
dispatched to Bevalaqua's chambers, where the critic makes a clumsy
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Only Walken's fiercely funereal gravity could keep the scene,
and the critic, with his built-in-easy laughs, from
self-destructing. And so he does. Turturro pretty much neutralizes
himself as Tuccio, in whose brilliance we are vainly asked to
believe. The others in the company _ Beverly D'Angelo, Rufus
Sewell, Georgina Cates, Leo Bassi _ tumble with zest through a
daisy chain of sexual capers. But while warmly energized, their
carryings-on also seem a little generic. It's as if they, like
Walken's fatuous critic, are being put through their paces to cater
to what the writers believe the public expects from such
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illuminata'' would become pretty forgettable pretty fast if it
weren't for two heroic performances: by Susan Sarandon as a worldly
diva of appetite and style, and by Katherine Borowitz as the heart
and soul of the company to which Tuccio is attached. Turturro, who
is Borowitz's real-life husband, has said that ``Illuminata'' arose
in part from his and his wife's experience as artists trying to
live, love, and work together and survive the differing levels of
professional success each has experienced. As a theater piece,
``Illuminata'' is often as clunky as it is lively. But as a
valentine to an actress who fleshes out her material with beauty,
delicacy, and more radiance than anything around her,
``Illuminata'' justifies its title.

SURGEONS PERFORM RARE PROCEDURE TO RELIEVE MAN'S SEIZURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Michele Angeloni is CQ)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Every day over the last 12 years, epileptic
seizures overpowered Michele Angeloni.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden episodes would grip his body, wrestling all control
he had over his own actions. Sometimes, he would walk in circles in
a hypnotic state with his eyes closed. Other times, he would laugh
uncontrollably or fall down without warning.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't unusual for the 18-year-old, who lives on the Italian
island of Sardinia, to suffer up to a seizure an hour, every day.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, physicians in San Antonio performed what his
mother calls ``the miracle,'' a delicate, neurological procedure to
try and halt the young man's rare seizure disorder. Only about 100
such procedures have been reported worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me like a miracle because Michele has gone through
a very miserable life since he was 6,'' his mother, Silvana
Angeloni, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angeloni family traveled to San Antonio from Sardinia so
that Dr. Alexander West, a neurosurgeon at the University of Texas
Health Science Center, could remove the tumor from the base of the
teen-ager's brain that was causing the bizarre seizures. He
underwent surgery Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors say it's early, they are optimistic that the
seizures will no longer torment Angeloni and his family. Still,
some effects of the disorder, such as learning and cognitive
problems, may be difficult to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The Angelonis took their son to the United States after Italian
surgeons shied away from the operation. The tumor, known as a
hamartoma, was located at the base of the brain, near the
hypothalamus _ which controls eating, sleeping and other actions _
and the optic nerve, which controls sight.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the location of the tumor, several Italian physicians
believed the intricate neurosurgery was too risky and could result
in loss of sight, smell or paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angelonis said they were tired of the seemingly endless
routine of seizures, medications and hospitalizations that had
become their son's life. He had already been diagnosed as having a
drug-resistant form of epilepsy, leaving the Angelonis with little
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Family members contacted the American Epilepsy Foundation and
learned of West. Soon after, West happened to be traveling to Italy
for an international medical conference. When he arrived, Silvana
Angeloni was at the airport in Milan to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   West spent more than a week with the Angeloni family. After
carefully evaluating Angeloni's case and determining the area of
the brain was fairly accessible, West agreed to do the procedure at
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident we could do it safely with minimal risk,''
West said, adding that the rare tumor ``may be the only one I see
in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   West and his surgical team temporarily removed a bone above
Angeloni's right eye to gain a clear view of the brain and remove
the tumor. The procedure, while complex, went without complication,
West said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Angeloni was born with the brain tumor, the first signs
of his seizure disorder didn't begin until he was 6. At first he
suffered the episodes in his sleep, leading his parents to believe
they were nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy soon began suffering from other, bizarre actions,
such as bursting out in sudden laughter. These extremely rare
episodes, known as gelastic seizures, were confusing to both
Angeloni and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a normal social habit to smile when you're an infant, so
it was difficult to understand,'' said Dr. C. Akos Szabo, of the
health science center's Department of Medicine, who assisted in the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures progressed and varied as Angeloni grew older. On
the way to University Hospital the day of his recent surgery,
Angeloni even suffered a grand mal seizure _ an episode that causes
loss of consciousness, whole-body spasms and muscular convulsions,
as well as tongue-biting.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on such traumatic times, Angeloni's mother noted
Thursday how the procedure seems to have opened up an ``entirely
new future'' for the family. ``It is one of the best periods of our
life,'' she said.

SUPERCHUNK CALLS THE TUNES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- One of the battle cries of the mid- to late-1970s punk
rock movement was DIY, or Do It Yourself. A number of rock bands,
both American and British, took that simple but revolutionary
philosophy and applied it to everything from making the music to
marketing it, often via small, independent labels. If you formed
your own record label, they reasoned, you had both artistic and
financial control.
</P>
<P>
   It is this path singer-guitarist Mac McCaughan and bassist Laura
Ballance chose for their band Superchunk 10 years ago. They set up
a label, Merge, in Chapel Hill, N.C. The small company _ it has
four employees _ prospers on its own terms. Costs are kept down,
allowing the company to profit on a CD that might only sell 2,000
copies. A ``big'' act, such as Neutral Milk Hotel, might sell over
20,000 copies. Merge does ``one-off'' projects with various bands;
McCaughan guesses the present roster contains about a dozen groups,
including his own offshoot, the gently rocking Portastatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think we don't have any aptitude for (business) at
all,'' says McCaughan, from the Merge office, ``but we've managed
to hone our instincts about how we think our albums are going to
do. We're in a position where we have a small label with access to
great distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The label's No. 1 act? That would be Superchunk, which is just
beginning a US tour and stops at the Middle East Downstairs this
weekend. A lot of rockers make a face when someone calls making
music a ``career,'' but McCaughan cops to it. He looks at his and
the band's evolution this way: ``When we first started, all we
wanted was to be in a band, to make records and play shows. After a
while, it takes on a life of its own, becomes its own entity,
becomes more of a job. It's not a choice of do we want to go oun
tour? You have to do certain things to support your record.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're your own boss, you only have your own butt to
kick. And McCaughan says that for all boring routine of touring the
1 1/2 hours onstage makes up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Superchunk has been one of America's most consistent and
rewarding alt-pop bands over the past decade. Melody, crunch,
exuberance, wit, brains _ all there. Where does Superchunk fit into
the grand scheme of the pop parade?
</P>
<P>
   ``Movements and scenes are largely products of music writers,''
says McCaughan, ``and it's difficult to write about music. It's
easier to describe what they see as a movement. When we started, we
were the next Nirvana. Then (we were part of) the lo-fi scene, the
indie crowd grouped with Pavement. In some ways, though, if I had
to group us with anybody, I would group us with Pavement or Sebadoh
or Sonic Youth or Yo La Tengo, in terms of bands that have been
successful in doing what they want to do. All those bands have
changed the way they've sounded over the years, but the records are
consistently good. Somehow, we've managed to do that, too, and it's
not easy. I don't want to say we're as good or as influential as
some of those bands, but in terms of motivation and what the
results seem to be . . .''
</P>
<P>
   On the band's latest disc, its seventh full-length effort,
``Come Pick Me Up,'' the band recorded in Chicago and producer Jim
O'Rourke encouraged them to bring strings and horns to the mix.
They did so in a manner that seamlessly fits the music and adds
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ever have a game plan other than to say `These are
the songs we've written and let's record them now,' '' says
McCaughan. ``We knew working with Jim would open us up to other
possibilities, horns and charts, string players. We didn't want to
go overboard with it, but the songs lent themselves to that.
Listening to it now, it may be our poppiest record, which I didn't
know when we made it. I think it's lighter sound-wise and
feeling-wise; it's pretty airy, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyrically,'' he adds, ``I don't usually see a theme until
later. Thematically, it seems to be about people being stuck in
their lives or finding ways to not be stuck, trying to take
control. It's a pretty universal thing, even for people who sit
back and say their lives are good. Everybody feels stuck in some
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you allow McCaughan's assertion that ``Come Pick Me Up''
is a light record, be assured that it kicks, too, and the hooks
stick. As to the band in concert, make no mistake, with a
Buzzcockian power and punch. ``We're a punk rock band,'' says
McCaughan. ``Live, it's still pretty noisy and out of hand.''

<P>
   If George W. Bush can just hang in there until the backlash sets
in against the media, he may never have to answer the drug
question.
</P>
<P>
   Bush starts with a built-in advantage, after all: Voters don't
really give a hoot whether the Texas governor snorted cocaine when
he was a wild and crazy guy back in the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who truly care about this issue are the media
pests who keep asking the question; Bush's political opponents, who
keep egging the media on; and the relatively small segment of the
population that simply has no use for Bush and is hoping against
hope that his campaign for president will somehow self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   As the runaway front-runner in the race for the Republican
Party's 2000 presidential nomination, Bush makes an easy target for
any cheap-shot artist or headline hunter who comes along. He has
encountered plenty of both in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a chance encounter with reporters, much less a formal
news conference or interview, has gone by without some reporter
asking The Question: ``Have you ever used illegal drugs?'' _ the
phrase ``illegal drugs'' being a synonym for ``cocaine,'' which is
the drug that most of these folks are thoroughly convinced he used.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has refused to answer the question directly,
although he has confessed to long-ago, unspecified ``mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to persistent media badgering, he even went so far
as to state unequivocally that he had not used illegal drugs during
the last seven years or within 15 years of his father's 1989-1993
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't talk about the years before that, the years when he
was, he concedes, ``young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and
irresponsible,'' Bush has said.
</P>
<P>
   That's as far as he's prepared to go on the question of drugs _
except for alcohol, which he readily admits to abusing in the past.
He gave up drinking 13 years ago, at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he so willing to talk about his drinking but so adamantly
reticent about other possible drug use? Well, we don't know. He
won't talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's official explanation is that he's fed up with the
``politics of personal destruction,'' a phenomenon that he says is
perpetuated by a never-ending cycle of rumors, questions, answers,
more rumors, more questions ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody floats a rumor and it causes you to ask a question,''
Bush said in response to a reporter's question about drug use.
``And that's the game in American politics and I refuse to play
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. For the sake of discussion, let's assume that
Bush made the mistake of using cocaine during his previous life as
an irresponsible party animal. Let's say he admits to that. What
happens next?
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens. The instant he confessed to using
cocaine, the media would demand to know how many times he used it,
how regularly, where he was when he used it, who was with him when
he used it, if he was addicted, where he got it, whether he ever
sold some to his friends ...
</P>
<P>
   That's the game. He refuses to play.
</P>
<P>
   I say it's a good decision. I say the voters will thank him for
battling to protect at least a shred of privacy at a time when no
sliver of a public person's life seems exempt from manhandling by
the media.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Can he stick to his guns in the face of the
media onslaught? Can he go about the business of discussing
relevant and important issues in the presidential campaign while
fending off daily queries about drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Bush's most devoted supporters are wondering how
long he can resist the media's relentless demands that he answer
The Question.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decision that only Bush can make. But recent history
strongly suggests that the public will eventually get so fed up
with The Question that the media will be inclined to stop asking
it. There's always a backlash when the media goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   If he can hang in there until the backlash sets in, Bush just
might get through the whole campaign without answering The
Question.

THE MOFFATTS SHOW STYLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KRISSAH WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ They may look alike.
</P>
<P>
   They may sound alike.
</P>
<P>
   But the Moffatts sure don't dress alike. Each member of the
boy-band has an individual style. The four members, all brothers
(including a set of triplets), shared their fashion secrets during
a recent stop on Teen People's Rock `N' Shop Fashion Van tour.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing the back-to-school fashions provided by Dillard's at an
area mall, the guys chose gear they said fits their personalities.
The Moffatt brothers _ Bob, Dave and Clint, all 15, and Scott, 16,
_ have their own closets and don't share clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob picked a long-sleeve, navy knit shirt with an orange collar.
``You don't have to be really built to wear this kind of thing,''
he said, laughing as he flexed his muscles. His fashion tips for
guys include: matching belts with shoes and wearing dark-denim
jeans with a small cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Dave selected a pair of olive cargo shorts. He said they
complemented his casual style. On the stage, he opts for brighter
colors, like orange and red.
</P>
<P>
   Clint, who said his style changes with his mood, chose a white
Guess T-shirt and dark jeans. ``I'm really into white T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott found a pair of pants that he would wear with a T-shirt
and matching sneakers. A sports fan, he also picked out a blue
soccer jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The guys, who shop often to keep their style fresh, said they
sometimes try to go to the mall incognito, wearing baseball caps
and sunglasses. But when fans recognize them and ask for
autographs, they give them willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping is a great thing. It's one of my passions. I love
getting new clothes,'' Clint said. ``I have to refill and restock
my closet. I really go through clothes really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Teasing his brother Dave, Clint added: ``It's amazing, sometimes
Dave has cool clothes, but when it's on him I don't realize it's
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Already widely popular in their Canadian homeland and overseas,
the Moffatts are working to develop a fan base here.
</P>
<P>
   The switch from country music to a ``rock-pop'' style on their
new CD, ``Chapter I: A New Beginning,'' could be the answer. The
album already has gone platinum in Canada, Indonesia, Thailand and
the Philippines. The CD's first single, ``Until You Loved Me,''
appeared on the ``Never Been Kissed'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Scott plays guitar, Dave is on keyboards, Clint plays bass and
Bob is on drums. They all sing, with Scott taking the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to other brother-bands (like Hanson) leave the guys
undaunted. Like their clothing styles, they feel their music
reflects their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more alternative, and we have a lot more of an edge.
It's all music and (the variety of male-bands) give people
options,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been well received at stops along the Teen People
tour, which includes a 68-foot van packed with the latest fashions
and accessories. At the south Houston mall, hundreds of teen-age
girls showed up to see the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've loved them since they were country singers,'' said
Kathleen Garrahan, 14, who has been a Moffatts fan since she was in
third grade. Kathleen came from San Antonio with her best friend
Krystina Scott, 13, to see the concert. ``They are like my other
favorite band, Hanson,'' Krystina said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen, Krystina and other concert-goers left the mall with
free posters, CDs and other goodies. Only one question remained for
the Moffatts: What clothing trends do they suggest for girls?
</P>
<P>
   Baby-tees and dark-denim blue jeans or Capri pants.

GROUPS PUSH TO REVERSE PUNITIVE IMMIGRATION LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALISON GREGOR  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Immigrant advocates are counting on a shift in
national attitudes to help them roll back part of a 1996
immigration law that these critics say is ripping families apart by
requiring deportation of legal immigrants for minor crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a coalition pushing for changes in three 1996 laws
affecting immigrants say they are particularly encouraged by polls
showing a warming of national attitudes toward legal immigration,
which they believe has been reflected in the popularity of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, a candidate for the Republican nomination for
president.
</P>
<P>
   But at least for now, Bush has decided not to talk about the
four bills filed months ago in Congress that the advocates hope to
have enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, one of the GOP's leaders on
immigration issues and author of several of the provisions the
coalition wants changed, also isn't ready to say whether he would
support or oppose the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has chipped away at Smith's Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, along with provisions
that targeted immigrants contained in the Personal Responsibility
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, also enacted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two House bills and two Senate bills filed this year would
restore more welfare benefits to legal immigrants and change a
provision that now requires federal authorities to round up and
deport legal immigrants who have committed crimes, including minor
offenses, no matter how long ago they occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-factor in all of this is the race for the presidency in
2000,'' said Frank Sharry of the National Immigration Forum, a
pro-immigration group that, along with the American Bar Association
and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, are mounting a
campaign called Fix '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``With George W. Bush being the apparent leader for the (GOP)
nomination, it seems like both parties are likely to compete for
who could be more pro-immigrant,'' Sharry said. ``I think that's a
different dynamic in place that might result in surprising and
positive legislation to restore balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has publicly praised the contributions of immigrants and
two years ago helped create an $18 million nutrition assistance
program in Texas to replace food stamp benefits that the 1996
welfare overhaul had stripped from immigrants legally residing in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after a reporter provided copies of the bills to the
Bush campaign and asked whether he would sign or veto them if they
reached his desk as president, his campaign staff said the
candidate was declining comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the campaign develops, Governor Bush will lay out a
detailed platform on many subjects, including immigration,'' Bush
spokesman Dan Bartlett said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has consistently said that food stamp benefits
should not be retroactively denied for those elderly and disabled
immigrants who came to this country legally, worked and
contributed, but are now old and sick and cannot work,'' Bartlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates said the proposed bills are the first of a
flurry of legislation expected to be introduced to change the 1996
measures, which they believe had much more stringent effects
against legal immigrants than Congress predicted or intended.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of President Clinton, Congress since 1997 has
restored about half the total amount of welfare benefits immigrants
lost under the 1996 overhaul of welfare. Sharry said he was
optimistic that trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year we're likely to see some movement to restore
benefits for legal immigrants,'' he said. ``That's happened in each
of the last two years, and there's strong bipartisan support for
it. As part of the budget negotiations, to some extent, you're
likely to see further restoration of benefits.''

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four bills being supported by Fix '96 are:
</P>
<P>
   _ HR 1485, introduced by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., which would
give the attorney general discretion to cancel orders to deport
immigrants based on criminal convictions if they meet certain
criteria for length of residency and type of crime. It would modify
a 1996 provision that broadened the categories of crimes requiring
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   _ HR 185, introduced by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., which would
establish a U.S. Immigration Court to preside over deportation
cases and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   _ S 1227, introduced by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and
co-sponsored by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Republican
presidential contender, which would allow states to grant medical
assistance under the Medicaid program to pregnant women and
children who are legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   _ S 792, introduced by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
which would allow states to grant medical assistance to legal
immigrants who are children or are pregnant, blind or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic
presidential candidate, said Gore favors the Chafee and Moynihan
bills and supports the goals of Frank's proposal, but not its
current wording. Gore is still studying the McCollum bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is very much focused on the issues of
importance to the Hispanic community, and he will continue to be a
strong advocate on issues such as the unacceptably high Hispanic
dropout rate, restoring food stamp benefits to legal immigrants,
and the importance of the census,'' Gore spokesman Alejandro
Cabrera said.

virtually free university system in Mexico City that's paralyzed by
the strike. Mexicans empathize with the philosophy of free
education, but there are signs that people are simply fed up with
the students' tactics and intrasigence -- and think fees for
wealthier students might be a good idea. A July 24 poll showed that
only 48 percent of respondents would oppose the use of force to

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a 28.8K modem, but when I download
something, I download at 4.24K per second. Is there anything wrong
with my modem?
</P>
<P>
   _ Impatient
</P>
<P>
   DEAR IMP: Yes. You should go out immediately and buy a new one.
And I'm not saying that just because I'm trying to get a kickback
from 3Com. Well, that's not true, but because I haven't heard back
from them, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Your modem is capable of connecting at approximately 28.8
kilobits per second. Most browsers measure downloads in kilobytes
per second. A byte is composed of eight bits. I know, the math
still doesn't work out, even with all the extra bits that help
verify a successful download thrown in. Download speed not only
depends on how fast you're connected, but how fast the remote
location can serve up a file to you, and there are so many
variables involved, it's not even funny. Be satisfied with your
4.24, and thanks for blowing the 3Com deal. I wonder if anybody
from Rockwell was reading this. ...
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I downloaded a game from the Net, and when it
asked what program to open it with, I didn't know which, so I
clicked on Dr. Watson. How do I change the program I open this file
with? Every time I download a game or demo, it won't open because

   DEAR OVER: Like the family cocker spaniel, Windows desperately
tries to please you. If it doesn't know how to do something, it
looks to you for guidance, which, in my case, explains why my
ex-dog thought drinking spilled beer on the floor was a good thing
and made everybody happy. In effect, you have told your cocker
spaniel to lick the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Windows tries to open programs based on file extensions. An EXE
extension means it's an executable file and should open or start
running on its own. Most downloads come that way. Something with a
ZIP extension is a zipped, or compressed, file, and you need a
special utility (WinZip32 is one) to open it. If you don't have the
utility, Windows asks you what to use instead. If you don't know
what to use, it's better to bail and try to figure out what you
really need.
</P>
<P>
   Open up ``My Computer'' and look for Folder Options in the View
menu. In there, you'll find File Types. This is where Windows
associates helper programs with file extensions. Just find the one
you added and delete it.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What impressed me about your recent comments
about America Online is that you immediately said that you really
were not informed, for example, referring to AOL's on-hold music as
``Muzak.'' If you have ever been on hold with AOL and listened to
the background music (soft volume, not loud!), then you would know
they play classical music. ``Scheherazade'' and ``1812 Overture''
are two I have heard on numerous occasions. I don't think either of
them would be on the top of Muzak's easy-listening list.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a 28.8K modem, but when I download
something, I download at 4.24K per second. Is there anything wrong
with my modem?
</P>
<P>
   _ Impatient
</P>
<P>
   DEAR IMP: Yes. You should go out immediately and buy a new one.
And I'm not saying that just because I'm trying to get a kickback
from 3Com. Well, that's not true, but because I haven't heard back
from them, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Your modem is capable of connecting at approximately 28.8
kilobits per second. Most browsers measure downloads in kilobytes
per second. A byte is composed of eight bits. I know, the math
still doesn't work out, even with all the extra bits that help
verify a successful download thrown in. Download speed not only
depends on how fast you're connected, but how fast the remote
location can serve up a file to you, and there are so many
variables involved, it's not even funny. Be satisfied with your
4.24, and thanks for blowing the 3Com deal. I wonder if anybody
from Rockwell was reading this. ...
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I downloaded a game from the Net, and when it
asked what program to open it with, I didn't know which, so I
clicked on Dr. Watson. How do I change the program I open this file
with? Every time I download a game or demo, it won't open because
of it.

TOURING THE ENGLAND OF THE BEATLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Let others journey to Paris in search of Hemingway's
cafes or walk the streets of Salzburg listening for the echoes of
Mozart. The Beatles are my cultural heroes, and I'd come to England
for an immersion course in Beatlemania.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment I heard their mono LPs _ with pennies holding
down the tone arm on my record player _ I've wanted to see
Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane and the train station from ``A
Hard Day's Night.''
</P>
<P>
   I've wanted to inhale the dank aroma of the Cavern Club and hear
a droll Liverpool accent and, yes, put my life on the line for a
picture in the Abbey Road crosswalk. Most of all, I've wanted to
understand the connection between these unremarkable places and the
remarkable music they inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after they went their separate ways, the
Beatles are firmly enshrined as cultural icons in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Their handwritten song lyrics, scribbled on airline stationary
and the backs of greeting cards, are on permanent display in the
British Library, just steps from the Magna Carta and Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Paul McCartney's childhood home in Liverpool is owned by the
National Trust, which also owns homes of Winston Churchill, Thomas
Hardy and Rudyard Kipling.
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool and London, the two main Beatles cities, abound with
Beatles walking tours, Beatles bus tours, Beatles guidebooks,
Beatles museums and Beatles memorabilia shops.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to visit Liverpool, the scene of their formative
days, first. There's enough to see that it's worth spending at
least two days there, but my wife Jeri and I journeyed up from our
base in London as, well, day-trippers. A ticket costs $114, round
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Unfairly, Liverpool has been stuck with the reputation as a
grim, depressed, dead-end city. This probably stems from stories of
the Beatles' early years in the late 1950s, when the port city,
bombed heavily in World War II, was still struggling to get back on
its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, England's third-largest metropolis is prosperous and
pleasant, with a lively downtown business district and expansive
green parks. New auto and pharmaceutical plants have opened, the
port is busier than ever and ferries still cross the Mersey river.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was 20 Forthlin Road, part of a tidy ``council
estate'' _ the British term for public housing _ in the city's
working-class Allerton district.
</P>
<P>
   The row house where Paul McCartney lived with his father and
brother between 1955 and 1964 has been faithfully restored to its
original condition by the National Trust. The walls are hung with
photos from those days taken by McCartney's brother, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   His mother (``Mother Mary'' of ``Let It Be'') died of breast
cancer shortly after they moved in, and Paul grew up as a latch-key
kid.
</P>
<P>
   According to his tape-recorded reminiscences on the self-guided
tour, he and his friend John Lennon used to cut school and sit for
hours in the house's tiny front parlor with their guitars,
composing songs.
</P>
<P>
   It was here and in Paul's upstairs bedroom _ so tiny you can
just about touch all four walls at once _ that they wrote, among
others, ``Love Me Do,'' ``I Saw Her Standing There'' and ``She
Loves You.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney recalled the first time he played the latter, with its
``yeah, yeah, yeah'' refrain, for his father.
</P>
<P>
   His father complained about those ``Americanisms,'' McCartney
said, and wonder why he couldn't just sing ``Yes, yes, yes''?
</P>
<P>
   Next up was a quick tour of ``The Beatles Story,'' a museum at
the redeveloped Albert Dock with exhibits from their early Hamburg
and Liverpool days, including their collarless suits and original
drummer Pete Best's drumsticks. It was a good primer in Beatles
history, filled with baby boomers trying to explain to their
children what life was like before the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the museum we joined the Magical Mystery Tour, a
two-hour circuit of Liverpool's Beatle sites in a 1960s bus painted
like the one used in one of the group's more ill-considered
projects. As a guest book was passed around to sign, I was reminded
yet again of the Beatles' universal appeal. On this day the tour
included fans from Japan, Australia, Israel and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   We visited each of the Beatles' childhood homes and punctured
the longstanding myth that John came from the toughest, most
impoverished background. Ringo, who grew up in the rough ``Dingle''
neighborhood of Irish immigrants, was easily the poorest, followed
by George and Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon lived with his Aunt Mimi in Liverpool's leafy Woolton
district.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, on Church Road, stands square-towered St. Peter's
Parish Church. It was here, on July 6, 1957, that John's schoolboy
skiffle group, the Quarry Men, was performing at the annual Woolton
Fete. Fifteen-year-old Paul dropped by _ he'd heard it was a good
place to pick up girls _ and a partnership was born.
</P>
<P>
   In the church graveyard there's a headstone with a familiar
name: Eleanor Rigby. McCartney always has maintained he invented
the name, but the grave site suggests his memory may be faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner from Lennon's childhood home, on Beacon
Street, we stopped at the gates to the Victorian-era Salvation Army
orphanage known as Strawberry Field. (For reasons unknown, John
pluralized it in the song.) Lennon could hear the Salvation Army
band playing from his backyard _ one of the inspirations, some
Beatleologists believe, for ``Sgt. Pepper.''
</P>
<P>
   The front gates were covered with chalk-written messages from
fans, bits of lyrics, scrawled signatures, declarations of love.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry Field still operates as an orphanage. Lennon paid for
a new wing to be built in 1979, and since his death his widow, Yoko
Ono, has given generously toward improvements.
</P>
<P>
   As we rounded a corner, our guide, Eddie Porter _ who grew up in
Liverpool at the same time as the Beatles, played in a rival band
and seems to know everyone in town _ waved to a white-haired old
man with a vaguely familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Charlie Lennon, John's uncle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away is the business district that played a central part
in the young lives of both Lennon and McCartney: Penny Lane.
</P>
<P>
   It looks much as it did in their time, although ``the shelter in
the middle of the roundabout,'' where Paul composed much of the
song while waiting for John, is now the Sgt. Pepper's Bistro. On
one side is Lloyds TSB Bank, where ``the banker never wears a mac
(rain jacket) in the pouring rain.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other is the Tony Slavin Ladies and Gentleman Stylists,
where ``the banker sits waiting for a trim.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't time to stop and walk around on this tour, but on
an earlier visit I talked to a Penny Lane shopkeeper who claimed to
remember John Lennon well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't much of a musician back then, but he was a right
good shoplifter.''
</P>
<P>
   (It should be pointed out, though, that hoodwinking tourists
with invented Beatle stories _ ``Fab Fibs'' _ is a favorite pastime
of Liverpudlians. Just the same, Lennon's juvenile delinquency is
well-documented.)
</P>
<P>
   Our tour ended at the Cavern Club, the subterranean,
catacomb-like venue where the Beatles played 274 times between 1961
and 1963 and met their future manager, Brian Epstein. The Cavern
was closed and paved over in 1973, but was rebuilt at virtually the
same site in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly original,'' said owner Bill Heckle, ``but
it's not a fake, either.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a Beatles plaque at the entrance and ``Twist and Shout''
blares into Mathew Street from a speaker. Inside, down two flights
of stairs, I was glad to see it's a real, working club, not a tacky
Fab Four tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It smelled of disinfectant and sweat, just as it did in the
Beatles' days, and a playbill announced that two young Liverpool
groups, ``Warped'' and ``Pineapple,'' would be playing that night.
I yearned to stay and hear them, to see Liverpudlians crowding the
tiny dance floor and condensation running down the brick walls.
</P>
<P>
   But we had to return to Londaon, a three-hour train ride.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the day we'd set aside for our London Beatles
tour was a special occasion: the 30th anniversary of the shooting
of the Abbey Road photo. Richard Porter, president of the London
Beatles Fan Club, had put together a special day-long tour for the
ultimate Beatles fan.
</P>
<P>
   Our day began at the Abbey Road crosswalk in time to mark the
exact minute _ 11:35 a.m. _ the photo was taken. Downtown, we
walked past the site of the Indica Art Gallery, now vacant, where
John met Yoko at an exhibit in 1967. ``John dropped by for an event
called a `Happening in a Bag,' and was disappointed to find out it
wasn't an orgy,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to 3 Saville Row, in the heart of the
fine-tailoring district. This stately office was the site of the
Beatles' last public performance, the rooftop concert at the end of
``Let It Be.''
</P>
<P>
   The street's tailors complained constantly to the police about
the groupies, mystics and autograph-seekers who crowded around the
front door 24 hours a day, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on Argyll Street, is the theater where, in
1963, the Beatles first appeared on ``Sunday Night at the
Palladium,'' Britain's version of the Ed Sullivan Show. Thousands
of shrieking fans filled the streets outside, and London's Fleet
Street press coined a new word: ``Beatlemania.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater currently is showing a stage performance of
``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the place where Beatlemania first began to falter.
Sutherland House, manager Brian Epstein's London office, is where
John Lennon gave an interview to Maureen Cleeve of the Evening
Standard that included his infamous ``we are more popular than
Jesus'' quote.
</P>
<P>
   The people on the tour were almost frighteningly well-versed in
Beatles lore. They often finished Porter's stories for him, and no
site was too obscure for them. At least two of them had visited a
bakery owned by Jane Asher, Paul's one-time girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   A quick stroll down Carnaby Street, clothiers of Swinging London
(and a prime sartorial inspiration for Austin Powers), led us to
Soho Square and the headquarters of MPL Communications, Paul
McCartney's London offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hang around here long enough, you'll eventually see Sir
Paul,'' said Porter, passing around snapshots to prove his point.
``He comes by about once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   We boarded minivans for a tour of Beatle film sites in London's
suburbs. Not everyone, it must be noted, was thrilled to see us. As
we crowded into the City Barge pub along the River Thames in
Strand-on-the-Green _ where Ringo ended up in the basement with the
tiger in ``Help!'' _ the bartender drew our pints with barely
disguised contempt. ``Beatles people,'' he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a different story at the row houses along Ailson
Avenue in Twickenham, where _ also in ``Help!'' _ the four Beatles
entered separate doorways only to emerge in the same large living
room. (The inside shots were filmed in a studio.)
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Brady, who lived there at the time, was happy to come
out of her house and share stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls were screaming, and they had to string up a rope to
hold them back,'' she said. ``Paul would come out and give a wave,
and that would set them all off again.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``They were great guys. They'd come into peoples'
houses for tea, and they spent a lot of time chatting with us. For
years we were getting letters from fans, saying, `Please pass this
on to Ringo,' that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in London, a special treat awaited us: a living piece of
Beatles history _ Rod Davis, an original member of the Quarry Men,
the Liverpool skiffle group that evolved into the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Thin, neatly groomed and gray-bearded, Davis was at the Beatles
For Sale memorabilia shop autographing copies of the Quarry Men's
reunion CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't kicked out of the group _ I just sort of drifted
away, and it didn't seem like any big deal at the time,'' he told
me.

Beware of the mud to be slung back and forth between the camps of

of: (a) the incessant honking of horns; (b) the clear and present
danger of police, without warning, barging into the homes of
innocent citizens and dragging them off to ``Cats''; (c) the
strange, mostly unidentifiable, smells; (d) the guilty conscience
that comes with having inspired in any way ``Mad About You''; or
(e) all the above.

</P>
<P>
   Keeps away some of the riffraff.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been riffraff for so long, the natural impulse is
to take them about as seriously as Weird Al Yankovic. Mets manager
Bobby Valentine has as many first-place finishes as Charlie Brown.
The Mets tried to fortify their pitching staff by trading for
left-hander Kenny Rogers, who wilted under the white-hot playoff
lights as a Yankee. Valentine is as popular in baseball circles as
Larry Flynt is among the Republican Party, but that shouldn't
detract from what the Mets have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, barely two months have passed since general manager
Steve Phillips fired three members of Valentine's coaching staff.
The Mets were 27-28 and had lost eight in a row, prompting
Valentine to give himself this ultimatum: ``I'm not worried about
my job. I believe, though, that in the next 55 games, if we're not
better, I shouldn't be the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has managed to steer the Mets to 26 games above .500 _
the franchise's high-water mark since the end of the 1988 season.
Those were the days when Darryl Strawberry and Doc Gooden had a map
and engraved invitations to the Hall of Fame. Orel Hershiser and
the Los Angeles Dodgers may not have done any humbling of the
Darryl-and-Doc Mets, but crumbling sure ensued.
</P>
<P>
   These Mets have won more road games than anybody in the majors,
evidence that they have the maturity to beat anybody anywhere. They
should have maturity on their side, what with fellow 40-year-olds
Rickey Henderson and Hershiser filling key roles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot can happen between now and October. The Mets
are living proof of how much things can change in two months.
Having the best record at the end of the season, let alone now, is
no guarantee of a long and prosperous playoff life. If Dan Reichert
(12.08 earned run average before Wednesday) and Blake Stein (career
6.15 ERA before Thursday) can shackle the Yankees on consecutive
days, then everybody is vulnerable in a short playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, the Mets ran the gamut from hopeless to
helpless in losing three straight at home against the Dodgers. The
Mets have gone 7-2 since then to overtake the Atlanta Braves in the
NL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through enough not to let (a bad stretch) get us
down,'' Valentine said. ``Yesterday doesn't affect today, and
tomorrow is far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibilities of October are too tantalizing to
ignore. The competition. The contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre, with his quiet self-assurance in a
city that once viewed him as Clueless Joe. Valentine, with his
moody, chip-on-the-shoulder demeanor. The classic pinstripes of the
Yankees. The cheesy black, blue and orange getup of the Mets.
Revered Yankee Stadium. Reviled Shea Stadium. Derek Jeter:
shortstop, superstar and eligible bachelor. Mike Piazza: catcher,
superstar and eligible bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Giuliani and Clinton would be tussling
for the affections of the Yankees' constituency. Giuliani is a
life-long Yankees fan who treats the Mets like the stepson who will
not, under any circumstances, get any of the inheritance. The First
Lady is a life-long Chicago Cubs fan who recently declared her
allegiance to the Yankees. Of course, if the Yankees were to get to
the World Series, and fall behind to the other team in New York ...
</P>
<P>
   So the two teams proceed, on a collision course with the past
and future. October 1999 could turn out to have a retro subway
feel. Just don't ask the Mets to indulge in a look at the past or
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn Back The Clock'' was all of the past the Mets could
handle. The Mets donned 1969 uniforms for a July promotion against
Tampa Bay and lost. Later in the month, they endured the indignity
of ``Turn Ahead The Clock.'' Wearing pseudo 2021 attire, the Mets
vanished into the Twilight Zone during a defeat to the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't beamed up to the proper coordinates,'' Piazza
explained afterward. On the days when the Mets don't have to set
their clocks decades into the past and future, they have the best
record in baseball. No wonder they prefer to stay rooted in the
present.

<HEADLINE>
`WISH YOU WERE HERE' AND OTHER POSTCARD MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (for use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Whe it comes to postcard wit, it's hard to top Jimmy
Buffett's classic line: ``The weather is here, wish you were
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But I don't know a single person I could send it to who wouldn't
slap me when I got home.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of this the other day as I sat in a London pub with a
stack of blank postcards in front of me and an equally vacant mind.
Not for the first time, I wondered if mailing postcards was really
worth all the bother.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, of course, is that no matter what you write _
no matter how breezily you describe the swaying palm trees or the
paisley sunsets or the frothy umbrella drinks _ your message can
always be summed up as: ``I'm somewhere fabulous right now. And
you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Your friends who don't travel much probably roll their eyes,
mutter something unkind about you and toss your postcard straight
into the garbage can. Your friends who do travel a lot _ well,
they're probably not home anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from me: It doesn't do any good to try to ease the
recipient's jealousy by quibbling with the weather or the food or
the flat, room-temperature beer. You come across as someone who's
somewhere fabulous _ and whining about it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're overseas and want your postcards to arrive home before
you do, you've pretty much got to mail them the day you arrive. At
this point in your journey there's usually not a whole lot to say:
``A bit of turbulence over Iceland. Luggage didn't get lost. Give
my love to Aunt Myrtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is more to say, I'm generally good for, at most,
only one pithy comment per destination. Once, in Kenya, I sent off
a batch of postcards with the line, ``We were charged by an
elephant and overcharged by a Nairobi shopkeeper'' _ only to
discover when I got home that the various recipients had all shared
their postcards with each other. After being repeated a dozen
times, the line _ admittedly pretty weak to begin with _ looked
considerably less than witty.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally I've gotten so carried away in my ramblings that
I've forgotten to leave room for stamps. There's nothing to do but
throw away the card and start over. However, a bigger peril these
days is the bar code strip the U.S. Postal Service affixes to the
bottoms of postcards. They have an unerring instinct for covering
up the punch line to a long anecdote, or, more commonly, for
blotting out the sender's name entirely. Every couple of weeks I
receive a postcard from some mystery correspondent who's having a
wonderful time on a palm-fringed beach and wishing I were there.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a hotel or convenience store that will sell
you a stamp, you've got to give up half a day of sightseeing and
stand in line at the local post office, many of which make the U.S.
Postal Service look like models of efficiency and cheerfulness.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, guidebooks routinely warn that if you don't
watch the postal clerk cancel the stamp at the counter, he'll wait
until you leave, peel off the stamp and re-sell it to the next
person in line. Your postcard gets tossed in the trash. It's hard
to imagine anyone going to such lengths for 40 or 50 cents, but
I've read the warning so many times I half-believe it.
</P>
<P>
   You may end up doing what I usually resort to: carrying the
postcards home with you and hand-delivering them.

   JAPAN-BANKS (Tokyo) _ Looking at the announcement by three of
Japan's biggest banks of plans to merge their businesses in an
alliance that would create the world's largest banking group, with
assets of more than $1 trillion. The three _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Fuji Bank and IBJ _ say they will form a joint holding company by
fall of 2000 and then cut jobs by a fifth and close nearly 150
branches of the combined operations. The plan may give a lift to a
troubled national industry that has fallen behind in an
increasingly competitive global business. But others are skeptical
whether such a deal would solve the deep-seated problems in Japan's
banking system. By Calvin Sims.

historians, the R.G. Dun &AMP; Co. Collection at Harvard University is
the Holy Grail. The credit assessments are invaluable to historians
in part because they avoid corporate spin and show the unbiased
view of a third party _ in this case, the agents, or

   WALL-STREET-DORMITORY (New York) _ The residents of 45 Wall

PIANIST RESPONDS TO CRESCENDO OF INSULTS WITH LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The letter to Garrick Ohlsson contains a
symphony of insults.
</P>
<P>
   A three-page missive addressed to the renowned concert pianist,
it appears to be separated into movements. Dizzying highs.
Deceptive lows. Dazzling crescendos of put-downs and personal
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grow up,'' the letter states, in one of its livelier passages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bone-crushing reign as a gifted adolescent ended a long
time ago and we're all bored to sobs with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter came from Ohlsson's manager, Vincent Ryan. Ohlsson
responded with a lawsuit, claiming the words are so brutal that
they cross the line into defamation and ``infliction of emotional
distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say that if it's not a first, it's certainly a rarity:
The recipient of a nasty note suing to recover monetary damages
based on the contents.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed against Arts Management Group Inc. in
San Francisco Superior Court last week. The war of words appeared
to begin when Ohlsson, a San Francisco resident, decided to change
management to Los Angeles-based International Creative Management.
</P>
<P>
   AMG's New York-based lawyer, Robert Helfand, said his client
doesn't want to discuss the matter with anyone except Ohlsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMG is sorry Mr. Ohlsson has felt the need to carry this
dispute into court,'' Helfand said. ``We believe the complaint has
no merit and that AMG will win the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlsson, 51, has been playing in the San Francisco Bay Area for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that the virtuoso was represented by Ryan for
19 years. Ohlsson signed his latest contract in June 1998,
promising 20 percent of his gross fees to AMG.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship declined drastically shortly after that
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Letters between Ohlsson and Ryan, included in the lawsuit as
exhibits, show that the pianist decided to leave AMG in part
because he wanted more exposure in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at the highest international level,'' Ohlsson wrote to
Ryan and another manager in an April 30 letter. ``I need to work
with people capable of showing up and working at that level with an
international vision.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Ryan faxed Ohlsson at a hotel in
Akron, Ohio, five days later. His response appeared to spare no
insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you have appeared just about everywhere in Europe for
three decades, it is remarkable that the message has not gotten
through to you that Europe has made its choices,'' the letter
reads. ``Wake up, for Christ's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlsson's lawsuit asserts that the letter harmed his
professional reputation, also causing him ``anxiety, embarrassment,
humiliation and anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants punitive damages, along with his legal fees paid.
Ohlsson also is seeking a court order that says Ryan's letter
effectively terminated his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlsson's lawyer, David Mattingly, said his client was ``deeply
admired and loved'' around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that his former New York agent, Arts
Management Group, has sought to undermine his reputation and
well-being by its untoward conduct,'' Mattingly said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter may be harsh, but a legal scholar said it could be
very difficult for Ohlsson to get the case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Cohen, a professor at the University of California
Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, said there is a lot
of room in the law for angry people to express their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is not intended to do what our kindergarten teachers
wanted us to do: Be nice,'' Cohen said.

WHERE YOU CAN `BUY THAT DREAM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My husband passed away in January of this year. In old
letters, I found mention of a song he liked very much called ``I'll
Buy That Dream.'' I can't remember this song _ can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ F.N., Weatherford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I'll Buy That Dream'' was a hit song introduced in the 1945
film ``Sing Your Way Home,'' a wartime high-seas musical starring
Jack Haley and Anne Jeffreys.
</P>
<P>
   The song was a 13-week winner on the ``Lucky Strike Hit Parade''
radio show and was nominated for a best song Oscar, losing to ``It
Might as Well Be Spring'' from ``State Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Dream was sung by by Anne Jeffreys in the film, and was a hit
for Dick Haymes and Helen Forrest. The 1999 Duke Ellington release
``Duke's Joint'' includes the song, and you can also find it on
``Vol. 1 _ The Very Best of Dick Haymes'' and the ``Hits of '46''
collection.
</P>
<P>
   These lyrics may jog your memory: ``Imagine me with my head on
your shoulder/and you with your lips growing bolder/a sky full of
moon/and a sweet mellow tune/I'll buy that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all of the discussion about when the next millennium
begins and the argument that there was no ``year 0,'' when did the
modern Western calendar start? At what point did someone say,
``Well, let's see, Jesus lived 125 years ago, so this is A.D.
126?''
</P>
<P>
   _ R.W., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: That event happened in around A.D. 532, when the Scythian
monk Dionysius Exiguus overhauled the calendar to stop paying
homage to a Roman emperor who persecuted Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In a table indicating when Easter should be celebrated, Exiguus
counted years from the birth of Jesus rather than the reign of
Emperor Diocletian.
</P>
<P>
   His new system had no year 0, skipping from 1 B.C. (''Before
Christ'') to A.D. 1 (''Anno Domini''). The concept of zero as a
number wouldn't be adopted in Europe for another three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars believe that Jesus was born between 7 B.C. and 4
B.C., making the Exiguus system inaccurate and the coming year 2000
celebrations several years late.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend gave me some self-tanning lotion made by Sun
Laboratories in Beverly Hills, Calif., but couldn't remember where
she got it. Where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.M.L., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: One company that sells Sun Laboratories tanning products is
the Internet retailer SkinSalon.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can order the products online at at www.skinsalon.com or by
mail.
</P>
<P>
   To contact the company for mail-order information, call (818)
790-4885 or write to 2222 Foothill Blvd., Suite E-210, La Canada,
CA 91011-1456.
</P>
<P>
   Sun makes self-tanning sets, exfoliant gels and ``tan
moisturizer maintainers.'' The SkinSalon site also sells Epilyt
Moisturizer, Body Therapeutics sunblock and NeoStrata Exuviance
skin care products.

ONE KEY TO THE `GUN PROBLEM': ENFORCE THE LAWS WE HAVE NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the twisted, dark recesses of the mind of Buford O.
Furrow Jr., one reality did manage to seep through. If you're going
to target someplace to make a statement with bullets, pick a spot
where no one will be shooting back.
</P>
<P>
   The avowed racist had several Jewish organizations on his hit
list last week as potential sites for his hate-driven ``wake-up
call to America.'' He picked the North Valley Jewish Community
Center outside of Los Angeles because security at the other
buildings was too intense.
</P>
<P>
   Even a madman was sane enough to recognize that when the good
guys have guns, it's not smart to jack with them.
</P>
<P>
   It is so basic that it should be intuitive for every American:
Good people with guns are a threat only to bad people, while bad
people with guns are a threat to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   So we should be doing what we can to keep guns from bad people,
right? Yet the push in Washington is to write more gun laws that
will impact the good people and continue to be ignored by bad
people for many reasons, among them the fact that the odds against
strict enforcement are in the bad people's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers write laws hoping that they will deter
unacceptable social behavior. Since a negative can't be proven,
it's impossible to quantify how many people toyed with the idea of
mayhem but discarded it because a law stood in the way of carrying
out the plan. But a law with no enforced consequence is meaningless
against those who are willing to test it. If the tiger is toothless
and clawless, it doesn't take much for sick prey to outmaneuver the
beast.
</P>
<P>
   This nation does have a gun-related problem, and it's the lack
of will to put dollars into enforcing laws already scribbled within
government's legal tomes. This is one facet of the gun debate where
the most strident of both sides _ the vocal minority that would be
tickled by a complete ban on private gun ownership, and the vocal
minority that believes any regulation is a threat to
constitutionally guaranteed rights _ should be able to agree.
Enforcement must be a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Had existing laws been enforced, perhaps Furrow would not have
possessed the firepower he used to fire 70 rounds into that day
camp, wounding three children. Perhaps he wouldn't have had the
handgun from which to fire the fatal shots at postal worker Joseph
Ileto. Furrow was under a court order not to have firearms in his
possession. Law enforcement personnel never followed up on that
directive.
</P>
<P>
   The reality in this world is that subhumans like Buford Furrow
will continue to slither through the cracks. Evil has always had a
way of doing that. But that court order, if enforced, would have
been one more obstacle in his way, one more opportunity to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, obviously, make laws. But writing legislation without
including the dollars needed to enforce it is just an exercise in
political posturing.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Constant, one of the great classical liberal thinkers
of the 19th century (that's ``liberal'' in the traditional
definition of one who believes that liberty is mankind's highest
political goal and that religious faith, a free-market economy and
limited government are central to that goal), had it right when he
said: ``Whenever there is no absolute necessity, whenever
legislation may fail to intervene without society being overthrown,
whenever, finally, it is a question merely of some hypothetical
improvement, the law must abstain, leave things alone, and keep
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the changes being proposed in the federal gun laws are
little more than hypothetical improvements. Although high-profile
cases such as Furrow's make it seem otherwise, gun violence is
statistically on the decline in this country. Unintentional
firearms deaths _ down. Homicides by firearms _ down. Suicides by
firearms _ down. School violence _ down.
</P>
<P>
   What this country has done, for the most part, is working. But
one more concrete step toward shoring up the gaps that remain is
making prosecuting gun-related cases a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Do what Chicago did this week. Agents from the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms cracked down on suburban gun dealers
who violated the law by selling to people they knew were going to
take banned handguns inside the city limits of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Do what Richmond, Va., has done with Project Exile (for the
record, a program strongly supported by the National Rifle
Association). Police and prosecutors strictly enforce federal gun
laws, which carry stiffer penalties than state offenses. Anyone
arrested on a drug offense who is also carrying a gun feels the
full force of the law. The homicide and robbery rates in that city
fell 30 percent, and more than 500 guns were taken off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of putting money into filing nuisance lawsuits against
gun manufacturers in an end-run attempt to legislate through the
judiciary, cities, counties and states should be putting dollars
into the enforcement of existing gun laws.

   BUSH-2000 (Akron, Ohio) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush says he will
still give federal money to faith-based organizations to perform
the social services once provided by the government, even if they

   SOLOMON-LOBBYIST (Washington) _ It's difficult to tell that
Gerald B.H. Solomon has changed careers from U.S. congressman to

holder with ``SOLOMON'' emblazoned on the side. And the man who

``There's no shortage of high-tech workers,'' Nelson says.

say the special assembly charged with the task is a rubber stamp
for Chavez's whims and warn that it could lead to the closing of
Congress and the Supreme Court and authoritarian powers for Chavez.

WE MUST CHALLENGE THOSE WHO HATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We who live in the religious majority can't even imagine the
pain and the verbal slaps in the face _ and the occasional violence
_ endured by those who live in the religious minority.
</P>
<P>
   I was forcefully reminded of that last week when talking with
some of my Jewish friends and acquaintances concerning the
horrendous hate crimes that have occurred in America lately.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest instance, a white supremacist misfit named Buford
O'Neal Furrow
</P>
<P>
   fired 70 shots into a Jewish Community Center in California,
wounding five people. He also confessed to killing a postal worker
near the center.
</P>
<P>
   He did it all in the name of his twisted faith and said he hoped
his horrendous act would be ``a wake-up call to America to kill
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   We need a wake-up call, all right.
</P>
<P>
   We need to be more alert to the hate groups, often identifying
themselves as ``Christian,'' that seem to be increasing in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Religious freedom is a hallmark of our American democratic
experiment. But when faith turns violent, it needs to be
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate violation of religious freedom comes when crazed
people like Furrow decide to gun down those who have a different
faith or ethnic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Other ``hate crimes'' have occurred recently. Two brothers,
Matthew and Tyler Williams, have been charged with torching three
synagogues and killing a gay couple in California.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Aaronson, executive director of Congregation Beth Shalom
in Arlington, Texas, said religious bigotry is an everyday concern
for Jewish families everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a day that a Jewish mother sends their child to
school that she doesn't worry about that child,'' she said. ``We
worry that someone will ask them `Why don't you celebrate
Christmas?' or `You are going to hell because you don't believe in
Jesus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aaronson said the bigots are in the minority, but they are still
there.
</P>
<P>
   The California shooting is even more detestable, Aaronson said,
because it was aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who targets children _ the most innocent of innocents _
is committing more than a `hate crime,''' she said. It is a crime
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith recently reported
that anti-Semitic incidents increased by 2 percent last year after
declines in such incidents during the previous three years. But
many such crimes go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth-Dallas area there are few anti-Semitic
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have few problems,'' said Don Dossey, a leader of
Congregation Kol Ami in Flower Mound in Denton County. ``Our only
incident came when someone painted (swastikas) on the front of our
building. But they did the same thing to a Baptist church next
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yosef Hodakov, the leader of this area's conservative
Chabad Lubavitch organization, sees little overt anti-Semitism.
When he hears a slur, he chalks it up to ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, witnessing any of this is very painful,'' he said.
``In America, we've come so far as a nation that we've become known
as an open and welcoming society.''
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of hate groups, including many with Web sites,
is a heightening concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult, because we are a free country and believe
in free speech, but we need to crack down on these groups,'' he
said. ``Words sometimes lead to actions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst things that could be done, the rabbi said,
would be to return violence with violence.
</P>
<P>
   What the terrible hate crimes might do, he said, is to remind us
to be even more loving and accepting of all people.
</P>
<P>
   He is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, light overcomes darkness,'' he said. ``You can
light a small candle in a dark room, and soon that tiny light will
brighten the entire room.''

 &HT;    FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND TV STAR THRIVES AT ``COOTER'S ``

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPERRYVILLE, Va. _ Followed by his hesitant family from Ward,
Ark., (population 700), Kevin Bernard approached the former Georgia
congressman perched on the hood of the orange '69 Dodge Charger and
inquired, ``You're the real thing, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Yessiree. It's ol' Cooter, all right. Seven years after leaving
Capitol Hill, Ben Jones is living his role as the greasy,
good-natured mechanic on the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' and cashing in on
the show's revival on cable by The Nashville Network. From
Thursdays through Sundays, Jones presides at a garage converted to
the ``Hazzard General Store'' beside a two-lane highway winding
toward the Shenandoah National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't Disneyland,'' Jones cheerfully concedes. ``If we're
open, I'm here. This is what it is _ me talking to folks, posing by
the General Lee, signing pictures, singing ...''
</P>
<P>
   The General Lee, for those who never visited TV's Hazzard
County, is the souped-up car with a Confederate flag painted on top
that cousins Bo and Luke Duke took airborne every episode in
eluding the greedy Boss Hogg and the bumbling Sheriff Rosco P.
Coltrane.
</P>
<P>
   The Charger parked beneath the ``Cooter's'' sign outside of
Sperryville is one of 229 General Lee's used in the series, said
Jones. About 1,500 vehicles of all sorts were wrecked during the
seven years that the program ran on CBS, ending in 1985. Cooter
spent considerable screen time driving a tow truck to pick up
police cars that had smashed up chasing the Duke boys.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the fans crowding around the orange car remembered Jones'
brief political career. A Democrat, he represented Atlanta suburbs
from 1988 through 1992 before being defeated by Republican Newt
Gingrich after redistricting altered the political landscape. But
the visitors all recognized the grinning fellow in the sleeveless
shirt as ``Cooter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to be passing by and saw the General Lee
parked there,'' marveled Delbert Fioles, from Ponca City, Okla. He
promptly bought a $10 ``Cooter's Garage'' cap for Jones to
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the 'Dukes of Hazzard'. I've still got the
little Hot Wheels cars,'' said Chris Dodson of Chesapeake, Va. He
drove his family an hour out of their way after overhearing a
conversation about ``Cooter's'' at a MacDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my favorite show,'' said Vince Barrick, who lives
nearby and brought his collection of character cards for Jones to
sign. ``I had all the matchbox cars and a scrapbook. It's good to
have one of them living around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooter's souvenir store and museum of ``Dukes of Hazzard''
memorabilia opened on July 4, about a year after Jones and his
wife, Alma Viator, moved into a log home in nearby Harris Hollow.
Viator runs a public relations agency in Washington, D.C., and met
Jones when he was serving in Congress. Since his defeat, Jones has
resumed acting _ appearing in the movie ``Primary Colors'' and a
``Dukes of Hazzard'' TV reunion, among other roles. He moved to
Rappahannock County, Va., after several years in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found a wonderful home here,'' he allowed. ``The best
thing is that people judge you by the way you are _ not by how much
money you have but by the way you behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Viator said the roadside ``Cooter's'' store ``was a crazy idea
that he had that I let go in one ear and out the other for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, TNN began showing reruns of the ``Dukes of
Hazzard'' twice a day and people started recognizing ``Cooter'' in
shopping malls and asking for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking that maybe it wasn't so crazy,'' said
Viator. ``When we came here, nobody cared that he had been in
Congress but they were excited that 'Cooter' was moving into the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is happy to autograph ``Cooter's'' wares ranging from
$4.50 cast pictures to $7.50 baby bibs to $15 T-shirts with cut-out
sleeves like the ones he wears. Visitors can also buy local
foodstuffs like ``Daisy's Country Honey'' and ``Miss Alma's Apple
Butter.'' Not for sale is an array of artifacts inspired by the
program _ scripts, action figures, model cars, props, Cooter's
costumes, off-screen snapshots of the cast, and even The New York
Times obituary of Sorrel Brooke, the actor who played Boss Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   TNN has ``introduced the show to a whole new generation of
fans,'' said Jones. Indeed, ``Dukes of Hazzard'' Web sites abound
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jones compares the show to the B-Westerns of old where action is
paramount and the good guys always win. Children can watch the
program with their parents, he said. ``It's not cynical. Nobody
ever gets hurt. I hear it every day from visitors _ 'Thank you for
putting on a show that was so much fun'.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Daisy Duke's long legs and short shorts may have
contributed as much as the car chases to the show's popularity with
teen-aged boys. Catharine Bach played Daisy. John Schneider
portrayed Bo. Tom Wopat was Luke. James Best was Rosco P. Coltrane.
Denver Pyle, who died last year, portrayed Uncle Jesse Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving regulars will return for a second reunion program
to be taped this autumn, said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Viator's agency represented theaters in Washington.
She claims to have been a Hazzard fan from the start because she
knew Wopat from his appearances at the National Theater. So now she
splits her time between her PR business in Washington and the cash
register at Cooter's, 80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben stays out here,'' she said. ``It's only for a rare,
personal favor that he'll come into D.C. any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his two terms in Congress were ``a thoroughly good
experience and a real honor'' but ``I can't say that I miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he seems to relish being ``Cooter.'' He chats and poses
enthusiastically with everyone who stops by.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a Thursday, a sizable audience assembled as Jones took
the microphone with a local bluegrass band. ``We've had a lot of
requests but I'm going to sing anyway,'' he declared through
speakers set atop galvanized tin washtubs. Later he launched into
the lyrics popularized by Waylon Jennings, the narrator for ``The
Dukes of Hazzard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just two good ol' boys,
</P>
<P>
   ``Never meaning no harm,
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats all you ever saw,
</P>
<P>
   ``Been in trouble with the law
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the day they were born.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, videotapes of the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' run
continuously on a monitor. A sign advertises a ``blue plate
special'' of an RC Cola and Moonpie for $1. On the phone, Viator
takes an order for ``Cooter's'' T-shirts from somebody calling from
Connecticut. And the General Lee is pulling cars off the highway
and into the parking lot like an orange magnet.

   ``I just happened to be passing by and saw the General Lee
parked there,'' marveled Delbert Fioles, from Ponca City, Okla. He
promptly bought a $10 ``Cooter's Garage'' cap for Jones to
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the 'Dukes of Hazzard'. I've still got the
little Hot Wheels cars,'' said Chris Dodson of Chesapeake, Va. He
drove his family an hour out of their way after overhearing a
conversation about ``Cooter's'' at a MacDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my favorite show,'' said Vince Barrick, who lives
nearby and brought his collection of character cards for Jones to
sign. ``I had all the matchbox cars and a scrapbook. It's good to
have one of them living around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooter's souvenir store and museum of ``Dukes of Hazzard''
memorabilia opened on July 4, about a year after Jones and his
wife, Alma Viator, moved into a log home in nearby Harris Hollow.
Viator runs a public relations agency in Washington, D.C., and met
Jones when he was serving in Congress. Since his defeat, Jones has
resumed acting _ appearing in the movie ``Primary Colors'' and a
``Dukes of Hazzard'' TV reunion, among other roles. He moved to
Rappahannock County, Va., after several years in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found a wonderful home here,'' he allowed. ``The best
thing is that people judge you by the way you are _ not by how much
money you have but by the way you behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Viator said the roadside ``Cooter's'' store ``was a crazy idea
that he had that I let go in one ear and out the other for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, TNN began showing reruns of the ``Dukes of
Hazzard'' twice a day and people started recognizing ``Cooter'' in
shopping malls and asking for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking that maybe it wasn't so crazy,'' said
Viator. ``When we came here, nobody cared that he had been in
Congress but they were excited that 'Cooter' was moving into the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is happy to autograph ``Cooter's'' wares ranging from
$4.50 cast pictures to $7.50 baby bibs to $15 T-shirts with cut-out
sleeves like the ones he wears. Visitors can also buy local
foodstuffs like ``Daisy's Country Honey'' and ``Miss Alma's Apple
Butter.'' Not for sale is an array of artifacts inspired by the
program _ scripts, action figures, model cars, props, Cooter's
costumes, off-screen snapshots of the cast, and even The New York
Times obituary of Sorrel Brooke, the actor who played Boss Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   TNN has ``introduced the show to a whole new generation of
fans,'' said Jones. Indeed, ``Dukes of Hazzard'' Web sites abound
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jones compares the show to the B-Westerns of old where action is
paramount and the good guys always win. Children can watch the
program with their parents, he said. ``It's not cynical. Nobody
ever gets hurt. I hear it every day from visitors _ 'Thank you for
putting on a show that was so much fun'.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Daisy Duke's long legs and short shorts may have
contributed as much as the car chases to the show's popularity with
teen-aged boys. Catharine Bach played Daisy. John Schneider
portrayed Bo. Tom Wopat was Luke. James Best was Rosco P. Coltrane.
Denver Pyle, who died last year, portrayed Uncle Jesse Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving regulars will return for a second reunion program
to be taped this autumn, said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Viator's agency represented theaters in Washington.
She claims to have been a Hazzard fan from the start because she
knew Wopat from his appearances at the National Theater. So now she
splits her time between her PR business in Washington and the cash
register at Cooter's, 80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben stays out here,'' she said. ``It's only for a rare,
personal favor that he'll come into D.C. any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his two terms in Congress were ``a thoroughly good
experience and a real honor'' but ``I can't say that I miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he seems to relish being ``Cooter.'' He chats and poses
enthusiastically with everyone who stops by.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a Thursday, a sizable audience assembled as Jones took
the microphone with a local bluegrass band. ``We've had a lot of
requests but I'm going to sing anyway,'' he declared through
speakers set atop galvanized tin washtubs. Later he launched into
the lyrics popularized by Waylon Jennings, the narrator for ``The
Dukes of Hazzard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just two good ol' boys,
</P>
<P>
   ``Never meaning no harm,
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats all you ever saw,
</P>
<P>
   ``Been in trouble with the law
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the day they were born.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, videotapes of the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' run
continuously on a monitor. A sign advertises a ``blue plate
special'' of an RC Cola and Moonpie for $1. On the phone, Viator
takes an order for ``Cooter's'' T-shirts from somebody calling from
Connecticut. And the General Lee is pulling cars off the highway
and into the parking lot like an orange magnet.

BOARD CLEARS CALIFORNIA JUDGE OF MISCONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a decision hailed as protecting judicial
independence, the California judicial watchdog agency has dropped
disciplinary charges against a San Francisco judge who had been
accused of failing to follow a controversial state Supreme Court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Judicial Performance on Thursday issued an
order dismissing charges against state Court of Appeal Justice J.
Anthony Kline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful that the commission has vindicated me ... and
vindicated the independence of all judges in the state of
California,'' said Kline, who was named to the appeals court in
1982 by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. ``If judges aren't free to think
freely ... we are in a sorry state.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8-1 vote by the commission marked a turnabout from a year
ago, when the panel of mostly Republican appointees voted to
proceed with the case. The charges triggered widespread criticism
of the commission as infringing on the judicial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At stake in this action was whether the law of California
would be decided by constitutionally appointed judges or whether it
would be decided by the staff of the commission,'' said James
Brosnahan, the San Francisco lawyer who represented Kline. ``The
present commission has answered that question in a clear way that
bodes well for judicial independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from a 1997 case in which Kline dissented
from an appeals court opinion that granted a ``stipulated
reversal,'' an order allowing two sides in a civil lawsuit to
privately settle their case even after it has been decided at
trial, effectively wiping out the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court approved stipulated reversals in a 1992
case. Critics said the process allowed litigants to buy their way
out of unfavorable court rulings and to unfairly shape public law.
The U.S. Supreme Court disparaged stipulated reversals in a 1994
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent, Kline refused to grant a stipulated reversal,
declaring ``judicial decisions are not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, someone filed a confidential complaint accusing
Kline of failing to follow the state's legal precedent, and the
commission brought formal charges against him for ``willful
misconduct.'' Kline denied the charges, which, if upheld, could
have ended his judicial career.
</P>
<P>
   The Kline case sparked concern that the commission was
interfering with legitimate judicial opinion. The California Judges
Association came to Kline's aid with a brief that asked the panel
to drop the charges, because they ``can only be seen by sitting
judges as a deterrent to their free expression.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case was pending, Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, was
elected and appointed new members to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the commission concluded that there was no basis to
punish Kline, 61.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Kline had a ``tenable belief'' that the
state Supreme Court's rule on stipulated reversals was
``destructive of judicial institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot conclude ... that the dissent was improper,'' it
said. In a comment that seemed meant for the body's own critics,
the commission added, ``We readily reaffirm our fundamental belief
in the principle of judicial independence.''

PALESTINIAN HELD ON SECRET EVIDENCE CHALLENGES U.S. IN COURT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Palestine, Egypt, N.J., Washington, D.C.)   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A Palestinian native whom federal officials have
tried to deport on the basis of secret evidence suggesting that he
is linked to terrorism filed suit Friday in federal court
challenging the government's use of such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Hany Kiareldeen, has been detained by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for 17 months in the Hudson
County Jail near here while the agency has sought to deport him.
Kiareldeen has petitioned a federal judge for his release, saying
the use of the evidence _ which he has not been allowed to see and
is from sources whose identity he has not been allowed to know _
violates his constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depriving someone of his liberty on the basis of secret
evidence is about as basic a constitutional violation as one can
imagine,'' said David Cole, a professor and immigration expert at
the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., and a
volunteer lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which
is representing Kiareldeen.
</P>
<P>
   But in a case that has broken legal ground at almost every turn
through the deportation process and immigration courts,
Kiareldeen's case has been seen as ``remarkable'' by opponents of
the use of such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The case has even led some immigration court judges to question
whether the government's use of secret evidence is too vague.
</P>
<P>
   Cole and Regis Fernandez, Kiareldeen's other lawyer, are seeking
his immediate release on bond while they press his constitutional
challenge. Judge William H. Walls of U.S. District Court here has
set a hearing for Aug. 29 on the bond request.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said that the only other federal court challenge of the use
of secret evidence had come in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in
the case of Nasser Ahmed, a native of Egypt who has been held for
nearly three years. Ahmed served as a court-appointed translator
for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Muslim cleric who was convicted in
October 1995 of masterminding a plot to blow up buildings in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Justice Department spokeswoman, Carol Florman, would
not comment on Kiareldeen's case specifically, she said that the
use of secret evidence in cases of national security had been
upheld over the years by federal courts. Ms. Florman said ``about
20'' people, all of Arab descent, are being detained and facing
deportation on the basis of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, who has been in the United States since 1990 and who
lived in Bloomfield, N.J., was picked up by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officers in March 1998 for overstaying his
student visa. Once he was in custody, INS officials opposed his
release on bail on the basis of secret evidence, which they did not
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, in a series of deportation hearings, the
immigration agency has released sketchy summaries of FBI reports
that said Kiareldeen had associated with fundamentalist Muslim
terrorists involved in the World Trade Center bombing, that he had
uttered ``a credible threat'' against Attorney General Janet Reno
and that he had met with one of the key bombing conspirators a week
before the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Kiareldeen has denied the charges and
maintained that they were conveyed to federal authorities out of
vindictiveness by his ex-wife, Amal Kamal Mohammed. In hearings, he
had presented witnesses who testified that, unlike some terrorism
suspects, he had no political involvements and was not very
religious. Other witnesses told an immigration court judge that
Kiareldeen did not even know who Reno was before he heard he had
been accused of threatening her.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez tried to compel Kiareldeen's ex-wife to testify. When
Ms. Mohammed refused, Judge Daniel Meisner of immigration court,
who did not have the authority to compel her testimony, asked the
U.S. Attorney for New Jersey to seek an order from U.S. District
Court to force her to testify.
</P>
<P>
   This marked the first time since their creation in 1996 that any
of the 200 judges of the immigration courts had sought such an
order from a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But Faith Hochberg, the U.S. Attorney, declined to force Ms.
Mohammed to testify, defying the immigration judge's request.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, working only from the summaries of the secret
evidence, Meisner ordered Kiareldeen released on bond. He said
that, based on what had come out in the hearings, ``a person of
ordinary prudence and caution could not conscientiously entertain a
reasonable belief that the allegations of the respondent's
involvement in terrorist activities were true.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS immediately appealed that ruling. Last month, in a
2-to-1 ruling, a panel of the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered
Kiareldeen to remain in detention, although the majority said that
they had concerns about the reliability of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting judge went further, writing that the INS and the
FBI had provided so little to support the allegations that he could
not agree to hold Kiareldeen.

THOUGHTS ON SPRINGSTEEN _ BY SPRINGSTEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   C'mon, did anybody really doubt that Bruce Springsteen would
someday play with the E Street Band again?
</P>
<P>
   It took 10 years to get from breakup to reunion tour, but now
that it's happening it seems completely natural. This isn't one of
those cynical ``let's cash in once more'' rock deals. It's more
like a brotherhood reaffirmed _ another payoff on the promise of
those glory nights when Springsteen and the E Streeters made you
believe anything was possible in rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that the reunion was coming were evident in an interview
Springsteen did with The Boston Globe last fall, when he released
his boxed set ``Tracks.'' ``I had some of the greatest nights of my
life on stage with them,'' Springsteen said at the time. ``I can't
imagine at some point that we wouldn't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The time has come, as Springsteen and the E Street Band open a
record-setting five-show run at the FleetCenter tonight (Aug. 21).
All the shows are sold out _ and the group is expected to gross a
rather tidy $1.15 million per show. And that, of course, doesn't
count merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   But Springsteen has never played just for profit. He's a
craftsman, not an entrepreneur: ``I'm a synthesist. I'm always
making music,'' he said last fall. ``And I make a lot of different
kinds of music all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen has not done any interviews this tour _ not on its
first leg, in Europe, and not now, in the States. But a skim
through this writer's old notebooks shows that many of the things
Springsteen has said through the years paint a consistent picture
of an artist who takes rock music as seriously as anyone in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   On music as his career (1988): ``I always knew that music was my
job, my life, but I guess you question what you've got to offer,
what you've got to say. Music, from the beginning, always meant so
much to me. And the biggest fear was that in some way I was wasting
people's time. In the end, you never answer those questions
completely or fully _ which is good, because once you do that you
get smug.''
</P>
<P>
   On record sales (1988): ``The first thing you've got to stop
worrying about is how much your record is going to sell. If it
starts to sell less, then that's OK. It's still the record I wanted
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   On performance (1984): ``You should just be intuitive. I never
like to find myself thinking during a song, because you've got to
be in that song at that time. So you don't have many distant
thoughts _ those come after the show. I'll go home and I'll get in
bed and think about what I did tonight. I think you become
self-conscious then.''
</P>
<P>
   On what he wanted his music to say (1998): ``I always wanted my
music to influence the life you were living emotionally _ with your
family, your lover, your wife, and, at a certain point, with your
children. So I aspired to write across a wide range of topics. I
guess the only map I followed was what I found myself going through
in my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   On his father's influence (1998): ``In the early years, I found
a voice that was my voice and partly my father's voice. But isn't
that what you always do? Why do kids at 5 years old go into the
closet and put daddy's shoes on? Hey, my kids do it. Or they run in
the car and come clunking out with your boots on. And I think that
was part of what I was doing. It was the fuel and fire for a lot of
songs, particularly on `Darkness on the Edge of Town' and `The
River.' It's always been a central connection. Then you go beyond
it and find your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   On being outside the music business (1996): ``At this point, I
see the music scene and music business as relatively inhospitable.
But I feel a greater sense of purpose. I have a greater idea of
what my job is, who I am, and what I want to do, not just this year
but in the future. It's pretty much outside the general thrust of
the music business, but that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On Hank Williams, one of his favorite songwriters (1980): ``You
always had that sense of rootlessness in all his stuff. It's not an
outlaw or a rebel thing, which is funny because when I first
started, people thought my characters were rebels, but I never
thought they were. They were just normal people trying to live,
period. Anyway, with Hank Williams's stuff, which I played while
traveling around the country on the entire last tour, his words
were just so beautiful and his songs were so real.''
</P>
<P>
   On social consciousness (1996): ``In every study, the division
of wealth is increasing in the US. And the debate is how much we
are cutting back and can cut out of the budget _ not whether some
people actually need more assistance. It's always how much money to
take away. But what about the people who don't have much to start
with? That's at the core of what I'm trying to do. It's a search
for beauty, and in beauty there is hope, and in hope there is some
sense of divine love, of faith, of community and possibility, of
things that would combat the brutality and the violence and the
suffering. That's what I'm trying to lay out there. It's a survival
guide.''

SOLOMON PRACTICES SAME BRAND OF POLITICS DOWNTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 22)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Rep. Gerald B. H. Solomon has changed his
job from lawmaker to lobbyist but you'd never know it.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept much of the same staff, the same legislative agenda,
the same in-your-face bluntness. He still has his office on
Pennsylvania Avenue _ though eight blocks from the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   He still goes back to his ``district'' on weekends. And he even
totes the same trademark cardboard file folder with ``SOLOMON''
emblazoned on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much doing the same thing, just from a different
point of view,'' said Solomon, who retired last winter after a
20-year career in the House. He ended up as chairman of the House
Rules Committee _ the powerful panel that can determine the fate of
legislation. Now he heads the four-man Solomon Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I had the power to go out and implement or block'' a
proposal, he says. ``Now I have to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ronald Reagan-worshipping conservative, Solomon says he limits
his lobbying clients to ``people I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   He said couldn't bear being a ``show horse'' for a large
lobbying firm because that would mean working for clients whose
goals he doesn't share. ``I question people who change allegiances
for a dollar,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Solomon has been doing what he has been doing for 30
years,'' he said, referring to himself in the third person as he
often does. ``He has stood up for business, industry and jobs in
the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's roster of lobbying clients includes many of the same
constituents he once served as a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   As a lobbyist for General Electric Co., a major employer in his
former district, he now tracks mortgage and insurance issues. He
stands ready, if asked, to lobby the Environmental Protection
Agency against requiring GE to spend millions of dollars to dredge
the Hudson River to remove the PCBs that the company legally
discharged into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon has passionately opposed the dredging for years.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Marine also represents veterans' groups, which he was
closely allied with in Congress. He says he works for ``half
price'' to try to keep dairy prices stable for farmers, another
cause he fought for as a lawmaker. But he says he has rejected
computer industry clients, whom he opposed in Congress by opposing
encryption technology they wanted to sell.
</P>
<P>
   He shares office expenses and clients with former Republican
Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., who was one of Reagan's closest
confidants, because ``Laxalt thinks the same way I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent photos in Solomon's office are framed
portraits of Reagan and President George Bush, which flank the
glass gavel given to him when he retired as rules chairman. ``Those
are my two heroes,'' Solomon says.
</P>
<P>
   His portable file holder contains notes from his meetings with
veterans groups and conservatives; he acts as liaison between them
and Speaker Dennis J. Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the speaker and majority leader have me in a group to
give them advice every few weeks,'' Solomon said. ``I still have a
lot of input.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethics laws prevent Solomon from lobbying Congress personally
for a year after retiring but the rules leave a lot of room for
maneuvering. He said he often goes to the Capitol Hill Club, a
Republican social center, and meets with members. ``I'm allowed to
talk politics but just don't talk clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The law allows his staffers to lobby members of Congress. ``They
can identify themselves as members of the Solomon Group but they
can't say Jerry Solomon sent them,'' he said, adding: ``It's a fine
line.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Solomon Group payroll is his former press secretary, Bill
Teator, as well as Bill Crosby, former counsel for the House Rules
panel, and Dave Lonie, his one-time staffer on the Foreign Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon keeps the same travel schedule that he has followed for
two decades: He flies into Washington on Mondays at the crack of
dawn and returns to Albany on Thursday or Friday nights and when
Congress is in recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stewardesses still think I'm a congressman,'' he says. He
says while it was ``hard to give up'' the power he enjoyed as
chairman of the House Rules panel, he says it's been even tougher
to change his work schedule. ``It gets in your blood,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 44 years, Freda Parker Solomon, joins him mid-week
in Washington when she is not selling real estate on Lake George
and caring for her Siberian Husky.
</P>
<P>
   She, rather than his constituents, is now in charge of his
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you don't see any more stress on Jerry Solomon's
face,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has piloted his motorboat around Lake George 40 times
this summer, compared to four times in 10 years while he was on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the same Market
Square building that holds his office; the trip home is an elevator
ride. His neighbors include Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
Defense Secretary William Cohen and Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   On his 69th Birthday last weekend, Solomon greeted crowds in
Ames, Iowa, as he stumped at the Iowa straw poll for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.

   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul) _ With thousands of bodies still lying
beneath the rubble from Tuesday's earthquake, relief workers and
government officials in Turkey say their most urgent challenge now
is preventing the outbreak of epidemic diseases. Government
officials put the latest death toll at 8,713. Fearing that the
number may soar, they have asked the United Nations for 10,000 body
bags. A U.N. official said the final toll could reach 40,000. By

a no-holds-barred psychological analysis. Giuliani created ``Live
From City Hall'' as a means of talking to ordinary citizens about
the frustrations of city life, and sure enough, he helps dozens of
callers navigate city bureaucracy, foil corrupt landlords and find
jobs. Each Friday morning, Giuliani uses his free air time to
lecture New Yorkers about their supposed bad habits, inveigh
against their collective dysfunction, and exhort them to be more
exemplary human beings, for crying out loud. Although he does solve
many callers' problems, Giuliani often sounds more like a bullying

MAN WITH TIES TO MISSING ATHEIST SENTENCED ON WEAPON CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal judge on Friday sentenced a leading
suspect in the disappearance of national atheist leader Madalyn
Murray O'Hair to 8 years in prison on two firearms charges.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Waters, 52, a former office manager for O'Hair, was
sentenced last week by a Texas court to 60 years in prison for
stealing money from one of her organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Waters has a total and abject disrespect for the law,''
U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to indicate he will not commit further
offenses,'' the judge said in imposing the maximum penalty
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Waters must serve the federal time once he satisfies the
sentence imposed for stealing $54,400 in 1994 from the
organizations run by O'Hair. It was not clear how much time Waters
must serve on the state sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who has been jailed since March, appeared in an orange
jump suit and laceless white sneakers. He declined an offer from
Sparks to address the court.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, however, argued that Waters, a prime suspect in the
disappearance of O'Hair, was really being punished harshly because
of that unsolved case.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Murray and adopted daughter Robin Murray
O'Hair are presumed dead, but their bodies have not been found
since they vanished from San Antonio nearly four years ago. O'Hair
gained prominence more than 30 years ago for her court fights
against school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet been charged in connection with the disappearance
but Waters and two other men are accused in a federal affidavit of
kidnapping and murdering them. One of the suspects was murdered
shortly after the O'Hair family vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand the government's position is not motivated
by the issues at hand. There is a hidden agenda they don't want to
talk about,'' said Patrick Ganne, the lawyer who represents Waters.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending the stiffest possible sentence for Waters,
federal prosecutors dug deep into his criminal past, which goes
back 36 years and includes various violent crimes, including
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes into consideration everything Mr. Waters has ever
done, from not helping old ladies across the street to every dog he
has kicked,'' Ganne told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald Carruth, however, told Sparks
that it was appropriate to weigh everything in Waters' past in
sentencing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had every opportunity to rehabilitate himself and has
failed to do so for 36 years,'' Carruth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that he can ever return to society again,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon charges that landed Waters in court stemmed from a
March 24 raid on his Austin apartment in which the FBI found 119
rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   As a felon, Waters is prohibited from possessing guns or
ammunition. On May 27, he pleaded guilty to possessing the
ammunition and to shipping firearms from Texas to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Carruth declined to respond to questions about Waters'
role in the O'Hair case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what Mr. Ganne said, I have no agenda,'' he said.
``Let me assure you, the investigation into the O'Hair
disappearance will continue until those responsible are brought to
justice.''

THE WARTIME CODE-BREAKER: PROTOTYPE FOR TODAY'S COMPUTER HACKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toward the end of Neal Stephenson's recently published novel,
``Cryptonomicon'' (Avon), two plot strands converge on attempts to
crack a particularly knotty Japanese code from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the war a brilliant mathematician uses a
collection of abacuses and a primitive, heat-producing, vacuum-tube
computer to untangle a code that had stymied the Allies' best
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 50 years later, the mathematician's grandson sits in a
Philippine prison with his laptop computer, attempting to crack
that same Japanese code, whose secrets have been lost. Yet he must
keep all results hidden from his captors' eyes; so the decoding
itself must be encoded.
</P>
<P>
   This 918-page novel has become something of a phenomenon in the
tech world (with over 100,000 copies in print), partly because of
the way it weaves back and forth between these hackers of two eras.
</P>
<P>
   It toys with the most advanced contemporary ideas while also
managing to ground them in the distant technological past,
suggesting that what we tend to think of as revolutionary _ the
Internet, electronic commerce, data encryption _ is actually
evolutionary. The origins of writing code (programming) lie in
historical efforts to break code (cryptography).
</P>
<P>
   This may be one reason why the codes of World War II have
provoked such interest in our obsessively high-tech age. In one
recent book, ``Between Silk and Cyanide'' (Free Press), Leo Marks,
a British cryptographer, later turned screenwriter, recalls basing
wartime ciphers on poems; encryptions would be written on silk
scarves, easily hidden and easily destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In another book, ``Code Breaking: A History and Exploration''
(Overlook), a German mathematician, Rudolf Kippenhahn, gives a
breezy survey of codes, ranging from the betrayal of Mary, Queen of
Scots, in a deciphered letter, to the nature of credit card
security. The heart of the book, however, focuses on breaking the
notorious German code, Enigma, which was punched out on portable
typing machines equipped with four spinning wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime code-breaking has taken on a mythic importance not just
because so much was at stake, but because it relied on a new way of
looking at the world that is only now coming to maturity: the world
is an agglomeration of information, much of it seemingly chaotic,
some of it hidden, all of it requiring interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   A technical field known as ``information theory'' began to
thrive just after the war. The notion of code was central, for a
code is an apparently meaningless stream of signals that contain a
hidden order. Breaking a code involves stripping away the ``noise''
to find the sense.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades before the war, theoretical mathematicians had
come to think about their own field in this way: when we are
presented with a series of statements, some of which are true, some
false, some provable, some not, how do we tell the difference? Is
there a procedure that might help separate, say, truth from
falsehood?
</P>
<P>
   In attempts to answer their theoretical questions,
mathematicians even created their own peculiar code, assigning
numbers to all mathematical signs, turning abstract statements
about truth or falsehood into numbers that could be more easily
explored.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematician Alan Turing (who plays a pivotal role in
Stephenson's novel), was involved in such speculations and _ not
coincidentally _ helped break the German Enigma code. He began to
consider the implications of all this for machines.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a machine creates a kind of material code, turning
one object into another according to a predetermined set of rules.
A machine that manipulates numbers _ a computer _ would literally
be a coding machine, transforming one bit of information into
another following strict procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The modern computer is a fantastically fast and subtle extension
of that idea. Everything is coded in number. Every movement of the
mouse, for example, is translated by the computer into a series of
numbers which are then manipulated and finally decoded, changing
the colors of pixels on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A hacker is literally a cryptographer, the computer an elaborate
Enigma machine. And now that transactions involving the exchange of
objects and money are being replaced by the transmission of
computer-generated codes, billions of dollars are at stake in
making sure they are unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these ideas bounce around in Stephenson's novel, which
is really an expansive portrait of the hacker mentality, then and
now. The hacker encodes and decodes experience with almost
compulsive energy.
</P>
<P>
   The water currents in a stream, the turning of a bicycle chain,
the pattern of street curbs in London, the churning of a bingo bin
_ there are patterns to decode in everything; everything is
connected. This creates a sense of Pynchonesque paranoia, in which
characters' concerns about secrecy regularly reach wartime
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   But it also inspires a kind of techno-mysticism that has become
familiar among the digerati: if everything is connected, a hacker
who could read the currents properly and reproduce them in digital
form might come to know the world's deepest encoded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson's novel has an epigraph from Turing suggesting that a
physicist is a cryptographer who attempts to discern the laws of
the universe. That would be a hacker's fantasy as well: cracking
the ultimate code, created by the ultimate Enigma.

CLAIM THAT WINDOWS 98 INSTALLATIONS WILL GO BELLY UP JAN. 1 IS A
HOAX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently received a forwarded e-mail that supposedly proves
that all Windows 98 installations will fail to roll over to the
correct date on Jan. 1, 2000. It gives a series of steps to fix the
problem. I went through the steps and, sure enough, I found my
computer was set up as shown in the message. This reads like one of
those dumb hoaxes, but it seemed to be correct. I've attached a
copy for you. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right, it is one of those silly hoax e-mails. But this
one plays on the limited knowledge most people have of how their
computer works.
</P>
<P>
   What the message purports to do is provide a Year 2000 bug fix,
but all it really does is change the way Windows 98 (and 95)
displays the date.
</P>
<P>
   By default, Windows' built-in calendar is set to display the
date as two digits _ the numbers 99 for 1999, for example. This, of
course, is how we got into this Y2K mess in the first place:
programmers using two instead of four digits to indicate a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it's purely cosmetic. Although the forwarded
e-mail says that this is how Windows passes information to other
programs, that's not true. A properly patched version of Windows 95
or 98 _ or the most recent full version, Windows 98 SE _ will pass
the year 2000 to applications properly, even if the calendar is set
to display it as just two digits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are the instructions given in the e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``START''
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``SETTING''
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``CONTROL PANEL''
</P>
<P>
   Double click on ``REGIONAL SETTINGS'' icon
</P>
<P>
   Click on the ``DATE'' tab at the top of the page.
</P>
<P>
   Where it says, ``Short Date Sample,'' look and see if it shows a
``two digit'' year (yy). That is the default setting for Windows
95, Windows 98 and NT. This date RIGHT HERE is the date that feeds
application software and WILL NOT rollover in the year 2000. It
will roll over to 00. Click on the ``SHORT DATE STYLE'' pull down
menu and select the option that shows, mm/dd/yyyy. (Be sure your
selection has four Y's showing and not two.) Click on ``APPLY'' and
then click on ``OK'' at the bottom. Easy enough to fix. However,
every single installation of Windows worldwide is defaulted to fail
Y2K rollover. Please feel free to pass this on to your associates
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While setting this to be four digits is generally a good idea,
it's not critical. Your computer won't melt down Jan. 1 if you
don't.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb about Internet hoaxes is: If it says pass
it on, don't. A good Web site that tracks bogus online information
is Stiller Research Virus Hoax News at www.stiller.com/hoaxes.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been amazed at the number of deals that offer free PCs
if you just agree to three years of Internet access with this or
that provider. Some of these look too good to be true. Are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: Depending on how you use a computer _ or, even more
importantly, how you might use a PC if you've never had one before
_ it could be a good deal. But there are definite pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computers offered in these deals have minimal
specifications, such as only 32 megabytes of memory or underpowered
video cards. If all you plan to do is manage home finances, surf
the Internet or write some letters, they will be fine _ so long as
you don't try to do these at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   If you think your needs will be minimal, consider that most
people who buy a computer end up using it for things other than
what they initially intended.
</P>
<P>
   Also, realize that you will be locked into a three-year contract
with the Internet provider involved. That can be a long time if the
service is sub-par or the provider doesn't offer the kinds of
service you need.

`UNIVERSAL SOLDIER:' THE RETURN OF THE HUNKY HUMANOID 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has succumbed to computer-borne paranoia in this year
of Y2K foreboding had better brace for another jolt to the ganglia
in the form of ``Universal Soldier: The Return.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the hyperkinetic action movie that posits the plot that
if it weren't for Jean-Claude Van Damme as a recycled corpse, the
world as undemanding movie fans know it would be at the mercy of a
megalomaniacal computer named Seth and a legion of pumped-up
zombies of a type known as a Unisol.
</P>
<P>
   That word, as Van Damme's followers are aware, stands for
Universal Soldier, which people _ if you can call it that _ a
government-financed experimental unit of resurrected Army dead,
whose heartening military motto is ``Dying to Serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with ``Universal Soldier,'' the 1992 film that
introduced Van Damme as Luc Deveraux, an early model of one of
these hunky humanoids, accept that the typical Unisol, besides
having a chip in the head and a chip on the shoulder, tends to have
a screw loose as well.
</P>
<P>
   So for those eager to bid adieu to their credibility for 82
minutes and to promise not to wonder why none of the eight
gazillion bullets fired during the new film manage to hit Luc or
why he cannot be defeated in hand-to-hand combat by foes who are 2{
to 5 times stronger than he is, it should come as no surprise that
the Unisols run amok once again.
</P>
<P>
   This time they are under the control of Seth, a computer with
delusions of grandeur that manages to assume human form (Michael
Jai White) inside the Ryan-Lathrop Military Weapons Research
Facility, not far from Dallas, where the latest models of Chips are
being refined.
</P>
<P>
   Luc, restored to humanity these days, is a widower with a
teen-age daughter and is working with the military-industrial
complex on this project when that old devil Washington pulls the
budgetary plug on the entire shebang.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, Seth is in a lethal snit, the Unisols are
battling the Army, Luc's daughter, Hillary (Karis Paige Bryant), is
in peril of either dying outright or becoming a zombie, and the
whole research facility, which also contains biological weapons,
could blow sky high.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters even more, all this begins on a day when
an ambitious television reporter named Erin (Heidi Schanz) is
paying a visit, which gives Luc a chance to protect a damsel from
harm, Erin a chance to save his life, and Luc and Erin an
opportunity to visit a topless bar and to exchange a couple of
steamless kisses while she gets the Big Story.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Universal Soldier: The Return,'' directed by Mic
Rodgers and written by William Malone and John Fasano, contains no
surprises, its action rarely flags. The hulking and comic Bill
Goldberg, familiar to those who follow World Championship
Wrestling, and Kiana Tom, the fitness guru of ESPN's ``Kiana's Flex
Appeal,'' compound the high level of physicality that characterizes
Van Damme's outings.
</P>
<P>
   All this, plus the fires, shattering glass, roaring explosions,
high body counts, trashed vehicles, head bashings and skull
surgery, leaves little time for the application of logic to
analysis of this foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   But one can surely carry away this lesson: If the world is ever
to be truly safe from Universal Soldiers, they, like Achilles, can
suffer a mortal wound in only one place. For them, it's the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier: The Return'' is rated R (under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes violence,
coarse language and partial nudity.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S STUDENT STRIKE TOUCHED SENSITIVE NERVE, BUT IS LOSING
SUPPORT

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's a scene that's repeated with more frequency
each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Striking students from Mexico's National Autonomous University
hold their ground at campus gates, four months into a strike that's
paralyzed one of the world's largest university systems.
</P>
<P>
   Students furious that the strike has dragged on so long march
angrily past, prompting shouting matches that television cameras
eagerly lap up.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   This week should have marked the beginning of fall semester for
Mexico City's sprawling, virtually free public university system,
known here as the UNAM. Normally, this university is home to
270,000 students enrolled in courses for degrees in everything from
literature and law to computer sciences and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of students walked out last April 20 in protest
against a proposal by the university's rector that would have --
for the first time in 50 years -- increased tuition from a few
cents to about $75 per semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear that if this happens all education, including primary,
will end up private in Mexico. How can you do that in a Third World
country?'' said Eric Gonzalez, a striking 23-year-old engineering
student whose father is a farmworker in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At first the student movement seemed to have captured the moral
high ground, especially in a country where many fear Mexico is
going too far with free-market economic reforms that have cut back
on government spending and subsidies. The announcement of a
dramatic tuition hike was seen as another attack on Mexico's
working classes, whose best opportunity for higher education is at
the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   But by mid-summer UNAM Rector Francisco Barnes had retreated,
declaring that the tuition hike would be voluntary and meant only
for students whose families could afford the increase. Suspicious
strikers said they didn't believe him -- and they shot back with a
range of other demands.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rector relented, the protracted strike is starting
to alarm the public and counter-demonstrations are growing
stronger. Recently, a star-studded group of liberal Mexican writers
published an open letter urging the adoption of a professors'
proposal for a suspension of the fee increases, a return to classes
and a series of assemblies where students and administrators could
negotiate their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes, Mexico's best-known novelist, was one of the
signatories. Another was Elena Poniatowska, a novelist who wrote a
famous investigative book detailing the bloody massacre of hundreds
of Mexican students striking for free speech and political freedom
on the eve of the Olympic Games here in October 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Poniatowska has immense moral clout in Mexico because she dared
to publish one of the first chronicles of the massacre, which
shredded the credibility of Mexico's government at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Poniatowska's position against the continuation of the 1999
strike highlighted the erosion of support for the students, who
have themselves broken into factions known as ``ultras,'' the more
radical students, and ``moderates,'' those who are inclined to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I am, in general, on the side of our youth,''
Poniatowska said. ``There should be space for the students to
express their concerns at the university.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, the students have already lost too much class
time. Now it appears the entire fall semester is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Poniatowska also said she disagreed with the students' demands
for automatic UNAM admission for any any student who attends one of
a chain of high schools affiliated with the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities need money,'' she said. But she suggested that
the UNAM should perhaps try other ways to increase funding rather
than asking the students to pay more. The fee increases would only
represent a fraction of the university's $994 million annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping vigil at one of the entrances to the UNAM, striking
student Arcelia Sanchez, 22, said she was disappointed in the
writers' position.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want a quick way out,'' she said. ``The problem is
we (the striking students) don't trust anyone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez and others still devoted to the strike said their
parents support them, but fear for their safety -- especially
because of what happened to students in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be more people out here with us, but because of
the ghost of '68 they won't come,'' said Eric Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the students feel they've been the victims of
unsympathetic television coverage, which has focused of late on
strikers blocking -- and sometimes fighting with -- students trying
to enroll for the UNAM's fall semester at alternative sites around
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is on that little box people believe,'' he said
bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of striking students have occupied classrooms and are
sleeping in them to maintain a 24-hour presence.
</P>
<P>
   Campus workers come and go freely and sensitive research in the
sciences and other disciplines continues. The UNAM is autonomous,
as its name implies, so ordinary police are not allowed on the
campus and conflicts are supposed to be settled within the academic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest messages about the students' struggle are posted on
school buildings, along with traditional red-and-black strike
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose a few days to win over a lifetime,'' said a sign posted
on the School of Architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Corea, a 23-year-old literature student, said he supported
the strike at first because the rector simply imposed the fee hikes
with no prior consultation with students or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Corea can't afford to pay much more -- his mother is a
housekeeper -- and he says he has friends who can barely afford bus
money every day to get to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   But he also believes students from wealthy families who drive
nice cars to the campus can afford the increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the strikers themselves are divided now,'' he said.
``They're not unified, so it's hard to see where this is going.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Emma Garcia, a 21-year-old dentistry student, is also
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are fellow students who can't afford to pay
more,'' she said. ``But I've seen too many people who want to just
pay a few cents for tuition. And how much does a box of cigarettes
cost or a pack of gum?''
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez said she fears that fee increases for tuition, the
use of libraries, laboratories and other services will continue to
climb if students don't take a stand now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not whether there are rich students or poor
students attending the university right now,'' she said. ``The
question is whether the university will remain accessible to the
working classes. That's been the essence of this university.''

CLAIM THAT WINDOWS 98 INSTALLATIONS WILL GO BELLY UP JAN. 1 IS A
HOAX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently received a forwarded e-mail that supposedly proves
that all Windows 98 installations will fail to roll over to the
correct date on Jan. 1, 2000. It gives a series of steps to fix the
problem. I went through the steps and, sure enough, I found my
computer was set up as shown in the message. This reads like one of
those dumb hoaxes, but it seemed to be correct. I've attached a
copy for you. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right, it is one of those silly hoax e-mails. But this
one plays on the limited knowledge most people have of how their
computer works.
</P>
<P>
   What the message purports to do is provide a Year 2000 bug fix,
but all it really does is change the way Windows 98 (and 95)
displays the date.
</P>
<P>
   By default, Windows' built-in calendar is set to display the
date as two digits _ the numbers 99 for 1999, for example. This, of
course, is how we got into this Y2K mess in the first place:
programmers using two instead of four digits to indicate a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it's purely cosmetic. Although the forwarded
e-mail says that this is how Windows passes information to other
programs, that's not true. A properly patched version of Windows 95
or 98 _ or the most recent full version, Windows 98 SE _ will pass
the year 2000 to applications properly, even if the calendar is set
to display it as just two digits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are the instructions given in the e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``START''
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``SETTING''
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``CONTROL PANEL''
</P>
<P>
   Double click on ``REGIONAL SETTINGS'' icon
</P>
<P>
   Click on the ``DATE'' tab at the top of the page.
</P>
<P>
   Where it says, ``Short Date Sample,'' look and see if it shows a
``two digit'' year (yy). That is the default setting for Windows
95, Windows 98 and NT. This date RIGHT HERE is the date that feeds
application software and WILL NOT rollover in the year 2000. It
will roll over to 00. Click on the ``SHORT DATE STYLE'' pull down
menu and select the option that shows, mm/dd/yyyy. (Be sure your
selection has four Y's showing and not two.) Click on ``APPLY'' and
then click on ``OK'' at the bottom. Easy enough to fix. However,
every single installation of Windows worldwide is defaulted to fail
Y2K rollover. Please feel free to pass this on to your associates
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While setting this to be four digits is generally a good idea,
it's not critical. Your computer won't melt down Jan. 1 if you
don't.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb about Internet hoaxes is: If it says pass
it on, don't. A good Web site that tracks bogus online information
is Stiller Research Virus Hoax News at www.stiller.com/hoaxes.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been amazed at the number of deals that offer free PCs
if you just agree to three years of Internet access with this or
that provider. Some of these look too good to be true. Are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: Depending on how you use a computer _ or, even more
importantly, how you might use a PC if you've never had one before
_ it could be a good deal. But there are definite pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computers offered in these deals have minimal
specifications, such as only 32 megabytes of memory or underpowered
video cards. If all you plan to do is manage home finances, surf
the Internet or write some letters, they will be fine _ so long as
you don't try to do these at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   If you think your needs will be minimal, consider that most
people who buy a computer end up using it for things other than
what they initially intended.
</P>
<P>
   Also, realize that you will be locked into a three-year contract
with the Internet provider involved. That can be a long time if the
service is sub-par or the provider doesn't offer the kinds of
service you need.

THREE WEBCAMS, 3 DIFFERENT PICTURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the moment the graphical Web browser first illuminated the
previously darkened, text-only Internet, there have been cameras
online to capture magical moments.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe most webcams aren't aimed at magical things. The
earliest cams were pointed at fish tanks, ferret cages, the inside
of refrigerators and even the ghosts presumed to live under one
woman's bed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are thousands of webcams, but the content hasn't
improved much. The pictures of fish, ferrets, moldy leftovers and
under-bed dust bunnies are just a bit clearer, and they're cheaper
to capture.
</P>
<P>
   Webcams have become incredibly inexpensive and are much easier
to set up and use, though the image quality they offer varies
dramatically. Here's a look at three low-priced cameras that plug
into a PC using a Universal Serial Bus port. Maybe you have
something goofy you can share with the world!
</P>
<P>
   _ Video Blaster WebCam 3, $79, Creative Labs: Of the three
webcams here, this new model from Creative Labs has the most
intriguing features. Unfortunately, it falls behind in the one
feature that counts the most: image quality.
</P>
<P>
   The WebCam 3 has one of the best physical designs of this group.
It has a jointed body _ one half has the lens, the other a solid
base with four legs. This is the most physically stable of the cams
I tried. The other two were more wobbly and difficult to aim
precisely.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with software called WebCam Monitor that lets you turn
the camera into a security device. It uses a motion-detecting
system to tell when someone has entered an area, then snaps a photo
of them. That image can be stored on a hard drive, or even sent to
an FTP or Web site. If you've got a sneaking suspicion that
someone's using your PC at work when you're not there, or that the
kids are scarfing one too many Oreos after school, this is a clever
way to catch the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The WebCam 3 also comes with a program that lets you quickly
build a Web site around the camera's images, using a series of
templates and clip art.
</P>
<P>
   The camera can handle 16.8 million colors, with a maximum
resolution of 640-by-480 pixels. It was most efficient at capturing
video at the 320-by-240 resolution. On a 500-megahertz Pentium III
system, it slowed down dramatically at 640-by-480.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the WebCam also had the poorest image display of
any of the cameras I tried. It was difficult to focus, and colors
seemed washed out. Regardless of how much fiddling and tweaking I
did, I never could get a satisfying picture.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs has a gallery of Web sites that use the product,
and I can tell from looking at them that the problem wasn't
confined to my unit.
</P>
<P>
   _ HomeConnect PC Digital Camera, $159, 3Com: This is the most
expensive of the webcams I tried, but it also is one of the most
well-equipped. While its image quality is better than the Creative
Labs model, it's not the best of the three. However, if you need a
webcam in low-light situations, this is the one to get.
</P>
<P>
   The HomeConnect model comes with plenty of software, including
one that lets you instantly create picture postcards and send them
via e-mail. A launch bar lets you pick from various
image-management programs, including PictureWork Live.
</P>
<P>
   It also has the nicest software for uploading images _ either
still or video _ to a Web site in Webcam32, which is a Windows
application that allows video camera images to be displayed within
a Web page. In fact, Webcam32 can be used with all of the cameras
reviewed here, and you can get a trial copy of the latest version,
5.0.8, at www.kolban.com/webcam32.
</P>
<P>
   The HomeConnect camera can display images up to 1,280-by-960
resolution in software-enhanced mode, though in hardware it is
limited to 640-by-480. It can display 16.8 million colors and, like
the Creative Labs camera, has a comfortable frame rate at
320-by-240 resolution.
</P>
<P>
   This camera's best feature is its handling of low-light
situations. In a relatively dark room, the HomeConnect model was
great at compensating and making it look as though the scene was
well-lighted. However, the image always seemed a bit grainy to me,
even in normal light, and I had to fiddle with the settings to get
the colors right.
</P>
<P>
   _ PC Camera Pack, $79, Intel Corp.: This webcam has the best
image quality by far. It also will take advantage of the
multimedia-enhancing code found in Pentium III-based PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the software included here was created by Intel, and
isn't quite as nice as the offerings in the other packages. For
example, I found the e-mail postcard program here not as easy to
use as the one that comes with the 3Com camera. On the other hand,
the camera does come with Intel's Video Phone program, which I like
much better than NetMeeting, the videophone software that comes
with the other two cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The package comes with an additional CD that includes the Video
Phone program in a mailer. This lets you send it to a friend, who
can receive your video call, even if he or she does not have a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   There are even some games included in which your image on the
video interacts with a variety of cartoon objects, such as a
basketball. Put out your hand and the basketball bounces off of it.
It's an interesting diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel camera can handle 16.8 million colors and resolutions
up to 640-by-480, and on a Pentium III system, video at that size
is quite smooth. If you install the camera on a Pentium II or older
system, you're better off backing the resolution down to
320-by-240.
</P>
<P>
   This camera had an incredibly clear, sharp image, and displayed
very realistic colors with almost no tweaking necessary. It did
not, however, handle low light as well as the 3Com camera. But of
the three, this one was my solid favorite.

 &HT;    Sony Walkman turns twenty
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Though he was co-founder of Sony _ soon to be
chairman and CEO _ Akio Morita wasn't even sure he could sell the
concept to his own company. Music had long been a social activity,
a source of sharing, a force for bringing people together. And here
was Morita, proposing a device that would isolate each listener
from the rest of the world, sealed within a solo sonic universe by
the lightest-weight headphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed as though nobody liked the idea,'' Morita recounts
in his autobiography, ``Made in Japan.'' ``Nobody laughed at me,
but I didn't seem to be convincing my own project team, though they
reluctantly went along. ... I don't think that any amount of market
research could have told us that the Sony Walkman would be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years and worldwide sales of almost 200 million units
later, the Walkman has triumphed beyond Morita's wildest
projections, establishing itself as a vital organ, or at least a
crucial appendage, for the modern listener. It's an invention that
plainly scratched an itch where no itch previously existed, one
that not merely fulfilled a desire, but instilled a demand. The
initial concern at Sony was ``Why would anybody buy a Walkman?''
The answer came soon enough, in the form of another question, ``How
could anyone live without one?''
</P>
<P>
   With this summer commemorating the 20th anniversary of the
product's launch, portable technology has since spun more than 600
different models under the Walkman banner, from CD Discmans to TV
Watchmans, from budget versions (under $20) to rugged Sports models
to the new Psyc line, designed to create a fashion demand among
teens, with sherbet shades of plasticity reminiscent of iMac. Not
to mention the thousands of knockoffs by hundreds of competitors,
in a category generically dubbed ``personal portable stereo,'' as
Sony zealously protects the Walkman trademark.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, then, that ``Walkman'' as a name was the source of
Morita's own reservations, that he had would have preferred, as he
explains, ``something like Walking Stereo.'' The tag that stuck
couldn't have passed the muster of political correctness in another
decade or so, when ``Walkperson'' or ``Walkwoman'' would have been
demanded. And its plural still makes grammarians cringe, though
``Walkmen'' never became standard usage. In the beginning, it was
the concept that was marketed internationally, not the name, as the
product was introduced in Japan as the Walkman, (and briefly) was
sold as Stowaway in Britain, Freestyle in Australia, Soundabout in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The second irony of the product launch is that Sony hedged its
earliest bets on sonic solitaire, giving the device two headphone
jacks. The two jacks allowed the music to still be a shared
experience, or at least a shared sound source, for two listeners
separated by a headphone barrier. If they wanted to talk, there was
even a mini-microphone on the early model that would allow
conversation to cut into the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could imagine people listening to music in solitude,''
Robert R. Nell, Sony's vice president of personal audio, later
reminisced to a reporter, though solitude proved to be precisely
the Walkman's appeal. Wearing a Walkman, you didn't need to talk
with anyone else, or even acknowledge anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded subway, on a busy jogging trail _ is it any
accident that the Walkman and running crazes flourished together? _
on the beach or at the office, you could turn on, tune out,
relegate the rest of the world to oblivion, establish a shell of
sound where any intrusion was a violation of your personal space.
(The second headphone jack and the microphone were quickly
discontinued.)
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the ironies, though the Walkman was initially
designed as an instrument of politeness _ allowing Morita and other
corporate jet-setters to enjoy music while traveling without
disturbing others _ its self-centeredness ultimately helped define
the era of its popular boom, the so-called ``Me Decade'' of the
'80s. In wearing a Walkman, the listener asserted that whatever the
outside world might have to offer, from surprise to serendipity,
was of less interest than the pre-programmed, self-controlled
experience of headphone life. Sonically, you were the master of
your domain, creator of the soundtrack to the movie of your
existence.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, at least an earlier generation's infatuation with
the transistor radio (celebrated in 1961's ``Transistor Sister'' by
the immortal Freddy ``Boom Boom'' Cannon) left one ear open, while
offering the possibility of discovery, the chance you could be
overwhelmed by a new song on the Top 40 that would change your
life. Where rock 'n' roll from the start had provided the
soundtrack to teen-age mobility _ that is, freedom _ the adventure
of cruising to Chuck Berry's ``No Particular Place to Go'' or the
Beach Boys' ``I Get Around'' was that you really didn't know where
you were going, or what you might find there.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its implications for society at large, the introduction
of the Walkman helped revolutionize the music industry. Within four
years, cassettes eclipsed the long-indomitable vinyl of LPs and 45s
as America's most popular medium for recorded music (with CDs soon
to supplant cassettes). Where Japanese production previously had
been derided as cut-rate and inferior, the Walkman helped Japan
elevate its reputation as both a technological pacesetter and an
economic powerhouse. When the globalization of the '90s devoured
the American music industry, Sony acquired the recording division
of CBS _ Columbia, Epic and associated labels _ with a roster
extending from Bob Dylan to Barbra Streisand to Michael Jackson to
Bruce Springsteen. Before Walkman, ``made in Japan'' was a
merchandising epithet; in Walkman's wake, Sony owned ``Born in the
U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   So public, and yet so private, the Walkman was the first step in
transforming each individual into a mobile communications and
multimedia unit. We talk by cell phone rather than face to face. We
message by e-mail rather than voice. We see movies in the solitude
of home video rather than within the community of a theater. And we
listen to music on headphones. We are plugged in, we are wired and
we are each so very much alone.

   For a long time, investing in the local telephone business meant
buying sleepy yet bedrock-solid stocks like those of the Baby
Bells. Substantially protected from competition until the enactment
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bells and other local
phone companies provided steady if unspectacular earnings growth,
healthy dividends and next to no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   As investments, these companies are still relatively
conservative and stable. But decades-old companies no longer have
the local communications business to themselves. Dozens of
upstarts, known in the communications business as competitive local
exchange carriers (or CLEC's, pronounced ``SEE-lecks''), are out to
provide competition in local communications markets ranging from
phone service to corporate data applications. The companies hope to
use new communications technologies and lean cost structures to
undercut the local giants while still making money.
</P>
<P>
   Their stocks provide investors a new way to participate in the
local end of the communications revolution, but they are also an
entirely different breed of investment vehicle _ risky and erratic,
because of their dependence on borrowed funds. From mid-June to
mid-August, most of these stocks lost about 20 percent of their
market value, though they have started to crawl back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring a lot of rocket fuel to a portfolio,'' said Mark
Kastan, who tracks the stocks for Merrill Lynch. ``They could
significantly enhance performance. But it's obviously high-risk,
high-reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the RCN Corp., one of the few upstarts that is aimed at
residential customers, rather than at businesses. Along with
Nextlink Communications Inc., which was founded by Craig O. McCaw,
the cellular phone pioneer, RCN is one of Kastan's favorite CLEC's.
</P>
<P>
   RCN's stock opened 1998 at $17.0625, climbed as high as $30.625
and then fell that October to $8.75 as the bottom fell out of the
high-yield debt market. By April 1999, the shares had surged to
$54.50. But with interest rates rising, RCN's shares have swooned
again, closing on Friday at $39.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI was the only competitive player on the long-distance
landscape for a long time, and it was an unbelievably volatile
company,'' said Alex J. Mandl, chairman of Teligent Inc., a local
service provider that uses fixed wireless links. ``In a sense, I
think you're seeing a similar situation in the local environment,''
he said. ``As 30, 40, 50 percent of the local market is occupied by
new players, I think that volatility will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, said Alex W. Peters, a communications analyst
for Franklin Advisors and co-manager of the Franklin Global
Utilities fund, ``these are high-beta stocks, so they outperform
the market in good times and underperform in bad times.'' Among
Peters' favorites is McLeodUSA Inc., one of the more established of
the upstarts, which focuses on the Midwest and Rocky Mountain
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of whether times are good or bad for the CLEC's tend
to change swiftly, because creating local networks is very
expensive. Pulling optical fiber under downtown streets, for
instance, can cost tens of millions of dollars in one city. So to
maintain their growth, almost all of them will have to return to
the high-yield well in the next 12 to 18 months. If interest rates
go up, so will the companies' cost of borrowing. Because Wall
Street values them on a discounted cash flow model that focuses
mostly on results in some distant year, a small change in interest
rates can imply a big swing in long-term valuations. Some Wall
Street analysts estimate that a 1 percent change in interest rates
can result in a 15 percent change in the value of one of these
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been other, more industry-specific concerns, too
_ for example, the impact of a proposal by a coalition of big local
and long-distance phone companies to lower the per-minute fees that
long-distance carriers pay to their local counterparts for
beginning and ending calls. In exchange, the local carriers would
be able to charge their customers higher fixed monthly fees. If
approved by Federal regulators, the plan would have a small but
negative impact on many of the local upstarts because they focus on
serving high-volume business users.
</P>
<P>
   But the essential issues facing investors in all these stocks
concern the basic structure of the telecommunications industry, not
relatively small regulatory questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, is the 100-year-old AT&AMP;T and Bell company
network the network for the next 10 or 20 years, given the way
people communicate now over the Internet?'' said David C. McCourt,
RCN's chairman. ``If the answer is no, then a basket of CLEC's is a
good investment. If the answer is yes, then CLEC's are not such a
great idea.''

PAIRING A TAX BREAK AND WEB GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 22) 
(jt) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some highly popular new Web sites have built impressive
followings on a simple premise: If you stop at them before shopping
on the Internet, some portion of what you spend will go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   As well intended as the pitch sounds, operators of the sites
have conceded that consumers were probably not eligible for tax
deductions on the money being diverted to the charitable groups.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most popular of these sites, iGive.com, now says
shoppers at its site may be able to take that deduction after all.
The company sent e-mail to its shoppers last week to alert them to
the development.
</P>
<P>
   The company has petitioned the Internal Revenue Service for a
private letter ruling that would confirm the propriety of its
approach, but in the meantime it has received the approval of its
tax lawyers at Hogan &AMP; Hartson in Washington. A private letter
ruling, which could take as long as two years to secure, would give
the company confidence that its shoppers' tax deductions would not
be challenged, but it would not protect its competitors' patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The question of tax deductibility may be technical and, for some
consumers, may involve such small sums that they will not bother
with the paperwork. But given the rapid growth of these Web sites,
the nickels and dimes can add up. For example, iGive, said its
68,000 members have raised $307,000 for charity in the nearly two
years since the site's founding. And tax deductibility may broaden
its appeal. Already, one competitor, Greatergood.com, has said that
it, too, is looking at ways to offer a tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, most of these shop-for-a-cause Web sites make their
money from the commissions they collect from retailers in exchange
for sending traffic their way. Shoppers then have the opportunity
to name a charity, which typically receives a cut of that fee, but
not always.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach at iGive.com is to give shoppers the option of
keeping that cut for themselves, in the form of a rebate, or having
it forwarded to the charity of their choice. Because the shopper
can demand the cash, routing the money to a charity would be more
likely to qualify as a tax-deductible gift for the shopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money looks like any other money you give to your worthy
cause,'' said the company's founder, Robert Grosshandler. He
pointed to the letter from his tax lawyers saying the IRS has once
before permitted such an arrangement, by a credit card company that
wanted to let customers divert part of their charge volume to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if iGive prevails with tax authorities, consumers may find
it hard to count on the deduction. For starters, iGive allows
consumers leeway to name just about any cause under the sun, and
its devotees do. One beneficiary, for instance, is the Broken Nose
Fund, a Portland, Maine, cause that was not registered as a charity
with regulators when it was started by a man who wanted to raise
money for his third nose job.
</P>
<P>
   As long as no one was taking a tax deduction, it hardly mattered
if some causes were not bona fide charities under section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code. But if consumers are claiming
deductions based on their shopping habits on iGive, tax experts say
they had better be sure to count only charities that qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Grosshandler, who says he is a big believer in personal
responsibility, quarrels with the idea that his customers need a
lot of hand-holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the business of vetting organizations for tax
deductibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential hitch to claiming the tax deduction would be
if the cause never gets the money. Although shoppers at iGive have
so far identified 5,300 causes to receive the $307,000 they have
generated in commissions, iGive has only sent $240,000 worth of
checks, to about 1,600 of these causes. In some cases, iGive cannot
locate a cause named by its shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, every cause must raise at least $10 through the Web
site before iGive issues a check. If shoppers do not spend much or
choose a cause that is obscure, the charity may fail to meet
iGive's minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question may simply be what happens if shoppers
start to flock to the site more for the rebate than to lend a hand
to charity. At least two other sites offering discounts, Ebates.com
and Esumer.com, have staked out the rebate turf. So, while the tax
strategy might work, it might also transform iGive from a
high-minded bankroller of charities to just another E-commerce
play.
</P>
<P>
   That might anger some retailers, who might not relish seeing
their goods discounted without any of the image-polishing they now
get by steering dollars to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Since iGive began offering the rebate last week, few people have
chosen to take the money rather than give it to charity, according
to Grosshandler. But he conceded that if people came to iGive not
to give, but to receive, the site would have to rethink its
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone chooses to get a check, the business model will
not work,'' he said.

ERUDITE PLAY ROOTED IN PAST, RELEVANT TO NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Describing Frank Dwyer's ``The Affliction of
Glory: A Comedy About Tragedy'' as a ``play of ideas'' is sort of
like describing the Harvard English department as a bunch of wise
guys.
</P>
<P>
   This engagingly eggheaded, if sometimes slow-moving, play about
(among many, many other things) the dumbing-down of popular culture
is a show with enough mental firepower to spark a dozen Ph.D.
dissertations.
</P>
<P>
   You practically can hear the author's mental synapses popping in
the background of the Getty Center's Harold M. Williams Auditorium,
where ``The Affliction of Glory'' opened a limited 15-performance
run Wednesday night. Dwyer is conceivably the only dramatist on
either side of the Atlantic who could make Tom Stoppard sound like
an ignoramus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Affliction of Glory'' bears a more than passing
resemblance to Stoppard's own ``Arcadia,'' in which the mysteries
of the unquiet past create a literary sleuthing game for several
intrepid members of the confused present.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, who also is a poet, director and literary
manager of the Mark Taper Forum, has attempted the Herculean task
of writing a play to mark an unusual collaboration among three of
L.A.'s premier cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Getty and the Huntington Library, Art
Collections and Botanical Gardens opened twin exhibitions of
paintings and drawings honoring Sarah Siddons, the regal,
porcelain-skinned British actress whose tragic performances were
said to make men cry and force women to be carried from London
theaters in hysterics. Co-commissioned by the Getty and the
Taper/Center Theatre Group, ``The Affliction of Glory'' adds
another dimension to the exploration of Siddons' formidable myth.
</P>
<P>
   Known in her heyday as ``the Muse of Tragedy,'' Siddons
(1755-1831) was cursed with the inability to play comedy
convincingly _ or, at least, to convince her idolatrous fans that
she should play it. (Think Meryl Streep in corsets and
uncomfortable shoes.)
</P>
<P>
   As Dwyer expresses it in the clever neo-Regency parlance he has
crafted for his talented and resourceful three-person cast (J.D.
Cullum, Nike Doukas, Patrick Egan), Siddons was ``betrayed by the
sublime.'' Like one of her venerable portraitists, the great Sir
Joshua Reynolds, she was an artist boxed in by the humdrum tastes
of Britain's burgeoning 18th-century middle classes, who couldn't
see that ``tragedies are concocted and irrelevant,'' whereas great
comedy is ``serious business.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're already scanning this page for footnotes, don't sweat
it. Though his script occasionally gets stalled in muddy fens of
allusion to 18th-century bowdlerizations of ``King Lear'' or the
neo-republican leanings of ``Paradise Lost,'' Dwyer for the most
part skillfully wrestles this abstract clay into compelling
flesh-and-blood portraits.
</P>
<P>
   His smartest conceit is making the play switch back and forth,
Pirandello style, from Siddons (Dukas), Reynolds (Cullum) and their
dynamic milieu to August 1999, when Bill (Cullum), a cerebral
actor-playwright, and Polly (Dukas), his scrappy co-star, muse and
significant other, are rehearsing a play about Sarah Siddons.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill and Polly, trying to make sense of Siddons' world and
her mystique triggers very modern questions not only about the
conflicting roles of wife, mother and actress that Siddons played,
but also about the difficulty of understanding her incredible
appeal. In some ways, ``The Affliction of Glory'' is about the
impossibility of truly knowing the past.
</P>
<P>
   Cullum and Dukas make Bill and Polly's brainy bickering quite
amusing, particularly in the Act 2 sequence when Polly recites one
of Siddons' legendary speeches, inserting squawks whenever the
flowery language (``Come, come, come, come, nay, come!'') seques
from sublime to ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cullum and Egan show remarkable versatility in a variety of
supporting roles, including Samuel Johnson, Lord Byron, William
Blake, a wandering German theater lover, a flamboyant Italian
painter and the wonderfully dotty English king (Egan) and queen
(Cullum), who address each other as Big Silly and Little Silly.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of ``Beyond the Fringe'' inspired looniness helps
deflate what might otherwise become an overwhelming sense of
self-importance. Corey Madden's direction, like John Iacovelli's
utilitarian set design, is sparsely effective. Candice Cain's
period costumes are without flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer and company have lifted Siddon's 2-D image off the wall
and set her before us in all her &UR;  &LR; 3-D complexity. Not a perfect
play, perhaps, but a glorious enterprise. &QL;

VIOLENT INCIDENTS BRING FEAR TO WORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time Debbie Jester hears about another workplace shooting,
she gets a little more nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if a disgruntled customer or disgruntled employee comes
in?'' asked Jester, the receptionist for a manufacturing company in
Houston. ``I'm the first one they'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there has never been any trouble with violence at the
company. But she said that trouble-free record doesn't keep her
from thinking about possible escape routes if she had to get out in
a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Jester isn't the only one who is nervous these days. Shootings
in post offices have made the phrase ``going postal'' part of the
nation's everyday vocabulary, even though many people who use it
forget its bloody origin. But the recent shooting at two
day-trading firms in Atlanta has put employees more on edge, made
workplace shootings more real.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to unnerve folks that an unhappy client _ not a
disgruntled employee or an upset spouse _ would come in and
randomly shoot people minding their own business.
</P>
<P>
   The fear almost sounds paranoid, Jester said, but she said it's
real. And it's something she and her co-workers talk about
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EMPLOYEES WORRIED, SILENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though employees like Jester are worried, they don't appear to
be passing along their concerns to their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit the radar screen yet and that's a bit surprising,
said Ruth Seiler, who hasn't heard a peep from her 30 client
companies. Seiler owns Staff Managers, which runs the human
resource operations for 30 companies in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She expected to hear the same kind of concern with the recent
outbreak of workplace violence that she did last summer after the
U.S. Supreme Court issued two rulings encouraging employers to
conduct sexual harassment training.
</P>
<P>
   Though shootings like the one in Atlanta are few and isolated,
workplace violence is real and growing. From 1992 to 1996, there
was an annual average of 2 million violent incidents at work, twice
the average of a decade ago, according to a 1998 report by the U.S.
Justice Department. Of the 2 million incidents, 1,000 were
homicides and 50,500 were rapes and sexual assaults. The rest were
assaults and robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace violence is a big issue to employees, but too many
times employers have not done enough to prevent it, said Lynne
McClure, president of McClure Associates in Phoenix, which
specializes in managing high risk behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Companies figure that it can't happen to them or that they
already have policies in place to deal with violence, McClure said.
But she said that when she has interviewed employees after a
workplace homicide, they're not surprised. It's the managers who
are surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers recognize the warning signs of problem employees,
such as frequent temper tantrums, a fixation on someone or
something or a tendency to blame others for their own problems, she
said. They worry because they never know what the employee may do.
And the longer an employer ignores the erratic, wild behavior, the
more it can fester, said McClure, author of ``Risky Business:
Managing Employee Violence in the Workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CLOSE TO THE EXIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recent workplace shootings haven't escaped Larry Williams'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, director of human resources for the Marek family of
companies, a Houston construction group, said that though he didn't
have much reason to worry, after terminating someone recently he
ducked out of his office and stayed close to an exit door _ just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   He has also changed his style of terminating an employee. Three
to five years ago, he used to explain exactly why someone was
getting the ax. If he was found stealing, he'd tell him that. Now,
he explains that things ``didn't really work out'' and suggests the
employee resign.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also sees a newly raised level of nervousness among his
managers. He suggested to one manager that he make sure that all
the money the employee had coming _ final paycheck, vacation pay,
severance _ was given to him at the time he was fired. That way,
the soon-to-be ex-employee has no reason to return.
</P>
<P>
   What if he was worried about a volatile ex-employee? It's a
tricky situation. Williams said he can't very well alert the
remaining employees because that would scare them unnecessarily.
And if the ex-employee found out, the notification might incite
him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, Williams said, he could just set up a secret security
system where, at the sign of trouble, he could just buzz the
biggest guy at the office.

   BUSH OFF THE HOOK IN ROBISON CASE
</P>
<P>
   (for commentary pages)
</P>
<P>
   By Susan E. Smith
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Larry Keith Robison, a paranoid schizophrenic, came
within hours of being executed this week. A stay from the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals saved him from becoming the 99th
death-row inmate executed on Gov. George W. Bush's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ordered a hearing to determine Robison's
mental competency to be executed. But based on the outcome, he
could still be executed.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which illustrates the many problems with the death
penalty, has placed Bush's compassionate conservatism on the firing
line once again.
</P>
<P>
   The court's action let Bush, who had been asked to grant a
30-day stay of execution for Robison, off the hook during an
election season when such a decision could spell political disaster
with voters who support the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Talk magazine article in which he reportedly mocked the
clemency appeals of Karla Faye Tucker exposes the shallow depths of
his compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's execution of the born-again Christian brought
national and international scrutiny to Texas' death penalty.
Robison's story brings an even worse kind of scrutiny to state
practices. Texas leads the nation in executions, yet ranks 48th
among states in services for the mentally ill, a disparity that
cries out for compassionate intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital punishment is especially barbaric when applied to
individuals, like Larry Keith Robison, whose crimes, although
extraordinarily serious and extreme, were the products of profound
and untreated mental illness,'' William B. Moffitt, president of
the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, wrote Bush
prior to the court stay.
</P>
<P>
   Robison, whose schizophrenia causes violent outbursts, fell
through Texas' tattered mental health safety net before he killed
five people in 1982. Doctors would not permanently hospitalize
Robison because he had not committed violent acts, says his mother.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Texas has executed 185 people since the death
penalty was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1976. Of the 99 cases on
Bush's watch, one person has been granted clemency.
</P>
<P>
   The court stay lets Bush off the hook in the Robison case, for
now. But he shouldn't be able to wiggle off the hook for his
unflinching support of the death penalty, which desperately needs a
touch of compassion for those, like Robison, who deserve it.

whose Microbus debuted in the 1950s and was at its cutest during
the '60s, when it began serving as the semiofficial mode of
transportation for the hippie movement.
</P>
<P>
   I was never a hippie, but I've owned my share of VW buses,
beginning with a beat-up 1960 model I had while I was in college.
The body style changed a bit in the 70s, making the Microbus
slightly larger, and the engine also changed, giving the vans more
power. I owned several of those.
</P>
<P>
   That body style gave way to the slightly larger, more
squared-off Vanagon model in 1980, and I even owned one of those.
One of the trademarks of the VW buses was its air-cooled
rear-mounted engine, but the last of the Vanagons, in the mid-80s,
came with rear-mounted, water-cooled engines.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, can't even claim to have invented the American
minivan. In 1962, Chevrolet rolled out the Corvair Greenbrier, a
VW-like minivan based on the rear-engine Corvair compact cars that
were introduced two years earlier. Ford introduced a small
front-engine van called the Econoline.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier came with a six-cylinder, air-cooled pancake
engine similar to the later four-cylinder pancake used in the VW
buses and Vanagon. It was a true minivan; it was two inches shorter
than the Corvair sedan, which was one of the smallest cars on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to drive on my parents' 1962 Greenbrier, which had a
two-speed automatic transmission with a small shift lever that
stuck out from the dashboard, just like on the Corvair cars. Later,
I owned a Greenbrier, which I used as a remote-broadcast van for an
AM radio station I owned in Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Today, DaimlerChrysler owns the lion's share of the minivan
market, and yes, the company did re-invent the minivan and take it
mainstream. The company has sold more than 500,000 of them a year
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But most of you probably don't know that Volkswagen still sells
a minivan, although it's drastically different from the Microbus
and the Vanagon.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the EuroVan, and it's a much more refined vehicle
than its predecessors. Introduced to the U.S. market initially in
the early 1990s, the EuroVan was discontined, except for a camper
version after 1994. But for 1999, the vans have been re-introduced
as regular passenger vehicles, and they are nicer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect anything like the original cutesy Microbus. The
anemic rear engines are gone. The EuroVan has a much more powerful,
front-mounted 2.8-liter V-6 engine similar to the one used in the
VW Passat and Jetta sedans.
</P>
<P>
   It's rated at 140 horsepower and 177 foot-pounds of torque, and
it delivers enough zip to allow the EuroVan to run with the best of
the minivans. (That wasn't the case with the Microbus, some of you
might recall; mountain grades were especially challenging to its
four-cylinder engines).
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the DaimlerChrysler minivans, the EuroVan is more
accurately described as a midivan. Its interior _ 190 cubic feet _
is larger than the average minivan, but less than that of a
full-size van.
</P>
<P>
   Creature comforts abound, which also is a departure from the
past. The Microbus was simple. The EuroVan has power windows and
door locks, air-conditioning that works, antilock brakes, cruise
control, programmable intermittent wipers with heated washer
nozzles, rear-hatch wiper and washer with defroster, power outside
mirrors and a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission
(rather than the old four-on-the-floor manual). Automatic climate
control is available on uplevel models. There also is a leather
interior package available.
</P>
<P>
   Families will love riding in the Eurovan. Different seating
arrangements are available. The base GLS model comes with two
forward-facing bench seats in the rear. With the two buckets up
front, it seats up to seven people.
</P>
<P>
   The uplevel MV model comes with a rear bench seat, two captain's
chair-style seats in the middle, facing the rear seat, and a table
that can be raised between the seats so you can eat or play games
while you're traveling.
</P>
<P>
   With the engine moved to the front, the cargo area is huge _
perfect for carrying camping gear and sports equipment. For more
hauling space, you can remove the center and rear seats, and the
cargo area is wide and long enough to hold standard sheets of
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   A camper model also is available. Its wheelbase is 15.7 inches
longer than the standard EuroVan's 115 inches, and it comes with a
pop-up top, swiveling captain's chairs up front, a two-burner gas
stove, refrigerator, and other amenities. (It is built in
partnership with Winnebago, which designed it to be essentially a
small motorhome.)
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to use the shorter EuroVan as a camper, the MV
model is available with a ``weekender'' package that adds a pop-up
roof with two-person bed, window screens for the two sliding side
windows, refrigerator, swiveling captain's chairs and more.
</P>
<P>
   The EuroVan can tow a trailer of up to 4,400 pounds, although
that would slow it down considerably on mountain grades.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, at highway speeds, the EuroVan is quiet _ also a
departure from the past. With its high roof and wide stance,
seating is comfortable and everyone has ample leg, knee and
shoulder room. There is one large sliding door on the right side
for access to the rear seating area. The rear hatch flips up for
easy loading of the cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is smooth, but not cushy. Handling is much crisper than
you would imagine for a vehicle of this boxy shape and size.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are higher than for most of the DaimlerChrysler minivans.
So if you're looking for a cheap people hauler, the EuroVan isn't
it. That, too, is a departure from the past. The GLS model lists
for $29,900 (plus $565 transportation), and the MV model begins at
$31,400. Add $3,495 for the weekender package to turn the MV into a
minicamper.
</P>
<P>
   Options include a 12,000 btu gas furnace, a power glass sliding
sun roof ($1,000, not available with the weekender package because
of the pop-up roof), alloy wheels ($315), heated front seats ($400)
and various seating arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle, the MV model, came with the sun roof, alloy
wheels, heated seats and special ``hot chili'' red metallic paint
$275). Total price, including transportation, was $33,955.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy ratings are 15 miles per gallon in the city and
20 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 21.1 gallons of gasoline, and
unleaded regular is recommended.

AT A GLANCE: 1999 Volkswagen EuroVan 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Seven-passenger, V-6 powered, front-engine,
front-wheel-drive minivan.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Volkswagen has re-introduced its modern minivan to
the U.S. market. This van first appeared in 1992, but disappeared
in all but camper form. It's bigger than the average minivan, and
has lots of amenities and much more power than the rear-engine VW
Microbuses or vans of the past. A perfect family hauler, especially
for vacations and camping trips; even camper versions are offered.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Not the most stylish-looking van on the market; ride
is a bit rougher than the more carlike minivans of DaimlerChrysler
and other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 15 miles per gallon city, 20 highway. Base
price: $29,900 (GLS model), $31,400 (MV model), plus $565
transportation. Price as tested: $33,955, including transportation
(MV model).
</P>
<P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Luca was in heaven. It was a summer evening, and the
Staffordshire terrier sat on a couch between Michael Cecchi and
Jennifer McConnell. As the couple talked, they constantly patted
Luca, who responded by licking their lips.
</P>
<P>
   A happier domestic scene you could not find. There was a catch:
Cecchi and Ms. McConnell broke up three years ago. They have
continued to share Luca, who is white with grey-brown circles
around the eyes. The couch belongs to Ms. McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Cecchi, an actor, had rescued a mangey Luca from
a kennel in New Jersey. Her ears had been clipped, leading her new
owners to believe she had been trained to fight. Together, they
nursed her back to health, consulting trainers and even a
self-described animal psychic about Luca's aggressive tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The psychic told them that when Luca was still nursing, two pit
bulls broke into the dark basement where she was kept, and killed
her mother and another puppy. ``And that is the trauma,'' Cecchi
said. ``For her, with other dogs, it is kill or be killed. It is a
survival instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Luca whined. ``She knows I am telling this story,'' Cecchi said.
``I know honey,'' he cooed. Ms. McConnell, who writes software,
rubbed her belly. ``It was weird,'' she admitted. ``But the things
the psychic told us make a lot of sense in terms of Luca and her
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Any couple so involved with their pet _ Cecchi once stayed home
with the dog on Thanksgiving rather than leave her alone, and Ms.
McConnell has the framed picture to prove it _ are not going to
find it easy to decide ownership after a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, they don't have to. More and more couples appear
to be arranging what might be called pet joint custody, especially
in a city like New York where there are lots of childless adults
bonding intensely with their animal companions. Stephanie Lafarge,
a psychotherapist based at the ASPCA on East 92nd Street, who
counsels adults about animal issues, said she has seen 10 couples
who arranged pet joint custody in the last two years, and it is
becoming more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joint custody is terrific if it is not another excuse for
fighting and prolonging the separation,'' Ms. Lafarge said.
Paradoxically, when Cecchi and Ms. McConnell were on the rocks
three years ago, Ms. Lafarge was their couples therapist, and at
the time she advised against joint custody of Luca, warning it
could be hard.
</P>
<P>
   But Cecchi and Ms. McConnell ignored her, believing that Luca's
happiness was all-important. When Ms. McConnell moved out into her
own apartment, Cecchi stayed over for several nights to
``transition'' Luca. ``Any new place feels threatening,'' Ms.
McConnell said. ``We didn't want her to be anxious. We got the same
bed so she would have it in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Cecchi's current girlfriend moved in with him,
but first he sought the dog's approval. ``I said, `Look, Luca, it
is your apartment,''' Cecchi recalled. ```If you would let her move
in, that would be great.' My girlfriend had a hard time. Luca would
go through her purse.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years of casually sharing Luca, Ms. McConnell asked
for a formal custody arrangement: three nights a week with her,
four with Cecchi. ``I suddenly had these stepmom feelings,'' she
said with a laugh. ``I didn't want to be replaced!'' She paused.
``I am over that now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to gauge how many people have pet joint custody or to
generalize about arrangements; people are intensely private about
breakups. Arthur I. Hirsch, a divorce lawyer, said pet custody
comes up in one out of 20 divorces, but true joint custody is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it goes through the same emotional battle as with
children,'' he said. ``Then the court has to intervene, rule on who
gets the parrot. Both parties will offer their version of why they
are the best. They may have witnesses, neighbors who say, `The
father beat the dog,' or `The mother kissed the dog.' I have heard
the story of a case where both parties were in the courtroom, with
the dog in the middle, to see which way it would go. They both
whistled and called.'' Hirsch laughed. The dog ran to the husband.
``It was not the deciding factor, but it was one of the factors,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most separating couples considering joint pet custody avoid the
courts, because pets are considered property under the law and not
subject to the rules for child custody. ``There are all kinds of
laws that relate to child custody, but pets are not given the
status similar to children,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce lawyer Raoul Felder added, ``The problem is the law
treats pets as a thing and people don't.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Kathy Yates would say amen. When Ms. Yates and her
husband separated in March after four years of marriage, they
decided to share Mia, a black and tan mutt they adopted from a
pound after their first dog died. ``We had gone through a lot with
dogs, and we both knew we loved Mia,'' Ms. Yates said.
</P>
<P>
   So Mia stays with Ms. Yates, a teacher of Feldenkrais physical
therapy, during the week, and with her estranged husband on
weekends. ``He goes to the country a lot, and I think that is nice
for her,'' Ms. Yates said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, handing off the pet between them is never easy. ``I
always have this feeling that Mia is trying to get us together,''
Ms. Yates said. ``She gets very excited when we meet and very
agitated when one of us leaves. I am sure I am projecting partly.''
</P>
<P>
   Only partly. Mia is clearly sensitive. At the time of the
breakup, Mia would whine when her owners fought. She even developed
a bladder infection. Ms. Yates' veterinarian told her that dogs are
often ``emotional barometers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Yates and her estranged husband live in the West
Village, so drop-offs occur on the street or at his apartment. ``He
has never been to my apartment,'' Ms. Yates said. ``Now, I live
with another guy from the dog run. But that's another story.''
</P>
<P>
   A new movie with Janeane Garofalo, ``Dog Park,'' which opens
Sept. 24, turns on the subject of pet joint custody: boy meets
girl, boy loses girl, boy must share his dog, Mogley, with
ex-girlfriend. The twist in the romantic comedy, written and
directed by Bruce McCulloch, is that Mogley is traumatized by
witnessing the enthusiastic love life of the hero's former
girlfriend and must visit an animal therapist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is a subject that interests Ms. Lafarge, the ASPCA's
(human) therapist. ``If the dog was part of the couple's intimate
life, at the time of the breakup that would be an issue,'' she
said. ``Ask any couple with a pet where it sleeps, more often than
not it sleeps in the bedroom. Then ask where the pet is when they
are having intercourse, and you enter a new realm.''
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch, an alumnus of ``Kids in the Hall,'' has never had pet
joint custody. ``I wrote the film because it seems like a social
phenomenon in a sense,'' he said. ``It is also one of those nice
things, it is like a big secret. People come out and say, `That
happened to me!' The other side of my film is that dogs keep us
practiced in love. Single people have dogs, and that is where their
love goes. When someone comes into the relationship, it is
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   If the emotions surrounding pet-sharing seem extreme or
misplaced, it is because for some, owning a dog or cat is a kind of
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people who don't have children, and their
animals are their children,'' said Joseph Olshan, a novelist who
lives in Vermont. His five-year arrangement to share Virgil, a
lanky Labrador retriever mix, with a former lover in New York City,
deteriorated into a ``rancorous situation,'' he said, adding, ``It
is difficult to maintain niceties with someone when your only
connection is a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tensions, Olshan continued to drive Virgil back and
forth between Vermont and the city. ``I felt we had no choice,'' he
said. ``It wouldn't be fair for the dog to be with one or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, before a scheduled handoff, Olshan's former
partner called to say the arrangement wasn't working. Olshan was
horrified. ``The night before I was supposed to bring Virgil to New
York, I had this terrible dream that I was going to lose the dog,''
he said. ``I woke up crying. The dog was under my bed and comforted
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Olshan tried to see Virgil again, his former partner, whom
he declined to name, told him the custody was off. Olshan never saw
Virgil again. ``It was awful,'' he said. ``I feel like there is no
remedy. Society hasn't developed one to protect people. I still
miss Virgil terribly. It was this amazing life here. I would get up
and write until three. Then we would go cross-country skiing or
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when couples who break up remain on good terms, and a pet
is shared equitably, joint custody is never a walk in the dog park.
Three years after Cecchi and Ms. McConnell broke up and began
sharing Luca, they say they are good friends and talk several times
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, they both visited Ms. McConnell's brother's country
house to give Luca time outdoors. But the reunion of her masters
under the same roof confused her utterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent half the night in Michael's room, half the night in
my room and the beginning of the night in the middle,'' Ms.
McConnell said, laughing. ``She was totally traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traumatized,'' Cecchi repeated, grabbing Luca's nose.

SURFING, AND ITS 1ST FAMILY, RIDES WAVE OF CULTURAL COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Aug. 22)  
(mk) 
 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ONOFRE STATE BEACH, Calif. _ On a hazy August morning in the
parking lot at San Onofre State Beach, Jonathan Paskowitz paced
back and forth inside a rickety camper van, wearing flip-flops and
salty board shorts. A cell phone was wedged between his ear and his
suntanned shoulder as he fielded a barrage of calls from Tommy
Hilfiger, the rock star Perry Farrell, his model-girlfriend and,
most important, his auto mechanic. The day before, while driving
from this Southern California beach to a surf shop in nearby San
Clemente, Paskowitz's 1970 Dodge van broke down, and he had to
nurse it back here.
</P>
<P>
   Paskowitz, a second-generation surf vagabond, is known to
friends as ``the TV'' because he is always on, always making noise.
But several phone calls later, the cell battery was nearly dead and
he did what any born-and-reared surfer would: He grabbed his long
board and headed toward the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Paskowitz is one of nine adult siblings who, along with their
parents, own and operate the Paskowitz Surf Camp, which was founded
in 1972 by the family patriarch, Dorian ``Doc'' Paskowitz, a
surfing pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, as surfing has ridden to ever greater
heights of cultural cool, the camp has become a ``must'' stop for
well-heeled hipsters eager to hang 10, ride the soup and mellow
out. Students have included musicians like Sarah McLachlan, Chris
Isaak, Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray, the members of Hanson and
Farrell, instigator of the Lollapalooza tours.
</P>
<P>
   Other graduates, who share bologna sandwiches on the beach
before plunging into the gentle three-foot swells, have included
Sky Dayton, the 27-year-old founder of Earthlink, the Internet
service provider; Kinka Usher, a film director whose ``Mystery
Men'' is now in theaters, and Tom Sachs, a New York artist known
for needling the fashion world with works like a plunger and toilet
bowl covered with Prada logos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great sport for aging hipsters because it's low-impact
and there's a lot of hanging around on the beach,'' said Sachs,
whose latest project is a fleet of long boards with Chanel logos,
which can be ordered from the Mary Boone Gallery this fall.
Jonathan Paskowitz is his design collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply indebted to the Paskowitzes,'' Sachs said. ``I went
to therapy for 20 years of my life, and I don't think I'll ever
need to go back now that I learned to surf.''
</P>
<P>
   Keki Mingus, the daughter of the jazz bassist Charles Mingus,
came to the Paskowitz camp for a weekend several years ago and
ended up staying three months. ``Almost everyone in the
entertainment business in Los Angeles that's kind of cool surfs,''
said Ms. Mingus, who works as a stylist for rock bands. ``It's this
kind of `secret-society-bonding' thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ms. Mingus' wedding in May in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, to
Stirling McIlwaine, the manager of Hanson, the Paskowitzes gave
surf lessons to guests. ``When I'm surfing, I completely forget
about things like who needs what clothes for the Oscars or the
Grammies,'' Ms. Mingus said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLachlan, founder of the Lilith Fair tour, learned to surf
at the camp a few months ago and is so stoked she plans to return
with her dog after the tour ends this summer. (Her managers made
her agree that she wouldn't surf during the tour, to avoid
injuries.)
</P>
<P>
   The eight Paskowitz brothers and one sister were raised in a
12-foot camper by their Mexican-born mother, Juliette, and father,
a Stanford-trained doctor who gave up his practice to travel the
world with his brood in search of endless summer. ``We'd pull up to
a city like Manhattan in our tiny camper, and there'd be surfboards
piled up on the roof,'' Abraham Paskowitz recalled. ``Dad would
double-park, and then nine kids in surf clothes would pile out onto
the street like a bunch of gremlins.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents gave most of their home-schooled children Old
Testament names. Besides Abraham, 37, they are David, 40, who, when
he's not involved in the camp, is the lead singer of a funk band
named Goldfish; Jonathan, 37, a former long-board champion and a
founder of Black Flys Eyewear, which makes surf sunglasses; Israel,
known as Izzy, 36, a former world champion surfer who now oversees
the camp; Moses, 34, who transports actors in the movie industry;
Salvador, 31, a graphic designer for surf clothing companies; Adam,
29, the lead singer of the Flys, a band signed to the Trauma label;
Navah, 27, the sole daughter and a model, and Joshua, 24, formerly
of the Flys and now beginning a solo career as a singer.
</P>
<P>
   The family has a development deal with Artisan Pictures, the
independent film company that distributed ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' for a feature based on their lives, Jonathan Paskowitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a rising and falling swell, surfing periodically goes in
and out of fashion, both at the beach and miles inland, where
youngsters raised in suburban sprawl or inner cities turn up at
school in baggy board shorts or surf-shop T-shirts. The latest wave
of surf style has been gaining momentum for more than a year.
Roxy/Quiksilver, the world's largest surf-wear company, increased
its sales by 64 percent, to $128 million, in the first quarter of
1999, compared with a year earlier. Old Navy, Tommy Hilfiger and
Gucci all offered brightly printed board shorts this spring and
summer. Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch sold T-shirts inspired by vintage surf
contests, while the company's in-store magazine included a history
and guide to surfing naked.
</P>
<P>
   The Surf Industry Manufacturers Association, a trade group, says
the number of active surfers rose to 1.75 million last year, from
1.1 million in 1992. In the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, the advertising agency, meetings with executives
from companies like Levi's take place around a conference table
made of surfboards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Manhattan, Roxy/Quiksilver opened a SoHo store
last year with two red surfboards outside to set it apart from all
the makeup stores. And Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas announced
the other day that they would be celebrity partners in a
surf-themed fast-food restaurant, Maui Tacos, which is to open next
door to Moomba this fall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of this posing in the culture at large has spelled
opportunities for bona-fide, high-profile surfers like the
Paskowitzes. They are seen by nonsurfers as authentic
representatives of the surfing life _ but not so authentic that
they cannot be embraced by marketers and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like the little pulses in the water that eventually
make a perfect wave,'' Abraham Paskowitz said, referring to his
family's place in the surf-trend food chain. ``We are so `for
real,' it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tommy Hilfiger moved into surf-inspired clothing in a
significant way two years ago, he signed the Paskowitz family to a
sponsorship deal: They lend their name to a line of T-shirts and
caps with the PSC logo (for Paskowitz Surf Camp) sold in about
1,000 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tommy sponsors music, it's the Rolling Stones,'' Hilfiger
said. ``When we go after cars, it's Ferrari, and when it comes to
surfing, there's no one more cool and credible than the
Paskowitzes.'' Without the family, whom he supplies with clothing
to wear at their camp, Hilfiger said, ``It would have been very
difficult to get a toe in the hard-core surf community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some surfing purists have balked as nonsurf companies have moved
to market their apparel and style to the landlocked masses.
Hard-core surfers rejected Hilfiger's first batch of board shorts,
introduced last summer, because they had a net lining, which the
surfers considered uncool. Hilfiger conceded this was an oversight
and has since eliminated the net.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Paskowitz, the family patriarch, now 78, said he suspected
that the Hilfiger company had made only a ``fair weather''
commitment to his family and the surfing life. ``If they don't make
a lot of money in the short term, they'll just move on to the next
fad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine it would be any other way for a giant
national brand. But for the moment, the sun is still shining at the
beach. In fact, Hilfiger said that he and his family plan to try
their luck surfing at Camp Paskowitz in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the no-frills camp, which is run from June through
October and is open to all ages and skill levels, may strike the
designer as a long way from the jet-set life he is used to. An
aqua-colored school bus transports the 15 to 20 students per
session between the beach and a nearby state campground, where they
stay in a few communal tents and eat at a long picnic table.
(Jonathan Paskowitz said that some celebrities check into a nearby
Ritz-Carlton.) The Paskowitzes themselves stay in a fleet of old
campers; both parents and all their children, along with wives,
grandchildren and other relatives are in residence at different
times during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   There are also more than a dozen young, fit blond instructors
and assistants, some related to famous surfers. The food is
notoriously bad, shade is minimal, and in-water instruction tends
to be casual _ critiques usually start out with ``Dude, you rock!''
Each session lasts one week and costs $900.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a camp with color-coded surfboards and
`Bay Watch'-y counselors, then it's definitely not the place,''
said Ms. Mingus, the stylist.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Paskowitz added: ``I think it's surprising to a lot of
people that our camp is not what everyone associates with surfing.
It's not the young, alternative generation, tribal, pierced,
go-for-it punks that you see on MTV. It's family-vibed and laid
back. That's what surfing is really about.''

   Between 3 and 6 inches of rain fell in east-central Pennsylvania
early Friday ahead of a potent, slow-moving jet stream disturbance
sliding southeast from the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, steady rains will spread into southeast New England as
Atlantic moisture streams inland north of a tandem of low pressure
systems along the Eastern Seaboard. Up to 2 inches of rain are
possible, particularly on higher ground away from the coast, where
moist ocean winds are forced to rise over the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, thunderstorms will erupt over the Middle Atlantic
Seaboard as a cold front associated with the low pressure system
over the Northeast wedges under and lifts very humid air. A few of
the storms will approach severe levels, with damaging straight-line
winds and large hail posing threats.
</P>
<P>
   The area at greatest risk will span from eastern Virginia and
the Delmarva Peninsula to North Carolina, where cooling aloft
associated with the jet stream disturbance combines with low-level
warmth to destabilize the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered heavy thunderstorms will rumble across southern
Florida as sea-breeze fronts lift low-level humid air. With
moisture also arriving overhead from Tropical Storm Bret swirling
slowly northward over the Bay of Campeche, rainfalls could exceed
two inches in some places.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bands of fitful showers and thunderstorms on the
northern flank of Tropical Storm Bret will approach extreme south
Texas, though the heaviest rains will stay over northeast Old
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WHAT'S IN A NAME
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Dora became a typhoon as it moved west across the
International Date Line late Thursday. The transformation was not a
meteorological one, but rather a matter of bookkeeping. Hurricanes
and typhoons are the same type of storm, but these mature tropical
swirls with winds over 64 knots are given different names in
different parts of the globe. They are called hurricanes in the
Atlantic or eastern Pacific and typhoons in the western Pacific.
Near the Philippines such a storm is locally called a baguio. In
the Indian Ocean, the storms are known by the generic name
``tropical cyclone.''

CHILDREN IN EXTREME POVERTY UP 27 PERCENT, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 22)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the third anniversary of the new welfare reform
law, the Children's Defense Fund released a report Sunday blaming
the controversial measure for what fund analysts said was a steep
rise in the number of children living in families at the bottom of
the income ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The study, drawn from U.S. Census Bureau data, showed 2.7
million children who fit the government's informal definition of
extreme poverty: Their family income is at or below $6,401 for a
family of three _ equivalent to $123 a week _ or $8,200 for a
family of four.
</P>
<P>
   The census numbers are from 1997, the last year for which data
is available. The Children's Defense Fund analysis reported the
number of 2.7 million children was 426,000, or 27 percent, more
than in 1996, the year Congress passed the welfare law requiring
work after two years and limiting a recipient's lifetime benefit to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The government pegged poverty in 1997 at a yearly income of
$16,400 for a family of four, and $12,802 for a family of three. It
defines extreme poverty as annual income at half those levels.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Weinstein, director of the fund's family income
division, attributed the rise to the difficulty that former welfare
recipients encounter in making the transition from welfare to work.
She noted that 87 percent of the 426,000 increase came from poor
children in mother-only families.
</P>
<P>
   In Weinstein's view, the numbers are more striking since the
increase took place against the backdrop of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that more than 400,000 children are being left
behind, so we have a lot more work to do,'' Weinstein said. ``Yes,
more families are working and that's great. We want to encourage
work but families ought to be able to work and lift their children
out of poverty. So far, that's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its conclusion that the number of children in extreme
poverty is rising, the study also reported the 1997 level of 2.7
million children is below the 1993 level, when 3.2 million children
were in families at the lowest income levels. Also, it is below the
1994 level of 3 million children.
</P>
<P>
   The study is a marked contrast to upbeat assessments by
President Clinton and congressional Republicans about how welfare
caseloads have declined since the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The welfare rolls have been cut in half,'' Clinton said
proudly earlier this month after the government reported 7.3
million people on welfare as of last March _ a 40 percent reduction
since the 1996 law, and a 48 percent reduction since Clinton took
office in January 1993. ``They're at their lowest level in 32
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the welfare reform law, many Democrats and
liberal social advocates warned it would usher in a new era of
extreme poverty for poor families and children.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said her group is less interested in rolling back the
clock to the pre-reform era than in making sure that former
recipients now working get extra help from government.
</P>
<P>
   The states, which have saved $54 billion in welfare payments
since the law's enactment, have not spent an estimated $4 billion
in federal block grants intended to help ex-recipients ease into
the work force. While some states have used the funds to help these
new workers, others are saving it for ``rainy day'' emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Michael
Kharfen said the government has encouraged the states to use the
money to help new workers with childcare, transportation, anti-drug
and -alcohol abuse programs care and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Kharfen said the Children's Defense Fund study failed to account
for the overall reduction in children living below the poverty line
since 1994, from 22.7 percent of all U.S. children that year to
19.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us can be content when such a large number of children
remain in poverty,'' Kharfen said. ``Nevertheless, when you look at
full picture, a number of (administration) policies have been
successful in helping families raise themselves out of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kharfen cited the expansion of the earned income tax credit, a
raise in the minimum wage and Clinton's call last month for eased
eligibility rules for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said the fund's high rate of increase in extreme
poverty among children is attributable to their families losing
benefits that typically went along with welfare, particularly food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures show a dramatic decline in the number of
recipients of food stamps, the U.S. Agriculture Department program
to provide food subsidies to the impoverished. Five months ago,
18.1 million people were receiving food stamps, a drop of 35
percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts disagree over what has caused the drop, with some
arguing it's due to the robust economy. But Weinstein and others
attribute the decline to former welfare recipients who are unaware
that they may still qualify for this particular benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very troubling when we see that part of the safety net,
which wasn't supposed to change, has become far less available to
families with children,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced an
effort to work with states to inform former welfare recipients
about continued eligibility for food stamps.

OF SUPERMARKETS, CARTESIAN LOGIC AND THE PRICE OF FRENCH APRICOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Sometimes the French really do seem to think
differently.
</P>
<P>
   In the country that Descartes imprinted with Cartesian logic,
people side with transit workers when bus, rail, and subway strikes
make it impossible to get to work on time.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers entering traffic at many intersections don't even cast a
glance at cars approaching from their left. By the logic of French
traffic rules, traffic from the right has priority and an accident
would therefore, a priori, be illogical.
</P>
<P>
   And because paid vacations have been a right only since the
1930s, and are a scrupulously observed August rite now, Paris shuts
down at the height of summer, leaving hordes of tourists to fend
for themselves. Therefore, the most celebrated ice cream parlor in
town, La Glacerie Berthillon on the Ile Saint-Louis, is closed for
vacation until Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And logically, at the height of the summer fruit and vegetable
season, prices should be lower. But by a logic perhaps only the
French can understand, fruit and vegetable producers are hoping
that a new government regulation requiring retail stores to post
the wholesale prices they paid for the produce alongside the retail
price _ which is always much higher _ will pressure wholesalers to
pay the producers more.
</P>
<P>
   What would American consumers do on learning that the price they
pay for apricots at the supermarket, the equivalent of $1.48 a
pound at the G20 supermarket in Paris this week, cost the store 70
cents or less at the wholesale market? Ask the store to pay more
for the fruit wholesale, or to charge customers less?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're thinking capitalistically,'' a Frenchman who
understands Americans well, Prof. Patrice Higonnet of Harvard
University, explained to an American in Paris. ``This is French
republican thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   By Gallic logic, French consumers seeing the wholesale and
resale prices on the shelves will side with underdog farmers, just
as they do with underdog railway workers, and show their solidarity
by pressuring wholesale distributors to be fairer to producers,
explained one farmer, Guy Savanier, from his apricot orchard and
vineyard near Nimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer will know that every product with two prices
listed is a product in difficulty,'' Savanier said. ``We hope they
will buy more, which will increase demand and raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded like economic logic, but Savanier hoped there would
be something more. ``We also expect a civic attitude by
distributors, in the sense that they will accept a more equitable
sharing of profit margins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, French supermarkets, the villains in Savanier's eyes, will
pay producers more for French fruit and vegetables, but not raise
supermarket retail prices. ``We don't want consumers to pay more,''
Savanier said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, 200 farmers blocked the center of the historic
Rhone River city of Avignon with 2,500 supermarket shopping carts
to protest falling prices. The day before, Jean Glavany, the
minister of agriculture, posted an order requiring supermarkets to
list both wholesale and retail prices for peaches, nectarines,
apricots, melons and pears for a month, for grapes and apples for
two months, and for tomatoes and cucumbers for three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not naive,'' Savanier said. ``We'll see what happens and
decide what to do then.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will happen, Christian de Boissieu, an economics
professor at the Sorbonne, told the daily Le Figaro on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers are counting on consumers to put pressure on
distributors,'' he said. ``But even if this solidarity mechanism
comes into play, it has no way of influencing the prices paid to
producers, which depend on many other factors like handling and
transportation costs, without mentioning phenomena like
overproduction. It's hard to imagine the consumer writing letters
to supermarket managers accusing them of pocketing scandalous
profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouki Abebssa, who runs a vegetable store on the Rue de la
Pompe in Paris, agreed. ``Consumers know there's a markup, and if
the quality is good enough, they're willing to pay for it,'' he
said. ``Telling them what the supermarket paid won't change
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel-Edouard Leclerc, the head of a chain of supermarkets that
bears his name, called the new regulation ``a political solution
responding to a demand by agricultural unions that won't make
prices rise.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the daily Liberation that when supermarkets eventually
posted wholesale prices, they would be national averages provided
by the Ministry of Agriculture, not the actual prices supermarkets
negotiate with producers' cooperatives, which are jealously guarded
trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Savanier said heavy spring frosts last year cost him most of his
grape crop, and now bumper fruit crops were making him sell at a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got as little as 3 to 3.50 francs a kilogram for apricots
this year,'' he said, the equivalent of about 25 cents a pound for
the fruit that G20 was getting $1.48. ``The average loss for
medium-size orchards around here this year has been 500,000 to
700,000 francs,'' he said, roughly $83,000 to $116,000.

   By December, Standard Register expects to upgrade its SmartWorks
Web site to allow customers to order stock documents and
specialized print jobs via the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that we'll see significant growth in the
ordering of Standard Register products over the Internet. It will
also allow us to penetrate markets we previously didn't have access
to,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The self-service Web site will allow Standard Register to serve
small businesses, midsize banks and doctors' offices, he said. It
wouldn't be cost-effective to send sales representatives to such
small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Register introduced a Web-based version of SmartWorks
12 months ago and it serves 600 customers with 11,000 users every
day. The new version, which will kick in automatically, offers more
features and functions, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Register, based in Dayton, prints documents and forms
and offers document management services. It had $1.4 billion in
sales last year and company officials hope to hit $2billion in
revenues by 2001.

ON A COFFEE FAMILY TREE, AN OLDER BRANCH SPOUTS ANEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Ore., Mass.)  (For release Sun., Aug. 22) 
(jt) 
 By ANNE DONKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Baldwin is convinced that he hasn't missed the boat. In
fact, he feels that the curious timing was practically forced on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Peet's Coffee and Tea, the model for and onetime sibling of
Starbucks, is at last ready to roll out nationwide _ 33 years after
it began in Berkeley, Calif., a decade after specialty coffee shops
emerged as a nationwide phenomenon and just as Starbucks, the
industry giant, is warning of slower earnings growth to come.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, the chairman of Peet's, sees no alternative. ``My goal
for Peet's is to stay independent,'' he said. ``To do that, we're
forced to grow. Peet's would be more vulnerable in a single market
than in multiple markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Peet's, which is privately owned, currently operates 49 stores.
Only five are outside California _ three in Chicago, one in
Portland, Ore., and one in Boston. A second Boston store, No. 50 in
the chain, will open next month, and Baldwin wants to rev up to a
pace of 10 to 15 new stores a year until the roster reaches a few
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Those are tiny numbers compared with Starbucks, which operates
or franchises more than 2,300 stores worldwide, opens new stores at
a rate of more than one a day, competes hard for the best
street-corner and mall locations and, last year, without breaking
stride, swallowed a rival chain in England that is bigger than
Peet's. But Baldwin said Peet's doesn't want to be another
omnivorous, Starbucks-like power; instead, it is aiming to carve
out a boutique niche.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons with Starbucks are no stretch for Baldwin. Along
with two friends, he founded Starbucks in Seattle in 1971, as a
single coffee store in the Pike Place Market. To supply them with
coffee beans, they sought out Alfred Peet of Berkeley, the grand
old man of specialty coffee in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 1950s that Peet, a Dutch immigrant from a family
of coffee merchants, began importing arabica coffee beans _ which
yield the strong, dark, oily brews favored in Europe _ to the
United States. When he opened his first retail store in 1966 at
Walnut and Vine Streets in North Berkeley, some customers dismissed
his dark-roasted coffee as ``burned.'' But it caught on with the
students, artists, writers and musicians of the city's burgeoning
bohemian scene, and a cult was born.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a Peet's store, and the kinship to Starbucks is
obvious in everything from the warm wood paneling, the pungent
aroma and the choreographed service to the bean-roasting style.
</P>
<P>
   Peet, now 79, said Baldwin and his partners ``didn't know a
thing about coffee'' when they approached him, so he insisted that
they come to Berkeley and learn about the product before he would
sell to them. When they returned to Seattle, they opened a clone of
Peet's, which at the time emphasized sales of coffee beans and tea
leaves and did not offer muffins, espresso or, for that matter,
anywhere for patrons to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Peet sold Peet's in 1979, and Baldwin acquired it five years
later, adding its four stores to a portfolio that included
Starbucks and Caravali, a wholesale coffee brand. In 1987, he
decided to sell one of his businesses, and his wife persuaded him
to let go of Starbucks, by then a six-store chain, and to keep
Peet's.
</P>
<P>
   Peet's ``was the original,'' he explained, and however good
Starbucks became, ``it would never be Peet's.'' The buyer was
Howard Schultz, a former Peet's employee who left the year before
to start his own coffee company, Il Giornale.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that transferred Starbucks to Schultz's control
included a noncompete agreement that expired in 1992, the year that
Starbucks went public and began growing exponentially. After the
agreement ran out and Starbucks outlets began appearing near Peet's
stores in the San Francisco Bay area, ``everyone predicted Peet's
demise,'' Baldwin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Peet reckons that that was the time to expand
aggressively, not now. ``It is way too late in the game for
Peet's,'' he said of Baldwin's plans. ``They should have done this
a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baldwin thinks that just as Peet's survived then, it can
thrive nationally now without having to meet the Starbucks
juggernaut head-on.
</P>
<P>
   New shops will be opened primarily in cities where Peet's
mail-order coffee business, which contributes 15 percent of its
revenue, already has a significant following, Baldwin said. The
company will stress the freshness of its product. ``We will never
sell coffee beans more than seven days after roasting,'' he said,
adding that a new roasting plant east of the Rockies may be needed
to fulfill that promise. ``Starbucks may be the volume leader;
Peet's is the national quality leader.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Starbucks says it is not prepared to cede any
ground at the high end of the coffee spectrum. ``Our quality is
best of class,'' said Cheri Libby, a spokeswoman for the company,
adding that it was Starbucks' policy not to comment directly about
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to Baldwin's plan is market positioning. He said
Peet's wants to appeal to customers who now avoid Starbucks in
favor of local specialty shops, because they hope to find coffee
with more personality or because they just don't like giving their
business to a huge corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is sure that customers will never think of Peet's that
way. ``Before I bought Peet's, I felt it was unique, and I continue
to believe that it is,'' he said.

INVESTING WITH DONALD AND CRAIG HODGES OF THE HODGES FUND

 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald W. Hodges, who runs the $33.6 million Hodges Fund with
his son, Craig D. Hodges, has an investing mandate as wide open as
the Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a nice blend of big, mid-cap and some small stocks,''
the elder Hodges said in his Texas drawl. ``We don't confine
ourselves to growth or value stocks, either. You need a strategy
that will enable you to score no matter what the defense is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he pay much attention to the overall market. ``We don't
get overly concerned about the market per se,'' he said from his
antique-filled office in a turn-of-the-century mansion near
downtown Dallas. ``We're more concerned about individual companies
and where they are in their business cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges' big-tent approach to the markets results in an eclectic
portfolio, with everything from sizzling growth companies to
beaten-down value investments.
</P>
<P>
   The Hodges Fund returned 20.9 percent, annualized, for the three
years ended Aug. 19, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher. That is better than the 16.3 percent, on
average, for mid-cap blend funds, a category that includes his
wide-ranging portfolio. But it is worse than the 27.9 percent
return of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, 65, says his stock-picking style has evolved over his 40
years in the securities business. Besides the fund, Hodges Capital
Management runs $55 million for individuals and small institutions,
partly managed by his son, 35, who became a co-manager of the fund
in April. The elder Hodges also owns First Dallas Securities, a
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s and '70s, I was a pure contrarian, buying
out-of-favor stocks,'' he said. ``In the '80s, that stopped
working. I realized that sometimes it did make sense to buy stocks
with very high multiples.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains the fund's unusual portfolio, about equally
divided among fast-growing momentum stocks, blue-chip growth
companies and contrarian plays. Sliced another way, it includes
roughly equal amounts of small stocks, those with market
capitalizations of less than $1 billion; mid-cap stocks, with
market caps from $1 billion to $5 billion, and big stocks, with
market caps of more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio breakdown shifted slightly in the spring. ``I sold
many of my Internet stocks, because I think they got overpriced,''
Hodges said. He removed ETrade and Yahoo, among others, from the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he has been adding value stocks. There is such a
disparity between price-to-earnings ratios and the growth rates of
revenues and earnings ``that the value today is in the slower
growers,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other money managers, Hodges does not screen stocks
by computer. He relies on a much more old-fashioned method _
reading. ``I read in the morning when I get up and all day long,''
he said. In what he calls a ``diligent search for information,'' he
scours research reports, newspapers and anything else he can find
for news about companies.
</P>
<P>
   His son added, ``He's seeing the same thing that a technical guy
would see on a computer, but he does it just by watching the stock
trade for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   The key factor in picking stocks, the son said, is management.
``We're not experts in retail or high tech, but we're good judges
of character,'' he said. They look for management that owns
substantial chunks in the company and treats shareholders fairly.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Hodges also says intuition plays a big part in his
stock-picking.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to revenue gains, he said, ``I like to see
consistent growth, but I don't have any minimum, because slow,
steady growers can be just as valuable as faster-growing stocks
that may not be as reliable.'' He also looks for consistent
earnings growth and little debt.
</P>
<P>
   The two start with a small position in a stock _ 10,000 to
20,000 shares, depending on the price of the stock _ and build it
up over two to six months. The fund generally holds 50 to 55
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks typically are sold when prices rise quickly, the elder
Hodges said. He sold the fund's big position in ETrade in May,
after its price rose tenfold in six months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February, Hodges started buying Tractor Supply, a
Nashville-based chain of 257 stores that sells farm equipment,
animal feed and other supplies. Management knows the business well,
he said, and has successfully developed a local concept into a
national chain.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying at $26 a share; the stock now is at $18.50,
just nine times his 1999 earnings estimate of $2.01 a share, he
said, because it has suffered from the overall lack of interest in
smaller stocks. He expects earnings growth of 18 to 20 percent a
year over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The fund added to its position in Starbucks, the Seattle coffee
giant, in early July, after the company announced that it was
starting a reserve to set up an Internet site and that its earnings
would not meet Wall Street expectations. The stock, which had
traded as high as $41 in May, tumbled after the announcement, and
Hodges picked up shares at $24 and $25; he first bought Starbucks
stock last October at $16.64.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that earnings and revenues have grown consistently,
Hodges said Starbucks is ``a great growth company that just had a
bit of temporary bad news but, like McDonald's, will continue to be
a great growth story for a long time.'' Management, he said, is
imaginative, generous with employees and aggressive about opening
new stores.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed on Friday at $20.50, or about 38 times
analysts' estimated earnings of 54 cents a share for the fiscal
year that ends in September.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges has also expanded his position in Sun Microsystems, the
computer software and hardware maker. He started buying shares at
$41.90 in January, because Sun ``is the closest thing to a
contender to Microsoft that exists,'' he said. The company is a
momentum play, he said, adding, ``it's hard to rationalize the
stock price based on earnings, but I have to assume that as the
industry gets bigger, they'll have their fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges calls Sun's management ``very entrepreneurial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've defied pundits and naysayers by successfully taking on
risk,'' he said. The stock closed on Friday at $74.25, or almost 44
times analysts' consensus earnings forecasts of $1.70 a share for
the fiscal year ending next June.

HOUSE-HUNTING WITH THE CLINTONS

<P>
   President Bill and Hillary Clinton are shopping for a house, an
ordeal that may strain their marriage even more than that
unpleasant business with what's-her-name.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Hillary's expected Senate bid, the Clintons
are house-hunting in Westchester County, a leafy and very expensive
suburb of New York City. According to The Washington Post, the
Clintons are looking at homes in the $1.7 to $2.3 million price
range, enough to get you a very nice pad around where I live but
barely enough for an unheated tool shed in Scarsdale. But deciding
how much they want to spend is only one of the arguments the
Clintons are likely to have while shopping for a house. The
president, one has to figure, will want a house close to a golf
course while Hillary will be looking for a home that is convenient
to shopping, restaurants and movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary will say that she doesn't want to live near a golf
course because she doesn't want errant golf balls crashing through
the windows and bouncing off the lanai while she's on the phone
discussing foreign policy with President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bill will contend that malls make him itch and there hasn't been
a movie he's wanted to see since ``Air Force One.'' He will also
whine about how much he hates paying $25 for a cheese sandwich and
how there isn't a restaurant in all Westchester County that can
make chicken fried steak and hush puppies as good as Mama could.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, will cause Hillary to roll her eyes and wonder,
once again, what kind of boob she married. Bill, who has seen that
look all too often, will lose his temper and tell Hillary that he's
through house-hunting for the day and that he's going out for pizza
and cigars with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   A sad scenario, indeed, but it doesn't have to be this way. As
someone who has been dragged through the house-hunting ordeal three
times in his life, I have learned a few (painful) lessons that I am
more than happy to pass along to the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   1) The house that you can afford and the house that you wind up
buying are two entirely different animals. The house that my wife
and I can afford, for example, would cost somewhere in the
neighborhood of $211. Unfortunately, it is hard to find houses in
that price range, even where I live. So we wound up buying a house
that costs what both of us will make at our jobs if we continue
working until age 211. (That, by the way, is the formula that real
estate agents and mortgage lenders use to determine what they think
you can afford to pay for a house.)
</P>
<P>
   2) Do not buy a house next to a house that has a nitro-fueled
dragster parked in the front yard. We learned this lesson the hard
way.
</P>
<P>
   3) Use a BB gun to shoot the rats that crawl along your
telephone line from your orange tree to your attic. Despite what
the animal-rights nuts may say, this is no more inhumane a way of
dispensing of rats than poison or traps, plus it sharpens your eye
and steadies your nerves, possibly resulting in lower scores on the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   4) Make sure your new home has lots of cable-TV outlets. This
way Bill can go in one room and watch the Golf Channel while
Hillary can go in another and watch the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   5) If you think that Chelsea may be living with you during
summer vacation or after she graduates from college (though I can't
for the life of me imagine why she'd want to), be sure to buy a
house in which the guest bedroom is located far away from the
master bedroom, preferably in another state.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Bugs Bunny may be politically incorrect, but he won't
be bounced from the Canadian airwaves after all.
</P>
<P>
   The wascally wabbit got off with a paw-slapping this week after
being hauled before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council for
insinuating that women are ``witches.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bugs first uttered the offending remark 45 years ago.
But his misogyny is only now catching up with him.
</P>
<P>
   A formal complaint against Bugs was lodged with the
quasi-judicial tribunal by an Ontario woman angered by the closing
line of the cartoon ``Bewitched Bunny,'' which has aired hundreds
of times in Canada and the United States since its release by
Warner Brothers in 1954, apparently without previous complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The animated yarn is a Looney Tunes twist on the fairytale
classic ``Hansel and Gretel.'' In it, Bugs saves a pair of kids
from being gobbled by the wicked witch, then, just on the verge of
getting cooked himself, douses the hag with magic powder _
transforming her into a very nubile female bunny.
</P>
<P>
   After cavorting a bit, the cartoon pair amble off arm-in-arm
into the sunset. Instead of just thanking his lucky rabbit's foot,
though, Bugs looks back over his shoulder with what might be fairly
described as a leer, saying, ``Ah sure, I know! But aren't they all
witches inside?''
</P>
<P>
   That was just too much for a female viewer in Toronto,
identified in news reports as Judith Hansel, who fired off a
missive to the Global Television broadcast company in July 1998
after being ``horrified'' by the hijinks on The Bugs Bunny and
Tweety Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Televising this anti-woman cartoon demands that you personally
offer a televised apology to woman viewers,'' she wrote, insisting
the apology be read at the start of the evening national newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Bell, Global's director for regulatory affairs,
responded with a letter saying the company was sorry the viewer was
offended, but denying the cartoon was demeaning to women.
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied, the angry watcher filed a formal complaint with the
Broadcast Standards Council, Canada's TV watchdog body, charging
that Bugs was not just a carrot-chomping wiseguy but a violator of
the industry's Sex Role Portrayal Code.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cartoon gives a wrong idea that all females are evil and
destructive... and that women are evil inside,'' her complaint
stated.
</P>
<P>
   It looked liked curtains. But wily old Bugs, as he has so many
times since making his cartoon debut in 1938, once again managed to
hippity-hop his way out of trouble _ barely.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal allowed that he's a hare-brained troublemaker, all
right, and way out of step with the times. But he hadn't broken
Canadian television content rules. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is undeniable innuendo in the closing line... which some
may find offensive,'' the six-member panel wrote in a
densely-worded report officially closing the case. ``That being
said, the Council is not of the view that a breach of the broadcast
Code it administers is entailed.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that again, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, bottom line: Bugs walks.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that the world's most recognizable
rabbit has roused ire. Several Bugs Bunny cartoons are no longer
aired because they rubbed people the wrong way with racial or
ethnic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian case apparently marks the first time Bugs has
faced formal charges of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been complaints about insensitive characterizations
in old cartoons such as this one, but I don't know of any other
serious attempt to silence Bugs Bunny,'' said Stephen Charla,
curator of the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Created by animator Chuck Jones, the smartmouthed rabbit
features the voice of Mel Blanc and, in addition to cartoons, has
appeared in comic books, motion pictures and newspaper strips.
</P>
<P>
   The panel that ruled on Bugs's fate consisted of two former TV
station managers, a lawyer, a self-styled ``feminist media
activist,'' a filmmaker and a television producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a fence-sitting decision,'' said Ron Cohen,
national chairman of the Broadcast Standards Council, telling the
Ottawa Citizen that Bug's remark ``wasn't a positive thing to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Global TV, meanwhile, is happy to see the long-eared star escape
the regulatory briar patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the tape, it's done so tongue-in-cheek, the way
it's presented could never be offensive to women,'' Bell told
Canadian reporters. ``We're happy with the decision. That's all,
folks.''

 &HT;    A tiny Scottish island that drew monks and Vikings alike became
a steppingstone for the spread
 &HT;    of Christianity
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLE OF IONA, Scotland _ If you're lucky enough to visit Iona _
site of abbeys for more than 1,400 years, often called the cradle
of Christianity for the northern British Isles _ don't wear your
church shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable footwear is not only acceptable for the informal,
nondenominational worship services thrice daily at the abbey
church, it's also a good idea for tramping across this ruggedly
lovely isle.
</P>
<P>
   Iona is only a mile wide and three miles long so you're always
in sight of the sea _ spouting against the outlying rocks, or
skerries. Almost always within earshot of bleating sheep. Always
aware that these religious buildings, faithfully reconstructed from
14th-century ruins, must have seemed to the monks like a way
station between Earth and heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Always reminded of the glory of nature and its designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians are one here,'' says Sister Filomena, a visiting
nun in her 80s from Glasgow, determinedly making her way with a
friend up the gently rising knoll from the jetty to the abbey.
``You don't think about denominations because we share the same
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the abbey church, which is run by the Iona Community
_ a worldwide network of clerics and laypersons working for social
justice, loosely associated with the Church of Scotland
(Presbyterian) _ sermons are delivered by ministers and laypersons
of all ethnic backgrounds. Recently they included a psychologist of
Greek Orthodox background, and a Canadian Methodist health care
worker who sermonized movingly about a paraplegic patient ``whose
spirit moves to the dance of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for wearing humble shoes is that they're bound to
get splashed with seawater when the ferry from the Isle of Mull _
the only public access to Iona _ crosses the one-mile channel,
lowers its squared-off bow onto the stone jetty and you walk
ashore, as if over a drawbridge. There's just a scattering of small
buildings on the island (population: about 150), so you're struck
first by the pristine white sands and mossy, boulder-studded moors,
the tiny yellow buttercups trembling in a steady breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but feel more worshipful here,'' says Morton
James, a Welsh businessman visiting for the day with his wife and
another couple.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that all of Iona is pious or frozen in the
past: One stone cottage has a jolly yellow Bart Simpson sticker in
the window. Hiking across to the wilder seaward side of the isle, I
saw the silhouette of a man, facing the Atlantic and the setting
sun, with nothing around him for hundreds of yards but a few sheep.
He placed something on the ground, then stood and gazed out to sea.
What in the world? I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he raised his arms, swung his body around, and a flash
of metal indicated the golf club in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   So I am still in Scotland after all, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   A 1,400-year mission
</P>
<P>
   And yet Iona is a place apart.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors have felt that way ever since St. Columba, the
missionary and poet, sailed here from Ireland in his coracle _ a
primitive wood-and-skins craft _ in A.D. 563. He called the island
a ``thin place,'' a term from Celtic Christianity meaning a spot
where the material and spiritual worlds brush within whispering
distance of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Columba founded the first abbey _ a few stones are still visible
near the current buildings _ and sent his monks to convert the
fierce pagan tribes of the region. The monks also created the famed
Book of Kells (the four Gospels in Latin, magnificently
illuminated) before shipping it back to Ireland for protection
against marauding Vikings. The original book is now at Trinity
College, Dublin, but a fine copy is displayed in the abbey church.
</P>
<P>
   There was no protection, though, for 68 monks. They were
slaughtered by Norsemen in the ninth century at a spot _ Martyr's
Beach, just a few steps from the jetty _ that now looks surreally
spotless and serene.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14th century a Benedictine abbey and church were built on
Columba's old site, with an Augustinian nunnery down the hill; with
the coming of the Reformation they too were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   When Samuel Johnson and James Boswell visited in 1773, the
island was crowded with half-starving farm families, and nunnery
ruins were being used to hold cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man is little to be envied,'' Johnson wrote, ``whose
piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.''
</P>
<P>
   'Two sides of same coin'
</P>
<P>
   The flame of Columba's vision guttered but would not die. The
church was lovingly reconstructed in the early 1900s by the
island's owner, the Duke of Argyll, and donated to the newly formed
Iona Cathedral Trustees, representing the Church of Scotland and
several Scottish universities.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1938, the Rev. George MacLeod, a Church of Scotland
pastor in a gritty industrial quarter of Glasgow, brought some
seminary students to begin the 30-year reconstruction of the entire
abbey as part of their training for inner-city ministry and social
service. He founded the Iona Community, a worldwide _ but mostly
Scottish and British _ network of 220 clerical and laypersons
working for social causes.
</P>
<P>
   Though its full membership may meet only three times a year,
including a mere weeklong confab on the island, MacLeod decreed
that Iona, as Columba's ``thin place,'' is their spiritual
headquarters. It's the ideal model of the world they strive to
build. In a chamber off the church sanctuary there are exhibits and
pamphlets to describe the community's campaigns against the arms
trade and for the protection of women, children, political
refugees, exploited workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The community members and their staff spend most of their days
on the island in prayer and study in the abbey and their adjoining
modern dormitories, so they have little contact with day visitors,
but they do accept up to 50 guests at a time for retreats in
Spartan bunk-bed style (two to five per room).
</P>
<P>
   ``We carry on the spirit of Columba, who pushed himself to the
literal edge of his world, where he felt closer to God,'' says the
Rev. Norman Shanks (Church of Scotland), leader of the Iona
Community. ``We see worship as the offering of one's whole life to
God, so social and spiritual concerns are two sides of the same
coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Plea for the homeless
</P>
<P>
   History and faith, too, are as gracefully intertwined as the
decorative swirls in the Book of Kells.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife, Cathy, and I stepped off the ferry one June
afternoon, we first toured the nunnery site, which is left in its
naturally ruined state but with beds of fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Next, beside the abbey church, we reached the Reilig Odhrain, or
Graveyard of Kings. Though no direct physical evidence has been
found, scholars believe that ancient graves of Irish, Scottish and
Norse kings are under the turf. As a theater critic, I felt a
special tingle over the legendary resting place of the real
Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, running my fingers along the carved vines and
leaves on the beloved St. Martin's Cross, oldest standing artifact
on the island, I had to wonder whether Shakespeare's luckless thane
did the same in the 11th century. At that point the 12-foot Celtic
cross, which stands in front of the church, was a mere 200 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum _ which like every building on the island is never
locked _ adjacent to the church we found 12th-century grave slabs
from the Reilig. Their effigies of uniformed soldiers (kings, some
scholars believe) look a bit eerie, like ancient spacemen with
their pointed hoods of mail and massive swords held against their
bellies.
</P>
<P>
   The church itself has an earthy rough-edged grandeur, with the
weather-scarred remnants of some 14th-century arches artfully
incorporated with the 20th-century reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The evening service, attended by about 50 people, consisted of
original poetry that incorporated lines of Scripture, and lovely
contemporary hymns, none of them familiar to a mainstream
Protestant service.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long period for silent prayer accompanied by
recorded music (a little too synthetically dreamy and New Age-y for
my taste, but barely troublesome). There was no sermon as such but
a stirring, poetic call to aid the homeless. We were all given
candles. It was lovely to see them all flickering just as the long
subarctic twilight settled in (around 10 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   An old blanket, cup and bowl had been placed in the broad middle
aisle, and as we stepped around these objects they took on a
haunting presence, as if a homeless person had just risen from this
mean ``bed.''
</P>
<P>
   As we walked back to our bed-and-breakfast about a half-mile
away, there was still a touch of a violet glow in the clear sky,
and we sent our thoughts of appreciation to Sister Filomena, who
had said earlier, ``It does rain here, so I'll pray you have sun.''
We heard the waves lapping at the skerries, heard the bleats of
sheep tossed to and fro across the fields in conversational
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Our window was open that cool night, and we couldn't ask for a
better evensong.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    CHRISTIANITY AT 2000: The Americanization of religion
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a Sunday morning in metro Atlanta, weekday traffic
is mercifully absent. Office buildings are shut down tight and
malls are closed. But there is plenty of life in area churches.
</P>
<P>
   Houses of worship have seen the town once called Terminus
through Civil War and civil rights, through booming growth and
urban decline. But the incredible diversity of almost 2,000
churches scattered across the region from Buford to Brooks is only
a tiny sampling of the even more diverse 250,000 Christian
congregations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All those congregations are essential to the warp and weft of
America's religious culture_from the simplest clapboard cabin where
unaccompanied voices rise in 100-year-old hymns to the most modern
mega-church with its orchestra and drama troupe, Christian
congregations are part of the warp and weft of America's history
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their churches are a network of clinics and hospitals,
schools and universities, soup kitchens and homeless shelters
operated in the name of Jesus, the Nazarene man born some 2,000
years ago whom Christians regard as the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Christianity on America is pervasive _ but so
is the influence of America on Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that it's a two-way
street,'' said Erskine Clarke, professor of American religious
history at Columbia Theological Seminary, an institution of the
Presbyterian Church (USA) in Decatur. ``On the one hand, it would
be very difficult to understand traditional American values and
institutions apart from western Christianity ... On the other hand,
Christianity in this country is, in many ways, distinctly North
American.''
</P>
<P>
   The American followers of Jesus have created powerful lobbying
groups in Washington and in statehouses across the country where
they are part of both the establishment and the anti-establishment
on issues from race relations to labor law to medical research.
Since colonial days, Christians and their churches have played
significant roles in the good, bad and ugly of American history _
they have preached slavery and abolition, segregation and
integration, war and peace, social reform and the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Christian voices have produced the literature, theater, art and
music of their country _ from Southern Catholic Flannery O'Connor's
stories to the singing style of rock 'n' roll's King, Elvis
Presley, whose hips swiveled with an exuberance grounded in gospel
music. Phrases from the Christian Scriptures, such as ``prodigal
son'' and ``good Samaritan,'' have gained common usage.
</P>
<P>
   Even the names of many of America's children _ Mary and Matthew
and Mark _ are from the Christian Gospels. And the best known of
modern-era American reformers _ the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. _
is the namesake of an early Christian reformer.
</P>
<P>
   It is an evolving story. As American culture has changed, so has
American Christianity. The oldest groups _ the Episcopalians and
Presbyterians, for instance _ have influence that exceeds their
numbers. Conservative Christians, under the label ``evangelical''
have set up in the last decades of the 20th century not only
powerful churches but a parallel culture. They have borrowed
elements from the American-born Pentecostal movement, an exuberant
Christianity that accepts such practices as speaking in unknown
tongues and which, from its beginnings a century ago, has become
the fastest-growing form of Christianity around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Worshippers entering a modern evangelical or Pentecostal church
hear tunes that could come from rock and country radio stations. At
home, they can watch sweaty preachers behind plexiglass pulpits
speaking to a television audience of millions. In their cars they
can opt for Christian music, Christian talk radio or even the daily
news from a conservative Christian point of view. They can read
Christian newspapers and Christian magazines, shop for Christian
greeting cards and gifts at Christian stores, and wear T-shirts and
baseball caps with Christian slogans to Christian concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Threads of Christianity
</P>
<P>
   North America's multifaceted brand of Christianity reflects the
diversity of its beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the so-called Founding Fathers sailed from Britain,
Spanish Catholic priests traveled into the Southwest and Florida to
convert Native Americans. Others, mostly French, brought
Catholicism down the Mississippi River out of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1492 when, as the child's poem goes, Columbus sailed
the ocean blue, he expressed hope in his first diary entry that he
would be able to contact native peoples to ``determine the manner
in which may be undertaken their conversion to our Holy Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic presence in America is easily seen in the names of
cities such as St. Augustine, Los Angeles and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   With the British Colonial movement, Anglicanism came to North
America, bringing the first wave of the Protestantism that was to
dominate American society. In this country's first English
settlement, Jamestown, the Book of Common Prayer was gospel. Within
a few years of the 1607 settlement, law compelled residents to
attend worship services and catechism classes, and imposed a death
penalty _ never really enforced _ for three unexcused absences.
There were also laws against gaming and intemperance.
</P>
<P>
   This stringent approach to Christianity showed shades of the
Puritanism that was soon to come to more northern colonies _
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire_as dissenters from
Anglicanism fled England. The Puritans, whose name came from their
desire to purify the church of England from such fancies as liturgy
and clerical robes, in turn exiled people who failed to live up to
their high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Rhode Island soon became a refuge for Baptists _ but was
still rooted in Puritanism.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans ``set the pace for the religious life of New England,''
wrote Catherine L. Albanese, author of ``America Religions and
Religion.'' They tried to shape government according to what they
saw as Biblical teaching, extending their belief in a
congregation-based structure to a suspicion of federalism in
government. Because of their belief in education, they established
schools, including Harvard and Yale universities.
</P>
<P>
   Puritans were not the only Christian souls seeking religious
freedom to come to North America. They were joined by the new wave
of Roman Catholics who founded Maryland, the French Protestant
Huguenots in the Carolinas, Quakers in Pennsylvania, and Protestant
sects from Germany, Holland and Sweden in the Middle Atlantic
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit riders carried Methodism to the farthest corners of the
new land, and the American Episcopal church separated from its
English home church soon after the colonies won their independence.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant segment of American society was the converged
membership of these groups _ ``a quite white, middle class,
mainstream Protestantism,'' said David Hackett, a associate
professor of religion at the University of Florida. ``The influence
has been tremendous and pervasive and long-lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett credits this generic Protestantism with giving Americans
a strong dose of individualism, which can be traced back to
Reformation doctrine that people are ultimately responsible for
their own relationship with God. He also sees it in the American
impulse to be thrifty and work hard, qualities that have led to a
strong emphasis on capitalism, economic development and
materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants helped lead the way in establishing laws that closed
businesses on Sunday and setting up entertainment standards that
today are regarded as prudish. Married couples on TV in the 1950s
and early '60s _ such as Rob and Laura Petrie on ``The Dick Van
Dyke Show'' _ had to sleep in twin beds; Lucille Ball and Ricky
Ricardo had to film the ``I Love Lucy'' episodes about the birth of
Little Ricky without once using the word ``pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were other voices _ especially the growing
Catholic church and the socially active black Protestant
denominations _ the one that ruled was ``the dominant voice of the
dominant class,'' Hackett said. ``They stamped the world in their
image.''
</P>
<P>
   A sort of ``secularized Christianity'' or ``residual
Protestantism'' is so much a part of American culture that people
do not even notice it or define it as such, Hackett said. ``It is
part of the air we breathe. We don't see it. It's the way we are.''

TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 22)

 By TOVAH MARTIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up with cactuses. Throughout my formative years, the
windowsills were lined with them, and I spent a disproportionate
amount of time with tweezers, removing spines from my fingers. In
her defense, my mother often suggested that I might want to admire
her menagerie of tactile malefactors from a distance. But it was no
use. I've always been compelled to reach out and touch things.
Which explains why I now find myself gravitating toward plants that
provide positive palpable encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the damage that working with the soil wreaks on your
fingernails, the hands-on side of gardening hasn't been given a lot
of play. And it could be argued that the industry is ignoring an
important selling tool.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the sensual aspects of lingerie and satin sheets are
frequent points of discussion for purveyors of that sort of thing,
texture isn't a common highlight for horticulturists. Catalogs
sometimes mention the palpable qualities of plants in passing, but
a gardener's fingers are not their primary focus. In a visually
driven world, it's little wonder that plant catalog descriptions
overlook the nap of a leaf, devoting descriptive space to blossom
hues or foliar patterns. You have to read between the lines if
you're looking for a feel-good sort of plant.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Latin binomials are wonderful for revealing virtues
as well as warning of pitfalls. Plants with names that include
tomentosum (Latin for ``densely covered with woolly hairs''),
hirtus (``clad in stiff bristly hairs''), hispida (``bristly'') and
glauca (``having leaves covered with a white film or coating'')
tend to promise good things for your fingers. On the other hand,
you might want to give plants with names that mention glutinosus
(``sticky leaves'') or acanthus (``thorny'') a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   Common names help, too. With something called teddy bear plant,
lamb's ears, pussy toes, chenille plant, eyelash begonia or
squirrel foot fern, intimate contact is likely to be a positive
experience. But sometimes common names send mixed messages. One
common name for Acalypha hispida, the chenille plant, encourages
children and adults alike to toy with its long, fluffy catkins. But
it's also known as the red-hot poker. As it turns out, the allusion
is not meant to be a warning. Instead, it describes the plant's
striking sizzling-pink streamers.
</P>
<P>
   Soft and fuzzy or felted leaves like the ones on foxgloves,
mullein and lamb's ears obviously invite fondling, but there are
other sensations available in the floral kingdom. In the furry
realm, leaves can feel like velvet (stachys), velveteen (peppermint
scented geranium), flannel (brugmansia) or corduroy (heliotrope).
Satiny foliage, like philodendron leaves, also fosters positive
finger play.
</P>
<P>
   And textures frequently change at different stages of
development. Young leaves are often softer and more cuddly than
their mature counterparts; buds are sometimes covered in a pleasant
down that disappears when the flower opens.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves offer tangible results most often, but flowers (magnolias
come to mind) occasionally gratify your sense of touch. The tufted
blossoms of grasses, for example, are a delight to run through your
fingers. Although easily damaged when fingered, rose petals are as
plush as Egyptian cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes plant handling should entail more than a single leaf.
Many ferns feel soft when you run your fingers up their fronds,
Boston ferns being particularly sensuous (the cultivar name Fluffy
Ruffles says it all). Almost any fiddlehead is Nirvana for
compulsive feelers. Mosses fulfill your fingers when you give them
a full body massage.
</P>
<P>
   As with anything, there can be caveats. Reaching out to plants
has brought its fair share of nasty surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The downy stems of nettles, for example, appear soft but have a
mean bite. Their hairs are actually minute, easily shattered vials
holding a dermatological irritant that isn't painful at first but
follows up with a burning sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most plants with a touch-me-not policy are more
flagrant about their artillery. Roses and bougainvilleas are fairly
obvious with their thorny defense systems. Many cactuses bristle
with nasty prongs, several citrus are similarly well armed with
thorns, and some raspberries also have noteworthy thorns easily
spied from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly characters are in the minority. For the most part, you
can touch a leaf without fear of reprisal or harm to the plant, as
long as you're gentle. And many herbs spew essential oils into the
air when their leaf surface is brushed, scenting the atmosphere
with perfume. No matter how often you touch their leaves, they
continue to emit their redolence.
</P>
<P>
   Because frequent touching does no harm and yet can be as
soothing as cuddling with a favorite blanket, many tactile plants
have become houseplants. There are several obvious advantages. You
don't have to crawl around on all fours to sample the sensual
qualities of lamb's ears when it's in a pot on the windowsill.
Although woolly plants come in all shapes and sizes, they're
frequently sun worshippers: in their native habitats, their downy
hairs have adapted to protect the leaf or stem surface from sun
damage. Indoors, they'll need a bright exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Touching plants is not just for children, fidgety adults and
those in need of therapy. It's another way to link with nature. You
can learn a lot about a plant by feeling its leaves and flowers.
There are secrets that are revealed only to your fingers. In a
world where most things are kept at arm's length, it's a nice
touch.  &QL;

 &HT;    Classical, modern meet on Main Street
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The epicenter of dance at the start of the 20th century was
Paris. But just after World War I, ballet took a grand jete across
the Atlantic to New York, which has been the dance capital of the
world ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance was born when Isadora Duncan of Oakland, Calif.,
decided it was a lot easier to move if she took off her corsets and
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And the all-American battle for supremacy between the fine arts
and popular culture was fought as vigorously on the dance front as
on any other _ perhaps more so. No Eudora Welty ever sighed to be
Danielle Steel, but Mikhail Baryshnikov acknowledges his admiration
for Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important influence on 20th-century dance is
the great emigration that followed the Russian Revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development of ballet in this century,'' says Janice Ross,
a dance historian who teaches at Stanford University, ``comes from
where the Russians went and who they taught.'' Not only did the
revolution scatter dance talent across the United States, but it
also persuaded a young choreographer, George Balanchine, to accept
a job in America, where he totally changed the look, the technique
and the expressive potential of classical ballet.
</P>
<P>
   A clean slate
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing phenomenon, the migration of dance to the New
World, which until then had had almost no formalized tradition of
expressive movement. Duncan, Loie Fuller and Maud Allan, the
founding mothers of modern dance, were all American, but they found
Europe a more open environment for their free-form dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the 20th century, when American dance began,
there were no schools, no academies, no companies, no tradition
handed down through a royal line. Up to that time, classical
dancing had been imported from Europe,'' says dance critic Marcia
B. Siegel in ``The Shapes of Change,'' a thematic history of
American dance. Not until 1933 did the United States have so much
as a single professional ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this to the art form often stigmatized as the most
European (or, more accurately, least American): opera. Despite its
elitist reputation, opera had been presented in this country since
the early 19th century. The Metropolitan Opera in New York was
founded in 1883 _ a long couple of generations before any
comparable venture in dance.
</P>
<P>
   All through the 19th century, though dance satellites flourished
in Copenhagen, Denmark, and St. Petersburg, Russia, Paris was still
regarded as the capital of the art. So when the impresario Serge
Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes set out to conquer the world, it
was to Paris that they came to make a statement. It was quite a
statement, too: ``The Rite of Spring'' caused a riot at its Paris
premiere in 1913. Its self-conscious primitivism, its oversize cave
drawings in raw colors, its non-balletic choreography by Vaslav
Nijinsky and above all the neo-brutalism of Igor Stravinsky's score
set a new base line for artistic adventurism. The rest of the
cultural world saw it and knew there was no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Europe was engulfed in a new kind of war:
impersonal, mechanized, omnivorous. In its wake, the years between
the world wars were an age of disillusion, of crude cabaret satire
and social anomie, of abraded emotion masked by flippancy or
distorted by exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States the destination of choice for European
intellectuals and artists, this country grew up in a hurry _
especially in dance, where the flood of emigre Russians after the
1917 revolution had an enormous influence. Russian troupes
overwhelmed the limited market for touring dance, with the result
that many of those highly trained dancers gave up the life of
artistic gypsies to set down roots in their adopted country.
Because of them, an artistic evolution that might have taken
centuries was compressed into a couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians also held back the development of indigenous
ballet wherever they went. Dancers from Alicia Markova (born Alice
Marks) to Vera Zorina (born Eve Brigitte Hartwig) Russified their
names to get a toehold in a profession dominated by exiled
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, of course, was Balanchine, a choreographer
for Diaghilev. His early work showed talent; no one could have
known, even after ``Apollo,'' that he was a genius. But Lincoln
Kirstein, a wealthy New York aesthete, took a chance that the
29-year-old Russian was the force needed to invent an American
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   When they met to discuss starting a ballet company, Balanchine
famously responded: ``But first, a school!'' For the initial group
of ballerinas-in-training, he created a masterpiece called
``Serenade'' (1934), the first plotless ballet. Built entirely of
classroom steps, ``Serenade'' displays all the traits of mature
Balanchine: It is fleet, complex, emotionally charged, musically
astute. It demands flawless pointe technique as well as stamina,
but any dancer will tell you it is a joy to perform. It gives back
in artistic satisfaction as much as it demands in artistic sweat
and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine went on to create a large body of work for New York
City Ballet, the company that evolved out of his school. It ranges
from abstract ``practice clothes'' ballets (``Agon'' and ``The Four
Temperaments'') to full-length story-ballets (``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' and ``Don Quixote''), from virtuoso spotlight dances in
classic mode (``Tarantella'') to full-corps showcases (``Symphony
in C'' and ``Jewels'').
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he continued the time-honored practice of building
repertory around important dancers, from Maria Tallchief to Edward
Villella. A generous colleague, he reached out to other talented
choreographers, notably Jerome Robbins, whom he made associate
artistic director in 1949, but also including such unlikely
dance-makers as Merce Cunningham. And his eclectic taste and
unconditional love for all things danceable allowed him to
incorporate such wide-ranging ingredients as Hollywood westerns and
Busby Berkeley musicals (``Western Symphony''); close-order drill
(``Stars and Stripes''); and Japanese ritual drama (``Bugaku''). He
believed ballet should not be insulated from the world beyond the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the ranks of New York City Ballet came the next
generation of American dance: Patricia Wilde founded Pittsburgh
Ballet Theater; Kent Stowell and Francia Russell, Pacific Northwest
Ballet (Seattle); Lew Christensen and later Helgi Tomasson, San
Francisco Ballet; Villella, Miami City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The curse of Isadora
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern dance'' has long been construed as the enemy of
classical ballet. Duncan started this by announcing, before her
1905 tour of Russia, that she intended to ``show that classical
ballet was all wrong.'' But in fact the founding mothers of
American dance reacted not so much to the rigidity of ballet as to
the restrictive society that ``protected'' (i.e., subordinated)
American women. Throwing off gentility along with their hobble
skirts, they helped the growing movement for women's rights by
raising questions about women's physical and expressive potential.
</P>
<P>
   The dance they created is not so much an opponent of ballet as
an alternative to it. Once ballet and modern dance began to pay
attention to one another, around 1950, the cross-fertilization was
immediate, productive and mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there was little artistic discipline to modern dance.
Duncan's disciples, Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, founded the first
``school'' in Los Angeles in 1915, offering a grab bag of yoga,
faux-ballet, what they called ``ethnic dance'' and rhythmic
exercises. They trained many of the most committed figures of
modern expressive movement, including Martha Graham and Doris
Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   When these women founded schools and companies in the '30s,
``modern dance'' still connoted a deliberate lack of technique.
Perhaps their most important achievement was to prove the new dance
an articulate vehicle for the body and an expressive spokesman for
the heart and mind. And they imbued their pieces almost from the
start with an American flavor. Graham's ``Sketches From the
People'' (1929) celebrated the spirit of labor; ``El Penitente''
(1940), Mexican religious rituals; Humphrey's ``The Shakers''
(1930) and Graham's ``Appalachian Spring'' (1944), the grass roots
of the American spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'40s, Graham embarked on her most ambitious work: the
long series of dances, most inspired by classical mythology and
Freudian dream-theory, from ``Cave of the Heart'' (Medea) (1946)
and ``Errand Into the Maze'' (Ariadne) (1947) to ``Clytemnestra''
(1958) and ``Phaedra'' (1962). Partly these were a feminist
response to Western culture; partly they displayed the endless
possibilities of renewal in these seminal stories; partly they
offered meaty roles in which Graham could express her considerable
dance personality.
</P>
<P>
   But their larger purpose was to demonstrate that modern dance
had reached artistic maturity. These dances _ unhampered by courtly
traditions, the formalized aesthetics of classical ballet or
well-worn musical ``messages'' _ had the strength of intellect to
sustain great ideas and great characters. Though the choreographers
of Judson Church in the '60s and the Grand Union in the '70s
created their art out of vernacular movement (walking, lying down,
contact improvisation) and claimed that their dances told no
stories and delivered no messages, they were clearly children of
Graham. The anti-establishment flavor of their work, so closely
allied to the civil rights movement of the '60s and the anti-war
protests of the '70s, has roots in Graham's leftist sympathies and
serious artistic statements.
</P>
<P>
   In an influential essay called ``The Curse of Isadora,'' Lincoln
Kirstein, Balanchine's bankroller and the invisible monarch of
American ballet, argued that modern dance was so rootless and
ungrounded that it had no staying power, and that so free-form a
movement could not possibly deal with anything more meaningful than
music and drapery. He underrated both the technical and expressive
power of this dance.

 &HT;    Thomas' great-grandson tries to fill in history's gaps
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Colin Monteith is 72 years old, but his face is
virtually unlined, his cheeks are as ruddy as a boy's, and his eyes
sparkle when he lays the huge scrapbook on the table.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at his family pictures and then squint your eyes a
little and look at his face again, it's easy enough to see his
great-grandfather: Deputy U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Monteith, an engineer who lives in Lilburn, Ga., hasn't always
known about his great-grandfather. His grandmother was born Mary Jo
Thomas, the fourth of the four children the manhunter had with his
first wife, Isabelle Gray. She was born in Texas, before the family
moved to Fort Smith, Ark., and Heck became a deputy marshal.
</P>
<P>
   After the fifth child was born, Isabelle took the children and
returned to Georgia. She was unable to stand the Indian Territory's
absence of refinement and culture, and its terrifying lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Monteith says, wasn't that Heck Thomas remarried,
``but there was no record of any divorce. My grandma never forgave
him that. She thought he was a bigamist.''
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers, Monteith says, have told him there was a
general custom at the time that considered a couple divorced if
they had lived apart, by choice, for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he says, ``Grandma never spoke of him, and she and
I got along wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteith's father met Heck Thomas when he ``was 8 or 10 years
old,'' when the lawman visited the family in Columbia, S.C., in
1910. ``He remembered him, but nothing in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Monteith's grandmother died, and he and his
father began rummaging in one of her trunks, that they discovered
photographs, newspaper clippings and even some frayed old letters
that Thomas had written to his children.
</P>
<P>
   Monteith says he is the oldest of numerous great-grandchildren
of the marshal. One granddaughter, Martha Lever, is still living in
Lexington, S.C. Few of the descendants, Monteith says, know much
about their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He and his father have both provided considerable assistance to
the authors of three books about Thomas. The marshal left all his
papers to his daughter by his second wife, and they are now housed
at the University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I plan to visit that part of the country next
year,'' Monteith says. ``I want to go by his home in Lawton, which
is still standing.'' Jack Warner writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.

   ATLANTA: way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fostering renewal
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it may be the absence of state sanction for any one
form of Christianity that has contributed to its pervasiveness and
endurance as an American cultural force.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation's earliest days, its founders realized they had
diverse ideas about church and government, practice and doctrine.
If they were to form a more perfect union, they knew there could be
no established church.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when the Bill of Rights was written for the new
Constitution, it expressly forbade government enforcement of any
religious belief. But it also clearly guaranteed the right to
follow one's faith without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a free market and an aggressive effort among some
quarters to proselytize, adding to the numbers and the coffers of
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a church couldn't get a congregation to support it, it
simply withered on the vine,'' said Edwin Gaustadt, author of
``Religious History of America,'' and professor emeritus of
religion at the University of California, Riverside. ``Many people
thought that was a mistake. In the long view of history, it has
worked much better for the United States than the system in
European nations where churches continued to have state support.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of security gave American Christianity a need for
renewal and revival. Great revival movements have spawned new
fervor and some new forms of Christianity, including modern-day
Pentecostalism.
</P>
<P>
   Older denominations have split and merged, taking on new names
and modifying their doctrine, powerful African-American
denominations developed, and some new religions evolved, such as
the Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses and Latter-day Saints
_ all made possible by the free enterprise system of religion in
America. And waves of new immigrants have made Catholics the single
largest Christian group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Influence changing
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy visit to America, Frenchman Alexis de
Tocqueville wrote in 1835, ``There is no country in the world where
the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls
of men than in America.'' Many would question whether that holds
true at the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On paper a far larger percentage of Americans are church members
than in the earliest days, when barely one in 10 Americans were
likely to belong to congregations. The main reason for that is not
an increase in religious commitment but a slackening of membership
standards, said Bruce Holifield, professor of American church
history at Emory's Candler School of Theology. Around the time of
the Revolutionary War, church membership involved lengthy training
and questioning, and a willingness to subject oneself to the
discipline of the congregation, he said. Many more people attended
church than joined.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll conducted in May 1999 showed that 71 percent of
those questioned _ who were overwhelmingly Christian _ claimed to
be a member of a church or synagogue, and 44 percent said they
attend almost every week. Studies of actual people in the pews put
that figure lower.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of this country's historically dominant faith has
been diluted in the modern age by differences within Christianity
and increasing numbers of non-Christian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that about 20 percent of Americans are diligently
practicing Christians from the 17th century to the present,'' said
Holifield, but they are more diverse in their beliefs and practices
than their ancestors. He predicts that no single religious group in
the future will be able to wield the kind of power the Protestants
did for the nation's first 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The May Gallup poll shows that many Americans agree. Sixty-two
percent of those questioned said religion as a whole is losing its
influence on American life, compared to 32 percent who felt it was
increasing. At no time since 1957 has a Gallup poll shown that a
majority of Americans believed religion is gaining in influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1999, we are unmistakably and undeniably a pluralistic
nation,'' Gaustadt said. ``We've been one for a long time, but
people could ignore the evidence. I don't think it's possible to
ignore any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians continue to influence American culture ``from the
grass roots up _ that is from the local communities and from human
hearts,'' he said. On Sunday morning in downtown Atlanta, that's
the way the Christianity of diversity is practiced:
</P>
<P>
   At Central Presbyterian Church across from the state capitol,
tables are set with white tablecloths and red napkins for the
congregation's traditional old-fashioned Sunday dinner. Next door,
at the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, a priest will offer
food of a different kind as he prepares the Eucharist. And, around
the corner at Trinity United Methodist, adults are gathered in
Sunday School to share their stories with their new minister, the
Rev. Cornelius Minor.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away on Auburn Avenue, a sign in front of Big
Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church apologizes for
construction: ``Please Pardon Our Progress.'' At historic Wheat
Street Baptist Church, young Jasmine Garrett is being baptized into
the fold. ``My dear sister,'' the Rev. Michael Harris calls her as
he pushes her under water in the name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost. Across Auburn Avenue in the new sunlight-filled Ebenezer
Baptist Church, Atlanta's church of Kings, the Rev. Mary Finley is
praising God, proclaiming, ``Church, this is the day that the Lord
has made. We should rejoice and be glad in it!''

 &HT;    Sam Elliott has no quarrel with career built on westerns
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I see you have camp all set up.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Sam Elliott can step into a Ritz-Carlton in Marina Del Rey,
walk up to a linen-covered table set with silverware and white
china, and declare the scene a campsite.
</P>
<P>
   We recognize his gravelly twang right away; we've heard it utter
``I reckon'' onscreen more times than we reckon we can count.
</P>
<P>
   We recognize most everything else, too: The hair looks not so
much like the color silver as the metal itself; it practically
glows against the black eyebrows that have pitched camp, so to
speak, right below it.
</P>
<P>
   A few silver hairs also peek from Elliott's V-neck black jersey,
which he wears over black pants and black boots. That's what he put
on before he drove here from his Malibu home, where Elliott lives
with his wife, the retired screen actress and heartthrob Katharine
Ross (``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``The Graduate'') and
their teenage daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the morning glare that bounces off the nearby water
and through the Ritz restaurant windows, Elliott looks a little ...
weird, frankly _ a little un-Elliott _ and right away it's obvious
why: the mustache is missing, the brushy logo that seems as much a
part of Elliott as those drawled ``I reckons.'' He shaved it off
for a movie he's about to shoot, a non-western.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reactions from friends, and people I don't even know, is,
`How can you shave off your trademark?''' he says when we mention
the bare lip, like, first thing. ``They take it serious _ it's more
than hair to some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott pauses to watch a waiter pour him coffee. Then, just
before he takes his first sip of the morning, he grins and says
drolly, ``It's only hair in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Elliott, at 55, just might be our last western hero, a
largely small-screen Gary Cooper who's identified with filmed
westerns even as the genre seems perpetually on the brink of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   He's acted for more than 30 years, in features as various as
``Mask'' (with Cher), ``Lifeguard'' (Kathleen Quinlan, Anne Archer)
and the Coen brothers' ``The Big Lebowski.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is westerns that he's most identified with. Among them
are the features ``Tombstone'' (with Kurt Russell) and ``Hi-Lo
Country'' (Woody Harrelson and Patricia Arquette), as well as five
TNT originals, including ``Conagher.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's latest, ``You Know My Name,'' in which he plays
real-life western lawman Bill Tilghman at the end of his career,
premieres at 8 tonight on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings the western to a western _ authenticity on every
level,'' John Kent Harrison, writer and director of ``You Know My
Name,'' explains of Elliott's appeal. ``The western is his home.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison adds that Elliott owns ``a subtle tone of melancholy; a
western hero carries his past.'' Producer Joel Silver once told
him: ``You got a lot of great baggage you carry with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men like him and women love him,'' sums up Eric O'Keefe,
editor at large of Cowboys &AMP; Indians, which features Elliott on its
September cover in a pose so cowpoke come-hither you might expect a
centerfold inside (there isn't one).
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys &AMP; Indians, a slick magazine devoted to western chic,
chose Elliott for its cover after a reader poll selected him in a
landslide as the celebrity they most wanted to read about.
</P>
<P>
   The western's appeal to Elliott is real basic:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing 'em _ I like being outside, going on locations,
being on a horse. I like the dialogue: clear-cut lines between good
and evil, not the psychological gray (stuff) you hear in most
movies. I like the upstanding moral characters that stand for
things _ there's not much of that in film today, or in anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the guy when nobody was doing it, and fortunately so,''
he adds. ``It's helped me get into this box a little bit, but so
what? I'm lucky to have a 31-year career no matter what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``box'' Elliott refers to is his western stereotype, a
circumstance that has at once kept him in work and kept him from
working. He might love making westerns, but he likes making other
kinds of movies, too, and sometimes westerns get in the way. He
didn't do a thing for a year after ``You Know My Name'' finished
filming. And while he's flattered by the magazine cover (``I really
like that western audience''), he doesn't expect it to raise his
profile in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I put it on the right desk in town _ maybe,'' he
says. ``But by and large, it's not going to do anything in terms of
translating into work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott wasn't raised to be a cowboy. His family's roots are in
Texas and New Mexico, but Elliott was born in Sacramento, Calif.
His father was a fish and wildlife worker, ``a true El Paso
redneck,'' and while Elliott grew up loving the outdoors, he calls
himself ``one of those `Pleasantville' kids. I grew up on TV.'' He
spent Saturdays at matinees, dreaming as early as 9 or 10 of being
a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's what I want to do,''' he recalls. ``I want to
be part of this exchange I see between the actor and the audience
up there on the screen, but I want to be on the other side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father wanted Elliott to attend college and major in
business. Elliott wasn't much of a student, but he wound up at the
University of Oregon, where he ran track. When his dad died his
senior year, in 1966, Elliott dropped out and moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He learned acting basics at a studio workshop, then signed a
six-year deal with 20th Century Fox, where he did a lot of bad TV
shows and small parts in major films such as ``Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid'' (his poker playing role was small enough that he
didn't really get to know Ross).
</P>
<P>
   But the decades-old studio system that Elliott signed on with
collapsed two years later. One agent suggested the out-of-work
Elliott return to Oregon; another told him to get rid of ``this
gawd-awful accent _ the accent that has carried me through my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what he thought was a break turned into a disaster.
Starring in the 1976 film ``Lifeguard,'' playing a kind of
precursor to David Hasselhoff in ``Baywatch,'' Elliott talked to
the press and slammed, with westernlike directness, those involved
in what he thought was the movie's mis-marketing. He didn't do a
movie for a long time afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if your opinion happens to be right dead on, you have to
be careful who you say that (stuff) to,'' he says. ``I did a great
disservice to myself _ I haven't worked at Paramount since.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's feature film drought ended in 1985, with ``Mask,''
directed by Peter Bogdanovich, in which he played Cher's
motorcycle-riding boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter said he was looking for a Gary Cooper on a
Harley-Davidson,'' Elliott recalls.
</P>
<P>
   His career since then has been that of an actor-on-the-verge:
recognizable, charismatic _ like Tom Skerritt, you're always real
glad to see him _ but not quite a bankable star. He's had a long
relationship with TNT, for whom he and Ross wrote,
executive-produced and starred in ``Conagher,'' which he calls a
career highlight.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott has this sense that something .. . something is
about to happen to him; he can't put his finger on it. He's been
cast in a political satire set in Washington called ``The
Contender,'' which just started filming in Virginia (``(The
director) said, `Will you shave your mustache and cut your hair?'
and I said, `Now.''').
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Rod Lurie calls Elliott ``one of the best actors
in the business,'' but has said he's only been allowed to ``flex
his western muscles'' and that people will be ``amazed'' by what
they see in this film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major change of pace for me, in how I'm perceived in
the business and by people in general,'' Elliott says.
</P>
<P>
   We've sat with Elliott for more than an hour now. And while you
couldn't ask for a better dude to drink coffee with, something
about him _ that ``subtle tone of melancholy''? _ moves us to
blurt: ``Are you happy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy?''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's startled by the question for about one second. Then he
answers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he says, ``I think I am. I get a lot of joy out of
what I do _ even for someone as cynical as me about the business,
I'm not so cynical that I still don't love the business.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got his wife, his daughter (``that, in a nutshell, is
really what life is about''), the three acres they garden together,
the mail from people who tell him the joy he's brought to their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy the leading-man thing has eluded me,'' he adds,
then grins and shakes his head, as if realizing how unwestern _ how
un-him _ that just sounded.
</P>
<P>
   So in his trademark drawl, without his trademark mustache, he
puts in, ``That almost borders on greediness.''

   THE SAM ELLIOTT FILE
</P>
<P>
   Age: 55
</P>
<P>
   Raised: Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Family: Wife of 15 years, actress Katharine Ross (they met
briefly on the ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' set but
became involved after filming 1979 horror movie ``The Legacy''),
and daughter Cleo Rose, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Movie sampler: ``Hi-Lo Country'' (1999), ``The Big Lebowski''
(1998), ``Tombstone'' (1993), ``Gettysburg'' (1993), ``Conagher''
(1991), ``Mask'' (1985), ``The Sacketts'' (1979), ``Lifeguard''
(1976), ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (1969).
</P>
<P>
   Quotes: ``There are a certain amount of (westerns) made by
people who know nothing about the genre. They figure if they throw
as much money as possible at it, it'll be good. `Wild Wild West' is
a prime example.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been good at intellectualizing the acting process.
I heard a quote of Spencer Tracy's too many times: `Just hit your
(bleeping) marks.' Whether you're a laborer or an actor, you have
to do three things: Show up on time, be a decent guy and bring your
tools. I'm closer to myself when I'm acting than I am to me
portraying some character _ nobody's going to call me a
chameleon.''

 &HT;    Art of dance hobbled by fiscal constraints
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not all that long ago, dance was an art passed down
from mother to daughter via stories, stick-figure drawings and
vague memories of ``tradition'' and ``custom.''
</P>
<P>
   Then video cameras became easy to use and affordable, and the
art form with the least staying power became one of the simplest to
preserve. Nowadays, it's typical for a choreographer to load the
VCR and leave the company to learn the basic steps from a tape for
a couple of hours. Then the choreographer returns to polish the
piece, saving rehearsal time and expense.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has changed dance, too. Rudolf von Laban's
meticulous and laborious stenographic process for recording
choreography, Labanotation, which once took years to learn, now
exists on software. Information on the computer graphic program
LabanWriter can be obtained from Ohio State University's Dance
Department Web site, www.dancenotation.org
</P>
<P>
   /LabanLinks.html.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater art of dance itself is limping into the 21st
century. According to John Munger, who analyzes industry data for
Dance/USA, the struggle to provide a living wage for dancers is no
nearer its goal. Ballet companies that once prided themselves on
40-week contracts have cut back to 34-week contracts, on average,
leaving their dancers to survive on unemployment the rest of the
year. These include such giants as New York City Ballet and
American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the field of dance,'' says Munger, ``it's so
difficult (to raise money) that no one has succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   All the arts are labor-intensive, but dance is more so than
most. A playwright can write in isolation; for a choreographer it's
easier to create steps with dancers. An orchestra rehearses 10
hours a week for each concert program; ballet dancers spend nine
hours
</P>
<P>
   a day, six days a week, keeping their bodies tuned in class and
rehearsal. And the time it takes to learn and practice choreography
is long and costly, involving as it does for most choreographers
the years spent being a dancer first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the voices of the future being developed?'' asks
John McFall, artistic director of Atlanta Ballet. ``Mentoring (a
young choreographer) is a process, like cultivating a garden. It's
a huge investment. It demands continuity, and I really don't think
we're doing a very good job of it.''

   UNDATED: power of this dance.
</P>
<P>
   But modern dance bears the curse of Isadora in a way that
Kirstein never considered: continuity. From its earliest days, it
has grown not by evolution but by cell division. When young
choreographers outgrew their mentors, they started new companies.
The field has become so fragmented that both funding sources and
audiences are confused, and the casualty rate of modern dance
troupes is unusually high. In our time, the modern dance community
has backslid to the economic condition of the '30s. The field is
overpopulated, yet only a museum troupe such as Graham's draws much
of a mainstream audience. While ballet companies struggle toward
year-round employment, health benefits and pensions for dancers, a
living wage for modern dancers is still an elusive goal, according
to the national service agency Dance/USA.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kirstein's ``curse'' has been a blessing for ballet. From
Agnes de Mille, who choreographed the immortal ``Rodeo'' (1942) to
Twyla Tharp, who made a repertory for American Ballet Theater in
the late '80s, ballet has appropriated modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine (who seems not to have listened to Kirstein) asked
Merce Cunningham for a piece for New York City Ballet and got a
masterpiece, ``Summerspace'' (1966). Mark Morris has made wonderful
ballets for ABT and San Francisco Ballet, as well as a portrait
gallery of dances for Mikhail Baryshnikov and his White Oak Dance
Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at someone like Glen Tetley,'' says Atlanta Ballet's John
McFall. ``He partnered Martha Graham. Then he'd sneak across the
street and take ballet classes at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet.''
Tetley's modern-inspired ballets are in the repertory of many
companies. ``I credit him with taking ideas that at one time were
segmented, that could not be crossed, and bringing them together,''
says McFall, whose ballets similarly draw on multiple sources.
</P>
<P>
   At the most fundamental level, modern dance has made modern
ballet possible. The prime illusion of classical ballet is the
denial of gravity. The modern dancer's commitment to the floor _ as
support, as roots, as the locus of regenerative energy _ was as
opposite to ballet's ethereality as it could be. Yet the greater
strength and technique of today's ballet dancers, the brilliance
and speed demanded by contemporary choreography, would not be
possible without the intelligent exploitation of gravity. The
overall ease and freedom of the body in modern dance have been
greedily co-opted by ballet choreographers eager to express more
than what ballet steps will allow.
</P>
<P>
   Culture wars
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Yankee Doodle,'' Americans have been stereotyped as
a nation of hicks. We contribute to the caricature by drawing
elaborate distinctions between high and low art, professing to be
intimidated by the one and comfy with the other.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the line of demarcation is no line at all, but a
porous zone. And therein lies one of the paradoxes of 20th-century
dance. Fred Astaire's glittering technique may have been equal to _
in fact, it was better than _ that of Nijinsky. But Astaire is
known as an entertainer, Nijinsky an artist. Nowadays, an eminent
dance critic such as Arlene Croce (``The Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers Book'') can take theatrical dance as seriously as classical
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 20th century's major themes has been the breakdown of
the artificial barrier between high art and popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Why it should have taken so long is a mystery, because classical
ballet from the start grabbed ideas from everywhere. Sir Frederick
Ashton, the Royal Ballet's master choreographer, danced as a
youngster on the English music hall stage, and its rambunctious,
frequently off-color humor and pratfalls can be discerned even in
his refined story-ballets. Balanchine and Robbins choreographed for
Broadway and Hollywood, and you can see elements of Apache dance,
the wild jazz style of the '20s, in Balanchine's ``Slaughter on
10th Avenue'' and Robbins' ``Fancy Free,'' about three sailors at
liberty. By the time he got to ``West Side Story,'' Robbins turned
street smarts, a sock hop, a gang rape and a rumble into urban
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they folded popular dance into their classical
work. Twentieth-century ballet devoured social dance and its
sensuous subtext in works from Nijinsky's ``La Spectre de la Rose''
(1911) to Robbins' ``Dances at a Gathering'' (1969). The capstone
may be Twyla Tharp's ``Nine Sinatra Songs'' (1983) enhanced with
designer gowns by Donna Karan and other haute couturiers.
</P>
<P>
   But all the while, modern dance choreographers from Graham
(``Appalachian Spring'') to Tharp (``Deuce Coupe,'' with its Beach
Boys score and California casualness) have plundered American folk
and pop culture for ideas. Dance anthropologist Katherine Dunham
began to investigate the Caribbean roots of African-American dance
in the '40s; and by the time Alvin Ailey started his company in
1958, the early civil rights movement promoted African-American
folk material _ spirituals in ``Revelations,'' work songs in
``Rainbow Round My Shoulder'' _ as a primal element of American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   World dance was slower to make its case, possibly because of the
emphasis on assimilation in our melting pot culture. The typical
American immigrant's working class origins also left its mark:
``The artists of the United States had usually regarded their folk
tradition as hopelessly inferior to the grand heritage of Europe,''
says Jamake Highwater, a dance historian of American Indian stock
and author of ``Dance: Rituals of Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the so-called ``inferiority'' of folk culture has not
been exclusively American. Though today there are folk-dance
festivals everywhere, for many years there was little of
professional calibre other than Amalia Hernandez's Ballet
Folclorico de Mexico and Igor Moiseyev's Russian folk company.
Around 1980, after ``multiculturalism'' became a buzzword, a noisy
and colorful flock of world dance troupes hatched virtually
overnight. Not long ago, an American asked about folk dance might
have offered the ``Mexican Hat Dance'' as an example; today, an
ethnic dance roster might offer anything from Turkish dervishes to
Indonesian bedhaya.
</P>
<P>
   The American century
</P>
<P>
   Though America has led the way, the rest of the world has not
been idle, particularly with dance that addresses hard questions.
With rare exceptions (Anna Sokolow's post-Holocaust ``Kaddish''),
American choreographers have preserved a fundamental American
optimism, shrugging off the great political and social questions of
the century. It has fallen to others to recover the ``moral
compass,'' as dance critic Marcia Siegel calls it, that animated
Graham's early work.
</P>
<P>
   The German expressionist choreographers, from Mary Wigman in the
'30s to Pina Bausch in the '80s, plumbed the dark subconscious of
an impersonal, industrialized world. The Japanese movement called
ankoku butoh (dance
</P>
<P>
   of darkness) has been almost alone in confronting the
aftereffects of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   But by the midcentury, dance looked to the New World for an
infusion of creativity, as well as dance techniques that seemed to
spring right out of America's soil and sidewalks. Balanchine
technique required dancers of sleek muscularity: the kind that grow
naturally in an abundance of open space, fresh air and plenteous
food. The eagerness to fill the whole stage with movement is an
American trait. And where other countries pride themselves on their
homogeneity, American dance delights in diversity.
</P>
<P>
   It took the United States less than two centuries to grow from a
baker's dozen of struggling former Colonies to a world power. In
the arts, it has been a superpower despite a history of
anti-intellectualism and a cultural bias toward willful ignorance.
Nowhere has the American century _ its assurance, its defiance, its
egotism and its deepest democratic urges _ been more evident than
in dance.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Meetings have taken place at the highest levels,
including several with Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Memos have been
drafted, rejected, amended. Threats have been leaked to the press.
And despite assurances that a deal is imminent, tensions remain
high six weeks after the formation of the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not peace with the Arabs. It is what to do with
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, architect of the Oslo
framework for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and
Israel's longest-serving and best-known statesman, is the new
minister of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But his is a title in search of authority for a ministry that so
far has no budget, no staff and no agreed functions.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders it may seem extraordinary that after his party
triumphantly returned to power, the Israeli leader most associated
with Middle East peace should find himself in a position that
friends and foes call humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Equally surprising may be why Peres, who spent the last three
years building an Institute for Peace that bears his name and who
is hailed across much of the globe by leaders and adoring audiences
as a visionary and hero, would submit himself to such indignities.
</P>
<P>
   But to those who know Barak, a security-focused former general
who never liked the Oslo accords and trusts almost no one, and
Peres, a 76-year-old man with boundless energy and limited years,
the situation is hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Barak to have Peres at a Cabinet meeting is like doing
your homework with your father looking over your shoulder,'' said
Akiva Eldar, a political columnist for the newspaper Haaretz,
referring to the 20-year age difference between the men. ``There is
this quality to him which says, `I've been there and I would have
done it better.' But Barak feels he can't afford to have him
causing trouble on the outside either.''
</P>
<P>
   For Peres, the new government is probably his last opportunity
to build what he has called ``the new Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is 76 and he feels he has three to four years to produce
the dream of his life,'' observed Mira Avrech, a longtime friend of
Peres. ``If he gets the authority he needs, he feels he can make it
happen. If he doesn't, he will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Shahal, a lawyer, close friend of Peres and former
government minister said: ``Barak will never agree to being
upstaged. Peres is paying a toll by being humiliated, but if he can
contribute to the country in this way he will put up with the
sacrifice. The peace process needs continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Peres says his aim was neither power nor prestige. In a
telephone interview, he said that at their last meeting, on
Thursday, he tried to explain to Barak that he wanted to revive
international donor conferences for the Palestinians, regional
economic meetings and Israeli-Arab projects, all of which fell away
in the three years when Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Barak I am not trying to run the country,'' Peres said.
``I am not trying to grab the power of the foreign minister. My aim
is to build things outside the country. With my experience and
connections and imagination, I want to try to do about 10 or 15
different things. The process needs someone who represents the
point of view of peace. I want to represent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are due to meet again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The threat that Peres might turn his back on Barak _ damaging
the prime minister's reputation among the Arabs and the West as a
potential peacemaker _ has been uttered often in the last week or
two. It is clear that Barak is trying to find a way to prevent
that.
</P>
<P>
   But some who know Peres say the one thing he will not do is
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never write a political eulogy for Shimon Peres,'' said a
senior official who has worked closely with him and spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``The more people write about the
possibility of his resigning, the less inclined he is to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very, very patient man, and he thinks Barak is going
to crash at some point and then turn to him in need. And he is
willing to put up with everything for that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest problems, say those involved in the
negotiations, is that to create a ministry for Peres, Barak needs
to carve pieces off others, notably the Foreign Ministry, headed by
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
   But Levy has no intention of willingly giving up any of his
powers, already limited by Barak's authoritarian style.
</P>
<P>
   And Finance Minister Avraham Shohat has publicly rejected a
Peres request for a $125 million budget for the new ministry,
saying that Peres' ministry should serve a coordinating role but
not an operational one.
</P>
<P>
   For Nahum Barnea, the nation's most-read political analyst, the
problem comes down to conflicting commitments, as he put in a
recent column in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised Peres a senior ministry, he promised Levy a senior
ministry and he promised himself that he wouldn't let Peres lead
him into all sorts of arrangements that he dislikes,'' Barnea
wrote. ``Barak knows that Peres' resignation has a price. It will
damage the government abroad and make its life more difficult
inside. Peres is not just another minister. On the outside he can
be a bitter adversary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is no question among those who know him that Peres
sincerely hopes to make a difference in the government. But they
also say that this is a man who has spent his entire life in public
service _ he was director general of the Defense Ministry at 28 _
and he does not know how to live any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ben-Simon, a journalist of Moroccan origin at Haaretz,
said that last month, while attending the funeral of King Hassan II
of Morocco in Rabat, Peres met with a leader of Moroccan Jews. As
he has done often in recent months, Peres took the opportunity to
complain about his treatment by Barak.
</P>
<P>
   When the Moroccan asked him why he put up with it and did not
leave the government, Peres replied, ``Political death is more
difficult than physical death,'' the man told Ben-Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Peres has a history of fostering yet somehow overcoming
complicated relationships with his colleagues. He and Yitzhak
Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated in 1995 while Peres
was foreign minister, never got along. Like Barak, Rabin, a
taciturn military man, feared independent Peres initiatives based
on grandiose visions.
</P>
<P>
   When Rabin first heard about efforts to make peace with the
Palestinians through secret meetings in Oslo in early 1993, he
dismissed them as more Peres pipe dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But when that channel led to a breakthrough, Peres' role in the
government grew substantially. The relationship between the two men
took on the quality of a long-married unhappy couple that need one
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, say his close associates, that Peres expects
something analogous to develop if he sticks out the current process
of defining a set of ministerial duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is sure the time will come when Barak will need him,'' said
someone who speaks with him often. ``He thinks that if Barak enters
a serious phase of negotiations for an overall agreement with the
Palestinians, there is no way he can run it without Peres, because
it will be so complicated and you need so much vision and
understanding of the characters that only Peres has. The past and
the future conspire to teach him that it will be worth it if he
waits.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Israelis say they find the process of watching Peres
wait hat in hand too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is he doing this to us?'' Eldar, the Haaretz columnist,
said of Barak. ``Peres is nearly a mythological figure, a pillar of
the peace camp, and there he is fighting to get the leftovers from
Barak. He is an icon. Why is he taking that away from us?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With George W. Bush maintaining a solid popular and
fund-raising lead in the GOP presidential sweepstakes, Southern
states are struggling to assert their relevance in the primary and
caucus process.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials are griping that the campaigning has begun
so early this election cycle that states with primaries in the late
spring have become afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become so front-loaded,'' said Dan Gurley, political
director for the North Carolina Republican Party. ``The states are
just trying to leapfrog one another to make their dates earlier. A
lot of folks realize this is becoming a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time North Carolina's presidential primary rolls around
on May 2, Gurley predicts that the GOP nominee will already be
known.
</P>
<P>
   National party figures agree that the primary season has become
too condensed, and they've set up a task force to find possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if the system is more spread out, it will
allow voters to meet more Republican candidates in more regions and
to move our message into more areas,'' said Mark Pfeifle, deputy
press secretary for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina officials, however, appear in no rush to change
things. With a primary set for Feb. 19, officials there believe the
state will prove pivotal as the gateway to the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be the bellwether for what happens
nationally,'' predicted J. Sam Daniels, executive director of the
state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, comes Alabama, where a straw poll is scheduled
for Aug. 27-28. While party chairman J. Winston Blount believes the
event has ``new meaning and life'' this year, most candidates are
thus far snubbing the Alabama event.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana wants to grab some attention by hosting an early
caucus on Jan. 22. Florida may find it hard to grab much of the
sunshine; it is seen by many as a lock for Bush since his brother
Jeb is governor there. Florida is part of the Super Tuesday lineup
set for March 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Something for Everyone
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been criticized for thinking too small in his
presidential campaign, concentrating on government minutiae rather
than bold, sweeping ideas that can inspire voters. A recent
announcement involving a Florida project might pour more fuel on
that fire.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president personally announced the award of $2.5
million to build a small dormitory at a job training center in the
state, a noble undertaking to be sure but not the magnitude of
project that typically attracts White House notice.
</P>
<P>
   But in their attempt to stay competitive in a state governed by
the sibling of the GOP front-runner, Gore and his advisers
evidently hold the opinion that it certainly doesn't hurt to be
associated with giving federal money to a community. Next up:
paving contracts?
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Mensch
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is weighing in on the fight between a
Jewish student and school administrators in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The school board in Harrison County recently voted to uphold a
policy that bans students from wearing anything that could be
considered a gang symbol. They believe that includes the Star of
David, a religious symbol displayed by many Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Referring to the Star of David as a gang symbol is either
ignorance or religious intolerance,'' Christian Coalition President
Pat Robertson said in a statement. He called on the school board to
reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow a school board may decide a Christian icon is
unacceptable,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Pains
</P>
<P>
   File this under irony.
</P>
<P>
   The South, not exactly known for the strength of its labor
movement, produced one of the country's labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   When former labor leader Lane Kirkland died this month, several
obituaries noted that he was a native of South Carolina, born in
Camden and reared in Newberry.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland, who served as president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to
1995, said in several interviews over the years that he grew to
appreciate the need for organized labor and unions after witnessing
the experience of some friends who worked in textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had company mill villages then,'' he said in a 1995
interview. ``If they'd fire a guy, he'd lose his house. He'd lose
everything. There's no better way to get an education in becoming a
liberal than to be exposed to those sorts of things.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANSELMO, Calif. _ Words no longer come naturally to Ram
Dass. ``My, uh ... my word dressing room ...'' His eyes narrow as
he closes in on the thought. Then he smiles broadly. ``My word
dressing room is bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem the cruelest of ironies that a man who spent his
life as a self-professed ``word merchant'' now struggles with the
simplest dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, the former Harvard professor gone
counterculture was a fixture on the spiritual lecture circuit. At
the time of his stroke two years ago, he was carving a new niche
for himself as a talk radio host.
</P>
<P>
   For 68-year-old Ram Dass, his affliction is no irony at all.
It's just one more switchback on the road of life. And the vista
around the bend is as wondrous as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday and Saturday, the former Richard Alpert will make his
first major public appearances since the stroke. He will share the
stage at the First Unitarian Universalist Center in San Francisco
with his ``guru brother'' Krishna Das.
</P>
<P>
   For the events, dubbed ``The Heart of Devotion,'' Krishna Das
will perform ancient Hindu devotional chants; Ram Dass will speak.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, Ram Dass will convene with the spirit of his
maharaji. Silence will play as large a role as words. Krishna Das'
songs, he says, ``will remind me, remind me, of the, um ... of the
Hindu roots. I feel that my speaking _ it will oil my speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his tranquillity has become a meditative tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences say that the silence between my words keeps them
going inside,'' he says. ``I'll tell you what I'm doing _ I'm
surfing the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses to shift his large frame. It's a serene 70-degree
afternoon at his home in San Anselmo, in Marin County north of San
Francisco. Boxes of books and cassettes spill from the front door
onto the leafy porch.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass is moving to a ground-level cottage in Tiburon, where
there are no steps. With his right side incapacitated, walking
short distances is now a monumental task. The steps to his porch
have made him ``a prisoner'' of this house.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, assistants are milling about, contemplating the packing
job. ``Take It to the Limit'' squawks from a portable stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass has spent his life in search of the limits of human
experience. As a playboy Harvard professor in the early 1960s, he
threw fast-lane parties, collected expensive playthings and learned
to fly an airplane. But the material world, he says, left a hole in
his soul.
</P>
<P>
   With Timothy Leary, he found a famous new direction in
psychedelic drugs. In 1963 the two professors were thrown out of
Harvard for inviting students to take part in their experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Dass' spiritual journeys in India led to ``Be Here Now,''
his lighthearted 1971 guidebook for the counterculture. The book
has sold over 1 million copies to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known as a '60s, um, blub blub,'' he laughs, not grappling
with words so much as satirizing the stereotypes of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Fame and nostalgia hold little contentment for the West's
best-known proponent of living in the moment. ``We've been going
through old lectures, getting ready to move. And I really find them
dull,'' he says, letting out a vigorous chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The simple message of ``Be Here Now'' _ that every moment on
Earth should be ecstasy _ has been particularly useful as he
contends with his physical problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the stroke, it was a beginning of a new life,'' Ram
Dass says, breathing heavily. ``It's good to go this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was toying with the power of the universe, because I was a
helper. That role is a power role. This role _ wow. You get up in
bed. All you are looking for _ `Will you help me? Help me, help me,
help me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such dependency has ``a very bad press in this culture,'' he
says. The teacher is now devoting his energy to addressing common
perceptions about age and infirmity. He's working on a book called
``Still Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his determination, he freely admits that his ``spiritual
faith is being tested. I would call this tough grace.''
</P>
<P>
   His late guru, Neem Karoli Baba, continues to bring Ram Dass
inspiration. ``I talk to him all the time now,'' he says. ``It can
seem wiggy talking to a dead man, but it's like having an imaginary
playmate who is compassionate, is wise, is humorous, is a rascal.
All these good things.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time of accelerating complexity, he says, this weekend's
events with Krishna Das will be a celebration of the Buddhist ideal
of nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck to those that want knowledge,'' Ram Dass says. ``I
want to be where that tree is.''

NAVY DENIES IT EXPECTS Y2K FAILURES IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CARLOS BYARS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Navy study pointing to a potential Year 2000
computer problem with Houston's water supply was mischaracterized
in a unofficial release of information obtained from the Internet,
a Navy statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the study does not predict widespread
problems with water, gas, electricity and sewer services in a
variety of cities, as an unofficial summary claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report lists Houston among those facing a potential
failure of the water supply, a spokesman for the Public Works
Department expressed confidence that all will be well on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy report was summarized this week on an Internet site run
by Jim Lord, a Y2K author, who said he obtained it ``from a
confidential source of the highest reliability and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, President Clinton's top Y2K adviser, called the
military's conclusions overly pessimistic. He said that those
conducting the study were assuming that major utilities would fail
unless proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has to work from the worst case (scenario), but
so do we,'' Lord told The Associated Press on Thursday. ``It's
reprehensible for them to know this and keep it from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said the Navy wasn't withholding information from
anyone, noting that the continually updated report was available
until recently on a Web site maintained by the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last people in the world the department is going to keep
information from is their own people,'' Koskinen said. ``In fact,
the whole purpose of the exercise is to make sure they can provide
appropriate information to servicemen on their bases and their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes Johnson of the Houston Public Works Department said the
department has been preparing for the calendar change for the last
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have completed all the system checks that we know of and
have replaced all the Y2K-sensitive hardware,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Y2K problem refers to the possible failure of some
computer programs, especially older ones, when the date changes to
2000. Because the programs were written to recognize only the last
two digits of a year, such programs could read the digits ``00'' as
1900, potentially causing problems with financial transactions,
airline schedules and electrical grids.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the city also has arranged for an outside
assessment of the city's preparations. That report is due in
mid-September, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city will have complete crews standing by on
New Year's Eve at every sensitive location, Johnson said. All
vacations for that period have been canceled, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that in case there are problems, the city will have
extra fuel for generators and extra chemicals on hand at the city's
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Corps of Engineers also has volunteered to fly in a
giant generator, if necessary, to power the city's main treatment
plant on Federal Road.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has tested the system by resetting computers and
letting the date roll over, not only for Jan. 1, but for Feb. 29,
which also is an unusual date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement faxed to the Houston Chronicle, the
Department of the Navy referred to the study as ``an internal
working document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no indications of likely widespread failures of
water, electricity, gas or sewer,'' the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   Lord's summary predicted ``probable'' partial water system
failures in Houston, Dallas, Nashville, Tenn.; Baton Rouge, La.;
Montgomery, Ala.; Tulsa, Okla.; and 59 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The study predicted ``likely'' partial electrical failures, for
example, at the new year at bases and offices in Orlando, Fla.;
Gulfport, Miss.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and nine other
small-to-midsize cities.
</P>
<P>
   It also predicted likely partial failures of natural gas service
_ in the middle of winter _ in Fort Worth, Nashville, Tenn.;
Albany, N.Y.; Columbus, Ohio; Pensacola, Fla.; and Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report issued by the White House said disruptions in
water service from the date rollover were ``increasingly
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as interesting as the world coming to an
end,'' said Koskinen. ``The way they worked was, until you have
information for contingency planning purposes, you ought to assume
there was a problem.''

   FAIRPORT, N.Y. _ Richard Sands is an avid woodworker. He likes
to make furniture. ``But, you know,'' he said, making a circle with
his arms, as if he were hugging a bear, ``I prefer to work with
logs, cutting them with a chain saw and turning them on a lathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I'd love to sculpt a really big log,'' he said,
laughing. ``I may even have my own sawmill.'' It was just an idea,
he implied, and may never come to anything. Perhaps. But it would
be a mistake to dismiss any of Richard Sands' ideas, especially
when they involve something big. Sands, a stocky, genial
49-year-old, is president and chief executive of Canandaigua Brands
Inc., one of the biggest names, and currently one of the hottest,
in the wine and spirits industry.
</P>
<P>
   Canandaigua was founded by Mordecai E. ``Mack'' Sands, Richard's
grandfather, in 1945. It became a large but unglamorous wine
company here in the Finger Lakes region of New York, with
downmarket brands like J. Roget sparkling wine and Richard's Wild
Irish Rose, a wine known _ unjustifiably, Sands says _ as an
inexpensive high for heavy drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard's Wild Irish Rose is now only a tiny part of the
Canandaigua portfolio, but Sands defends it as a ``pleasant, sweet
wine whose market is mostly rural and mostly blue-collar.'' It was,
he said, named for him by his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a dazzling string of acquisitions, Canandaigua has
become the country's second-largest wine producer, after E&AMP;J Gallo;
its second-largest beer importer, after Heineken, and its
fourth-largest spirits producer. Worldwide, it is 3d in wine
production and 10th in spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In a buying spree that began in 1991, the first trophy was Guild
Wineries and Distillers, a California growers' cooperative whose
Cook's champagne overnight made Canandaigua the nation's No. 2
producer of sparkling wine, after Gallo. In 1993, the acquisition
of Barton Inc. brought the rights to import Corona beer from
Mexico. Vintners International, picked up four months later,
brought in brands like Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars.
In June 1994, Canandaigua acquired Almaden and Inglenook from
Heublein Inc. And in 1995, it bought 30 spirits brands from United
Distillers Glenmore.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Clark PLC, a major British producer and distributor of
everything from wine to bottled water, joined the fold in 1998. So
far this year, Canandaigua has picked up eight Canadian whisky
brands, including Black Velvet and Golden Wedding, two Canadian
distilleries and two prized California wineries, Simi and
Franciscan Estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all for the moment,'' Sands said, grinning like a cat
who has just swallowed a flock of very big canaries. ``Except
vineyards. We are always interested in vineyards.'' Canandaigua now
owns 5,000 acres of vines in California and Chile, not that much
for someone with Sands' expansive point of view. Since 1987, the
company has also owned the Manischewitz label.
</P>
<P>
   In photographs in the company's annual reports, Richard Sands _
everyone, even office assistants, calls him Richard _ looks stern
and businesslike. But strolling around the office in slacks and a
polo shirt, wrestling with the coffee machine and ducking outside
for a forbidden cigarette, he acts more like the laid-back academic
he once hoped to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Sands family was in the wine business as early as 1932, when
Mack Sands was a partner in a winery in Long Island City, N.Y.
Marvin Sands, Richard's father, preceded his son as chief
executive. ``My father never pushed us to go into the family
business,'' Richard Sands said. Which may help explain why he ended
up with a doctorate in social psychology from the University of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   That followed, he acknowledged, a disjointed undergraduate life
that took him to the University of California at Berkeley,
Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Vermont.
``It was the '60s,'' he explained with a shrug, alluding to the
era's campus protests. ``I was gassed by the cops the day I arrived
at Berkeley.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, academia lost its charm. ``There was a glut of
Ph.D.'s in the 1970s and a decrease in the student population,''
Sands said. ``There was a lot of politics _ it was not the ivory
tower I'd hoped it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the campus gave him a chance to return to an earlier
passion: mathematics. ``I always had a mathematic bent,'' he said.
``I dropped it all in Berkeley when I looked around a math class
and realized there were no girls. But artificial intelligence?
Mathematical models? I love that stuff. Eventually, my dad
suggested I might be able to apply it in the business world. I
joined the company in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the financial side,'' he said. ``I never took a course
in accounting, but I can drive all the financial officers crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there have been three marriages, the third
beginning three years ago. ``It will be my last,'' he said. He and
his wife, Jennifer, live with two of her children.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to see Richard Sands, at the center of companies
all over the world, as the tranquil eye of the storm. But to hear
him tell it, there is no storm. ``The presidents of the companies
have complete control,'' he said. ``We like CEO's who know their
companies better than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sands, the newest Canandaigua acquisitions may be the most
exciting. Simi and Franciscan are the company's first ventures into
the fine-wine category. Not surprisingly, he sees them as a
stepping stone to a major presence in the high end of the wine
business, a long way from Richard's Wild Irish Rose. Only a small
part of the business now, they could turn out to be that really big
log he's been dreaming of.

FAILURE, AMERICA'S OWN SUCCESS STORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ohio., Ill., Calif., Mass., Pa.)   By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a curious inversion afoot in Silicon Valley, where
Internet entrepreneurs whose start-up companies fail are more
marketable to venture capitalists than those who have never failed
at all. It is not how business is supposed to work, but there it
is: in that corner of the economy, failure has become an asset, a
resume-builder.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in an industry where people do not know what they are
doing, any experience is better than none; perhaps the willingness
to fail is admired because it suggests the courage to try. Whatever
the explanation, the turning of failure on its head is a reminder
of Americans' incessantly ambivalent and constantly mutable
relationship with the idea of not ``making it.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure has been with us as the shadow of success since the
republic's early days, when Benjamin Franklin lectured that
``little strokes fell great oaks'' _ that with enough diligence and
tenacity, anyone could succeed. In the two centuries since, as
capitalism has expanded its hold on American life, success has
become that much more important and failure that much more
catastrophic. Its definition seems to have quietly broadened to
encompass not just those who fail outright, but those who do not
achieve extraordinary and public success.
</P>
<P>
   As in Silicon Valley, there are exceptions. In the age of
instant memoirs and commercial endorsements, for example, Bob Dole,
Dick Morris, and others have shown that failure can be profitable.
To judge from talk shows and tabloids, the only true failure
nowadays sometimes seems to be obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Americans the stigma of failing remains, and thus
the quest to assign a moral cause for it continues. Whether the
blame for those who fail to make it up the ladder lies with larger
socioeconomic forces or with the individual is an unspoken subtext
of the ideological battle between liberals and conservatives. It is
the backdrop of countless policy debates, on subjects from welfare
to how hard it should be to declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while plenty of Americans have experience with failure, few
like to dwell on it, at least outside their therapists' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians in particular and Americans in general don't like
to talk about failure very much,'' said Scott Sandage, a professor
at Carnegie Mellon who is at work on a book called ``Forgotten Men:
Failure in American Culture,'' to be published by Harvard
University Press.
</P>
<P>
   There are, he says, dozens of studies of the ideology of success
in America, but until recently, historians have not looked at the
experience of failure. Sandage is doing just that _ researching not
great men who momentarily stumbled, but ordinary men who despite
their honest toil slowly, or sometimes instantaneously, sank.
</P>
<P>
   He has dug through family papers and diaries, credit reports and
letters, to understand how Americans grappled with failure in a
society where hard work was supposed to equal success.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was usually to find some flaw in the person's
character. He cites the example of Robert Brown, a farmer and
planter in antebellum Virginia, who was described in various
business records as ``one of nature's best sons'' _ a decent if
slightly naive man _ while he was prospering. But when he went
bankrupt some of the same people described him as ``a man of no
energy'' _ a phrase that Sandage says became common in the 1850s
and 1860s to describe failures who were not idlers or drunkards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a profound threat to the fundamental ideology of America
if it never comes together'' despite one's best efforts, Sandage
said.
</P>
<P>
   So when Fitch Raymond, a Cleveland grocer who failed during the
Panic of 1873, requested assistance from a friend, he defended
himself against the assumption that he was to blame: ``I have been
Struggling incessantly trying to regain a little foothold but
without success. ``Not because I am imbecile, shiftless, lazy,
listlessly, loafing about, no, not a bit of it, but the reverse is
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time Sandage said, failure has been transformed from an
action _ failing at a business or other venture _ to an identity.
Today, being known as a ``loser'' and the words ``I am a failure''
have become common coinage.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of super-successes like Carnegie and Rockefeller at the
end of the 19th century helped breed the phenomenon that might be
called failure through inadequacy: unless one achieved and amassed
on a grand public scale, one had failed. As capitalism exploded,
Americans began grappling with how to process failure in a society
that held that the individual made his fortunes or broke them. The
notion of treating failure as a bump on the road to success _ still
very much evident today in self-help books with titles like
``Failure: The Back Door to Success'' _ began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, the decade when the president proclaimed that
``the business of America is business,'' a little homily called
``The Failure'' circulated in popular magazines, Merrill Peterson
writes in ``Lincoln in American Memory.'' It recounted the defeats
Abraham Lincoln had suffered and concluded: ``How would you stand
in the face of such setbacks? Think it over!''
</P>
<P>
   The list of Lincoln's failures continues to circulate today,
most often in advice columns and motivational seminars. That it
happens to be somewhat inaccurate _ some of the defeats on the list
are exaggerated or did not happen at all _ has done little to
diminish its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lincoln list'' embodies one of the most potent images in
American life, one found in politics, Hollywood and certainly
sports: the comeback. At its heart the comeback is nothing more
than failing, then rising from the ashes, with victory sweetened by
the defeat that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a culture we are very forgiving of failure,'' said Steven
Biel, a professor of history and literature at Harvard, ``but
failure has to be one moment in a larger narrative where success is
secured.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Biel, the author of ``Down With the Old Canoe,'' a history of
cultural attitudes toward the Titanic, notes that when the ship
sank in 1912, ``everyone who looked at it tried to turn it into a
story of redemption _ pulling success out of the jaws of failure.''
The fact that women and children were saved first, he said, was
instantly spun as an example of American male chivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Such public and political efforts to transform grand national
failures into a narrative of triumph are not uncommon. Consider the
speech William Safire composed for President Nixon in 1969 in case
the men who landed on the moon had to be abandoned there. It would
have been a disastrous failure, but in Safire's vision, it became a
triumph of American character. ``Others will follow, and surely
find their way home,'' the speech read. ``Man's search will not be
denied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American political culture has not changed,'' Biel said. ``It
is hard to envision any national figure not returning to the
rhetoric of progress _ that failure is part of the American
narrative of destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the turns of history have forced Americans occasionally
to adjust their attitudes toward failure. During the Depression,
for instance, failure became so widespread that blame shifted
somewhat from the individual to the system. The same is true, to a
lesser degree, of the wave of downsizing earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Such larger phenomena may briefly elicit more public compassion.
But perhaps the gentlest and certainly most honest treatment of
failure comes in literature. As Willy Loman, perhaps the archetype
of American failure puts it, ``A man can't go out the way he came
in, Ben, he has got to add up to something.'' Robert Polito, the
biographer of the crime novelist Jim Thompson, calls failure ``one
of the great subjects of American fiction'' _ perhaps the great
subject. From Herman Melville's ``Pierre,'' to Hurstwood in
``Sister Carrie,'' who descends from prosperity to a Bowery
flophouse, to Dick Diver disappearing into smaller and smaller
towns at the end of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``Tender Is the Night'' _
the list of fictional failures is endless. Often, Polito notes,
they are exploring the burdens placed on the psyche by the enormous
expectations of success in America.
</P>
<P>
   In most of these books the failures are men, and Sandage said
his research also reveals failure as a masculine category. ``People
don't fail unless they are supposed to succeed,'' he said, and in
the 19th century and much of the 20th success was the province of
white men.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Delbanco, a professor of the humanities at Columbia
University, notes that women, particularly in the 19th century, had
their own kind of failure to deal with: whether they married and,
in a certain social milieu, married well. Again, literature tells
the story: Lily Bart in Edith Wharton's ``House of Mirth,'' for
example, blows her chance to make a good match and is consigned to
poverty and ultimately death.
</P>
<P>
   Each subculture in American life _ whether gender or region,
profession or class _ seems to have its own code of failure: what
kinds are acceptable? How to treat those who fail. What rules about
failure will protect the status of the subculture and its members?
Where Silicon Valley exalts failure, Wall Street punishes it
ruthlessly, observes Michael Lewis, who is about to publish a book
on cyberspace entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't be seen giving money to someone who has proven
inept with money,'' he said. On Wall Street, to readmit a failure
would suggest that the whole business is a crapshoot, based as much
on luck as skill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the underclass, conversely, failure has become normalized.
Sociologists like William Julius Wilson have devoted a sizable
portion of their work trying to establish why the ``achievement
ethic,'' the hunger for traditional notions of success, has not
permeated the inner city, or how structural forces grease the path
toward failure.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is politics, which Lewis, who spent the 1996
presidential campaign mostly with candidates who failed, calls one
of the few fields in American life with room for ``noble failure''
_ the principled and damned quest, waged by men like Ralph Nader or
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But even principle does not necessarily make defeat palatable.
Lewis said that he wanted to title his last book, on the 1996
presidential campaign, ``Losers,'' but his publisher refused. Lewis
said he was told there is no market in America for failure.

 &HT;    Browns ready for new season
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two months after he helped resurrect one of
America's most vociferous sports fan clubs at a goat farmers'
amphitheater near Versailles, Glen Foutz has a message for
Dayton-area pro football buffs: The Cleveland Browns are baa-ck.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Foutz, who grew up thrilling to the gridiron
exploits of Cleveland's Jim Brown and others on a small-screen,
black-and-white television set, is president of the Miami Valley
Browns Backers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Browns fans will be keyed up tonight as their team
plays its first game in the $283 million, 72,000-seat Cleveland
Browns Stadium. The preseason game against Minnesota is the first
NFL game in Cleveland since Dec. 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This was already shaping up as a good year for the Piqua-based
Browns Backers chapter long before the Browns resumed play with a
20-17 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Aug. 9, after a
44-month hiatus that began when the original team was moved to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though membership in Cleveland Browns fan clubs worldwide
is still down considerably from what it was before the team left
Cleveland, we're absolutely booming,'' Foutz says. ``We have 1,100
card-carrying members, which makes us the largest Browns Backers
chapter in Ohio, and one of the biggest in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Foutz concedes, however, that the increased participation this
year may have something to do with the fact that the club isn't
charging a membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our records were lost after the team went to
Baltimore,'' he explains. ``When we decided to put the fan club
together again, Browns officials suggested we make membership free
the first year so we wouldn't be charging some people twice for
joining the organization. When we resume collecting dues, they will
be $10 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has dozens of Browns fan clubs, including two in Dayton _
the Browns Backers of Greater Dayton and the Northwest Browns
Backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team deserves much of the credit for the success of the
clubs because it is the only National Football League team that
employs a coordinator of fan clubs,'' Foutz says. ``Her name is
Krystal Thomas, and she is very helpful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest get-togethers for members of the Miami Valley
Browns Backers Inc. was an Aug. 7 dance at the End Zone Sports Bar
in Covington. About 200 men and women shelled out five bucks a pop
each to take a few twirls around the dance floor and have a chance
to receive one of 138 game tickets the team set aside for members
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Browns reserved 600 tickets for Browns Backers chapters
and we got 138 because we are a large club,'' Foutz says. ``Ours
are for the Nov. 7 Baltimore Ravens game. Each of the winners will
pay $30 for the ticket, and an additional $30 to cover the cost of
bus trip to Cleveland. We'll be taking at least three buses.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnout at the Covington watering hole was a pretty typical
one for the Piqua chapter, according to Foutz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a nice mix of people,'' he says. ``Men and women _
the women call themselves ``Dawgettes'' _ and families, too. There
are rich people and poor people. Old people and young people.
Professionals and blue-collar workers. Many of them came to the
dance displaying the orange and brown colors of the team. They wore
T-shirts and hard hats and Browns bandannas. Nobody showed up with
face paint on, but I'm sure that'll come later.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the dance _ the night the Browns opened the
pre-season against the Cowboys in Canton's Fawcett Stadium _
members of the Piqua chapter gathered at The End Zone Lounge and
Slammer's Nightclub Inc. in Versailles to watch the game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Subler, owner of Slammer's, characterizes Browns Backers
as ``a rowdy bunch.'' Then he adds: ``They're beer drinkers . . .
and good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Foutz says Browns Backers come from all walks of life and then
offers a story to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the members of the chapter in Bowling Green is a
Catholic priest,'' he says. ``He wears his Browns stuff under his
robes so he can head for the game as soon as Mass is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's two BB chapters present contrasting images.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns Backers of Greater Dayton, founded in 1986, has about
500 members and is growing every day, says 46-year-old Mike
McDonald, a trustee for the chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than 1,100 members before the team left Cleveland,
but we're coming back,'' he says. ``The night the Browns played the
Cowboys, more than 300 of us watched the game at Wallaby's in
Beavercreek and we signed up 50 new members. Our dues are $20 a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The next task for the chapter _ which has a new logo featuring a
Cleveland Browns helmet with Dayton's skyline in the background _
is to dispense 80 tickets for the Nov. 28 Browns-Tennessee Titans
game. The chapter's next business meeting is at 7 p.m. Aug. 30 at
VFW Post 9927 at Wilmington Pike and Marshall Road in Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   As McDonald watches membership mushroom in his chapter, Donald
Holmes, president of the 11-year-old Northwest Dayton Browns
Backers, talks of breathing new life into his organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now were trying to rebuild our membership,'' says
Holmes, who describes himself as a Browns fan since birth. ``We
currently have 28 members because everybody kind of took a little
vacation when the team left Cleveland. Now we're going to start
recruiting new ones.'' The chapter's dues are aren't determined
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Foutz remembers his first Browns Backers meeting of the year _
the BYOB session at the amphitheater built by goat farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pro football draft was over, so we knew what players were
on board by the time we had that meeting,'' he says. ``You could
tell that night that enthusiasm for the team was running very high
. . . and the excitement has been been building ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Club members aren't expecting any miracles from the Browns this
year. Not major miracles, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's looking for a Super Bowl win right out of the
chute,'' Foutz says. ``If we go 8-8, we'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he points to the license plate on his sport utility
vehicle. It is GO BROWN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state wouldn't let me add an `s' to it, but I still think
it looks pretty good,'' he says.

PHYSICAL AFFECTION LEADS TO LESS-AGGRESSIVE YOUTHS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a cross-cultural study of affection and aggression
done at McDonald's playgrounds, pre-schoolers in France playfully
touched each other twice as much US children did, but while the
French children acted aggressively only 1 percent of the time, the
US youth did so 29 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists have long known that cultures that shower
physical affection on young children have little adult violence,
dating back to Margaret Mead's studies in New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   But the study in McDonald's playgrounds in France and the United
States, along with other new evidence, suggests that it's time for
America to take another look at how it raises its children,
particularly boys, to stop the crisis of violence, researchers said
Friday at the nation's largest annual psychological association
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be some relationship between a lack of touching
and violence,'' said Tiffany Field of the University of Miami
Medical School, who conducted the study at the McDonald's
playgrounds _ especially since international statistics have
consistently shown that France has the lowest homicide rate of
developed nations, while the United States has the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Field said she fears there will be even less physical affection
toward children in our society as a result of teachers and day care
providers worrying about accusations of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   She joined several other researchers in presenting their recent
findings about the root causes of anger, isolation and violence in
boys, during a news conference Friday at the American Psychological
Association meeting in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While they agreed that the inability to express affection and
other constructive emotions may play a role in violence, they
cautioned that there are other factors as well, and that it is
difficult to prove cause and effect.
</P>
<P>
   But with headlines about schoolyard shootings and hate crimes
perpetrated by boys and men, the need to understand the root causes
are more important than ever, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   For Harvard psychologist Dan Kindlon, the problem is ``we give
boys an emotional miseducation.''
</P>
<P>
   Society tells boys ``you can punch each other but you can't have
any kind of affectionate touch,'' said Kindlon, an assistant
professor at both Harvard Medical School and School of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Boys grow up unable to talk about their emotions or to be aware
of others' feelings, and they have fewer constructive ways of
dealing with stress, said Kindlon, co-author of a book on the topic
entitled ``Raising Cain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of a lack of adaptive response, too many boys act out
in violence and anger,'' Kindlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and McLean Hospital psychologist William S. Pollack,
author of the book ``Real Boys,'' said ``we have a national crisis
of boyhood in America'' at the same time that there is a national
crisis of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 200 boys from ages 12 through 17, who were
considered well-adjusted, normal boys, Pollack found much angst,
depression and sadness. He linked these to their feeling they had
to live up to the old myths about boys being boys and boys not
crying, while on the other hand feeling they had to live up to new
demands of being more sensitive and egalitarian toward girls.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of turmoil and conflict may lead some boys to
violence, Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies on presented Friday touched upon such issues as
schoolyard bullying and prevention of violence through negotiation.

IOWA RESULTS SHOW GENDER WORKING FOR DOLE, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Geraldine Ferraro has a few words of warning for
GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole: The big crowds and
enthusiasm and media attention for a ``first woman'' in politics
don't always translate into votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put a damper on this, but you can't always
believe what you're seeing,'' said Ferraro, whose run for vice
president in 1984 generated huge excitement but didn't help the
losing Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Dole's aides insist that seeing is believing. Dole's
unexpected third-place finish in last week's Iowa straw poll was
unique because two-thirds of her voters were women and half were
newcomers to politics. Her pollster, Linda DiVall, called it a
``powerful testament to Dole's strength'' in turning the curious
into the committed and a sign that women will support a fresh,
female face for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Getting 14 percent, or 3,420, of the 23,685 votes in the
nonbinding Iowa event is a long way from winning the nomination,
which is still a long shot for Dole while Texas Governor George W.
Bush is miles ahead in the money-and-endorsement race.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the Iowa results have silenced pundits who
had pronounced Dole's campaign all but dead, and more important,
they offer some proof that her gender is working for, not against,
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being `the woman' in the race will continue to dog her, but
being `a woman' appears to be helping Dole bring out a different
kind of GOP constituency _ younger people and women,'' said New
York pollster John Zogby, who said last week's vote gave ``new
life'' to Dole's campaign. ``Soccer moms may have found their
Republican primary candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance for the GOP is that Dole could be a magnet for
moderate, suburban women who are independents or first-time voters,
and, like Ronald Reagan in 1980, could expand the base of the
party. She could also narrow the gender gap that gives Democrats
the edge with women voters and cost Republicans the White House in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dole's challenge is to harness the interest shown by women _
they far outnumber men at her events and fund-raisers and swamp her
for photographs, hugs, and autographs for their daughters _ and
turn what she calls her ``invisible army'' into volunteers, voters,
and donors. She plans a weekend of fund-raising and speechmaking on
the West Coast and will take a few days off next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an untapped army, but it does not belong
automatically to Elizabeth Dole or any other female candidate,''
said Irene Natividad, chairwoman of the nonprofit Women's Vote
Project. ``She may have the presumptive edge with women, but she
has to say something real to get their vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole has separated herself from the GOP pack on one issue that
pollsters say resonates with women _ tighter gun control _ and her
speeches are full of parent-friendly, value-based ideas for making
communities safer and schools stronger. She straddles the fence on
abortion, asserting she is ``pro-life'' while suggesting that
abortion rights would be safe in a Dole administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole's gender connection seems to be based less on what she
stands for than who she is. Many women like Dole simply because she
is optimistic, accomplished, sincere, and different, DiVall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older women, who we would expect to be more resistant to a
woman candidate, say, `Why not a woman, after what we've just had
in the White House?' '' DiVall said. ``Younger women say, `This is
us, it's our time to make history.' It's not a negative-male thing,
but they are really enthused and want to see her succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Medge Owen, an anesthesiologist in Winston-Salem, N.C., is
typical of professional women under 40 who have no political
affiliation but a strong attraction to Dole. ``My parents brought
me up to believe I could do anything, and here is a woman who is
proving you can,'' Owen said after hearing Dole speak. ``She's a
great role model for younger women.''
</P>
<P>
   While aides openly discuss Dole's appeal to women, the candidate
herself avoids the issue. Aside from joking that her spouse, former
Senate majority leader Bob Dole, is a house-husband and declaring
that her goal is to ``make history,'' the 63-year-old Dole plays
down her gender and rarely mentions her academic and professional
trailblazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not running because I am a woman,'' Dole said at the
luncheon last month in Winston-Salem. ``I don't want people to vote
for me because I am a woman. I want them to vote for me because I
am the best qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides say Dole understands how to maintain the balance
between wooing women voters and not alienating men, and Ferraro
thinks she's got it about right. ``I never gave a woman's speech,''
Ferraro said. ``When you're the only one wearing a bright-colored
dress and wearing lipstick, it's pretty obvious who the woman
candidate is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's experience running the American Red Cross and heading two
Cabinet departments may help inoculate her against the stereotype
that women don't have the savvy or insider's edge to be the chief
executive. Proving herself an expert on foreign policy and defense
``is a hurdle,'' DiVall said. But her softer image could help
dispel the general notion that all Republicans are dour and
judgmental, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole already hears the types of observations never made
about men: On National Public Radio this week, political analyst
Stuart Rothenberg said Dole had to prove she was running for more
than ``national hostess.'' She also faces the conventional wisdom
that she would make a perfect vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anybody saying (Arizona Senator) John McCain would make a
great vice president? No,'' said Ari Fleischer, Dole's press
secretary. Dole emphatically says she is not running for or
interested in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it works to our advantage. Every time they say `vice
president,' more women turn out at our events, and we we move up a
notch,'' Fleischer added. ``Women are tired of being told they are
equal to men and then getting the second job. This feeling is
shared by millions of women: `Give us a crack at the really great
job.' ''

 &HT;    Questions of Bush's drug use level off during his second day in
Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ As days go on the often rugged presidential
campaign trail, Friday turned out to be much happier for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After being verbally pummeled by reporters Thursday with
questions about whether he used illegal drugs years ago, Bush, 53,
faced relatively gentle queries Friday in Akron, and then received
a hero's welcome at a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser from supporters
who showered him with $365,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the $300,000 Bush raised Thursday night at the
suburban Columbus home of Les Wexner, chairman of The Limited
Stores Inc., Bush raised $1,665,000 in less than a month in Ohio.
The first $1 million came at a July 22 event in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be the next president of the United
States and I thank you for getting on my team,'' Bush said as
applause filled the ballroom at the Hilton Fairlawn Hotel just
outside Akron.
</P>
<P>
   As Ohio Democratic Chairman David Leland noted, Bush,
accompanied to Akron by Gov. Bob Taft, may have been getting a
little ahead of himself as he warmed to the partisan crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has been lulled into a false sense of security,'' Leland
said. ``The Republicans have given him the nomination before a
single vote has been cast. Soon he'll find out we don't elect
presidents that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush supporters said they believed the Texas governor has
emerged relatively unscathed from the frenzy of questioning about
possible illegal drug use, although the issue could come up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press is trying to find something. ... He'll survive
this,'' said U.S. Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Navarre), dean of the Ohio
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush said in Roanoke, Va. that, in effect, he had
not used illegal drugs since at least 1974, 25 years ago. Once he
got to Ohio, he declined to repeat this but stuck to a statement he
reiterated Friday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the American people that years ago I made some
mistakes. I've learned from my mistakes. Should I be fortunate
enough to become president, I will bring dignity and honor to the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came before the fund-raiser, just after he toured
the Haven of Rest Ministries mission in downtown Akron. He cited
the mission, which provides shelter and training to the poor,
homeless and people with substance-abuse problems, as the kind of
faith-based organization that Americans should rely on to solve the
nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting such groups is a key part of Bush's campaign. ``I
believe as we had to the 21st century, it's important to
reinvigorate faith-based organizations that help people change
their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush deflected a question about whether he had been
straightforward with his 17-year-old twin daughters about his past
use of alcohol and possibly drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate your question, but I'm going to leave my
daughters out of the campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that members of his generation have a special
obligation to today's young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting questions facing baby boomers is have
we grown up? Are we willing to share the wisdom of past mistakes. I
think the message ought to be to our children, `Don't use drugs,
don't abuse alcohol.' That's what leadership is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he'd learned from the vigorous questioning of the
past two days, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that sometimes politics can be unnecessarily ugly
and I'm trying to purge the system of ugly politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he plans to return to Ohio frequently before the
March 7 primary and, if he gets the Republican nomination, before
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the fight for the nomination to be over by
March 7 when California, New York and several other states also
hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the general election, (Ohio) is always a bellwether state,
a swing state. I try to remember the '88 campaign and not the '92
campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, George Bush, won Ohio in 1988 when he was elected
president, but lost the state and the presidency in 1992 to Bill
Clinton.

GPS SATELLITE RESET COULD CAUSE CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER ZEIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who rely on the global satellite system called GPS to
help them navigate will be closely watching the network Saturday
night as it resets itself, possibly throwing millions of electronic
direction-finders out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K-like bug could cause just a technological hiccup, or it
could result in thousands of pilots, boaters, and even Japanese
drivers, to become temporarily lost.
</P>
<P>
   The network of 27 earth orbiting satellites used to aid
navigation for the military, businesses and individuals, was
programmed in 1980 with a calendar of just 1,024 weeks. At 13
seconds before 8 pm EST Saturday, that calendar will expire and the
system will reset to week one.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the satellites are prepared for this ``end
of week rollover,'' and will continue to transmit an accurate
signal. But just how the Global Positioning System receivers
interpret the epoch moment is a matter of some debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the potential to be a major problem as in Y2K, but we
don't expect it to be,'' said Bill Schmidt of the Boston Coast
Guard, Aids and Navigation department.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt predicts there may be a second's lapse while receiving
the signal, but then the system should quickly reset itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get people to go to their manufacturers,''
Schmidt said, adding the older models are the issue. He also
advised that mariners not rely on the GPS as their only form of
locator.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the manufacturers of GPS receivers, including Lowrance
Electronics, Garmin and Magellan GPS systems have posted
reassurances on their Internet sites, telling customers that all of
their newer models are end-of-week rollover compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any prudent mariner that's out there that has any inkling of
sense will have more than one mode of navigation,'' Schmidt said.
Long Range Navigation, Type C and other traditional visual
navigation are two types of backup.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS receivers determine location via latitude, longtitude,
and _ with planes _ altitude by triangulating signals from at least
four of 27 satellites that orbit the Earth every 12 hours. GPS was
solely a military system until about 10 years ago, when a separate
signal was released to civilians. The civilian signal contains a
built-in random error to thwart terrorist groups from finding exact
locations of important landmarks or military installations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, handheld and dashboard-mounted GPS receivers
have become popular ``techno-toys'' for everyone from general
aviation pilots, weekend boaters, and even big business. Federal
Express, for example, uses the signal to track the status of
shipped packages and relay them to customers via their website.
FedEx claims they aren't shaken by the rollover, but will switch to
a private satellite system, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident that there will be no problems with the
receivers; we've been on top of this for some time,'' said Darlene
Faquin, a spokeswoman for Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where GPS-equipped automobiles have become
commonplace, drivers rely on the network as their only indicator to
navigate the country's unmarked streets. Drivers with navigation
systems made before 1997 have been told to check with their
manufacturers for reset instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Poossible problems include receivers that appear to be working
but display inaccurate positions, times, or dates, like displaying
Jan. 5 or Jan. 6, 1980, or receivers that fail to locate the
satellite signal, according to Ronea Alger, chief of media
relations at the Los Angeles Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   Master Chief Petty Officer Rick Hamilton of the Coast Guard
Navigation Center in Alexandria, VA, said there's no top-secret
reason why the system was programmed with a limited calendar.
Programmers ``just drew a line,'' he said. ``It was probably just
an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, the government liasion to the civil sector for
GPS, refines signals from an accuracy of 100 meters to a more
precise 10 meters, is using this weekend as a test for the upcoming
rollover into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Jan. 1, possibly unrecognizable leap-year dates
February 28 to February 29, 2000, may also be problematic along
with Sept. 9, 1999 (9/9/99) which the system may read as a purge
command.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard has set up checkpoint times one half hour before and
after the rollover for Coast Guard ships and planes, asking pilots
to double check time and location accuracy and call in any
problems.

COMPAQ DROPS ALPHA-WINDOWS 2000 PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. is giving up on efforts to make its
powerful Alpha processor chips compatible with Windows 2000, the
next version of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system.
Compaq says it has disbanded the 100-person team working on the
project and that some of them will likely be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not plan to support 32-bit Windows 2000 on Alpha
systems,'' said Compaq spokesman Jim Finlaw. But he added that
Compaq is still committed to a future version of Windows 2000 that
will be customized to take advantage of the special design of the
Alpha chip. Meanwhile, Compaq will concentrate on selling
Alpha-based machines that run the Unix and Linux operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bradshaw, a spokesman for Alpha Processor Inc., a Concord
firm jointly owned by Compaq and the Korean electronics firm
Samsung, said that the Alpha has a bright future despite the policy
shift. ``Less than 5 percent of the business that we see now comes
from the NT space,'' Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shannon, author of the industry newsletter Shannon Knows
Compaq, said that demand for high-end computers using Alpha
processors is actually on the rise, but few Alpha customers want to
use Windows NT. ``There are now over half a million Alpha platforms
out there,'' said Shannon. ``My guess is Alpha NT represents maybe
15 percent, perhaps less, of that total.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Alpha wasn't designed to run NT in its
current form. The chip was developed in the early 1990s by
engineers at Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp., before it was
acquired by Compaq. Alpha chips consistently have been faster and
more powerful than the popular Pentium series of processors from
Intel Corp. This is partly because the Alpha was designed to
process 64 bits of data at a time. Pentium chips can only handle 32
bits at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But the chip's 64-bit design is incompatible with Microsoft's
32-bit Windows operating systems, including Windows NT, a version
intended for business use. Alpha chips can run Windows software by
using a special program, but this method causes the Alpha to run
slower, thus reducing its speed advantage over the Pentium. The
ultimate solution would be to develop a 64-bit version of Windows.
Microsoft has been working on such a product to run not only on
Alpha but also on Merced, an upcoming 64-bit chip to be produced by
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Most Alpha users run some version of the Unix operating system.
Unix is widely used for high-end corporate computing because it's
considered more reliable than Windows NT. Compaq already has a
version of Unix that takes full advantage of the Alpha chip's
64-bit design. In addition, many Alpha users rely on a 64-bit
version of the Linux operating system, which is available at low
cost from firms such as Red Hat Software Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dube, an industry analyst with Wasserstein Perella
Securities in New York, said that Compaq's move signals a retreat
from Windows NT, not from the Alpha chip. ``NT has not really made
the big breakthrough,'' said Dube. ``It is not the elixir of love
everyone thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft this year will introduce Windows 2000, a version of NT
that is supposed to be reliable enough for use at the highest level
of large businesses. But Dube said that many high-end users remain
skeptical that any Windows operating system will be trustworthy
enough for mission-critical jobs. These users are sticking with
Unix-based systems, for which Alpha is already well suited.

 &HT;    Former BellSouth chairman to lead UNC-Chapel Hill
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ A year from now, former BellSouth Vice
Chairman Bill McCoy hopes to retire, once and for all. Until then,
the 65-year-old man in dark pinstripes and gold cuff links is back
at his alma mater as interim chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is steering UNC-Chapel Hill, North Carolina's flagship
university, through turbulent times until his permanent replacement
is hired next year.
</P>
<P>
   Students are returning to a historic campus still shaken by the
unexpected death of popular Chancellor Michael Hooker, 53, who died
in June of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy also is having to deal with deepening financial worries,
after the state Legislature refused this summer to approve a $3
billion construction package for North Carolina's 16 public
universities.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that UNC-Chapel Hill already was grappling with a
projected $11.6 million budget shortfall. An estimated $5 million
stemmed from an embarrassing oversight by finance officials. They
failed to realize that in the coming year, the university will be
responsible for 27 pay periods, not the usual 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget snafu and the failed bond issue were blows to
Carolina's credibility,'' chided a recent editorial in The Chapel
Hill Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The budget shortfall has since been reduced to $6.8 million, but
it required the elimination of 13 jobs. Though he had no role in
the payroll miscalculation, McCoy said it won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to focus on the university's planning and budgeting _
less visionary than some of Hooker's endeavors, but crucial at this
time, some believe.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, a 1969 UNC graduate, gained popularity as chancellor by
visiting each of North Carolina's 100 counties. After UNC defeated
rival Duke in a men's basketball game, Hooker allowed celebrating
students to hoist his body and pass him atop the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, by contrast, has a penchant for finance, not body
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His experience in business will directly apply to what we need
to accomplish on the business side of the university,'' said Jane
Stine, a UNC systems programmer and chair of the Employee Forum,
which represents nonfaculty staff. ``I've been extremely impressed
with his quick grasp of the situation here.''
</P>
<P>
   The lean, graying interim chancellor leans over a glass-topped
table in South Building, a corner of the university home to Yackety
Yack yearbooks dating back to the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is reserved and methodical in his style and in his
expectations for UNC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can keep some of the important things moving along,
maintaining the historic momentum of this school, I will be glad
about it,'' said the 1955 UNC graduate from Snow Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a Marine Corps helicopter pilot, he earned his
reputation as a financial whiz over 35 years in telecommunications,
mostly at BellSouth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, McCoy played a critical role in the spinoff of
Atlanta-based BellSouth during the breakup of AT&AMP;T. He rose to
chief financial officer and vice chairman and, in 1986, became
president of BellSouth Enterprises, which grew to 17,000 employees
in nonregulated industries such as cellular phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not an effusive sort of guy, a backslapper,'' said Dick
Yarbrough, a retired BellSouth vice president. ``If he had any
emotional bent, it was toward the University of North Carolina. I
think he probably bleeds Tar Heel blue.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy impressed then-UNC President C.D. Spangler, a Charlotte,
N.C., billionaire who served on BellSouth's board of directors.
Another BellSouth director, Charlotte banker Cliff Cameron, served
on UNC's Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
   After McCoy retired from BellSouth, Spangler and Cameron
convinced him to join UNC's General Administration, responsible for
the 16 public universities, as vice president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from that post in January, hoping to relax with his
wife, Sara, play golf and visit with grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after Hooker went on medical leave, McCoy began a
two-month stint as UNC-Chapel Hill's acting chancellor. Following
Hooker's death, he agreed to return on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think students are looking for a visionary, or for
Bill McCoy to lay out a 10-point plan for what he is going to do,''
said Nic Heinke, 21, the student body president. ``But they are
looking for strong leadership.

BAY STATE JOBLESSNESS UP SLIGHTLY IN JULY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts continued to add jobs in July, but a
rush of new workers entering the labor force nudged the state's
unemployment rate up slightly to 3.2 percent, the state Division of
Employment and Training said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of state residents with jobs rose by 3,100 during the
month. But at the same time 9,000 people decided to go looking for
work _ the largest one month expansion in the labor force since
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in the number of job seekers caused 5,900 more people
to report unemployment, pushing the monthly rate up from 3 percent
in June, the division said.
</P>
<P>
   The rise is so small that it's statistically insignificant,
economists said. And every sector of the economy except
manufacturing added jobs from the same time a year ago, with the
biggest gains coming at restaurants and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Massacusetts unemployment remains a full percentage
point below the national rate of 4.3 percent, economists said it is
slightly worrisome that the state added jobs at a rate of just 1.3
percent since last July. That's a more sluggish rate than the
nation, which showed 2.3 percent growth during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a sign of some slowing,'' said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. ``Is it a cause for
concern? Probably not a huge one. It's still a very ebulient
economy. When you put everything together, it still smells pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Massachusetts' slower job growth since last July, the
state figures show more than three-quarters of the gains came in
the last six months, suggesting the slowdown may have been
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In July, jobs were most plentiful at the state's restaurants and
retail stores, which had 4,900 new positions. By far, that was the
biggest job addition of any sector during the month. Construction
added 200 jobs, manufacturing added 700, services accounted for
1,300 and there were 400 more in finance, insurance and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the same time a year ago, the period most economists use
to gauge trends, retail added 13,800 jobs in Massachusetts, a gain
of 2.5 percent. Construction showed an increase of 6,500 jobs, or 6
percent, though that rate has slowed significantly in recent
months. Jobs in finance, real estate and insurance climbed 4,600,
or 2.1 percent, and services showed an increase of 27,600, or 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in manufacturing, meanwhile _ still suffering the lingering
effects of a sluggish world economy and the Asian financial
collapse _ dropped by 14,700, or 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In July, manufacturing jobs grew for the first time in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to know whether the July numbers for this
sector represent a change in the trend,'' the employment division
said in its report. ``However some manufacturing industries are
showing over-the-year increases,'' suggesting long-term
improvements may be in store.

   Lionbridge Technologies Inc., formed as a 1996 management buyout
of a money-losing company once owned by R. R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons, the
Chicago printing firm, raised nearly $36.32 million in an initial
public offering Friday _ more than $20 million less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO ended Friday with the Lionbridge stock climbing 2 5/8
points points to close at 12 5/8 on the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Waltham, Mass., Lionbridge provides foreign language
versions of software publishers and computer hardware makers'
software, documentation, Internet support, and marketing
literature.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 447 people, sold 3.6 million shares
at $10 each. That total is below the company's original goal,
announced in June, when it hoped to raise as much as $57.5 million
by selling more than 4.2 million shares priced between $12 and $14
a share.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to lower the price and reduce the volume of shares
sold was due to ``the market of late being softer than the
underwriters had anticipated,'' said Steven Lifshatz, Lionbridge's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's concerns about higher interest rates, a widening
of the US trade deficit in June, and a weak dollar that has
heightened inflation worries, coupled with August market doldrums,
has led to an overall shaky market for IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Lifshatz said Lionbridge _ among three Massachusetts firms that
planned to lauch their IPOs this week _ waited until the last
minute, acknowledging that ``the later you get in August, the more
challenging it is.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast another Waltham company, SilverStream Software Inc.,
had a more successful IPO earlier this week, selling sell 3 million
shares at 16 each, exceeding the expected range of 13 to 15. It
raised $48 million before underwriting fees. On Tuesday, the first
day of trading, the young company's stock soared to more than 39 a
share before closing at 31 1/2. Since then the shares have slid
down, closing Friday at 24 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has shown strong growth and an impressive list of
large customers,'' said Paul Bard, an analyst at Renaissance
Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn. which runs a fund that invests in
IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said telecommunications equipment companies and
software developers focused on the Internet infrastructure fared
better this week. SilverStream provides software to integrate
on-line software for corporate computer networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Agile Software Corp. of San Jose, Calif., which helps
clients use the Internet to coordinate manufacturing processes,
rose 90 percent on its first day of trading Friday, closing at 39
7/8, up 18 7/8. Agile competes against Parametric Technology Corp.
of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And while Lionbridge and SilverStream launched their IPO, a
third firm, HarvardNet, which provides Internet access and data
communications services, postponed its Wall Street debut. The
Boston-based company is looking to raise $124 milion by selling 8.9
million shares initially priced at between 13 and 15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Lionbridge with a client list including IBM in France and Sun
Microsystems Inc. in China, was not alone in reducing its IPO share
price this week. On Thursday, New York-based LaBranche &AMP; Co., the
third largest floor trading firm operating in the New York Stock
Exchange, reduced its IPO to 14 a share, from 15 to 17 a share. The
result: the stock closed Thursday at 14 1/2 dipping on Friday to 14
1/16.

ARMSTRONG SIXTH IN VERMONT MOUNTAIN BIKE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DOVER, Vt. _ Lance Armstrong won the World Championship
Road Race in 1993, and he won the Tour de France earlier this
summer. So how did Friday's mountain bike race compare?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest two hours of bike racing,'' said Armstrong,
rubbing his cramped legs after the race.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Green, of Victoria, British Columbia, finished the
22.8-mile race first in 2 hour 12 minutes; while Travis Brown of
Boulder, Colo., came in 48 seconds behind to win the national
mountain bike championship. Brown also won the Chevy Trucks NORBA
(National Off-Road Bicycle Association) series of six races.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong was no slouch as he rode in second place for part
of the race and finished sixth, 3:27 behind Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for these guys,'' said Armstrong.
``Nothing in the Tour de France compares to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 82 riders kicked up a cloud of dust as they sped away from
the starting line on the dirt road at the base of the Mount Snow
ski area. Then, as chair lifts _ some empty, some filled with
mountain bikes, some filled with spectators _ went up and down the
mountain, the riders traversed the course on their 18- or 27-speed
bikes. The cyclists went over tree roots, stumps, and rocks on the
course that climbed almost 2,000 feet each lap, and averaged 11.4
miles per hour as they covered the 3.8-mile circuit six times.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 25, who notched his first win of the year, said he didn't
even know he was leading most of the way. Riders don't bunches up
but get strung out in a line as they battle the course more than
each other _ which is why Green was impressed with Armstrong's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fittest cyclist in the world can't just just come here and
win,'' Green said. ``You have to have the ability to handle a bike
on bumpy terrain, and I think it's a testament to just how
difficult the sport is.''
</P>
<P>
   He got no argument from Armstrong, who didn't excel in the
mountains Friday as he did in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought I would lose time on the downhills, but the
second half of the race I was losing time on the uphills,'' said
Armstrong, a 27-year-old native of Austin, Texas. ``I don't have
the fitness on a course like that, it's undulating and always up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who rides on the same Trek/Volkswagen team that sponsors
Armstrong, said he surged ahead of Armstrong on the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the lead and said, `Go T,' when I went past,'' Brown
said. ``I don't know if he was fading or did that on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably a little of both, since Armstrong said that ``the first
half was sort of fun, but the second half wasn't fun at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he didn't set a goal before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I had no specific objective,'' he said. ``I wanted to try
and finish, I wanted to start well and see how it went.''
</P>
<P>
   It went very well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Alison Dunlap, of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
won the women'a national championship and the Chevy Trucks series
championship in 1:45 over four laps of the 3.8-mile circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who won a gold medal in the mountain bike race at the
Pan Am Games earlier this month, divides her time between mountain
bike racing and road racing, and is hoping to go the Olympics next
year to compete in both categories. She was also cylco-cross
national champion for the past two years, including last year's win
at Devens, Mass.

   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ As the death toll from this
week's earthquake rises, relief workers and government officials in
Turkey say that their most urgent challenge now is preventing the
outbreak of epidemic diseases. The exact number of victims _ dead,
injured and still missing _ from the earthquake is impossible to
determine with precision in the chaos of a city and country
unprepared for such massive destruction. The official crisis center
announced that more than 10,000 bodies have been recovered so far,
and the number of injured has risen to 34,000. By Stephen Kinzer.

official word that three of the country's biggest banks will unite

agreement announced by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the Industrial

to ordinary citizens about the frustrations of city life, and sure
enough, he helps dozens of callers navigate city bureaucracy. But

   The U.N. Security Council has tripled the number of military
observers in Sierra Leone, to 210, and urged that the country move
quickly to begin putting a July 7 peace accord into effect. The
accord has been criticized because of the amnesty it grants to
rebel fighters responsible for the deaths and mutilation of
thousands of people. Peter Burleigh, the United States
representative on the council, said Washington is committed to
prosecuting war criminals, and views the accord as ``the best

   The U.N. Development Program in Islamabad said it had dismissed

ruled that the administrator ``created an intimidating, hostile and
offensive work environment.'' Dismissals on grounds of sexual
harassment have been rare in the U.N. system, in part because of
questions of cultural differences. The United Nations did not
identify the official, but employees familiar with the case said he
was a Pakistani.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Having bid occasionally tearful good-byes to
their loved ones, the 160 newcomers to the lakeside university
campus here pasted on their nametags and embarked on a two-day
introduction to college life.
</P>
<P>
   At times it was like boot camp, especially when a sergeant from
the university police, a 9mm pistol on his belt, informed them of
the first-time penalty for underage drinking: a $209 fine and a
90-day suspended driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   At other times it was like group therapy, as when a dean who
exuded all the comfort of a home-cooked meal, assured them that it
was painful to separate from those who had shared a roof with them
for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big leap from high school to the University of
Wisconsin, Madison,'' Sheila Spear, the dean of students, told
them, describing a campus of 40,000 inhabitants. ``It's like moving
from the farm leagues to the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But none in this crowd would be graduating with the class of
2003: they were all parents, and at the moment, it was their
transition, and their jitters, that were of utmost concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has been repeated hundreds of times on dozens of
campuses across the country this summer, administrators have been
gathering the parents of incoming freshmen to gird them for the
looking-glass journey on which they and their families are about to
embark.
</P>
<P>
   While orientations for the freshmen themselves, especially
Outward-Bound-style bonding missions set in the woods, have been
fixtures at colleges for more than a decade, the systematic
immersion of parents is a relatively recent development.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one has undertaken a precise tally, Cherry Callahan,
the former president of the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators, estimates that dozens, and likely
hundreds, of the nation's 2,200 four-year colleges have added or
substantially expanded parent orientation programs only in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose is plain: to enlist parents as coaches to prod their
students to greatness; to ply them with information about their
children's new lives, and to address the parents' own
roller-coaster emotions as they prepare to break away from their
companions of the last 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Bemidji State University, a school of 4,000 students in
northern Minnesota, parents are sent a homework assignment in
advance of their orientation: a 43-page script that instructs them
how to talk to their children about the odyssey at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time that you deem appropriate, approach your student
with the following questions,'' the manual advises, suggesting, as
an ice-breaker, ``What can I (we) do as a parent(s) to assist you
with the process of adjusting to college life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Alabama's orientation, parents of freshmen
are told to call a toll-free hotline installed just for them in the
dean's office. There, they can find a sympathetic voice _ someone
willing, if pressed hard enough, to track down a student to upbraid
him for not calling home as often as his mother would like.
</P>
<P>
   At MacAlester College in Saint Paul, Minn., the parent
orientation includes a component lifted from an elementary school
open house: before their students even take a test, the parents
spend a day running through their children's course schedule, which
entails sitting in their child's seat, meeting his professors and
listening to sample lectures.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like a grand scheme designed partly to coddle
baby boomers _ many of them raised on Dr. Spock, weaned from their
own parents on an analyst's couch and now confronted with the
daunting prospect of becoming college parents themselves _ then
that's hardly accidental, says Ms. Callahan, the associate vice
chancellor for student affairs at the University of North Carolina
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my parents never talked about their feelings very
much, particularly my father, before I went to college,'' said Ms.
Callahan, 50, who graduated from Greensboro in 1971. ``This is a
generation, the baby boomers, that is more open than their parents
were in talking with their children about life experience, social
issues and what may lie ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``They also want to know what they're getting for
their money.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wisconsin, almost all of the 5,700 incoming
freshmen had at least one parent accept the university's invitation
to spend two days on campus in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 160 parents in the last of 33 orientation groups, on
Aug. 10 and 11, said they paid the $40 parent orientation fee
because the university emphasized the program's value, because they
wanted a better understanding of what their children were going
through or because they were seeking ways to wrestle with their own
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes red from crying, Tama Schmidt, 38, who had dropped out
of college in 1981 to raise her daughter Taylor, described how she
had been readying herself for Taylor's expected departure for
Madison on Sept. 1: each night the two have been watching a
different ``weepy mother-daughter movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Schmidt had managed to get through ``Terms of
Endearment'' without choking up, she did not fare as well during
``Steel Magnolias.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour drive from New Richmond, Wis., to Madison had
offered little respite, with Mrs. Schmidt's mind replaying a
virtual highlight reel of her daughter's life, from birth to her
selection last year as ``Miss New Richmond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear,'' said Mrs. Schmidt, a purchasing agent, ``is
that she's not going to be under my roof every night of the week
and I'm not going to know what she's up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Woods, 57, an architect from Milwaukee, arrived at the

getting his daughter's thoroughbred _ she jumps competitively _

   ``We gave him food when he got here and he met another horse so
he was happy,'' Woods said. ``He probably has a bigger stall than
she has a room.''

   Woods said he grew mournful when he realized that, for the first
time in a decade, he and his daughter, Jennifer, 18, ``aren't going
to spend time in the barn together.'' But he said he was also
relishing the prospect of free time.

``Need I say more.''

   His daughter quickly interjected: ``I don't need to hear this.''

MADISON, Wis.: hear this.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   After dining with their daughters for the first session of the
orientation, Mrs. Schmidt and Woods were then separated from their
children for the balance of the program. While the students picked
their courses with their academic advisers, their parents were
sequestered across campus, their every concern addressed in
lectures and question-and-answer forums that went far deeper, in
time and substance, than the more social parent visiting weekends
that universities have hosted for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were reminded, yet again, how much lighter their
wallets would be: the average cost of tuition and room-and-board
would be $8,987.70 for state residents, and $18,301.70 for others,
with checks due Oct. 1. They were told, to their surprise, that
that price included sheets, blankets and pillowcases, to be
laundered by the university each week if the students desired. (The
parents certainly liked the idea of guaranteed clean linens.)
</P>
<P>
   And they were warned that, should their children require
hospitalization, there would likely be gaps between the basic
medical coverage provided by the university and their own policies,
many of which cover college-age children. (A hypothetical anecdote
about a freshman breaking an arm after her bike got caught in
railroad tracks caused shudders.)
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker who seemed to draw out the most anxieties was
Sgt. Kurt Feavel, of the University of Wisconsin Police, who
assured the audience that his employer was ``the real police,''
with full jurisdiction over the campus, including the authority to
arrest students on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date-rape drug, is it a problem,'' one parent asked, via
an index card submitted from the audience, about a substance that,
when dropped in alcohol, can make someone faint, and ultimately
forgetful. The sergeant responded that ``we fortunately don't have
that problem,'' adding that there had been only three suspected
instances of the drug's use on campus in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Another card demanded, ``Is it dangerous for women to walk alone
on campus at night?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Feavel assured that ``we're fortunate we don't have a lot
of assaults on campus.'' Yet he directed the parents toward a
poster advertising a self-defense program in which ``your daughter
will learn verbal, physical and psychological techniques to protect
and defend herself on and off campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the father of the equestrian, said the brochure had
convinced him to enroll his daughter because, ``if she's really
backed up against a wall,'' she needs the ability to ``strike out
if she has to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Schmidt, the teary movie-watcher who had despaired over
not knowing her daughter's every coming and going during the
upcoming fall, the entire seminar had proven as spiritual as it was
informative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel better,'' she said. ``You go home feeling a little
more educated about what's going to happen in the next couple of
weeks.''

 &HT;    Norwood puts patients over party in push to pass bill
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just before leaving town earlier this month, Rep.
Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.) unveiled the latest incarnation of his
legislation that would overhaul the nation's managed health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   This time, no amount of pressure from Republican leaders could
stop the former dentist. This time, Norwood, a consistently
conservative voter, was willing to work with top Democrats in
defiance of his own party's leaders to bring his managed care bill
to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would place most politicians in a precarious
political spot. Defying the wishes of party leaders usually comes
at a price. Bills without the leadership's blessing tend to die
before they reach the House floor. And the lawmaker's actions are
often remembered when it comes time to divvy up the federal budget
for local roads, bridges and schools.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that appears to influence Norwood's decision making
_ at least on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather pass this bill than be a congressman any day of the
week,'' said Norwood. ``I guess I have to say I am more interested
in patients than I am in party.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind such bravado is the reality that the Republicans control
the House by only a five-vote margin. With a contentious
congressional election approaching next year, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.) cannot afford to risk losing an otherwise loyal
Republican soldier like Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they could do is defeat me and then get someone
who would vote for Gephardt for speaker. Why should you want to do
that?'' said Norwood, referring to Democratic Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who has launched a fierce campaign to win
the House back in next fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   And behind Norwood's tough talk is the reality that the
Democrats in his 10th District want to overhaul managed health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realizes that the 10th District is largely
Democratic and he's listening to what his constituents want in the
district,'' said Ron Schoeffler, chairman of the Richmond County
Democratic Party. ``If he had gone with the Republican leadership,
he would have a tough election next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill that Norwood and Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), the
ranking Democrat of the Commerce Committee, drafted encompasses
most of what Norwood first proposed in 1995, then in 1997 and again
this year.
</P>
<P>
   It would allow patients to choose their own doctors, create an
external appeals process and allow patients to sue their health
plans in state courts. In addition, it increases access to
emergency rooms and it gives women and children the right to see
gynecologists and pediatricians, respectively, without a referral
from a primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial issue is allowing patients the right to
sue their health plans. Republican leaders are opposed to the
measure, saying it would increase insurance premiums and strip
millions of Americans of their health coverage. Business groups
such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and insurance companies are
trying to defeat the proposal when Congress returns next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is built on the erroneous premise that trial
lawyers are the sole guardians of good medical care,'' said Karen
Ignagni, president and chief executive officer of the American
Association of Health Plans, a Washington-based organization that
represents more than 1,000 managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   To support the claim that premiums would increase, Ignagni cites
a study by the Virginia-based Lewin Group that found that a 1
percent increase in premiums would cause 300,000 individuals to
lose their health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, patients can sue in federal court only for
the cost of treatment and legal expenses, but not for punitive
damages. The law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, created obstacles for patients to file lawsuits, in part,
because Congress wanted employers to create health insurance plans
without being exposed to costly lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Republican leaders face an uphill battle to
defeat the the Norwood-Dingell measure. With support from 21
Republicans, including Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), and the conservative
branch of the Democratic Party, it would appear that Norwood and
Dingell have the votes to pass their bill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also appears poised to sign the legislation if
it passes the Senate. The Senate passed a limited managed care bill
in July, but it does not include the right to sue health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican leaders need to stop fighting bipartisan progress
and let managed care reform move forward,'' Clinton said at a
recent Democratic event on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other leaders have tried to bring Norwood back
inside their tent, but he won't budge. At this point, he is
frustrated with the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, every time I get the ball to the 10-yard line,
the leadership moves the goal post. ... I'm through with that,''
Norwood said. ``I don't mind getting beat. I'm a big boy. If you
get beat, you get beat. But I do believe in a fair fight and it
hasn't been a fair fight.''
</P>
<P>
   For every word against Norwood's bill from the business
community, doctors and medical professionals have words of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Norwood is popular because he puts his patients
first,'' said Dr. James Davis, a radiologist at the University
Hospital in Augusta and the Columbia Augusta Regional Hospital.
``This isn't popular with the Republican leadership, but it's
popular with the people in the district both Democratic and
Republican.''

FEARS OF EPIDEMIC MOUNT AT CHAOTIC TURKISH EARTHQUAKE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TURKEY-TOWN, TURKEY-LEARN) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With the death toll from this week's
earthquake projected to soar into the tens of thousands and the
huge dislocation of people showing no sign of ending, relief
workers and government officials turned Friday to the challenge of
preventing the outbreak of disease.
</P>
<P>
   In many towns in the earthquake zone, the stench of decomposing
bodies has become thick and almost unbearable in the damp summer
heat. Medical supplies are scarce, and running water is unavailable
in most of the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of victims _ dead, injured and missing _ is
impossible to determine with precision in the chaos of a city and
country unprepared for such destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The official crisis center announced Friday night that more than
10,000 bodies had been recovered so far, and that the number of
injured had risen to 34,000. Anyone still alive among the many,
many thousands more still missing were at grave risk if they were
not found and rescued soon.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to gain control over the disorder, and under heavy
criticism both for the extent of the damage to poorly constructed
buildings and the government's disjointed response, Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit ordered that the dead be buried as soon as they are
found. He said the bodies should be photographed so that relatives
could identify them later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of
epidemic,'' Ecevit, dressed in black, said Friday. He described the
earthquake as ``one of the worst in human history and the heaviest
in Turkish history.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, relief agencies, journalists and others
were left to try to divine the overall human cost from outward
signs, like an aerial survey of Istanbul that produced a rough
estimate of the populations of the demolished areas.
</P>
<P>
   But after estimates that had spoken of many thousands injured,
the predictions Friday jumped to tens of thousands. Government
officials have asked the United Nations for 10,000 body bags. And a
U.N. official said the death toll could reach 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimated 35,000 people are under the rubble,'' the
official, Sergio Piazzi, told reporters in Geneva. ``This is from
the Turkish authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically one-third of the Turkish population lived in the
area affected by the earthquake,'' Piazzi said. ``I can only add
that in the Golcuk area alone, 10,000 people are expected to be
under the rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazzi, who heads the European desk of the U.N. Office for
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that some of those
buried could survive until Monday or Tuesday, but that he feared
that most were beyond hope. Asked if the death toll could reach
40,000, he replied, ``It is a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was among the
hardest hit, city officials issued an urgent appeal for portable
toilets as a way of lessening the risk of disease as hordes of
residents continued to camp outdoors. Relief workers there and in
other towns said they had treated cases of dysentery, diarrhea and
gastroenteritis, but that there had been no reports of cholera, a
far more serious disease that sometimes breaks out under these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important now is that the bodies be recovered from
underneath the ruins so that microbes from the corpses do not
spread,'' said Senol Ergunsay, a doctor in Golcuk.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement Friday by the World Health
Organization, though, while unsanitary conditions can spawn
disease, the bodies of the earthquake victims themselves do not
present a significant health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Muslim clerics have ruled that under the current extreme
circumstances, Islamic burial customs need not be followed. They
said that bodies could be buried in a single shroud instead of
three, that the bodies could be washed with sand if no water was
available, and that men and women could be buried together.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 2,000 foreign relief specialists who have arrived
here since Tuesday continued to take the lead in rescue operations,
and public anger toward the government remained intense. Newspapers
carried banner headlines like ``Total Fiasco'' and ``We Died
Twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the earthquake zone said they had still not seen
any Turkish relief workers. They are relying on untrained
volunteers and hoping that foreigners will show up to direct them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rescue operation has been very slow, I must admit,'' Sukru
Gurel, a Cabinet minister who is helping to coordinate the effort,
said at a news briefing. ``But in that region, we are talking about
tens of thousands of buildings wrecked. To move quickly, we need
tens of thousands of rescue teams, which no government in the world
can mobilize.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked how high he thought the death toll might reach, Gurel
replied: ``We are afraid it could be beyond our initial estimates.
The magnitude of this tragedy is beyond imagination, because such
an event only happens once every 200 or 300 years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to historians, major quakes have shaken the Istanbul
region more frequently than that. Their accounts say that in the
last 5,000 years, there has been such a quake about once every 175
years. Istanbul is now home to 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area where this recent quake was centered will not be hit
again any time soon, because the seismic pressure there has
dissipated,'' said Ahmet Cakmak, a professor of engineering at
Princeton University who is an expert on Turkish seismology. ``But
the fault that runs closer to Istanbul is still very dangerous, and
a major quake here is very likely. ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's plenty of time to prepare for that quake,
but usually the memory of devastation lasts five years at most, and
then people go back to building and living as they did before. The
newspapers are saying we survived the big earthquake, but that's
silly. It's a big mistake. What we should do is learn from this
one, expect a bigger one and be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earthquake zone, more victims were rescued Friday, most
of them by foreign relief teams. Israeli soldiers working in the
village of Cinarcik, where several Israeli tourists are missing,
pulled an 11-year-old Turkish girl from the rubble after working
for 17 hours to reach her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising that she managed to survive,'' said an
Israeli doctor who worked alongside the soldiers. ``During the long
hours while we rescued her, we managed to teach her a few words in
Hebrew, and we built a lot of trust.''

PATRIOTS MAKE LAW HIGHEST BONUS PLAYER IN TEAM HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The previous two times the Patriots paid huge
signing bonuses, they received little for their money. Since
receiving their $8 million bonuses, both defensive end Willie
McGinest and linebacker Ted Johnson have wound up missing
significant time due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can ill afford one more curse of the signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they took that plunge Friday with Ty Law, agreeing to a
seven-year, $50 million deal that includes a $14.2 million signing
bonus, the highest ever paid to a Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the eve of the Patriots' exhibition game against the
Dallas Cowboys and their extravagant owner, Jerry Jones, who has
certainly been a pioneer in signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The deal surpasses Drew Bledsoe's 1995 contract of $42 million
over seven years, which included an $11 million signing bonus.
Bledsoe, who will likely have his deal renegotiated in the next
year, eventually will surpass Law. For now, though, Law and his
agents, Carl and Kevin Poston, consider him the second-highest-paid
cornerback behind Dallas's Deion Sanders, whose deal averages $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the job that goes on between us and agents is figuring
out what the other deals are. Sometimes there are deals and
sometimes there are smoke and mirrors. The good news for Ty is that
this is a real deal,'' said Patriots vice president Andy Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   Law's deal is made up of what both sides call ``real money,''
meaning most of it is achievable. About $4 million spread out over
the life of the contract is tied in to making the Super Bowl and
the Pro Bowl, but at least $46 million is money that Law could earn
just by playing.
</P>
<P>
   NFL deals are structured so that a player gets a great deal of
money at the beginning and at the end, when the contract can
usually either be restructured or the player is released. Most NFL
contracts are not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh year of the deal _ in 2006 _ is worth about $10.3
million. By signing Law, the Patriots will save about $600,000 in
salary cap money. Law's cap figure for 1999 was $3 million. That
will be reduced to $2.4 by restructuring the deal and factoring in
a minimum salary of $400,000 for '99 and the $14.2 million signing
bonus. The cap figure will escalate yearly. The middle five years
are worth about $5 million apiece to Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest contract in Patriots history. It's a special
contract, but we think we have a real special player,'' said
Wasynczuk.

   Law made the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career last
season, intercepting seven passes and showing dominance against the
opposing teams' top receivers. He also got national attention when
he picked off a pass and ran 67 yards for a touchdown in the Pro
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Law thanked Pete Carroll for being the first coach to allow him
to ``be the player that I have always wanted to be. I would like to
thank you.'' He also said his agents were ``like fathers to me,''
and he thanked owner Robert Kraft and familty, vowing, ``I will put
everything I have into this thing. I'm so happy that it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said during negotiations that he wanted to make sure Lawyer
Milloy would remain a teammate over the length of the contract. No
such assurances were given to Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around here wants Lawyer to sign, and I'm definitely
going to put up a big campaign for myself. We have to go out there
and do our jobs. The best negotiation I can do for Lawyer and
Lawyer to do for himself is to go out there and win a championship
together,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk acknowledged that Milloy would be the next big
negotiation for the Patriots, with Bledsoe's extension an ongoing
issue. Bledsoe has one of the biggest cap numbers in the NFL at
$7.2 million this season, while his actual salary is $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to work hard with Lawyer's situation,'' said
Wasynczuk. ``Ray Anderson (Milloy's agent) and I have got to the
point where we thought it might be good to take a break and we'll
revisit it at the end of the year. It may be sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk pointed out that the signing bonus was ``the Kraft
family stepping up and subsidizing the operation.'' He said that
some of the big signing bonuses handed out recently have not come
out of team revenue but out of Bob Kraft's pockets. Kraft had a
personal meeting with Law three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Law was angry when Willie Clay was released, but he said: ``It
didn't take long at all (to get over Clay leaving the team). You
also have to keep in mind that this is a business and things
happen. It is all about winning. My job is to go out there and
play. The reaction I had with Lawyer and a couple of other guys who
were so close, it's hard not to get that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postons have certainly found a money stream. Along with the
Law deal, they also recently negotiated an $86 million contract for
Penny Hardaway with the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an easy deal for us in terms of Ty being such a great
person and a great player that who he is and what he does speaks
for itself,'' said Carl Poston, who announced that Law would be
starting a charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Law said the money won't change his work ethic; the past two
years, he's punished himself under legendary track coach Bob
Kersee's conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play for the money,'' said Law. ``I play to earn
respect, to compete against myself and opposing players. I come
from a small town and I was already financially secure. That didn't
change my drive. This gives me more financial stability, but I
still have to go out there and do what I have to do to earn respect
throughout the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say `cornerback,' you say `Deion Sanders.' I would
say `Deion Sanders,' but I'm working to get there. When I retire,
five years later, I want to get to the Hall of Fame. I can't rest
with one Pro Bowl and a multimillion dollar contract. The time I
rest is when I walk away from the game.''

SIGEL'S BACK NINE PROPELS HIM AHEAD OF THE SENIOR PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ He toured the first nine holes of the verdant
6,773-yard layout at Nashawtuc CC at even-par 36. Nothing
spectacular. Just steady golf. However, Jay Sigel's back nine
proved to be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   It was there the 55-year-old Senior PGA Tour member gathered
himself for a strong finishing kick, carding five birdies _
including three in a row on Nos. 12, 13 and 14 _ for a 5-under 67
and a two-shot lead over a pack of eight tied at 69 after Friday's
first round of the BankBoston Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Christy O'Connor, winner of last week's Foremost Insurance
Championship in Ada, Mich.; Hale Irwin, the two-time defending
champion of the BankBoston Classic and Senior Tour's second-leading
money winner; and Tom McGinnis, who recorded the only eagle of the
day with a 6-iron from 170 yards out on the par-4, 423-yard 11th
hole, were among the eight golfers tied at 3-under.
</P>
<P>
   Eight more players, including Dana Quigley of Rehoboth, were
tied at 70, meaning 16 golfers were within three strokes of Sigel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My round was scratchy starting out,'' said Sigel, who last
year shot a final-round 66 but wound up two strokes behind eventual
winner Irwin with a 54-hole total of 13-under 203. ``Making the
birdie on (No.) 10 from the bunker really put me in a positive
frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it did.
</P>
<P>
   After he found the bunker with his second shot on the par-5,
538-yard dogleg right, Sigel rallied when he blasted out to within
6 feet for his first birdie of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed my whole day,'' Sigel said. ``I had a very hard
shot. I was pleased I got it in the vicinity and to make birdie was
a real bonus. It was definitely the shot of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   After jump-starting his round with a birdie on the 10th, Sigel
followed with consecutive birdies on the par-4, 411-yard 12th (with
a wedge to within 4 feet), the par-3, 203-yard 13th (a 3-iron
within 12 feet), and the par-4, 367-yard 14th (an 8-iron to within
18 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Sigel closed out his round with a birdie 4 on No. 18, a par 5,
511-yarder, nestling a pitching wedge to within 6 feet after
hitting back-to-back 3-irons. Sigel's round (36-31-67) matched his
season best, which came when he gained a share of the lead with
Kermit Zarley and Bob Dickson in the opening round of the Home
Depot Invitational April 23 at Charlotte, N.C., which,
coincidentally, was the last time he led a senior event. He wound
up winning $31,200 after finishing tied for ninth.
</P>
<P>
   A two-time winner last year at the Bell Atlantic Classic and the
EMC(Squared) Kaanapali Classic, Sigel entered this weekend's event
ranked No. 45 on the money list with $261,922 after making 20 of 21
cuts. In his last 10 Senior Tour events, Sigel has recorded only
two Top 10 finishes: a tie for ninth at the NFL Cadillac Classic
June 6, and a tie for 10th at the Coldwell Banker Burnet Classic
July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a strange year,'' said Sigel, who is still
remembered around these parts for his victory in the 1982 US
Amateur at The Country Club in Brookline, where he captured the
first of back-to-back crowns. ``I haven't done anything all that
bad. I just haven't done anything. It's hard to be patient. I just
haven't gotten the results. I'm delighted with this round and
hopefully I can build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who will attempt to join Chi Chi Rodriguez (1986-88) as
the only three-time winners of the Senior Tour's Boston stop, is
hoping to do the same after he finished at 3-under (35-34). Irwin,
a winner of three of the last five Senior events and five times in
all this season, had five birdies (on Nos. 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18)
offset by bogeys on No. 9 and 16 to wind up 3 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ever object to 3-under par,'' Irwin said. ``It's a
good start, but I won't say it was a `great' start. I made a few
too many mistakes out there and had too many short irons, 30-35
feet from the hole. I wasn't as mentally efficient as I tend to be
or as I want to be. Because of that, my game was not quite where I
want it to be. But then again I'm not complaining about 69. It's a
good round, but sort of an indifferent round.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for Sigel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through valleys before as an amateur, but they
haven't lasted that long,'' said Sigel. ``Perhaps I've played too
much over the last few years. I played conservative off most of the
tees on the front, and hit six drivers total all day. I probably
won't play it any differently the rest of the tournament.''

BRADLEY'S WIFE HAS DUAL CAMPAIGN MESSAGE: BREAST CANCER, POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ It's quite a leap from Nazi Germany to the
White House, but for Ernestine Bradley it is just one more step
toward the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the world wants to come to this country, so I don't
feel that I was a great exception,'' said the wife of Democratic
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley. ``It is in a sense the country
of the future, the country of so many opportunities. When I came in
'57, it seemed to me the one open country, open in the sense of
being receptive, flexible, and I wanted to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley's father served in the German air force, or
Luftwaffe, during World War II, primarily in France, but the
candidate's wife said that as a young girl she was too ``wrapped up
in my child's life'' to give much thought to Hitler and the Third
Reich. As an adult, however, Bradley, a professor of German and
comparative literature, has written extensively about the Nazi
reign. Her most recent book, ``The Language of Silence: West German
Literature and the Holocaust,'' was published in March.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who married the cerebral basketball star and later U.S.
senator from New Jersey in 1974, brought her husband's campaign for
the presidency and her campaign against breast cancer to upstate
New York on Friday. She found receptive audiences for both.
</P>
<P>
   In Schenectady, she met with other breast cancer survivors and
advocates at the Schenectady YWCA, where Bellevue Woman's Hospital
featured its mobile mammography van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancer is really something that can be nipped,
something you do not have to die of,'' Bradley said in Schenectady.
Bradley discovered in 1992 that she had breast cancer, and
subsequently underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am living proof _ living proof _ that you can survive,'' she
said. ``I find that life after cancer is a much more intense life,
much more precious. I have found my values, or I should say I have
found the courage to insist on my values more than I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   After enduring surgery and radiation _ and losing her hair _
Bradley said she emerged a ``much stronger person.'' At 63, she is
eight years older than her husband. The underdog campaign of Bill
Bradley is, according to polls, seemingly gaining momentum, and New
York could be pivotal if the former New York Knicks guard and
Rhodes scholar from Princeton is to overtake Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Democrat, has not yet endorsed either,
but said he's always been impressed with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a good academic grasp of the issues,'' Tonko
said. ``We live in a complex world, and the academic skills he has
are a valuable asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady County Democratic Chairman Chris Gardner said he's
been in Bradley's corner ever since the then-senator came to the
Electric City in 1993 to support Barry Kramer's bid for a Surrogate
Court judgeship. Kramer _ now Judge Kramer _ and Bradley had been
roommates during the 1964 Olympic basketball trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It impressed me that 29 years later the senator was driving
several hundred miles to help out a friend,'' Gardner said. ``You
wouldn't have too many senators who would drive a 10-year-old car
700 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said Bradley is the better presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are huge differences in policy between
Bill Bradley and Al Gore,'' Gardner said. ``I think it's more a
matter of leadership style, and I think Bill Bradley will get us
away from focus-group, poll-driven politics. ... He knows what he
believes in, knows what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley, who first came to this country as a Pan Am
stewardess and had never seen a basketball game until meeting her
future husband, declined to compare the Democratic presidential
contenders. But she implied _ as did Gardner _ that the former
three-term senator would offer more than the finger-to-the-wind,
sound-bite policymaking for which the Clinton administration, and
by extension Gore, have been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has been a good politician for 18 years,'' she said. ``He
has worked very hard and tackled issues that are normally
considered either dangerous _ like tax reform, where you don't
really gain much support _ or volatile, like race relations. ... He
really does feel that the president is the one person who would be
able not to be guided by focus groups or polls, but guided by his
understanding of where the country should be going. ... We need the
kind of leadership that transcends the political.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, maintains a comfortable lead and has already
secured the backing of many Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the party leadership, or a good portion of it, is
already committed to Gore,'' said Harold Joyce, former chairman of
the Albany County Democratic Committee.

COUSY ON THE WAY OUT AS CELTICS BROADCASTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His has been the voice of reason for the last 25 years, and now,
apparently, the people at Fox Sports New England are trying to
quiet it. The Boston Celtics without Bob Cousy on the telecast?
That's the talk at the cable outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has given the Celtics a bundle of money to televise all
their games, paying much more than it should have for the rights to
such a poor team. But now the word is that it is trying to dump
Cousy, which would be a monumental mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I would like to say at this point,'' offered Fox vice
president David Woodman, ``is that we want Bob Cousy. We are still
talking with Bob Cousy. All of this (purchasing the rights to all
Boston TV games) happened fast, so we still have some thinking to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still wouldn't say if Cousy would remain an analyst. In
recent years, Cousy has done the Celtics road games. He's the voice
of reason. If the Celtics are looking good, he says they are good.
If they are bad, he says that as well. He has terrific insights, is
always well prepared, and is a great balance to Tom Heinsohn, who
is biased toward the Celtics and against the officials.
</P>
<P>
   To spend all that money and not keep Cousy where he is best
suited would be stupid. There is no other word for it.

   After some boorish behavior by fans at the PGA Championship in
the Chicago suburbs last week, the people who will be running the
Ryder Cup show at The Country Club in Brookline are going to be
very sensitive to bad behavior on their grounds when the great
international event takes place there next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to tolerate what we feel is improprer
behavior by any fan,'' says John Cornish, who is in charge of
running the Ryder Cup from The Country Club. ``Every fan entering
the club will be given a program. In that program is a message from
both team captains asking for the fans to cooperate. The fans will
be asked to applaud good shots by both sides, not cheer bad shots
by anyone, and not to be offensive toward players on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cornish, ``Six years ago in Kiawah (Island, S.C.), there
was some bad behavior by US fans toward the European players, and
we don't want a repeat of that here. Our marshals will be on the
lookout for any problems, and if there are any, we will deal with
them accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan behavior has been growing more troublesome at major events,
says Len Zaichowsky, professor of sports psychology at Boston
University and one of the country's top experts in fan behavior.
``I think one of the major reasons for it is that the fans are
paying more for tickets and feel they have a bigger investment,''
he said. ``If you pay $75 for a seat, then you probably feel you
have a right to get angry when some athlete who is making millions
of dollars does not perform up to expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money issue is a big factor on both sides. The athletes
who get the multimillion-dollar contracts often act like they have
a sense of entitlement, that they are above it all no matter what
they do, and that they shouldn't criticized. Then the prices are so
high now for tickets and everything else that goes with attending a
game _ parking, concessions _ that the fan feel he is entitled to
vent his feelings when he doesn't think he is getting what he paid
for.''

   The unrelenting pressure of his two-month court battle in the
Reggie Lewis case hasn't stopped Dr. Gilbert Mudge from moving on
with the rest of his life. We are told that in a 10-day period,
Mudge, who is chief of the cardiac transplant unit at Brigham &AMP;
Women's Hospital, oversaw five successful heart transplants, a rare
occurrence. Meanwhile, there is no settlement on the horizon in the
Lewis case. Mudge's lawyers are getting ready to go back to trial
with Donna Harris Lewis, his widow. A Suffolk County jury would not
convict Mudge of malpractice in the first trial, so Harris Lewis
says she is going to try again. In addition, the Equitable
Insurance Company is moving close to a decision on whether to take
legal action against the Celtics in trying to reclaim $5 million
paid out to the team in life insurance when Lewis died, if it deems
Lewis did not tell the truth in filling out answers on the
applications in regard to using drugs and being tested for drugs .
. . Jerry Jacobs, owner of the FleetCenter and the Bruins, has
decided to wait no longer to find a development partner. Jacobs now
plans to build a hotel, office building, and condominiums on the
site of the old Boston Garden, on the Causeway Street side of the
FleetCenter. The present plans call for three 30-floor towers on a
space now being as a parking lot.

   The Minnesota Vikings must not have done their customary
diligent homework when it came to drafting defensive lineman
Dimitrius Underwood in the first round. Underwood's coaches at
Michigan State told NFL scouts before the draft that he really
didn't have his heart in playing football. So it was not a big
surprise to many teams when he told the Vikings he had discovered
God and didn't want to play any longer . . . Speaking of lack of
homework, one local pro team recently signed a free agent with a
dubious past. When this guy was leaving one team, he sold a
teammate a $10,000 Rolex watch that turned out to be a phony. When
he left another team, he sold a teammate a top-shelf sports car for
$20,000. Turned out he simply was leasing it . . . Clark Booth told
this story about Tom Johnson at his retirement luncheon this past
week at the FleetCenter. When Johnson was playing for the Bruins,
his career was ended by a vicious cheap shot from Chicago forward
Chico Maki, who kicked Johnson in the back of the leg with his
skate blade, severing his Achilles' tendon. Unable to play again,
Johnson went on to coach the Bruins to a Stanley Cup in 1972 and
work in the front office until retiring this year. Booth went back
to Johnson a year ago while writing a book on the history of the
club, and Johnson still refused to talk about the incident, saying
it was nothing important. As Booth pointed out, hockey players are
a different breed, accepting the most difficult aspects of their
rugged sport without complaint. Let's hope they stay that way.

   If you want Ryder Cup tickets, the smart way to get them is to
buy into the deal Mayor Menino has set up. Menino is using Woolf
Associates to sell Ryder Cup packages combined with a golf tourney
that week at Franklin Park. Rather than deal with a scalper, you
would be better off with the Menino deal, through which you can get
a writeoff for a charitable contribution, play in the tourney, and
still pay less than with a scalper. The money goes to junior golf
in the city. Bobby Orr and Gale Sayers are co-chairmen of the
tourney . . . The coaches at Boston College are hoping that
freshman running back William Green of Atlantic City, N.J., is as
good as he has looked to date. Green, a 6-foot-2-inch, 220-pound
tailback, was highly recruited by top schools around the country.
He is currently with the third team . . . The Patriots didn't do
well in the Sporting News's Top 100 players of all-time. John
Hannah grabbed 20th, and Mike Haynes, who played half his career in
Oakland, was 93d. None of the other local lads got a sniff,
although Roger Staubach said that Raymond Clayborn was the
second-toughest cornerback he ever tried to throw against, and Mack
Herron made a couple of personal lists as being one of the toughest
players to tackle in the open field.

<P>
   Barely a year after a worldwide deflation scare _ when markets
and currencies were crashing, banks and businesses in Asia, Russia
and Latin America were failing, and prices of oil and raw materials
were plunging _ inflation is back on peoples' minds.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, fretting about inflation when every major
price gauge in the United States is rising just 2 percent or so a
year seems a little like Uma Thurman obsessing over her weight. But
what concerns Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and
Wall Street investors is the nagging suspicion that the stellar
inflation record of the last two years was mostly the product of a
few lucky, highly transitory breaks _ and therefore won't last.
That suspicion is likely to propel the Fed's policy-making
committee toward another interest-rate increase when it meets on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the budding recovery in Asia and Europe has already
blunted some of the forces that have helped push U.S. inflation
down from 4 percent to 2 percent a year since 1997. Energy prices _
indeed, most commodity prices other than farm products _ are
already rebounding sharply after collapsing last year. And the
high-flying dollar, which helped to make imports cheaper, has
recently weakened against the euro and the yen as global investors
have begun to shift some of their mutual fund money away from the
United States to foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds dire, right? Actually, there are solid reasons for
thinking that a return to the bad old days, when upwardly spiraling
prices seemed as inevitable as the sunrise, is highly unlikely. For
one thing, some of those ``transitory'' factors are likely to
persist for quite a while longer. For another, popular expectations
about inflation _ low inflation, this time _ readily become
self-fulfilling prophecies. And a host of structural and policy
changes over the last couple of decades have made the U.S. economy
less inherently prone to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptics now say that the low inflation of the 1990s is not
just a fluke, but rather a return to a norm that prevailed for a
quarter-century, beginning in the late 1940s _ years when 4 percent
inflation seemed scandalously high. As Alan S. Blinder, an
economist at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the
Federal Reserve, said recently, ``To a substantial extent, we're
back to the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University, until recently a member
of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said of mainstream
economists: ``A lot of us were real stick-in-the-muds. We said:
`No, no, no. Here are the equations.' But other people who knew
less about equations had the sense to realize that things are a bit
different.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, not all the good luck is evaporating. True, energy
prices have jumped 24 percent since the beginning of the year. But
energy wasn't a big factor in inflation's decline _ the economy
uses a lot less energy than it did in, say, 1973 _ and this year's
price increase isn't anything like the surges in 1973 or 1990. Most
of the impact has already filtered through to consumer prices for
gasoline, electricity, heating oil and air fares, adding at most a
few tenths of a percentage point to the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's recent dip and the ballooning trade deficit have
some economists, notably Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, warning of the possibility of a currency
crisis. If the dollar were to take a big dive, that would indeed
threaten to push inflation up sharply. But it would also provoke a
sharp reaction from the Fed. And the dollar is still slightly
stronger on a trade-weighted basis (that is, against a basket of
currencies of America's trading partners) than it was at the start
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, import prices, by far the biggest recent drag
on inflation, are apt to remain under downward pressure. Their
decline, it turns out, was due less to the strong dollar than to
vast excess productive capacity in Asia, Latin America and
elsewhere _ an excess that will not be mopped up soon, given the
gradual pace of world recovery. ``It's not just the dollar, but
economic incentives to increase production abroad,'' said Robert J.
Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, health care costs have stopped skyrocketing and
show few signs of resuming that course, despite increases over the
last year in the fees that health maintenance organizations charge
employers. Though the latest readings show consumer prices for
medical care rising a bit faster than a year ago, few experts
expect the pace to accelerate to twice the overall inflation rate,
as it did in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even temporary lulls in inflation can have
long-term effects, by changing expectations. Americans who believed
two decades ago that inflation would always rise are now expecting
it to remain low. According to the monthly University of Michigan
survey of consumer expectations, ordinary Americans expect the
inflation rate a year from now to be under 3 percent. (The Federal
Reserve forecasts 2.5 percent or less.) ``You get this extra
impact,'' Gordon said. ``The biggest factor holding down inflation
in the next couple of years is the lower inflation of the past
couple.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the strongest reasons for optimism are sweeping
changes in the economy that have been in the works for years.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the bad old 1970s, temporary supply shocks tended to
produce higher inflation automatically. Since then, some long-term
trends _ globalization, deregulation, the computer revolution _
have made the economy less susceptible to bottlenecks and
wage-price spirals. ``One story is that we are permanently able to
run the economy hotter and labor markets tighter,'' Krugman said,
``because we have a more flexible labor market, and monopoly and
union power have been curbed by international competition.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider deregulation, which began during the Carter
administration and has since radically transformed broad swaths of
the sprawling service sector, including airlines, energy, banking,
railroads, telecommunications and, most recently, electricity. More
competition helps rein in inflation directly, and a new wealth of
alternatives keeps strikes or other disruptions from creating
bottlenecks. (Remember what life was like before faxes, cell phones
and e-mail?) ``They all kind of connect the economy together,''
Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the computer revolution. Information technology
helps companies do everything they do _ notably, managing inventory
_ more flexibly and efficiently. But innovation is also driving
down computer prices, and rapidly enough to take half a percentage
point off the overall inflation rate, according to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   More prosaic changes in the way the American labor market works
may be as important as globalization. Alan B. Krueger of Princeton
University and Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard recently published a
study suggesting that a host of small, incremental changes _
including the decline of unions, the growing role of temporary-help
firms, even welfare reform _ have made the labor market more
efficient. That may be why an unemployment rate below the
prevailing average of the 1950s and 1960s has yet to set off
bidding wars among employers.
</P>
<P>
   And though the labor market may be tight, American business is
still operating with a lot of spare capacity, the product of an
investment boom spurred by lower interest rates and a rush to
embrace technology. Utilization rates remain relatively low even
after eight years of economic expansion _ one reason that companies
find it hard to raise prices. ``That could explain why inflation is
lower than you'd think just looking at unemployment,'' Frankel
said.
</P>
<P>
   That investment boom has had another powerful anti-inflation
effect. Productivity has been growing at around 2 percent a year,
double the rate that prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s. Greater
efficiency, in turn, has made it possible for employers to increase
compensation at a higher pace than the inflation rate without
adding much to their costs. ``We've had an acceleration of
productivity growth, and it takes a while before people build that
expectation into wages,'' Krugman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the most open, flexible, productive economy can
suffer inflation. Inflation, as Milton Friedman, the Nobel
Prize-winning economist, has said, is ultimately a monetary
phenomenon, and is therefore determined by policy makers in
Washington, most notably the Fed. Recall how the low-inflation
post-war era ended: tax cuts and guns-and-butter spending under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and an accommodating central bank
let the inflation genie out of the bottle even before the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quadrupled oil prices
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the genie back in the bottle cost the nation a couple of
nasty recessions and years of high unemployment and lost output.
Today, the memory of the high human and political costs of wringing
inflation out of the system helps keep inflation at bay, much as
memories of the Great Depression have kept deflation at bay. Three
times in 10 years, Alan Greenspan has struck pre-emptively with
interest-rate increases to ward off any acceleration before it
could even begin, in 1989, 1994 and now _ strikes that so far, at
least, seem to have served the economy well.

TURKEY URGED TO SHIFT EFFORT TO HELPING QUAKE SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IZMIT, Turkey _ From the streets to government offices,
earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded
with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead
and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of
thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are overwhelmed and now they are completely concerned
with the total number of dead,'' said Richard Van Hazebrouck, a UN
humanitarian aid coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not thinking of the next step, but we are putting
pressure to get some figures of what the Turkish authorities need
for the survivors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo planes from all over the world have brought in medical
supplies, blankets, plastic sheeting and even field hospitals to
help the living after Tuesday's 7.4 magnitude quake, which
authorities say could be the world's deadliest in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But international relief workers are worried that this is not
enough to care for the hundreds of thousands of people who will
never be able to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need any more rescue teams on site. Now we must move
into the second stage, which is looking after the survivors,'' said
Hazebrouck.
</P>
<P>
   With water pipes broken and electric lines down over a huge
swath of Turkey's northeast, relief workers are also concerned
about the possible spread of disease, especially with the thousands
of corpses rotting under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   An epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta flew into Turkey Friday to help assess health needs, along
with two US water sanitation experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be sure, especially with this sweltering weather,
that you're not looking at an outbreak of contagious diseases,''
said Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator of the US Agency for
International Development's humanitarian relief department.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, dressed in black, echoed Parmer's
concern. ``Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of
epidemic,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign engineers and architects are expected to arrive in
Turkey over the next few days to help officials decide which
buildings must be knocked down because of heavy damage and which
can remain standing.
</P>
<P>
   Many still-standing buildings in the hard-hit Izmit and Yalova
areas are clearly unsafe, lurching down at one end or leaning
dangerously out into the street. Five aftershocks, ranging between
4.3 and 4.6 on the Richter scale, rocked the disaster zone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, many people are living out in the open, along the side
of roads and in parks in the city center. Families string up sheets
and blankets for privacy, the few possessions they managed to save
carefully arranged in the only place they can now call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People must understand that there is an urgent need for
portable toilets, cleaning materials, garbage collection - the
local authorities are not able to cope with the scale of these
things,'' said Karen Lever, an International Red Cross logistical
worker in the makeshift tent hospital located in Yalova's football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke outside a tent in which staffers were preparing for an
expected upsurge of infectious diseases. ``The water will be a
problem _ clean water. And sewage and disposing of bodies with all
these people outside in (95-degree) heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of those who did manage to get out alive after the
45-second quake that destroyed so much, the only issue was whether
more people could be pulled from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, large swaths of Izmit were forbidden to rescue
workers while firefighters battled a blaze at the nation's biggest
petroleum refinery. The ruins of the shattered houses there now
conceal an unknown number of dead, and, perhaps, injured.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign search and rescue teams managed to find at least three
people Friday, raising hopes that others may have survived
underneath the collapsed buildings, despite the heat and the lack
of water.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-member American team that arrived on Wednesday in Izmit has
been scouring the crumbled building remains one by one, with German
Shepherds trained to sniff any smell of life. Saturday another team
of about 90 people will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But on the wreckage of what was once a six-story apartment
building, the yellow-helmeted rescue workers could do little for
the relatives of a young woman and her father, whose weak shouts
had been heard until about mid afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a sound, any sound!'' shouted the aid team's Turkish
translator, kneeling over a small hole between two huge slabs of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``With whatever strength you still have scream, please scream,
scream!'' she cried, while a sensitive microphone was dangled into
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes one of the rescue workers turned toward the
dozens of anxious Turks who were waiting across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This machine will pick up anything, heartbeats, breathing, and
there's no real indication that there's anything down there _ we're
not going to stay here,'' Daniel Bickham announced to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the pleas of a young Turkish soldier _ who had heard some
sounds just a few hours earlier _ convinced the team to give it one
more try. Two hours later, the rescue workers finally walked away,
leaving behind the anguished cries of onlookers and what rescue
workers were certain were two corpses buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same scene on Yalova's Stadium Street, now devoid of
the apartment buildings where hundreds of families had lived before
3:04 a.m. Tuesday. For 10 minues, French rescue workers and Turkish
volunteers stopped working to huddle together in total silence,
straining to hear anything from their delicate microphones. After a
few minutes, they stood back from the rubble, their heads shaking.
</P>
<P>
   On one street in Izmit, not even the rumble of bulldozers
ripping through concrete and crushed furniture could convince
26-year-old Ilkay Yildiz that his 20-year-old fiance with the long
brown hair and quick smile was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Every day since the quake he has been waiting at the edge of the
rubble for Hacer Subasi to appear. Even after the foreign rescue
team left a day earlier _ convinced that there was nobody left to
save _ and the bulldozer started digging for corpses, Yildiz
refuses to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the most beautiful, wonderful girl in the world and she
cannot be dead,'' he murmured, falling to the ground and beginning
to cry.

CHINA DETAINEE INJURED IN FALL FROM BUILDING, WIFE TOLD

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ An American detained by authorities last Sunday in a
remote area of China has been gravely injured while in custody, his
wife learned Friday from US embassy officials who reached the
location.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials said Daja Mizu Meston, 29, who was in remote
Qinghai province to research a controversial development project
funded by the World Bank, had jumped from the third story of the
building where he was held after being detained early this week
along with an Australian scholar.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Phuntsok Meston, and friends said they believe
Meston, of Newton, Mass., was more likely pushed or the victim of a
beating.
</P>
<P>
   She said embassy officials informed her that Meston had suffered
broken vertebrae and liver damage and was bleeding internally. His
spleen was reportedly removed in emergency surgery and he was
unconscious, his distraught wife said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was making arrangements to fly to Beijing as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman confirmed that a team of US
diplomats traveled to Qinghai province Friday night and visited
Meston. In Beijing and Washington, US officials demanded Meston's
release and expressed their ``serious concern about the American
citizen's detention and injuries,'' said the spokesman, but said
privacy laws prevented disclosure of Meston's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard, I was terrified. Either he was in such a state
of mind that he was irrational _ but he is not such a person,''
said his wife, Phuntsok Meston, a Tibetan exile, from her home in
Newton. ``There must be other causes of his injuries. Maybe they
pushed him.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also upset that it took so long to learn that Meston had
been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cannot believe the Chinese wouldn't tell the American
embassy earlier how seriously hurt he was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials in Beijing said earlier that Chinese
authorities had told them that Meston had been ``severely injured''
but was ``out of danger after emergency treatment.'' The Chinese
did not indicate when he would be released.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Barney Frank, in whose district the Mestons reside,
called on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the World Bank
to demand the release of both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the US government should make it clear to China that
no further relations can go forward in the absence of these men
being released,'' said a statement issued by Frank, a Democrat and
one of a number of critics of the Chinese resettlement project and
the World Bank's controversial decision to help finance it. He
noted that China has a history of harshly suppressing dissent,
especially in Tibetan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was unaware of Meston's injuries when he sent the letters,
said spokeswoman Dottie Reichard. She said Frank was traveling on
vacation Friday and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican who used Meston as a
translator during a 1997 trip to China, was ``shocked and
saddened'' to hear of Meston's injuries, spokeswoman Rosanne Dupras
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman is very concerned about Daja,'' Dupras said.
``We want the US to do everything to get him home as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   World Bank spokesman Peter Stephens said the bank will not make
any decisions on going forward with the project until bank
officials have full information on Meston's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news of Mr. Meston's condition is awful and shocking,''
Stephens said. ``We are very saddened. But given that some
information is unclear, it's hard for us to make any decisions now
on the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Daja Meston, an American by birth, was raised by his parents in
a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal and speaks fluent Tibetan.
Known as Wangchuk to his Tibetan friends, he is a sociology
graduate of Brandeis University and an aspiring researcher on
Tibetan economic development. He was detained along with an
Australian scholar, Gabriel Lafitte, 50. The two were said to be
researching China's plan to relocate more than 55,000 ethnically
Chinese farmers to an a traditionally Tibetan and Mongolian area of
western Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the two men
were detained for ``illegal covering and photographing in closed
areas.'' Chinese public security officials said the men ``candidly
confessed their illegal activities'' _ an alleged admission that
Meston's wife said must have been made under duress.
</P>
<P>
   The project divided the World Bank's board of directors and has
been condemned by a variety of critics, including the Boston
Globe's editorial page. For the first time in the bank's history,
the board voted to go ahead with funding the project despite
official opposition from the US government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the June 24 World Bank vote, Chinese authorities
said outside politicians, journalists, non-governmental
organizations and ``legitimate'' individuals were welcome to visit
the area ``unattended by Chinese officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But the only journalists allowed to visit so far were required
to be part of an escorted tour. Two weeks later, Meston and
Lafitte, the first independent researchers known to have ventured
to Qinghai, were detained.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese spokesman Zhu said that the men ``were neither entrusted
by the World Bank nor invited by the relevant Chinese
departments.''
</P>
<P>
   Phuntsok Meston broke down in tears on the phone Friday, asking,
``Why have they arrested him, for what? This is just an example of
how the Chinese government functions _ they say one thing and do
something else. Unfortunately, this time it had to be my husband
and Gabriel who pay the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte's wife, Helen Verran, interviewed by telephone from
Melbourne, said her husband had traveled to Qinghai last year to do
research, and has ``always gone on a tourist visa. Other people
interested in the World Bank project were advised . . . there's no
need for an invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian embassy in Beijing said Lafitte had forwarded a
letter through Chinese police saying he was well and ``did not
require any assistance from the embassy.'' An Australian spokesman
told Reuters news agency that the embassy had verified the contents
of the letter in a telephone call with Lafitte.

DRUG-USE ISSUE CONTINUES TO DOG BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a father, Texas Governor George W. Bush doesn't
want his twin, teenage daughters to experiment with drugs. As a
son, Bush hated it when a reporter asked his father, President
Bush, if he had ever committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   As a GOP presidential candidate, Bush has had a rough week
because those personal considerations have trumped the conventional
political wisdom that says Bush should give a direct, unequivocal
answer about whether he ever used illegal drugs, according to
people close to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, reporters tried a new tack in getting Bush to answer the
drug-use question that smothered his campaign this week. Outside an
Akron, Ohio, homeless shelter, Bush was asked what anti-drug
message he had given to his own children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I'm going to leave my daughters out of this
campaign,'' but he replied that parents have a responsibility to
make up for their youthful mistakes by warning their children to
stay away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting questions facing baby boomers is, have
we grown up? Are we willing to share the wisdom of past mistakes?''
the 53-year-old Bush said. ``And I think the message ought to be to
all children, `Don't use drugs. Don't abuse alcohol.' That's what
leadership is about.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Ralph Reed said he believes the governor, like
many baby boomers, had some youthful indiscretions, but did not use
hard drugs. Reed said Bush won't respond to unsubstantiated rumors
about using drugs, including cocaine, because he is uncomfortable
answering personal questions that demean politics and could hurt
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a father, Bush had told his daughters not to use drugs,''
said Reed, a Bush adviser. ``An awful lot of young people like them
are on the cusp of making decisions about their future, and he
doesn't want them to say, `The president of the United States did
that, so I can do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said Bush deeply resents that his father was asked in an
Oval Office interview if he had ever had an extramarital affair.
``He has an emotional feeling about the undignified way his dad was
treated, and he strongly thinks that we are exacting a cost on
public servants that is vicious and negative and has gone way
beyond the call of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this week's media drumbeat so rattled his campaign that
Bush was forced to shift off his just-say-no stance. In answer to a
question Thursday about his ability to pass FBI background checks
for drug use, Bush indicated that he had not used illegal drugs at
any time during the past 25 years. A day earlier, Bush told the
Dallas Morning News he had not used drugs in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has mishandled the issue,'' said John Zogby, a New
York pollster. ``By slowly chiseling away at his hard-line
position, it looks like he is doing a kabuki dance around the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But polls show the public is almost equally divided on the issue
of whether a candidate should disclose past cocaine use. In a new
Time magazine poll, conducted Thursday, 49 percent of the
respondents said yes, and 48 percent said no. When asked if cocaine
use in his 20s would disqualify Bush from the presidency, the
results were more lopsided _ 84 percent of the public said no; 11
percent said yes. (The poll had a margin of error of 3.3 percentage
points.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to hurt Bush,'' said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate
University. ``Not only is the electorate sort of fed up with this
line of questioning, but it doesn't think the issue of drugs should
be dredged up if it doesn't interfere with public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say this isn't a risk-free strategy for Bush.
First, he may be cast as a hypocrite for stressing moral
responsibility in his campaign and at the same time refusing to
answer some, but not other, questions about his own values. Bush
has been frank on the issue of adultery, saying he has been
faithful to his wife, Laura, and about alcohol, admitting he gave
it up at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that drug use is a legitimate issue in terms of
a president's judgment and character, and whether he or she can be
a moral leader and a role model,'' said Mark A. de Bernardo,
executive director of the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, a
nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk, said William Kristol, editor of the conservative
Weekly Standard, is that Bush will face serious consequences, and a
media ``feeding frenzy,'' if he discloses or evidence surfaces that
he once used hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am as sympathetic as anyone to the notion that people
deserve a zone of privacy and the right to say `none of your
business,' '' Kristol said. ``But using cocaine is a felony, a
matter of criminal law, and even if it was a long time ago, the
questions still will come: `Did you buy it, did you sell it, were
you toking off every night?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the Time poll, 35 percent of the respondents said they
thought Bush had used cocaine at some point in his life, 18 percent
thought he did not, and 47 percent said they weren't sure. Bush's
eight rivals for the GOP nomination have said they did not use
illegal drugs. Both Democratic contenders, Vice President Al Gore
and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, have acknowledged they
smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``What never ceases to amaze me is the degree to which
politicians don't understand that the public is forgiving of
mistakes, but not of coverups and lies,'' said L. Brent Bozell III,
chairman of the Media Research Center, a conservative media
watchdog group. ``Bush should have come clean with an answer and
told the truth. Now he has dug himself into a hole.'' Bozell has
endorsed publisher Steve Forbes for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged Friday there wasn't anything uplifting about
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that politics can be unnecessarily ugly,'' Bush
said in Akron, ``and I'm trying to purge the system of ugly
politics.''

HILLARY CLINTON'S `FOCUSED' LOOK DRAWS COMMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ She wore dark sunglasses, a shapely black
pantsuit and matching low-heeled, open-toed slingbacks as she held
a cell phone to her ear. It could have been a snapshot of any
modern woman strolling down a Manhattan street.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the First Lady moments after decending the steps
from Air Force One onto Martha's Vineyard Thursday, a jarring
contrast to the welcoming friends dressed in jeans, print frocks
and Hawaiian shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Although her Senate campaign staff huffs at the idea that
Hillary Rodham Clinton could have an image consultant -- they think
it's a sexist question, even though men regularly hire them --
people are taking notice of the new vibrant look, including her
modern, no-nonsense short hair. What they see is an independent
woman ready for battle and sophisticated enough to take on New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does look different,'' said Vineyard Haven resident Sue
Rogers, who was there to greet the Clintons and has met them during
their previous vacations on the island. ``She looks very focused
and very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choice of clothing-as-image may not be as blunt as, say,
former presidential candidate Lamar Alexander's trademark
I'm-one-of-you plaid shirts, but the change has been noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible isn't it?'' shouted Boston-based Democratic
political consultant Michael Goldman. ``She's looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age where image is everything, politicians are accutely
aware that how they look effects how much people relate to them,
whether they trust them and, ultimately, whether they vote for
them.
</P>
<P>
   But the First Lady's handlers denied that her new look was a
part of a conscious strategy. ``She does not have an image
consultant,'' Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman Julie Mason said sternly,
adding that she did not really know what an image consultant is.
``No one is telling her what to wear. To tell you the truth I
haven't paid much attention to it. It may just be it's more
practical for her to dress that way. ... I also don't know whether
great thought has been given to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Never known for her fashion sense -- remember the blue hat and
awkwardly tied scarf around her neck on Inauguration Day? -- the
first sign of Hillary trying to break free of those matronly pink
skirt suits came last December when she became the only First Lady
to appear on the cover of Vogue in its 110-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The cover shot had her in a $4,000 burgundy velvet Oscar De La
Renta number with Cartier earrings and shoes by Manolo Blahnik, one
of the hottest footwear designers around. More telling, perhaps,
was the inside spread, where Mrs. Clinton wore her own Oscar De La
Renta pants and a Donna Karan sweater in pictures magazine
spokesman Patrick O'Connell calls ``poised'' and ``empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine hit the stand right around the time when her
candidacy to replace US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was being
floated. And since then, her look has been further refined.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Rodriguez, one of the stylists at the Cristoph Salon in
Washington who ran his brush through her hair as recently as two
weeks ago at the White House, says Mrs. Clinton has finally figured
out what looks good on her, or, in political terms, what's right
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I say this? I think it all kind of slowly but surely
happened that way,'' Rodriguez said. The current hairdo almost
makes you forget about the headband she wore when she was standing
by her man during the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this haircut and this hairstyle is very current,
fresh-looking, modern and hip without overdoing it,'' Rodriguez
added.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh hair. Fresh start. Scandals and nearly two terms of White
House living are practically behind her and she's shopping for a
home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion watchers have also noted that Mrs. Clinton is moving
away from skirts -- the wearing of which can appear more feminine
than feminist -- and toward pants. Perhaps, they offer, it is a
symbol of a new freedom from her traditional role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a change when you are primarily a supportive
person as opposed to being a principle'' said Kam Kuwata, a
California Democratic consultant who helped elect Diane Feinstein
to the Senate. ``It appears she's carrying herself in a different
way because of a change in status.''

VENEZUELA STRUGGLES WITH NEW CONSTITUTION

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Until recently, Antonia Munoz had never
been to the white, colonnaded Capitol building in downtown Caracas.
But nearly every day this month, she has settled into its plush
chambers to help lay the foundations for a new Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, a university professor from the western city of Guanare,
was elected last month to the Constitutional Assembly, which is
writing a new Magna Carta to replace the 1961 edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always dreamed of changing the rules of the game in this
country,'' said Munoz, who earned a doctorate in agronomy at Texas
A&AMP;M University before returning to Venezuela to teach. ``I wanted
to have honest government.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembly is the linchpin of President Hugo Chavez's crusade
to bring about a ``peaceful revolution'' in this oil-rich yet
impoverished nation of 23 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides composing a new charter, the assembly is expected to
dissolve the Congress and to overhaul the justice system, political
parties and other institutions that are viewed as corrupt. Chavez's
vision is a complete makeover of the Venezuelan state.
</P>
<P>
   Critics express fear that the assembly could become a rubber
stamp for Chavez's whims and would allow the hugely popular
president to accumulate even more power. They note that pro-Chavez
candidates won an astounding 123 of 131 seats in July 25 elections
for the Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But during the first three weeks of deliberations, the assembly
has often displayed a feisty, independent attitude. Debates go on
for hours and the voting has been unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that Chavez remains incredibly popular six
months after taking office. Polls put his public approval rating at
more than 70 percent. But because his support comes from the left,
center and right, the assembly tends to reflect all of Venezuelan
society rather than Chavez himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have different opinions. They are not like sheep,'' said
Luis Vicente Leon, director of the Datanalysis polling firm in
Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with foreign reporters last week, Chavez spent
the first 15 minutes criticizing the international media, saying
that they misunderstand the nature of the assembly and have
unfairly portrayed him as a dictator-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally false that the 120 or so people ... allied to us
are a homogenous block that will raise their hands for whatever
Chavez says,'' he said. ``No one can say that this is being cooked
up. If that's the way it really was, the constitution would already
have been approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Congress, which is in recess, the Constitutional
Assembly includes seasoned politicians as well as social workers,
teachers, journalists, retired military officers and Indians.
Voters even elected two folk singers and a racetrack announcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really weird mix,'' said Ricardo Penfold, vice
president of research for Santander Investment in Caracas. ``You
wonder if they have the credentials to be drafting a new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of delegates are university graduates who are on
leave from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here for the money,'' said Jesus Rafael Sulbaran,
the racetrack announcer who also has a law degree. ``We are here
for our ideals. We are here to regain our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Idealism has been in short supply in Venezuela. Although it is
the world's third-largest oil producer and Latin America's oldest
democracy, the country is in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate is 15 percent and 80 percent of the
population live in poverty. Venezuelans put much of the blame on
government institutions gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial system often is singled out as the worst offender.
More than half of the nation's 4,700 judges and court officials
face complaints of corruption and other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former Army paratrooper who launched an unsuccessful
coup attempt in 1992, won a landslide election victory last
December by promising to clean house. To do so, he says he needs a
new set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitutional Assembly, which began meeting Aug. 3, must
come up with a new charter within six months, although Chavez said
he would like the document ready in three months. Venezuelans will
then go to the polls to approve or reject the document.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly everyone agrees that a government shake-up is
essential, the exact powers of the assembly are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez contends the assembly is the nation's ``supreme power''
and warns that existing government institutions must not be used as
``trenches'' from which to fight against the coming reforms. But
the Supreme Court maintains that the assembly must stick to writing
a new constitution and not meddle with the other branches of power.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the assembly ignored the Supreme Court's opinion by
declaring a ``judicial emergency,'' giving itself wide-ranging
powers to overhaul the court system and fire corrupt judges.
</P>
<P>
   It also appears likely that the Congress will be dissolved and
that new elections will be held next year, a measure that has
overwhelming support among average Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want these institutions. They don't believe in
them. They no longer represent anything in Venezuela,'' said
Aristobulo Isturiz, vice president of the assembly and a former
mayor of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers warn that the assembly could get so bogged down
addressing the nation's ills that it will lose sight of its
original purpose. And if Chavez loses patience with the process, he
may demand action, said Herbert Koeneke, a political science
professor at Simon Bolivar University in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that whenever he decides that enough is enough, he
may have the votes to pass the constitution that he wants,''
Koeneke said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, U.S. officials have endorsed Venezuela's reform program.
Following a recent trip to Caracas, Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering said that Chavez ``intends to have a constitution that
has full respect for democracy, human and civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is healthy stuff,'' added a western diplomat. ``This is
democracy, Venezuela style.''

<P>
   When Brian Knapp arrived at Barnes &AMP; Noble's new media division,
as it was then known, in January 1997, he thought the risks were
amply justified by the rewards. He was given a salary in the range
of $50,000, a job he liked and, thanks to a generous stock-options
package, the prospect of a big windfall when the division became a
separate company with its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25 this year, when Barnesandnoble.com went public at $18
a share, Knapp and his colleagues hoped to watch the stock soar,
and to join the ranks of their newly wealthy friends at Amazon.com
and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the shares stagnated. Without the prospect of a fortune
to hold him, Knapp left the company on July 23 to become director
of business development for the Allbusiness.com of San Francisco,
which offers business services on line _ and plans to go public in
a few years. The benefits included a new options package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much easier to leave because I didn't have the golden
handcuffs,'' he said of Barnesandnoble.com. ``It wasn't worth it
for me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   After a huge run-up, the decline in Internet stocks since April
has loosened the strongest ties that employees have to some risky
young companies. Stock options, once limited to top executives,
have become the new common currency in the technology world, but
the wealth that many workers hoped their options would yield has
sometimes become as insubstantial as smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies, especially IPO's and Internet, are putting
all their eggs in the stock options basket,'' said Dick
Wagner,chief executive of Strategic Compensation Research
Associates in Manhattan. ``If the stock price doesn't perform, a
stock option, unlike performance shares or other forms of
compensation, won't attract or retain key employees. In fact,
underwater options can be a massive motivator to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   With more Americans hopping from job to job, options have become
a prime way for employers to build loyalty and morale. The options
provide the right to buy stock in the future _ at the eventual
offering price, the current market price, or often at a discount.
They typically vest, or become effective, 25 percent at a time over
four years. Employees usually get the most options when they
arrive, but many receive annual option grants as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jenn Shreve received a substantial number of pre-offering
options as an editor for three years at Salon.com, the online
magazine in San Francisco. When the company went public at $10.50 a
share on June 22, employees expected the stock, and the options'
value, to take off. But after running past $15 in early July, the
shares have fallen, closing on Friday at $6.25.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shreve, who is 26, quit her job at Salon.com earlier this
month to do freelance writing. While she did not leave solely
because of the stock's poor performance, she had less incentive to
stay. ``I never expected to get massively wealthy in the first
place, but it would've been nice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At companies like Amazon.com or Yahoo, early employees were
compensated with minimal salaries but abundant stock options, so a
lot of youthful plutocrats were minted as those stocks soared.
</P>
<P>
   But the options have already lost some of their cachet in
dot-com land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hype in this industry, and for every
millionaire there are a hundred people who don't make anything off
their options,'' said Knapp, who is 25. ``We were always pitted
against Amazon.com, and a lot of those folks did very well. But
starting at Amazon and being a founder there is like winning the
lottery. They're doing a great job, but what happened there isn't
going to happen in most people's lifetimes, even for a successful
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers, meanwhile, find that they must pay high salaries in
addition to options. ``There's no way we can hire someone without
stock options, but we still have to pay market rate,'' said John
Williamson, chief operating officer of Surfmonkey.com, of Campbell,
Calif., a Web portal for children; the company plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   With some Internet shares down more than others, job hunters
have become amateur stock analysts. ``They know they're in short
supply; they can negotiate,'' Williamson said. ``They're all
looking to find pre-IPO companies they can join and benefit from.''
</P>
<P>
   Where prospects still seem promising, taking a chance on an
options windfall doesn't necessarily mean taking a full-time job.
For the first time in his 21 years of doing business, Bob Eiland,
who owns EGS Elite, a consulting firm in Northboro, Mass., chose to
accept options as well as cash for his work the last few years with
Software.com, an Internet software company in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The shares were sold to the public at $15 on June 24, hit $48 on
July 15 and closed on Friday at $40.8125; Eiland's options allow
him to buy shares in the single digits. He cannot sell any shares
until December, but plans to hold most of them for the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland finds his compensation package both exciting and
unnerving, as he struggles not to spend money he does not yet have.
``Owning a significant amount of options in a high-growth Internet
company can be insidious in how it can sneak its way into your
unconscious,'' he said. (FM)`Without knowing it, you can start
making assumptions on how things will be easier financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he said, he and his wife, Sharlotte, who have been
considering a move to a new home since the beginning of the year,
were tempted to buy a house that cost twice as much as their
present one is worth. Ultimately, they backed off, but still do a
little dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Since his decision to accept the options instead of a higher
fee, he and his wife have retained a financial adviser, a tax
lawyer, an accountant specializing in stock transactions and an
initial-offering consultant who helps devise long-term investment
strategies. Eiland has also thought about charities to which he
could contribute.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he does not even know how much his options will be
worth. ``It's possible, though improbable, that we could even lose
money _ especially considering the amount of money I gave up in
order to get the options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential for huge gains diminishing as Internet stocks
weaken, some employees are adjusting to working more for salaries
and intrinsic pleasures _ more like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said I'm going into an Internet company to be a
millionaire,'' Knapp said. ``I do it because I love the atmosphere,
the industry, that medium and the people. The fact that I get paid
to play on the Internet all day long is astounding.''

 &HT;    Goldberg can't kick start `Soldier'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may not be a movie screen big enough for Bill Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   World Championship Wrestling's paramount wrestler and former
Atlanta Falcon is all over Jean-Claude Van Damme's latest
all-fists-and-kicks flick, ``Universal Soldier: The Return.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the movie's robotic superhunks turned evil, Goldberg
gets shot, stabbed, set on fire and smashed by a truck. He falls
headfirst down stairs into a concrete wall, backside first off a
multi-story building onto rock-hard asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   What's this muscled goon to do? Toss it all off with his
trademark wrestling shoulder-shrug and charge ahead, body-slam-ming
some piece of tattooed male meat dressed up as a hospital orderly.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Van Damme movie. And that makes it an unapologetic,
full-borne, brawn brawl.
</P>
<P>
   There is a story to get in the way of all the fighting. As the
title so eloquently indicates, this is a return to Van Damme's 1992
``Universal Soldier,'' in which dead military guys are turned into
chiseled, nearly unstoppable, cyborglike warriors. This time,
there's a HAL-like computer dubbed Seth running things. And when an
ill-advised general orders the shutdown of the Universal Soldier
program, old Seth boots up the fighting force and orders a world
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Only Van Damme, as a former human-robot who's now inexplicably
more human than automaton, stands in the way. He's got an injured
daughter to worry about, a shapely female reporter constantly at
his heels and the whole planet to tote on his back.
</P>
<P>
   The kicks, punches, bombs and firepower just keep coming as the
film's heavy metal soundtrack just keeps blaring.
</P>
<P>
   More amazing than all the explosions and noise is the tenacity a
movie like this has to sneak its story line inside a strip joint
where, naturally, lap dances turn into a fisticuffs free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but the only thing resembling a human actor in all this
is Michael Jai White, who plays Seth after the computer downloads
its smarts into White's monstrously buffed body. He's amazingly
evil.
</P>
<P>
   As with most Van Damme movies, this one's got some good jabs and
kicks. But it's devoid of the full-fledged physical artistry of
Jackie Chan or the mesmerizing carnage of the best Hong Kong action
flicks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, without Goldberg and White, it'd be nothing but a
whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier:
</P>
<P>
   The Return''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White and Bill
Goldberg. Rated R for nonstop strong violence, and for language and
nudity. 1 hour, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's loud, it's brutal and, unfortunately, not
packed with enough fun.

 &HT;    Researchers develop `living' calculator using real nerve cells
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 22.
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul Garcia makes an incision down the length of the
green and brown spotted back of a leech. He carefully clears tissue
and blood away from his target: a fragile network of nerve cells
that will soon function as a biological calculator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, we are utilizing the properties of leech
neurons to add,'' explains Garcia, a graduate student at Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Blurring the distinction between biology and technology, Garcia
and other scientists from Georgia Tech and Emory University have
joined forces to create a method of computing that is part machine
and part animal. Garcia is combining living nerve cells, courtesy
of leeches, with a little machinery to create a calculator that
correctly answers a question that stumps all but a couple of
species worldwide: What is two plus three?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta researchers hope the ability to add will be the first
step to a more sophisticated and new type of thinking for a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, computers process information in a rigid procedure of
logic that cannot make guesses or assumptions about vague, inexact
problems. The ``language'' a computer understands is purely one of
numbers and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, these biology-based computer systems might
understand the messy scrawl of handwriting _ a decidedly difficult
task for a computer, but not for a 5-year-old, says Bill Ditto, a
former physics professor at Georgia Tech and collaborator on the
project. One day, the so-called ``neurosilicon computer'' might
also be able to help security experts break codes, recognize and
distinguish among human voices, and control the movement of
prosthetic limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My handwriting is terrible. My kids can read it, but a
computer cannot. They are stupid in that sense,'' Ditto explains.
That's because computers are unable to make sense of the tiny
variations inherent in everyday handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Simply adding processing power to a machine doesn't solve the
problem, because computers need to ``think'' differently. Ditto
says that neurons _ nerve cells, the biological building blocks of
nature's most powerful computer, the human brain _ are much better
suited to filling in gaps of uncertainty that even today's most
powerful computers can't overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans don't think in terms of ones and zeros; they have
neurons,'' Ditto says.
</P>
<P>
   But a full-fledged biological computer is still far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a very primitive stage in this research. We haven't
yet done anything revolutionary,'' says Ron Calabrese, professor of
biology at Emory University. He says the research to date has
merely established that the building blocks for a biological
computer can work at a fundamental level. It's like proving a wheel
will roll before building a car.
</P>
<P>
   Calabrese is an expert of leech neurophysiology, studying the
bloodsucker since 1974 in his efforts to understand its nervous
system. Calabrese and Ditto plan to construct a large
conglomeration of neurons and silicon as a type of computer chip _
a true mixture of biology and electronics _ that they hope will do
much more than add.
</P>
<P>
   The leech computer is a typical example of the kind of
interdisciplinary work pursued by the joint biomedical engineering
department of Georgia Tech and Emory University. ``The leech
project is very innovative, taking the approach of looking at
nature and how it processes information as a model for computing,''
says Don Giddens, a biomedical engineer at Georgia Tech who heads
the joint department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the schools joined forces to establish the department,
bringing together the strong technical and engineering strengths of
Tech with the biological and medical prowess of Emory. Among the
innovative research efforts under way:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Michelle LaPlaca of the joint biomedical engineering faculty
is studying how brain cells react to injury. She hopes to develop a
replacement brain tissue that would restore structure and function
to lost brain areas in victims of brain diseases and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paul Benkeser, a Georgia Tech professor of computer
engineering who also is affiliated with the biomedical engineering
department, is using imaging techniques to develop a way to better
understand the pediatric heart under bypass surgery. Without the
presence of blood during bypass, the heart changes shape as it
collapses, looking much different to the surgeon who must make
crucial decisions for a successful procedure.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ditto is attempting to develop new techniques for electrically
stimulating the brain in epileptics that might eliminate seizures,
which are now treated primarily with drugs or surgery. Research in
animals has been promising to date, and Ditto may begin work with
human patients in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, studying for a medical degree from Emory as well as a
Ph.D. from Tech under an unusual joint program, is perfectly suited
for the interdisciplinary project. His knowledge of neural biology
and electronic engineering allows him to physically combine the
neurons of a leech _ officially known as Hirudo medicinalis, a
species commonly found in Eastern Europe _ with electronics.
</P>
<P>
   He is able to connect the two because the nervous system of any
animal involves electrical signals that travel along neurons and
jump from cell to cell in a biological network of communication. To
get leech cells to add, Garcia isolates a leech neuron and monitors
the electrical activity _ sometimes called ``cell firing'' _ of the
separated, living nerve cell with electrodes. A cell will ``fire''
with a certain amount of electrical activity to which Garcia
assigns an arithmetic number. Garcia is able to manipulate the
firing of an individual cell, controlling its activity level.
</P>
<P>
   The actual computation comes when Garcia connects two cells with
a computer system developed at Brandeis University that acts much
the way nature does. ``This artificial connection represents and
mimics a biological (connection) between the two cells. For our
purposes, it does so perfectly,'' says Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The program causes the activity of one cell to influence the
firing of another, just as it might in a live leech. Garcia causes
the firing of two cells _ one, for example, whose activity level
corresponds to 2 and one whose level corresponds to 3 _ to combine.
The result is an overall activity level that reflects the
``answer'' _ in this case, that 2 plus 3 equals 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now this is a very trivial way of achieving computation;
it is really just the first step,'' says Garcia, who is exploring
more complex connections between leech neurons that may be able to
do more than just addition. ``We are on to something that nobody
has ever done before, and that is very exciting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The research is progressing very quickly,'' adds Ditto, ``and
this joint Emory-Georgia Tech program is right at the forefront of
this whole field.''

STEPASHIN LEADS PRO-CAPITALIST COALITION IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin emerged Friday
as the leader of a new centrist alliance, as the unofficial race to
succeed President Boris Yeltsin continued to gather momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin will lead a political coalition that includes Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko, two former prime ministers who,
like Stephashin, were also fired by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to create a pro-capitalist alternative to the
left-leaning Yevgeny Primakov, another former prime minister who
has become an early favorite to win the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Stepashin and Primakov are simply preparing for
December's parliamentary elections. But those elections are widely
perceived as preparation for the more important competition next
year over control of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   With many of Russia's economic reformers tainted by last year's
financial crisis, Stephashin, 47, has sought to become the
standard-bearer of the unruly collection of democrats, economic
reformers and power-brokers that Russians have taken to calling the
``center right.''
</P>
<P>
   A former head of the Interior Ministry and internal intelligence
service, Stepashin seems more pragmatic and hard-nosed than the
professorial Kiriyenko, who had the political misfortune to preside
over the fall of the ruble. And he is younger and more dynamic than
the stolid Chernomyrdin, 61, who has gained an unwanted reputation
for his fractured syntax and associations with powerful interests.
</P>
<P>
   Running well behind Primakov in the ratings, Stephasin seemingly
needs a broad base of support. Still, weaknesses in his emerging
coalition were already apparent Friday as some of the would-be
members squabbled openly among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's key aides were reportedly seeking to exclude the
movement led by Yegor Gaidar, Democratic Choice. An economist and
former prime minister who liberalized prices in Russia, Gaidar was
also the behind-the-scenes architect of much of Yeltsin's
unfulfilled agenda of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, the former head of Russia's privatization
program and a member of Gaidar's party, met with Chernomyrdin at
his country home outside Moscow Friday to try to persuade him to
make common cause with the Gaidar faction.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that he might be excluded, Gaidar said sarcastically
that there were ``anatomical differences'' between the members of
his party and those of Chernomyrdin's: The members of the Gaidar
party, he said, had moral backbones; the members of Chernomyrdin's
party did not.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only sign of friction. Some of Chernomyrdin's
aides, for example, said there was no place in the new coalition
for Boris Fyodorov, the blunt-spoken former tax collector who once
assailed Chernomyrdin as a do-nothing minister, and Boris Nemtsov,
the reform-minded former aide to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a feeling of lost grandeur and this feeling just
eats them up,'' Nemtsov said sarcastically, referring to the
Chernomyrdin faction. ``I hope that common sense prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the new alliance to pull together _ or fracture _
could become clear as early as Saturday, when Stepashin and
Chernomyrdin may formally announce their new electoral bloc.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the announcement so pressing is Primakov's dramatic
reentry into Russian politics earlier this week and his partnership
with Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, one of the nation's most
ambitious politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A former Soviet official, Primakov is seen as a force for
stability by many Russians. Primakov's critics say he is a typical
politician who steadfastly avoided difficult decisions during his
term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   While opinion polls generally rate Primakov as the nation's most
trusted politician, that view is held by only a quarter of the
population, reflecting the widespread antipathy many Russians feel
toward their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There are other contenders, too. They include Grigory Yavlinsky,
the stubbornly independent leader of the liberal Yabloko party.
Earlier this week, Yavlinsky and Stepashin discussed throwing their
lot together, but those talks broke down when Stepashin turned down
an offer to join the Yavlinsky ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist leader, has a solid base of
mostly older supporters. But few observers give him a chance to win
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Stepashin's successor as prime minister, Vladimir
Putin, whom Yeltsin has publicly endorsed as his successor, and an
array of governors, like Konstantin Titov of the Volga River region
of Samara.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll did not give Putin, a former intelligence official,
much hope. Only 12 percent said they thought Yeltsin was sincere
when he offered the endorsement.

 By JENNIFER 8. LEE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a Saturday afternoon that offered the first break
from an 80-plus-hour work week, investment bankers lay bronzing on
the rooftop terrace of 45 Wall St. Sipping Evian and Corona beer,
they took in a 29th-floor view of the landmarks of the financial
district, close enough to reach out and touch: the Goldman Sachs
building, the New York Stock Exchange, the World Trade Center, the
J.P. Morgan building.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents worked out in the building's mirrored penthouse
gym, or shot pool in a wood-paneled lounge. The logos on their
workout clothes formed a lineup of prestigious names: Harvard,
Wharton, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch _ all alma maters and
employers.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of 45 Wall St. are relatively young. They are
urban. They are brazenly professional. The converted office
building in which they live, one block from the New York Stock
Exchange, has become known as an upscale dormitory of sorts for
armies of fresh college graduates, who invade Wall Street from the
country's premier universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question here is what Wall Street company do you work for,
not what do you do,'' said James Im, a University of Chicago
graduate, who was doing stomach crunches in the gym. ``Forty-five
Wall is famous. It's known to be an analysts' dormitory. If you're
an analyst, you know someone who lives in 45 Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   To most financial investors, a Wall Street analyst is a
respected stock picker. But ``analyst'' is also the title given to
the foot soldiers of the industry who fill the lowest level of the
Wall Street hierarchy. They put in back-breaking hours, pull
all-nighters regularly and grease the capitalist machine through
IPO's and mergers and acquisitions. They are intimate with
Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint. ``You're in the bottom of the food
chain,'' said Valerie Zonenberg, 23, a Harvard University graduate
who has worked for two years for a major Wall Street firm and lives
at 45 Wall.
</P>
<P>
   When it was converted two years ago to residential use, the
building, which is managed by the Rockrose Development Corp., was
designed for professionals, with home offices; some apartments even
have high-speed Internet access. But few take advantage of that
option. Today, half of the residents work in the financial
industry. The average age is 28. The average salary is $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The address has resonance. The Wall Street subway stop on the
No. 2 and No. 3 trains is beneath the building. ``It's all part of
the mystique: `I live on Wall Street, I work at Goldman Sachs,'''
said one recent college graduate, tanning on the rooftop of 45
Wall, where he shares a three-bedroom apartment with two other
analysts for $3,400 a month. ``It's a culture. You walk downstairs
in the morning and everyone is in suits. You feel like you're at
the center of the world. Everything happens here.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The location is convenient, even though the financial district
becomes a ghost town after 6 p.m. Half the residents live less than
a 15-minute walk from work. ``From door to desk, it takes me 2
minutes,'' David Saenz, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said during a
round of pool in the lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the proximity helps ease the life style. ``When you
are working 100 hours a week, you want to be able to walk to
work,'' said Ms. Zonenberg, who pays $1,400 a month for a studio
apartment. ``Especially when you have three hours of sleep at
night, you want to be able to run home and take a quick shower.''
</P>
<P>
   She is one of a group of people fulfilling a high-cost,
high-payoff contract. They have agreed to serve as Wall Street's
drudges for two or three years, in exchange for another blue-chip
credential on their resumes. For many, Wall Street is just a stop
on the way to business or law school. Others will stay in the
financial industry. It's a combination rat race and paper chase.
The end of the road is a place in the American aristocracy, earned
through grit and luck.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The doormen at 45 Wall don't find it unusual when residents
stumble in at 4 or 5 a.m. Tenants regularly arrive home as others
are leaving for work. ``They shower, sleep for two hours, get up
and go to work again,'' said Thomas Wright, who was on the midnight
to 8 a.m. door shift in the marble and redwood lobby. Doormen often
give wake-up calls to rouse the employees from their naps. ``I have
some people come in so disgusted, they say the job is killing
them,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The analysts concede that their salaries are comfortable for a
first job, but they are quick to point out that computed hourly,
they are within a few dollars of minimum wage. ``The joke is a
McDonald's worker makes more per hour than we do,'' Ms. Zonenberg
said. ``Eighty hours a week is two jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of 45 Wall say they find strength in sharing the
ordeal. ``When you come home at 3 in the morning, you can always
expect someone to walk in at the same time, also in a suit, also as
exhausted as you are,'' Ms. Zonenberg said. ``In the elevator ride,
you're too tired to talk but you give each other that nod: `I'm
there, too. Thanks for being there.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how they can work 100 hours a week,'' Wright said.
``I tell them, `Your health comes first. I don't care how much
money you are making.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In return for the fatherly counsel, the financial professionals
offer their doormen advice of their own. ``I don't know anything
about investments, but my tenants told me what to do with my
money,'' Wright related. ``They said take my money out of my
savings account. Now, I'm in the stock market,'' he said,
brandishing the current issue of the Janus fund report.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the building is a high-class dormitory at sky-high
Manhattan real estate prices. The young professionals live in
groups of up to five in an apartment. Living rooms are partitioned
to carve out bedrooms and economize. Bookshelves are filled with
textbooks from summer finance training courses like ``Essentials of
Accounting'' and ``Principles of Corporate Finance.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many dorms, 45 Wall even has a common area _ the rooftop
lounge, complete with pool table, big-screen television and a
party-size wrap terrace, which can be rented for $100 a hour.
Parties are a big part of life at 45 Wall. ``Before, I had sublet
in a building with older tenants,'' said Novisi Atadika, a recent
Harvard graduate, who works at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``There,
they posted up signs that said, `I'm sorry, I'm having a party.'
Whereas here it's commonplace to party.'' Instead of beer kegs and
pretzels, parties at 45 Wall typically have full bars and caterers.
</P>
<P>
   Children are unusual, though becoming slightly more common.
Older people wandering the hotel-like hallways are presumed to be
parents of residents. ``You are 35 in this building, you stand
out,'' Ms. Zonenberg said. ``If you are 45, you are the parent
visiting the kids, bringing food to a son.''
</P>
<P>
   Other differences between college and the real world: the
furniture is nicer, the televisions more expensive. Ikea is the
furniture store of choice for the young professionals. This being
Wall Street, the building has an indoor practice golf course. It
also has a dry cleaning service, critical to appearing well groomed
in a culture that hasn't fully taken to summer casual. Dry cleaning
bills for the young analysts can approach $100 a month.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Residents rarely cook, and kitchens are barren. The analysts eat
breakfast on the way to work, lunch in the office and dinner at a
restaurant, traditionally paid for by companies for employees who
stay late. Even when they're not working, the residents dine out or
order in. The doormen see a steady stream of pizza and Chinese food
deliveries on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not once shopped for groceries in a year,'' Im said.
``It's not out of the ordinary to go a few days without toilet
paper and not care enough to do anything about it.'' His apartment
refrigerator contains water, beer and leftover Chinese food. Ms.
Zonenberg ate at home so seldom that she didn't buy a dining table
and chairs until eight months into her lease.
</P>
<P>
   For those who actually do purchase groceries, the scarcity of
supermarkets in the financial district leaves them scrambling to
stock their cabinets. Many analysts will have the company cars that
drive them home make a loop to 24-hour groceries and delis so they
can pick up basic necessities at 2 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free meals, free rides home, free cell phones and pagers _ it
appears to be a glamorous life style,'' one analyst said. ``But
there's no such thing as a free lunch. It's hard work. I would give
up all those free meals to come home earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents compare life at 45 Wall to a financial version of
``Friends.'' The narrow pool of colleges and companies makes for
only a few degrees of separation between people. ``It's a great way
to start a conversation,'' Saenz said. `` `Hey, you work at
Salomon? I have a friend who works at Salomon.' `Really? What
group?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity and sameness of the work can result in narrow
discussions. ``You can't say, `I saw this movie' or `I went on
vacation' because your life is filled with work,'' Im said.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, 45 Wall reflects the demographics of the
financial industry. There are two men to every woman. Some say the
building, like the Street, has a socially conservative cast.
``There are fewer other gays in the building than anywhere else
I've lived in New York City,'' said Jim Nellis, 45, a a senior vice
president at Commpeople, a telecommunications company, who is one
of the few baby-boomer residents. ``Wall Street is so closeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zonenberg, who still keeps her stuffed animals next to her
financial textbooks, said that for her a building that is an
extension of college is just fine for now. ``I'm not ready to be in
a place where there are babies, dogs and cats and real families
everywhere,'' she said. ``We know this is not the real world.''

FOR MORALITY LESSONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVICE, TUNE IN TO THE
MAYOR

(DW) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there's anything callers to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's weekly radio show should know before dialing, it's this:
Be careful what you ask.
</P>
<P>
   When Tony from the Bronx called to question the mayor's handling
of the Amadou Diallo shooting, Giuliani told him, ``Either you
don't read the newspapers carefully enough or you're so prejudiced
and biased that you block out the truth.'' When Bill in Manhattan
asked why it was illegal to hang a flag from city property,
Giuliani shot back, ``Isn't there something more important that you
want to ask me?''
</P>
<P>
   When David in Oceanside last month complained about the ban on
pet ferrets, the mayor of New York City leaned into the microphone
on his desk and intoned, ``There is something deranged about you.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-minute diatribe against the ferret advocate ensued, with
Giuliani saying things like, ``You should go consult a psychologist
or a psychiatrist with this excessive concern _ how you are
devoting your life to weasels.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor created ``Live From City Hall with Rudy Giuliani'' in
1994 as a means of talking to ordinary citizens about the
frustrations of city life, and sure enough, he helps dozens of
callers navigate city bureaucracy, foil corrupt landlords and find
jobs. When Alina from Queens phoned recently to complain about dogs
that bark all night, the mayor offered soothing advice. When
Dorothy from Brooklyn wanted someone to crack down on the garbage
trucks that spew rotten milk on her street, Giuliani hopped to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is as much about trouble-making as
trouble-shooting. Every Friday morning from 11 to 11:45, Giuliani
uses his free air time on WABC-AM to lecture New Yorkers about
their bad habits, inveigh against their collective dysfunction and
exhort them to be more exemplary human beings, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Although he does solve many callers' problems, Giuliani often
sounds more like a bullying therapist than an elected official.
``Live From City Hall,'' is his most direct, unfiltered means of
playing a favorite role: telling people who disagree with them that
they are not only wrong, but psychically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made the radio show into an opportunity to give
morality lessons and ideological sermonettes,'' said Mitchell Moss,
who directs the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
``He is using it less as an elected official and more as a local
Rush Limbaugh.''
</P>
<P>
   With 75,000 listeners per show, ``Live From City Hall'' is
considerably less popular than Limbaugh's show, which airs on the
same station and draws about 170,000 daily listeners in the
metropolitan area. Still, Giuliani's show, which can be heard as
far away as Albany, is the city's second-most-popular AM radio show
in its time slot, said Phil Boyce, the program director at WABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has definitely built up a following,'' Boyce said. ``He's
no different from the rest of our hosts, who have a pretty high
opinion of their own opinion and like to tell people what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Giuliani's radio style is not so different from
that of his role model, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, who reached
out to New Yorkers on his own weekly radio show in the 1940s. La
Guardia used his show to rail against reporters and bookies and
people who wasted gasoline during the war years, moralizing just as
fiercely as Giuliani does today.
</P>
<P>
   But La Guardia also shared stories about his children, dispensed
shopping and cooking tips and, famously, gave dramatic readings of
the ``Dick Tracy'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like Giuliani in that he had no doubt about the fact
that he was right,'' said Thomas Kessner, a history professor at
the City University of New York Graduate Center who wrote a book
about La Guardia. ``But his tone on the radio was much more
avuncular. He was like the older uncle telling men and women what
was best for them in a way that infused them with optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   On a typical show, Giuliani starts out sounding like a school
principal making announcements over the public address system. As
the jaunty theme music fades, he exhorts listeners to donate blood
and take brief showers, root for local teams and get some exercise.
``You should really keep yourself as physically fit as possible,''
he said on the Aug. 6 show.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 13, the subject was gridlock, and Giuliani patiently
explained why not clogging intersections, known as blocking the
box, is an exercise in spiritual growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason not to block the box is a very, very important one
for your development as a responsible human being,'' Giuliani said.
``It means respecting the rights of other people, understanding
that there are sometimes things you would like to do, things that
feel better to you, but in doing them you disrespect the rights of
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   After his discourse, the mayor opens the phone lines for
questions.A technician e-mails each caller's name and a summary of
their question to City Hall, where Giuliani chooses the exchanges
du jour.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his most startling tirades recently came in response to
calls from David Guthartz, the ferret advocate, and Margarita
Rosario, whose son Anthony, an 18-year-old robbery suspect, was
shot dead by two police detectives in 1995. Mrs. Rosario called
last month and said that she wanted to discuss Con Edison. But
instead, she started protesting the shooting, and Giuliani barely
let her speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should ask yourself some questions about the way he
was brought up and the things that happened to him,'' the mayor
told Mrs. Rosario, whose 21-year-old nephew, also a suspect, died
in the shooting. ``Trying to displace the responsibility for the
criminal acts of your son onto these police officers is really
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tapes of some of Giuliani's earliest radio shows suggest that
back then, he handled hostile callers with more equanimity. When
Ann from Linden, N.J. called in August 1994 to denounce his support
of the federal crime bill, he politely responded, ``Ma'am, why are
you so angry?'' When Belinda from Manhattan called him ``a snake''
for endorsing Gov. Mario Cuomo, Giuliani had nothing more biting to
say than, ``That sounds like it was a paid political
announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So why, at a time when the mayor is taking some pains to soften
his image, has he dismissed some of his recent callers as not only
misguided or disingenuous, but mentally unsound?
</P>
<P>
   ``Having these conversations in private doesn't do any good in
placing out there the other side of the story,'' he said in an
interview. ``If you believe in the search for truth, people have to
be able to see the biases and prejudices and the irrational
problems that are affecting somebody's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani recently began asking listeners to experiment with his
brand of therapy on a particularly troublesome group of New
Yorkers: the ones who don't clean up after their dogs. Such people
tend to have ``a whole host of other problems that play out in
their personalities,'' the mayor said on Friday's show.
</P>
<P>
   It would help, he added, if listeners could confront the
perpetrators on the street and call them slobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may walk up to the wrong person and who knows, you might
get a punch in the nose,'' Giuliani said. ``But if you feel capable
of doing that, this is really something that people have to learn
in society.''

AMERICAN NAVY SHIPS CARRYING AID TO TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TURKEY-QUAKE, TURKEY-LEARN, TURKEY-TOWN) 
(th) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three Navy ships carrying more than 3,000 sailors
and Marines and tons of relief supplies were scheduled to arrive
off the coast of Turkey this weekend, the spearhead of what is
proving to be a large American military response to Turkey's
devastating earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy ships are crossing the Mediterranean and will be ready
to provide medical care by Saturday evening, the Pentagon said.
Pentagon officials said they scrapped plans to send several Air
Force transport planes to Turkey to help fight fires set off by the
earthquake because the fires had largely been contained.
</P>
<P>
   The ships, led by the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge, carry
22 helicopters available for medical evacuations and have six
operating rooms, five X-ray rooms and 60 hospital beds. The medical
staff includes eight doctors, three dentists and 88 medics and
other medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   A separate 22-member Navy medical team from Naples, Italy,
arrived in Turkey on Friday with 27,000 pounds of medical gear and
surgical supplies, including intravenous fluids and anesthesia
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development, which is
overseeing the government's civilian response to the disaster, said
Friday that the United States had so far provided about $3 million
in nonmilitary aid to Turkey to support the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Additional money will be committed later to support the
reconstruction of towns and cities in Turkey ravaged by the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much in the search-and-rescue phase of this
operation,'' said Harriet C. Babbitt, the agency's deputy
administrator. ``The president has been very clear that Turkey is a
longtime friend and ally and we will be responsive to their needs
and requests.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has depended heavily on Turkey, a NATO ally,
in American-led military operations in both the Balkans and the
Middle East, and President Clinton said earlier this week that the
United States ``will do whatever we can to help them get through
this terrible crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   A 70-member search-and-rescue team from Fairfax County, Va.,
outside Washington, has been at work in Turkey since Thursday
morning, searching for survivors buried under the rubble of the
city of Izmit, near the epicenter of the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which uses sniffer dogs and sophisticated electronic
equipment in its searches, is under contract to the AID and has so
far rescued four people from collapsed buildings. It is to be
joined this weekend by a second 70-member American rescue team,
this one from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With whole Turkish cities virtually in rubble, American relief
officials said that the Turkish government's most pressing need was
for tents and other types of temporary housing for the hundreds of
thousands of people forced from their homes. The Defense Department
has said that it will provide Turkey with up to 30,000 tents and
more than 100,000 prepared meals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Babbitt said that the Clinton administration was urging
members of the public who wish to help Turkish earthquake victims
to do so with money, not through donations of clothing, food or
other goods that would take time to ship to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The AID has established a toll-free telephone number to provide
callers with a list of charity groups seeking contributions for
earthquake relief: 1-800-872-4373, or 1-800-USAID-RE.

BUSH ANSWERS ON DRUGS PUTTING MAR ON OTHERWISE CHARMED EXISTENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In his short but famously successful political
career, George W. Bush has led a charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   Applying an almost obsessive discipline that has kept him
focused on a core set of issues and little more, Bush beat popular
Gov. Ann Richards in 1994, crushed his re-election opponent in
1998, and catapulted himself into an instant national phenomenon in
his race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, Bush's winning strategy is being put to
the test in a national feeding frenzy, as unsubstantiated rumors
about past drug use overwhelm practically anything else the
campaign would like to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fallout does not appear to have put the brakes on
Bush's frontrunning presidential campaign. A new poll shows most
Americans want the media to stop asking about the issue, and that
most people say they wouldn't hold a youthful dalliance with
cocaine against him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say the media swirl could damage Bush more than
the rumors themselves, depending on how he performs in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a problem if you don't handle it well,'' said Gary
Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California in
San Diego. ``It's this kind of dribbling out of unpleasant
information that's really damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest there is no good way to handle the issue. Absent
a definitive ``no,'' a strategy of either refusing to answer the
question or of divulging illegal drug use carries risks.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, Bush's answer to the drug question _ or
his non-answer _ had at least been consistent: He always told
reporters he would not inventory the mistakes he made as a young
man.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed this week when Bush was asked if he could
answer a questionnaire that requires potential White House
employees to say whether they had used illegal drugs in the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he could respond, and that the answer would be ``no.''
He later went on to say he could go back even further. His latest
statement has been interpreted to mean that he hasn't used illegal
drugs since at least 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That partial answer, far from putting the issue to rest, sparked
a media blitzkrieg. And, at least temporarily, it undermined Bush's
knack for controlling the message voters are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he was back to declining to answer questions about
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever headlines Bush may have envisioned from his recent
campaign stops _ whether it be the technology-wise Jefferson
Elementary School outside New Orleans or a faith-based homeless
shelter in Ohio _ they have largely evaporated in a hail of
late-night television jokes, political cartoons and calls for him
to come clean with whatever secrets he may have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think Govovernor Bush is right to say I've
admitted mistakes and I don't have anything else to say,'' said
Chuck McDonald, who served as spokesman for former Governor
Richards. ``But you have to adopt a line and never waiver, because
there's a million follow-up questions. It never ends.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
in 1990, Richards broke political ground by refusing to answer drug
questions and inviting voters to choose another candidate if they
just had to know.
</P>
<P>
   Bush followed a similar tack in his successful race against
Richards four years later. When asked by the Houston Chronicle in
1994 about illegal drug use, he said: ``Maybe I did, maybe I
didn't. Where's the relevance?''
</P>
<P>
   The issue pretty much died until Bush began campaigning for
president this year, when rumors about alleged drug use began
circulating on the Internet and, eventually, on the front page of
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called the rumors absurd but said nothing specific until
this week, when he was confronted about the White House security
clearance issue.
</P>
<P>
   C. Boyden Gray, who was counsel to President Bush, helped draft
the policy regarding illegal drug use by prospective White House
applicants, and said the Bush campaign contacted him to determine
what that policy was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to make sure that he is able to establish a tough
enough standard, but one that's not too tough that he can't appoint
anybody,'' Gray said. ``His father used to crack that, `my God, if
you had a rule that you never used drugs since you were 18, I could
never find anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether people will hold Bush's refusal to answer the question
against him remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that many Americans who have been ignoring the
2000 campaign are hearing about the Bush rumors because they're
reaching beyond the narrow band of political reporting, said Allan
Saxe, a political scientist at the University of Texas at
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the comedians and the cartoonists get on you, it can be
serious. A comedian can do more harm than a columnist or a
newspaper reporter, because it starts sticking,'' Saxe said. ``It
begins to resonate.''

JAPAN LETS THE YEN RISE, BUT FOR HOW LONG?

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The investing environment in Japan has changed in the last week,
raising questions about the outlook for its currency and its stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   After intervening aggressively in the foreign exchange market
six times in June and July, hoping to restrain the rising value of
the yen, Japanese officials appear to have stepped to the
sidelines. Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase
Manhattan Bank, said that the officials have made a ``virtue out of
a necessity'' _ that they have decided not to intervene because the
effort to restrain the yen hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Why hasn't it? Because institutional investors around the world
have been rushing to get back into the Japanese stock market. And
so they buy yen _ which pushes up its value _ to buy Japanese
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo ``won't do anything unless the Nikkei collapses,'' said
Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston,
referring to Japan's marquee stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese stock market has already been very, very good to
American investors who have bet on it this year. The Nikkei index
of 225 stocks is up 30.8 percent, while the broader Topix index has
jumped 37.9 percent. And the recent rally of the yen has turned
earlier currency losses into small gains that have added to the
return from the stock market. Since its low for the year on May 20,
the yen is up 11.6 percent. Together, the Nikkei and the yen have
produced a gain of 24.7 percent in the last two months for American
investors.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a change in policy, the yen, which finished
the week at 111.42 to the dollar, could get stronger, which would
only add to the combined returns for investors as yen investments
become worth more in dollar terms. Ms. Parker thinks the yen could
soon move to 105 to 108 to the dollar. (As the yen strengthens, it
takes fewer to buy a dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   But a stronger yen could become a problem. It makes Japanese
exports more expensive abroad, cutting into sales. And if Japan's
export rebound is tripped up, the economic recovery that was
suggested in first-quarter economic data may be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan's attempts in June and July to restrain the
rising yen were based on this fear. And, as many analysts note, the
rallies of the stock market and the yen have both come on very
little in the way of positive economic news.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors don't seem worried. Even while the yen has been
rallying, the Nikkei has rebounded from its summer slide and now is
just 435 points _ or 2.4 percent _ from its 1999 high of 18,532.58.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth J. Allan, senior vice president at Scudder Kemper
Investments and a former Japanese fund manager, is among the
sanguine. Many Japanese companies have business plans based on a
yen around 110 to 115 to the dollar, she said, adding, ``around
these levels, it is not a big deal in relation to their earnings
estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Allan said she thought many new investors in
Japan were not just looking for quick profits in the stock market.
``There seems to be a lot of buying out there, and a lot of it
seems to be long-term, patient money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The patience of these investors will be tested in early
September. That is when data on second-quarter economic growth will
be released. First-quarter growth of 1.9 percent was a big
surprise, and many economists think it overstated the recovery in
Japan. The fresh data will give an indication if the trend is
continuing or fizzling. An unexpectedly weak number would undermine
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A test of Japanese intentions ought to come sooner. Since the
end of 1996, the yen has not breeched 110 to the dollar. If that
level is passed without Japanese intervention, then it will be
clear that policy in Tokyo has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials will threaten intervention, as they did on
Friday. But after a while, that won't count if they don't actually
do anything.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Medley, president of Medley Global Advisors, a
consultant to hedge funds and investment houses, said the Japanese
have to intervene now to slow the yen's rise. If they don't, and if
the second-quarter economic data are disappointing, there may be a
destabilizing selloff in the yen _ and the stock market may follow
it down..
</P>
<P>
   ``Its a very tough period,'' Medley said.

   Don't Forget to Floss
</P>
<P>
   What's the perfect accoutrement for a date in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   How about the ``Get Lucky Pak,'' a wallet-sized package offering
a LifeStyles condom and a sample of new Dental Dots, dime-sized
pads soaked in mint toothpaste with adhesive backing to adhere to
the index finger for a quick cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to get some press on it, maybe on late-night TV,''
said John Stoltzfus, president of Dental Dots Inc. ``While it's a
serious product for good oral hygiene, it does lend itself to the
tongue-in-cheek approach,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The disposable fingertip toothbrush is the brainchild of
Stoltzfus' late identical twin brother, Bob, who during a long
illness was unable to get to the bathroom to brush his teeth. John
left his career in commercial real estate, developed special
equipment to make the product and founded Dental Dots in Reseda,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new, patented toothbrush sells in blister packs of six for
about $2 in drugstores and other outlets. The promotion with
LifeStyles condoms is one of the racier for the company. Stoltzfus
is also talking to the hospitality industry, especially airlines
and hotel chains, about serving travelers in a hurry.

   A Higher (Tech) Calling
</P>
<P>
   New graduates of the Harvard Business School, traditionally able
to pick and choose in the job market, are increasingly drawn to
technology and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the old ways are gone. Consulting, the top career
choice for the school's new graduates since 1988, kept its place
this year. But only 22 percent chose it, compared with 38 percent
in 1995. And the new No. 2, superseding investment banking, was
high technology, up to 20 percent from 8 percent in 1995. Many who
chose it, according to the Aug. 2 issue of The Harbus, the school's
student newspaper, picked Internet-based businesses. In 1995, no
graduate went to such a company; this year, 12 percent of the class
did.
</P>
<P>
   One incentive is a new way of doing things, according to Tracy
Lawrence, a 1999 graduate who, with her classmate, Sasha
Novakovich, is setting up Shopforservice.com, which will help
consumers choose communications services.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a very young age,'' Ms. Lawrence said, ``you have the
opportunity to build or help shape a company from the ground up, to
revolutionize an industry or process.'' And there is another lure
in a field known for twenty-something millionaires _ ``a huge
potential financial upside,'' Ms. Lawrence said.

   Business, Retirement and Taxes
</P>
<P>
   The labor market may be tight, but 80 percent of the 7.6 million
U.S. States companies with fewer than 100 employees lack retirement
plans, and 70 percent of those have no plans to start them,
according to the Spectrem Group, a consulting company in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Still, within two years, Spectrem found, 167,000 more small
companies do expect to start retirement plans, with 1.6 million
more workers likely to be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes as congressional Republicans promote a $792
billion tax cut bill that would significantly increase the tax
benefits to business owners and their highest-paid workers in
retirement plans, while weakening rules that encourage offering
plans to lower-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has vowed to veto the bill. But Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio, and others say that if he does, Congress will pass
a separate bill this fall containing only the pension rule changes.

 BODY TO BE EXHUMED IN CIVIL SUIT IN SHEPPARD SLAYING  (ko) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Lawyers defending the state of Ohio against a
wrongful-imprisonment lawsuit brought by the son of Sam Sheppard,
the Ohio doctor whose murder trials inspired the television series
``The Fugitive,'' said on Friday that they would exhume the remains
of Marilyn Sheppard, Sheppard's wife, who was slain in July 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuyahoga County prosecutor, William D. Mason, whose office
is defending the state, filed a motion on Friday to postpone the
trial, which is scheduled to begin on Oct. 18, so genetic and other
tests could be made on Mrs. Sheppard's body. Mason said that DNA
currently available from Mrs. Sheppard might be contaminated and
that new technology would allow for better analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Reese Sheppard, who has tried for years to clear his
father's name, filed the lawsuit in 1995 seeking monetary damages
for his father's wrongful imprisonment. Under Ohio law, the state
could be forced to pay $25,000 for each year of imprisonment, plus
lost income and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard spent 10 years in prison for his wife's murder, which
he said was committed by a bushy-haired intruder. He was sentenced
to life in prison in 1954, but the U.S. Supreme Court, citing the
unfair effect of pretrial publicity, later overturned his
conviction. Sheppard was acquitted in a second trial; he was freed
from prison in 1966 and died four years later.
</P>
<P>
   His body was exhumed last year, resulting in new DNA evidence
that his son's lawyer, Terry Gilbert, says rules out Sheppard's
involvement in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say a window washer at the family home, Richard
Eberling, killed Mrs. Sheppard. DNA testing, Gilbert said, showed
that Eberling could not be excluded as a match with blood stains
found at the crime scene. Eberling, who was convicted of an
unrelated murder, died in prison last year.

BUSH PROMOTES GREATER RELIANCE ON FAITH-BASED GROUPS TO HELP
HOMELESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ When Texas Gov. George W. Bush took a tour Friday
of the Haven of Rest Ministries, a Christian homeless shelter, he
stressed that if elected president he would promote greater
reliance on these faith-based organizations to take care of the
nation's poverty needs.
</P>
<P>
   While the leading presidential candidates in both parties,
Republican Bush and Democratic Vice President Al Gore, have
promoted faith-based groups in their campaign platforms, this
downtown homeless shelter may also provide a lesson in the
potential pitfalls of making federal government partners with
private religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Haven of Rest Ministries informed a prominent
local Jewish businessman, whose company had contributed to the
shelter, that he could not join the organization's board because he
was not a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the shelter, which is currently funded privately,
defended their policy of hiring only born-again Christians, arguing
that they wanted to preserve the mission's religious nature.
Because they took no government money, they did not have to comply
with anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plans the federal government would not only provide
tax incentives for people to donate to such faith-based groups but
would also make it easier for these religious organizations to
receive government funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Haven of Rest Ministries' programs would be
eligible for government funding despite its exclusionary employment
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The programs should qualify,'' he said. ``The questions we
should ask is does it work ...We ought to be funding programs that
work. ``
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he understands the reluctance of many of these
religious organizations to work with government because of fears
``of having to dilute their mission, the fear of having to forget
the reason they exist in the first place.``
</P>
<P>
   But Bush tried to assure them that he did not want to change the
religious nature of these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly that government should fund programs and
people. And the institutions that provide the love shouldn't have
to change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, even as he has called for faith-based institution to play
a larger role in humanitarian services, apparently has not directly
addressed the exclusion issue. But he has pointed to the special
nature of religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in May, Gore called for ``clear and strict
safeguards'' but said faith-based organizations should be able to
use public funds for a range of operations ``without having to
alter the religious character that is so often the key to their
effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also set other limits saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is always a secular alternative for anyone
who wants one, and as long as no one is required to participate in
religious observances as a condition for receiving services,
faith-based organizations can provide jobs and job training,
counseling and mentoring, food and basic medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should extend this carefully tailored approach to
other vital services where faith-based organizations can play a
role _ such as drug treatment, homelessness, and youth violence
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it may not be so easy to funnel taxpayer dollars to
these private groups that do not comply with federal policies,
which bar discrimination against people on the basis of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a future Bush administration decided not to impose those
policies on private groups, there undoubtedly would be court
challenges if taxpayer money went to organizations that refused to
hire people of certain religions.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, a political science professor at the University of
Akron, said the Haven of Rest controversy does ``reveal the
problems government would have if it started funneling taxpayer
money through these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Green added that ``it also reveals the problems groups would
have once they take government money and they start having to
change their mission.``
</P>
<P>
   The Haven of Rest Ministries was founded in 1943 as a shelter
for homeless women and children by Marjorie Ruth and C.C. Thomas,
devout Christians who initially rented a small office with 25
chairs, an upright piano and a pulpit . Their effort has grown to
include three buildings and 40 employees. It lodges 150 people a
night and provides 400 meals each day.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning the shelter has stressed its Christianity
and requires all board members and staff, including janitors, to
sign a statement of faith annually that includes the belief in
``the absolute Deity of Jesus Christ.``
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1997 that policy came under question when the top
executive of a jewelry company, Terry Burman, took a tour of the
shelter and inquired if he could serve on its 15-member board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Burman told the Akron Beacon-Journal that shelter officials told
him ``we only want members on our board that walk with the Lord and
know Him in a very special way.`` Burman canceled his company's
fund-raising efforts for the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the compliance officer with the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission told the Akron Beacon Journal that the mission's
hiring policy was ``highly suspect.``
</P>
<P>
   This week the shelter's executive director, the Rev. Curt
Thomas, who is the son of the founders, said the board has no
intention of changing the practice of hiring only born-again
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the policy as the only way to ensure that the
shelter's program, which includes prayer services and Christian
counseling, remains true to its mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have Christian organization you must have a Christian
board, a Christian staff and a Christian program, '' Thomas said.
However, he said, the shelter takes in people regardless of their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas acknowledged that the board would be wary of taking
government funding because they ``would be a little nervous because
in the past there have been strings attached to it.``
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Thomas welcomed Bush's visit and the governor's
promotion of faith-based groups. Thomas said Bush found out about
his organization through the office of Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, who
accompanied the Texas governor on his tour.

ALVAREZ EXPECTED TO BOOST REVOLUTION MIDFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Walter Zenga's first extended coaching experience has
not been pleasant. The Revolution have dropped into fifth place in
the Eastern Conference and seem no more resourceful than they were
during nine-game losing streaks of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But, now, the team is receiving a boost from its most
experienced players.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Leonel Alvarez, acquired last week from Dallas in
exchange for Ariel Graziani, appears capable of stabilizing the
midfield. And, probably more important, Zenga himself will return
in goal for Saturday night's game at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Zenga literally rescued the Revolution from a
nine-game losing streak, returning from a knee operation, as they
advanced to the playoffs for the only time in their 3 1/2-year
history. This time, Zenga has had to recuperate from a strained
left knee ligament suffered during a 0-0 regulation-time tie at
Colorado Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga missed the Revolution's losses to San Jose (2-1) and Tampa
Bay (1-0). Though reserve Jeff Causey performed well most of the
time, the own goal he surrendered against the Clash was costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad period for us and everyone has to take
responsibility, but mine is doubled because I am the coach, also,''
Zenga said. ``I don't want to leave the team alone during a bad
time in the season. I want to stay on the field and win or lose
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga appeared to have a magic touch as player-coach with the
Revolution for a while. But it appears his greatest value to the
team is as a player. The Revolution's overall regulation-time
victory total is 34, and nearly half of those have been with Zenga
in goal. Without Zenga in goal, they are 18-49-8, and with him in
goal they are 16-20-7.
</P>
<P>
   This will be only the second time this season the Revolution
will have the same starting lineup of field players available for
two games in succession. But the team has yet to establish
continuity. Now, the Revolution must assimilate newcomers Alvarez
and Jeff Baicher, who was acquired from the Clash in exchange for
midfielder Jair, and is still adjusting to the absence of central
defender Dan Calichman (groin).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can play the same players, it's better for everyone,''
Zenga said. ``We have 22 players on the roster and we have to be
able to use everybody, but if we can use the same 11 starters when
we need a win, it's good. We all need to take responsibility and go
on the field and play with pride and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez brings credibility and versatility to his role and
should help bolster the Revolution's defense, better addressing the
team's vulnerabilities than Graziani, a striker. But Graziani
received few opportunities with the Revolution, but scored in his
debut for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know in soccer,'' Zenga said. ``Graziani did not
score for us and he scores on his first touch with Dallas. But I
think Leonel Alvarez is a very, very strong player, a good
personality, and it's only unlucky for us that he came here so late
in the season. But it's never too late to play good soccer. We have
to go out now and give everything we have on the field.''

RENSSELAER'S NEW PRESIDENT, A CRUSADER FOR WOMEN IN SCIENCE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ The reason there are so few women in science is
self-evident to Yale computer scientist David Gelertner: ``Women
are less drawn to science and engineering than men are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why monkey with female predilections?'' Gelertner asked in the
June 21 issue of The Weekly Standard, at a time when the National
Science Foundation and other organizations have been encouraging
schools to recruit more women and minority members. ``The result is
a diversity crusade that insults women scientists and
nonscientists.'' Ultimately, he concluded, academic institutions
will start limiting the number of men who can major in the
sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Such opinions do not ruffle Shirley Ann Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In a steady voice so soft it sometimes does not even register on
a tape recorder, she offers what sounds like a practiced response:
``The real issue is about choices, about having the opportunity and
the exposure, and you make a choice. I'm not talking about
quotas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson has been on the front lines of such debates her
whole life. Forced to attend an all-black elementary school before
the Supreme Court outlawed segregation in 1954, she became the
first black woman in America to get a doctorate in physics in 1973.
(There has not been much change since. Only 10 black women received
doctorates in physics from 1988 to 1997, the National Science
Foundation reports.) She was the first black and the first woman to
head the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is the new president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
here, the nation's oldest university dedicated to science and
engineering, a black woman heading a school where 75 percent of the
students are men and 90 percent are white.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her luxurious new presidential office, Ms. Jackson, a
small, prim woman with close-cropped hair, listed her immediate
goals. In addition to attracting more women and minorities, she
also wants to increase RPI's $500-million endowment, to raise its
frayed academic reputation and to expand basic research.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour interview, in which she calmly recalled being
shot at and spat on during her years as one of the few black
students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she appeared
to have a will as tough as polished steel. She has a reputation for
decisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very inquisitive, always very much of a take-charge
person,'' said her oldest sister, Barbara Avery. ``She would have
an idea, like let's repaint the bathroom. She would start it and
then, after my other sister and brother got involved, she would
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Ms. Avery, who is dean of students at Loyola
Marymount College in Los Angeles, invited her sister along on a
hiking trip she organizes each summer for a group of black women.
After a few days of alternating leaders on the trail, Ms. Jackson
took charge, even though she had not done much hiking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got us up the mountain and got us there better than anyone
did it before,'' Ms. Avery said. One of the other women on the trip
started calling Ms. Jackson ``the general.'' The name stuck and now
Ms. Jackson always carries the map and walks first.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Jackson is assertive, she is not antagonistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shirley was never needlessly adversarial,'' said Paul Gray,
who was associate provost at MIT in 1968 when Ms. Jackson served as
a leader of the school's black students organization. He was asked
to head a committee to deal with a series of their demands and is
now a close friend of Ms. Jackson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had strong positions,'' he said. ``She spoke for them
eloquently. She held to them. But she did not engage in rancor or
denigration or demeaning people for the effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington she experienced as head of a federal agency was
quite a distance from the Washington she knew as a child. Growing
up in the city's northwest section in the early 1950s, Ms. Jackson
could not attend a nearby elementary school reserved for whites.
Instead, she had to travel several miles to the black school in
another neighborhood _ an interesting inverse of the later debate
over busing to achieve racial integration, she now points out.
</P>
<P>
   She showed an interest in math and science from an early age,
and her parents strongly encouraged her as well as her brother and
two sisters. (``Shirley was always tinkering with things,''
recalled Ms. Avery.) Her father, who rose to become a supervisor at
the Postal Service, graduated from high school but never got the
chance to attend college. Her mother, an orphan who was reared by
older siblings, attended college but had to drop out for financial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Jackson children excelled. Ms. Avery got her
doctorate in education; Gloria Joseph, her younger sister, is a
lawyer who is director of administration at the National Labor
Relations Board. (Their brother, who was the youngest, died 15
years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson attributes her opportunity to pursue science to
lucky timing. Three years after segregation was outlawed in 1954,
the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first orbiting
satellite. Cold War fears that America was falling behind in the
space race led to a new emphasis on science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson took advantage of the trend to indulge her interests
in math, biology and chemistry. She also studied Latin for six
years. The experience shaped her view of what is needed to attract
more women and minorities to science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careers in these areas are a cumulative process,'' she said.
``You can't talk about being a theoretical physicist if you can't
do calculus. You can't do calculus if you can't add, subtract,
multiply or divide and learn some geometry, algebra and
trigonometry. So I think for some underrepresented minorities it is
both a question of how hospitable the fields are and the
institutions that educate and train people, but it is fundamentally
also related to what people are exposed to early on.''
</P>
<P>
   A vice principal at Ms. Jackson's high school suggested that she
apply to MIT. There were 43 women in her freshman class of 900; one
other was black. Though Ms. Jackson experienced the indignities of
Jim Crow in the South, she said she was exposed to very little
overt racism until she arrived in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, many of her fellow students shunned her, refusing to let
her participate in study groups or even to sit next to her in
class. Once, while in downtown Boston, she said she was shot at.
Another time, a group of men shouted racial epithets at her and one
spit in her face. Ms. Jackson persevered. ``It was important to not
just focus on myself but rather to understand that I had a
particular opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking barriers and being a role model can be burdensome, but
Ms. Jackson said she was not resentful. ``Well, if that were the
sum total of my life and the sum total of what people had to say
about me, then it would be disturbing,'' she said. ``But I guess I
am older now and so I am philosophical.'' Ms. Jackson said that if
her being identified as a first black or first woman opened doors
for others, then it's OK with her: ``At the end, I operate in terms
of what my legacy will be.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson did post-graduate work at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago and the European
Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva before joining Bell
Labs in New Jersey in 1976. There, she met her husband, Morris
Washington, who is also a physicist. The couple have a son who is
about to enter college.
</P>
<P>
   In her research, Ms. Jackson focused on the electronic and
optical properties of atomic particles within layers of different
materials, an important aspect in the design and manufacture of
semiconductors. But her experience as a student leader at MIT had
kindled an interest in public service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Ms. Jackson was nominated to head the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, several anti-nuclear groups opposed her
appointment because she had served on the boards of both Public
Service Electric and Gas, a utility that operates nuclear power
plants, and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, an
industry-backed watchdog organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jackson ended up surprising the group. She shook up the
commission's staff, overhauled the procedure used to evaluate
safety performance at nuclear power plants and opened up commission
hearings to groups on both sides of the nuclear power debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion she was the best chairman the NRC has ever had,
from a safety and public-awareness standpoint,'' said David
Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned
Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Avery said that her sister had a vulnerable side that people
outside of her family and close friends were rarely allowed see.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, during the annual hike with her sister and friends,
Ms. Avery recalled, the group came to some narrow logs thrown
across a deep creek. Ms. Jackson, in the lead as usual, walked over
without hesitating, giving the others confidence to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But later, as the group relaxed in the evening, Ms. Jackson
admitted that she had been frightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known that she was afraid,'' her sister said, ``we
would have never have gone across.''

CLINTON GOLFS, HILLARY POLITICKS AS VACATION UNFOLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Like so many First Ladies on so many summer
sojourns, Hillary Rodham Clinton would quietly slip into bookstores
and boutiques. She would lunch behind closed doors with authors and
artists. Then she would flash a smile and a fleeting wave to
bystanders as the Secret Service rushed her back to her island
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In the public's eye, she was President Clinton's all-but-silent
partner on his first four getaways to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Now this: As Bill Clinton Friday played as private a round of
golf as a president can play, Mrs. Clinton happily thrust herself
into the laserlike spotlight of the national media, playing to the
cameras in a carefully orchestrated event at a landmark Nantucket
whaling church as she pursued her historic evolution from
presidential spouse to US Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The first full day of the Clinton family's vacation had hardly
begun and already one fact was as clear as a ship bell's peel. With
Bill Clinton entering the twilight of his lame-duck presidency, the
Hillary Era has dawned.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day ended, Mrs. Clinton raised more than $100,000 for
her Senate campaign and was honored during a dinner for the
American Ireland Fund, a recognition that could boost her candidacy
with New York's vast Irish American population.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who followed his wife to the podium at the
American Ireland Fund event, praised Mrs. Clinton's peace efforts
in a way that also hinted at their divergent political
trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   ''The women are doing better than the men now,'' Clinton said.
He paused amid the crowd's laughter, then added, ''in promoting
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hillary Era could dissolve as quickly as it began if Mrs.
Clinton abandons her exploratory campaign for a Senate seat from
New York, or if she enters the race and loses. She has all but
announced her intention to seek the seat being vacated by Senator
Daniel P. Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mrs. Clinton showed Friday in a whirlwind tour of
Nantucket, she no longer is curling up with a book in the family's
borrowed home on the Vineyard while the president pursues his
marathon quest to perfect his golf game. Clinton played Friday at
the swank Nantucket Golf Club with a foursome that included Senator
John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bill Clinton's visit to Nantucket was said to be the
first by a sitting president, the golf match was kept so private
that news photographers never saw enough of Clinton to capture a
single image.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mrs. Clinton was on center stage for hours,
starting with an appearance to boost a restoration project at the
175-year-old United Methodist Church on Nantucket. As photographers
jostled for position in a scene that a pool reporter described as
''pandemonium,'' Mrs. Clinton appealed from the altar for donors to
help preserve the building as ''a real gift to the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton announced that $51,000 of the $148,000 needed for
the second phase of the restoration had been raised. And she tried
to boost the fund-raising effort by warning that the church's
demise would provide further evidence that ''we live in a real
throw-away culture.''
</P>
<P>
   With New York reporters hanging on every word, Mrs. Clinton
skirted any talk of the Senate race. Her only reference to New York
was praise for an effort to preserve Harriet Tubman's house there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton left the church to cheers and applause from the
crowd outside, and she enthusiastically greeted scores of onlookers
before she continued her tour of the island, including a shopping
excursion. The crowd responded in kind, as they had when the
Clintons arrived the day before at Martha's Vineyard Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be pleased to vote for her in the primary and the general
election,'' said Mary Flanagan, 42, of Port Washington, N.Y., a
summer resident of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less enamored of Mrs. Clinton, who has been a
lightning rod for criticism at least since her prominent role in
the president's failed effort in 1993 to overhaul the nation's
health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after David Stein, a corporate consultant from New York,
expressed awe Thursday at shaking President Clinton's hand at the
Martha's Vineyard Airport, Stein said he was ''unimpressed'' by
meeting Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't in any way get a charge out of shaking her hand,''
Stein said. ''I'd rather shake Robert DiNiro's hand than Hillary's
any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein, like many New Yorkers, said he remains uncertain about
Mrs. Clinton's motives for exploring a New York Senate race. ''I'm
not sure if she is really looking to help New York or using us as a
step ladder,'' said Stein, 52, who lives in Mahopac, N.Y., and has
a summer home in West Tisbury.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than 100 supporters donated at least $1,000 each at a
private reception  &UR; last night &LR;  to help fund Mrs. Clinton's
prospective Senate race. The reception was held at the sprawling,
Nantucket mansion of the former US ambassador to Portugal,
Elizabeth Bagley, where Clinton earlier in the day recorded his
weekly radio address that is scheduled to be broadcast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bagley estate, like many in the area, flew the flags of the
United States and Ireland, as did the home of Bob and Mia Matthews,
who hosted the American Ireland Fund dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy was supposed to co-host the Matthews
event but didn't show up. Those close to the senator said he is
still exhausted by the death of his nephew, John F. Kennedy Jr.,
and his wife and her sister. Kennedy has not kept a public schedule
since Congress recessed earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   If Kennedy does not hold court with the president during this
vacation, it will be the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bagley event marked the first time the president formally
spoke on Mrs. Clinton's behalf at a fundraiser. But in the end, the
day belonged to Mrs. Clinton, as, in the public's eye, might the
rest of the vacation.

   DEGIRMENDERE, Turkey _ This summer resort town on the Sea of
Marmara lost more than 1,000 lives in the earthquake, and Friday
the town square was full of survivors trying to figure out how to
marshal the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the first day after the quake struck, Degirmendere felt
stranded, begging the authorities and volunteers to bring them
essentials like food and body bags. But by Friday trucks were
clogging the main road, delivering tomatoes, bread, bottled water
and used clothing, dumping them into piles that were spilling off
sidewalks onto the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the chaos stood Mayor Akalin Ertugryl, his eyes
bleary and his hands shaking from exhaustion, trying to pull
together a relief effort that was spinning off in different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with food,'' he said as he interrupted a
delegation of anxious women to talk to a Turkish military officer
who had arrived to oversee the rescue effort. ``The civilian and
military authorities are working together, but it is not so
organized.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the mayor and others in the town, Degirmendere is
now able to tend to its dead, but its biggest concern now is
medicine for the growing number of people suffering from dysentery
and other stomach ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road at a crisis center set up by the Turkish military
outside the Golcuk Naval Base, the atmosphere was more orderly.
There Vice Adm. Bulent Alpkaya was meeting with his staff,
dispatching the three engineering brigades called in to oversee the
rescue effort in Degirmendere and in Golcuk, one of the hardest-hit
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the naval base collapsed on the night of the
quake, killing many high-ranking officers who had gathered for a
celebration. Alpkaya said 146 people had been killed and 127
rescued. Work continues to clear the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just yesterday in the city we took 28 children out of the
rubble, all of them alive,'' he said. ``We have airlifted 600
people to Istanbul hospitals and have established an air bridge to
Ankara so that hospitals here can continue to take in new
arrivals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, every hour, it is getting more organized,'' the
admiral said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of rescue workers from France, Israel, Russia, Germany and
Britain are in the Golcuk area, working around the clock. But
Alpkaya said more experts and equipment are needed to recover the
survivors and the victims still believed to be in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The French team _ made up of 61 rescue workers, four doctors,
six dogs and a veterinarian _ spent 12 hours, using sophisticated
cameras and heat sensitive devices, pulling two people out of one
collapsed building, Col. Bernard Modere said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of reinforced concrete construction, if it doesn't
flatten out completely, can leave spaces where people can remain
alive,'' he said. ``If the people are in those spaces, they can
survive up to a week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is gigantic,'' he said. ``And there is never enough
help _ that is the definition of a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two days, several boatloads of Istanbul University
students have been arriving at the Golcuk navy base, eager to help
the rescue effort. Some came bearing brand new shovels and pick
axes, hard hats and gardening gloves, as well as boxes and bags of
bread, toilet paper, disposable diapers, juice and milk.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rescue work moves into its final stages, requiring
trained specialists or heavy machinery, the volunteers were finding
that their help was in many cases superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   After the four-hour boat ride from Istanbul, one group from the
Istanbul Technical University was greeted by an instructor who told
them they might have to turn around and go back.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, jobs for the students were found, carrying rubble
off rescue sites or unloading cartons of goods off the boats and
trucks. ``We are not trained to do anything else,'' one young woman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Turks, the rescue operations were a woeful reminder
of how unprepared Turkey is to deal with a powerful earthquake,
even though much of the country and most of its population are in
high-risk zones.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish teams do not have search dogs or the sort of
equipment that the foreign crews brought with them. And the
volunteer effort was ad hoc, thrown together by sympathetic
enthusiasts at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Turkey's biggest problems is the lack of
nongovernmental organizations,'' said Haran Ilhan, a graduate of
the Technical University who turned up on the boat Friday with
classmates drawn together by a blitz of faxes and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The same lament was echoed Friday in newspaper columns in which
commentators noted that Turkey is now paying the price for a
political system that has discouraged the growth of civic
associations, for fear that they would challenge the authority of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I for one would direct an accusing finger at those in
authority who never trust their own people,'' wrote Fehmi Koru, a
columnist for the English-language Turkish Daily News. He spoke of
those in authority ``who feel forever uneasy when they see the
people mobilizing as responsible civilians to take their fate in
their own hands, and who've consistently forbidden them to organize
into either religious or nonreligious groups.''

FORMER CIA DIRECTOR STRIPPED OF SECURITY CLEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Central Intelligence Agency announced on Friday
that it had suspended the security clearance of its former
director, John Deutch, after concluding that as director he had
improperly handled national secrets on a desktop computer at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's actions, which occurred during the 18 months he served
as director of central intelligence before resigning in December
1996, left highly classified information on an unsecured computer,
vulnerable to spies or computer hackers, the agency concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the suspension, the agency said the
current director, George Tenet, imposed the suspension ``for an
indefinite period of time'' after the agency's inspector general
concluded that Deutch had created a risk to the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
   While the inspector general's report ``found no evidence that
national security information was lost, the potential for damage to
U.S. security existed as a result of the actions described in the
report,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down, Deutch continued to serve in advisory roles
that required access to classified information, including as a
consultant to Tenet and as chairman of the Commission on
Non-Proliferation, a group mandated by Congress that recently
completed a study of the spread of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Deutch arose days after he stepped down as
director, when CIA technicians reviewing equipment in his house in
Maryland discovered highly classified information on a desktop
computer. Although the computer belonged to the agency, it was not
equipped to contain classified information.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Newsweek magazine reported that the technicians had
discovered 31 secret files, including documents related to Iraq and
a 1996 terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American
troops. Officials at the agency declined to discuss the files in
greater detail, so the extent of lapses by Deutch and the nature of
the data involved remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is the first time in the agency's 52 years that a
former director has been stripped of access to highly classified
information. In his own statement released by the agency, Deutch
expressed regret for his mishandling of the information and
acknowledged that he had failed to follow the strict rules for
safeguarding secrets. He said he respected Tenet's decision to
suspend his clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that I never considered the
information to be at risk or intended to violate security
procedures,'' Deutch said. ``But good intentions are simply not
good enough. Strict compliance is the standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch's case has parallels to the one against Wen Ho Lee, a
physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico who
was dismissed in March after being accused of transferring
classified computer files to a personal computer. Lee, who has
denied the accusations, remains the subject of an investigation
into whether he passed information about the nation's nuclear
arsenal to China.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the decision to discipline Deutch
had nothing to do with the furor over Lee and China's espionage.
But an associate of Deutch suggested the furor over security lapses
at Los Alamos had created a climate that made it difficult for the
agency not to punish Deutch harshly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Los Alamos factored in,'' said the associate,
who would speak on the condition of not being named, ``but it is a
difficult period.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the accusations about China's espionage surfaced,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson appointed Deutch to review
security at the weapons laboratories, but Deutch withdrew a short
time later.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of Deutch's security clearance precludes him from
serving in those kinds of positions.
</P>
<P>
   The director of central intelligence has the power to review and
lift a suspension, but that seems unlikely in Deutch's case, given
the agency's findings against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigated Deutch's actions but after a
yearlong inquiry declined to charge him with criminal wrongdoing.
However, the department referred its findings to the CIA for
disciplinary proceedings after concluding that his actions were
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch said in his statement that he had erred by using his
personal computer ``to compose classified documents and
memoranda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While it was absolutely necessary for me to work at home and
while on travel,'' he said, ``in hindsight it is clear that I
should have insisted that I be provided the means of accomplishing
this work in a manner fully consistent with all the security rules.
No one, including the director, is exempt from compliance with
these rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, now a professor of chemistry at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, served for nearly four decades in various
national security positions, including as undersecretary of energy
and deputy secretary of defense.

NO DISCO, PLEASE, WE'RE TRADE REPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 22, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New Zealand's Mike Moore takes over next month as director
general of the World Trade Organization, he faces a tall order. For
starters, he has to get ready in just three months for the trade
ministers' December meeting in Seattle at which a complicated new
round of negotiations lasting many years is expected to commence.
</P>
<P>
   A fast start is only part of the problem facing Moore. He must
prepare to make a fast finish, too. After a year-long stand-off
between industrial and developing nations failed to produce a
consensus candidate, they agreed to split between them the director
general's six-year term. Moore gets three years, and Supachai
Panitchpakdi serves for three years after that.
</P>
<P>
   In certain ways, it is a good progression. Moore, 50, is an
unusually attractive combination, a labor movement visionary and
free trader whose most recent tract is called ``A History of the
Future.'' He catapulted to prominence 1972 when he became the
youngest member ever elected to New Zealand's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Panitchpakdi, 53, is a Rotterdam University economist turned
bureaucrat. He was Thailand's deputy prime minister during the
recent crisis and, not surprisingly, was often critical of the
austerity measures prescribed by the International Monetary Fund.
As a result, the United States worked vigorously behind the scenes
to keep him out of the job. But none doubt his commitment to the
principles of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man resembles his predecessors: the geopolitical
strategist Arthur Dunkel (he sometimes carried along the ten-year
Uruguay Round of negotiations on sheer strength of will); or ramrod
Peter Sutherland, who brought the treaty to its successful
completion in 1994; or even the affable Renato Ruggiero, who
breathed life into the fledgling World Trade Organization (though
Moore joked that his chief credential for the job was that he
looked a lot like Ruggiero.)
</P>
<P>
   It may not matter much, though, now that globalization has
entered a new realm of political sophistication, with the
highly-visible WTO succeeding the hidden-in-plain-sight General
Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade, or GATT.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States is far and away the world's biggest
trading nation, much depends on the results of the next US
elections, congressional and presidential. But the rest of the
world has grown a great deal, so progress on trade also depends
critically on the ability of the WTO head to serve as a kind of
referee, leaning against the tendency of the United States to
insist that every disputed call go in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain prospects were underscored last month in a two-day
meeting at Columbia University, sponsored by the university's law
school and its economics department. Present were a number of
senior figures from the trade commuity. The meeting was conceived
by Columbia economist Jagdish Bhagwati (who served for a time as
chief economic adviser to Arthur Dunkel) as a way of scouting out
the agenda for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seemed to be that there was no consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Among trade experts, the someday wish-list consists of generally
agreed-upon ``rules of the game'' in at least three new broad
areas.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to investment, hopes for a global agreement have
been chilled by the breakdown of talks aimed at an MAI (as a
Multilateral Agreement on Investment is known to the acronym happy
world of trade diplomacy) among the members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   If 23 broadly similar European nations can't agree on where to
draw the line between national sovereignty and global investment
guidelines, what hope is there that the larger community of nations
can agree on matters ranging from capital movements to intellectual
property protection.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to competition, the differences are even more
pronounced. In the United States, the measures designed to ensure
that firms compete with one another for the benefit of consumers
are known as the antitrust statutes. But few other countries have
embraced such tough prohibitions, and in many cultures
price-fixing, group boycotts, and other forms of cartel conduct
have an honored place, to say nothing of the higher forms of
restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The most controverial measures of all have to do with the
so-called ``linkage issues.'' These determined attempts to address
environmental and labor issues in the forum of the World Trade
Organization are the newly-discovered enthusiasm of large numbers
of activists. Representatives of some 600 NGOs (non-governmental
organizations) plan to converge on Seattle in December to plead
their cases _ everything from global warming to child labor to
animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Trade specialists often respond that environmental and social
issues should be pursued mainly in other venues, such as the
International Labor Organization, the World Health Organization,
and the United Nations Childrens Fund, or UNICEF. ``The usual rule
is that to kill two birds you need two stones,'' says economist
Bhagwati. ``Otherwise you risk missing both birds.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new visibility of the WTO has made it irresistable to
those seeking change. The best hope is that new and more
disciplined forums will arise for airing the concerns of consumers,
labor, business and environmental groups, and that new mechanisms
for creating consensus will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes of a new round of trade negotiations was
illustrated nicely by the US National Intelligence Council's
convening earlier this month of a elaborate mock ministerial
meeting behind tightly closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by Mark Suzman of the Financial Times, the US
Central Intelligence Agency (and spies in most other countries)
have turned to commercial intelligence now that the Cold War has
waned. Agents, former trade diplomats and academics took turns
trying to anticipate the bargaining strategems that others nations
are expected to bring to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious new undertakings on investment and competition
policies are unlikely to emerge from Seattle, despite the fond
hopes of companies like Boeing and Microsoft (which have paid
handsomely for the privilege of serving as hosts.) The NGOs
probably will upstage the formal proceedings. Uncertainty over the
elections will render diplomats more cautious than usual.
</P>
<P>
   What then, if anything, may be expected from a new round of
negotitions? In the absence of a preliminary consensus among the
rich and poor nations of the world, the best strategy would be to
aim low.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be hoped for from a Seattle round would be
another few years of work on lower trade barriers and improving
mechanisms for dispute resolution _ the basic blocking and tackling
of trade diplomacy. ``I heard one negotiator complaining that
merely reducing trade barriers is a dull business,'' says Bhagwati.
``He was a trade diplomat wanting more action -- for which he
should probably go to a disco.''

FELLS ACRES CASE RUNS COUNTER TO TREND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The cases are strikingly similar, the outcomes
radically different.
</P>
<P>
   In notorious day care center sexual abuse cases in California,
New Jersey and North Carolina, convicted abusers were let out of
jail or exonerated on appeal after lengthy, divisive
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, freedom came for the defendants after testimony
by child witnesses was judged to have been coerced or tainted by
overly aggressive investigators. In others, jurors found the
accounts of some children too fantastic, or the prosecution's
evidence inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for years, Cheryl Amirault LeFave's attorneys and supporters
made similar arguments on her behalf in the Fells Acres case, and a
Superior Court judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's all but certain that LeFave will be returning to
prison within a month after the state Supreme Judicial Court
rejected those arguments earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with prosecutors, defense attorneys, academics and
sex-abuse specialists, reasons for the difference are as divergent
and passionate as the opinions and emotions aroused by the case
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision Wednesday, the six-member court ruled
that Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein erred when he determined
in 1997 that LeFave and her mother, Violet Amirault, also convicted
in the case, had an inadequate defense at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also rejected the argument, raised in Borenstein's
1998 decision, that LeFave should have gotten a new trial because
her appellate lawyers found new evidence that children's testimony
can be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   To some legal experts, there are subtle but critical factual
distinctions between the Fells Acres case and the others. Some of
those cases fell apart because of inconsistent evidence, others
failed due to recanted testimony from the child victims.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the Virginia McMartin Preschool in affluent
Manhattan Beach, Calif., a 1983 abuse claim led to charges against
seven people, including McMartin and her son. But seven years
later, after two defendants had spent time in jail, a jury
deadlocked in 1990 and the case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the matter cost more than $13 million, making it the
longest and most expensive trial in US history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, prosecutors in North Carolina abandoned their case
against the Little Rascals day care center, where 29 children had
alleged sexual abuse _ but not before two defendants were convicted
and spent time behind bars. Their convictions were ultimately
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Still others attribute the different outcomes to the varying
personalities of the courts that tried _ and often retried _ the
abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Amirault controversy ``is probably one of
the most difficult cases the legal community . . . has had to
wrestle with,'' said Boston attorney Thomas Hoopes, a criminal
defense specialist and former Middlesex County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see really well-intentioned people on both sides taking very
strong opinions and having very strong beliefs, but the bottom line
in this case is that it's just very hard,'' Hoopes said.
``Sometimes there are powerfully conflicting forces in a case, and
the more diametrically opposed and more powerful they are, the
harder it is to weigh them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several local attorneys attribute last week's decision by the
Supreme Judicial Court to deny LeFave a new trial, effectively
sending her back to jail, to the high court's inherent
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that is absolutely clear is that this outcome had
nothing to do with the Amiraults,'' said Thomas G. Gutheil, a
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who has testified
in numerous abuse cases. ``It can only be about the political and
judicial system here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutheil and others contend that the SJC's ruling was influenced
by politics and administrative expediency as well as the desire to
end once and for all a case that has lingered in the state's court
system for 15 years. They also charge that the SJC didn't want to
risk the embarrassment of changing a position it had staked out
years before.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, some legal scholars say, then the justices'
ruling may have come at the expense of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know what happened at Fells Acres, just like the
communities that suffered through the other multiple abuse cases .
. . will never know with certainty'' if the defendants were guilty
or innocent, said Boston attorney Martin Weinberg, director of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a democracy, unlike in an accusatory system, when
there's uncertainty citizens remain free. It's the fundamental
notion of our nation's heritage, and I think that's been challenged
in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the SJC's ruling reject claims that the court's
decision was driven by anything but a careful review of the
evidence and testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many of the other cases, courts found technical reasons for
overturning convictions,'' said Boston attorney Laurence Hardoon,
the former lead prosecutor in Amirault case who is now in private
practice, ``so I don't think you can look at those cases and
conclude they were erroneously prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   And in several out-of-state cases, area lawyers noted,
prosecutors said they dropped charges not because their cases were
weak, but because they did not want to put the alleged victims
through the emotional toll of a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any consistent sentiment, it is that few people, if
any, have scrutinized the various cases both individually and
collectively in an effort to draw contrasts, comparisons and,
ultimately, conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very bad things that happen to kids and very bad
accusuations that are made against people that haven't done
anything wrong,'' said Stuart Grassian, a forensic psychiatrist who
studies sexual abuse. ``We have to be incredibly sober and humble
in trying to distinguish one from the other, because the
consequences of making wrong decisions in either case are so
overwhelming.''

SOUTH AMERICAN MARKETS COME UNDER PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Latin America's currency and bond markets
came under pressure on Friday as worries over the possibility of
default by Ecuador, one of the region's smaller countries, collided
with concern that political gridlock would slow its juggernaut,
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean officials assured investors the government would not
default on a $93.5-million bond payment later this month, but
markets were skeptical. Ecuadorean bonds plunged more than 11
percent on speculation about a default.
</P>
<P>
   A default would be the first on Brady bonds, the repackaged
securities designed by the former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, which helped Latin America emerge from a debt crisis in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian markets, which often come under selling pressure when
troubles emerge in Latin America, showed unusual signs of strain.
Brazil's currency, the real, weakened nearly 3 percent. It fell to
almost 2 reais to the dollar, its lowest value in five months,
before rebounding to 1.89 on news that the government had sold
six-month dollar-linked bonds, offering investors protection
against further falls in the currency. In New York, the real
settled at 1.99 to the dollar, down from 1.94 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian bonds were mixed. A basket of Brazil's dollar debt
lost as much as 0.9 percent, according to J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. The
widely traded C bond gained as much as 0.9 percent, to 58.813, with
the yield narrowing to 16.970 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Argentina, where the economy has been hurt by a
drop in commerce with Brazil, higher borrowing costs added to
concern about other countries in the region. Moody's Investors
Service placed the nation's credit ratings on review Friday for
possible downgrade, a move that led Argentine bonds to fall with
the debt of other Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, which in population and economic might is substantially
smaller than Brazil or Argentina, accounts for just a sliver of
investors' holdings of Latin American securities. Yet the
psychological effect of a rapidly deteriorating economy there, and
of concern that neighboring countries could be influenced if it
defaults, has led to a fresh assessment of risk throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for contamination is there,'' said Arturo
Porzecanski, the chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings.
``Just like Russia showed the world a former superpower could
default, Ecuador could show its neighbors that avoiding a
moratorium is not sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   As problems in Ecuador prompted some investors to trim their
exposure to Brazil, growing concern over the ability of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration to control spending
triggered additional anxiety. There have been several examples in
recent days of pressure on government finances.
</P>
<P>
   This week, thousands of farmers marched on Brazil's capital
city, Brasilia, to call for a restructuring of about 11 billion
reais, or $5.7 billion, in debt with state-controlled financial
institutions. Although Cardoso refused to accede to their demands,
Congress overwhelmingly showed support for the farmers. And it is
in Congress that the president hopes to win approval for austerity
measures to prevent a worsening of the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, members of Congress began considering raises
for themselves. If the raises are approved, cries for similar pay
increases could cascade throughout the civil service. Worries that
the central government may assume some debt obligations of state
administrations contributed to the gloom over the its effectiveness
in dealing with these challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil did a very good job handling the economy in the first
half of the year, but the challenge now is political rather than
economic,'' said Carlos Novis Guimaraes, the head of investment
banking for Latin America at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Some indicators show an improvement in the economy, among them
rising direct foreign investment, which climbed 64 percent, to
$17.1 billion, in the first half of this year. Such inflows of
long-term capital helped fuel the second consecutive quarter of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet concern over the deficit or over problems in neighboring
countries could keep the central bank from lowering interest rates,
now at 19.5 percent. That possibility adds to anxiety over the
effect that such rates have on public finances, because the
government needs to pay higher premiums on its bonds to attract
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is hurt by these momentary spikes of concern,''
said Thomas Trebat, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney. ``But
really, what we see after taking a deep breath is a region that's
lagging the rest of the world into recovery. Problems that put a
chill on capital flows now will be forgotten by next year.''

 &HT;    Georgia governor appoints board to oversee tobacco settlement
distribution
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes has given an $80,000-a-year part-time
job to a former state revenue commissioner whose agency once lost
track of $1.5 billion in sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes announced Friday that Marcus Collins, who ran the state
Revenue Department from 1983 until he resigned under fire following
a critical audit in 1996, will be executive director of the new
Georgia Tobacco Community Development Board. The panel will
distribute money from the tobacco settlement to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   To remain eligible to draw his annual $55,646 state pension,
Collins, 72, will work no more than 20 hours a week _ an hourly
wage of almost $77. In the new part-time job, Collins will almost
match his old salary from his full-time job as revenue
commissioner, which was $81,400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, along with a six-member board also appointed Friday,
will oversee about $22 million a year in payments to the state's
tobacco farmers. The money, which will be paid for 12 years, comes
from a secondary agreement to the state's $4.8 billion settlement
from the tobacco industry. His salary will come from the settlement
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' appointment drew criticism from those who remembered
his departure from the Revenue Department, which followed the
disclosure that his agency had reimbursed cities and counties based
on estimates because it couldn't accurately track sales tax
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty thousand dollars a year for 20 hours a week of work?
Cronyism is alive and well,'' said Senate Minority Leader Eric
Johnson (R-Savannah). ``I just hope he doesn't lose any of the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Barnes defended the appointment, which
will be made official when the new board meets in Atlanta on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus Collins is very knowledgeable about farming issues,''
said Joselyn Butler, the governor's press secretary. ``That,
combined with his experience in government, the governor felt, made
him ideally suited to the position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the problems at Revenue,'' Butler added, ``a lot of
that was not of his making.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who has earned $40,266 a year _ in addition to his
pension _ as a part-time aide to House Speaker Tom Murphy since
1997, will be eligible for benefits from the fund he will oversee,
since he grows tobacco on his farm near the Mitchell County town of
Cotton. At Barnes' request, the state attorney general's office
issued an advisory opinion saying such payments would not violate
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home Friday, Collins said that if his new job
requires more than 20 hours a week, ``I'll donate the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to discuss how his new salary was set.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I say won't have any effect on what you write,'' he told
a reporter. ``You can write anything you care to.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan signaled the start of a far-reaching consolidation
of its bloated and debt-ridden banking system Friday with official
word that three of the country's biggest banks would unite to form
the world's largest financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement announced by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.,
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. was viewed by
economists and investors as a significant change, but not because
of the combination's colossal size. Rather, they said it would
hasten mergers among other Japanese banks, winnowing the weakest
and helping to reduce what has been one of the biggest drags on the
Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Banks in Japan have suffered from years of bad loans, low
profits and antiquated technology despite numerous government
efforts to strengthen the system. Many continue to lose money or
are marginally profitable but there has been little pressure on
them to find partners. Analysts said the three-way tie-up announced
Friday, which was strongly endorsed by government officials,
suggested that era was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size of course is not everything, but this does show a major
change in the mindset of Japanese bank management,'' said J. Brian
Waterhouse, an analyst for HSBC James Capel. ``Up until this year,
Japanese banks were determined to be independent, and suddenly we
have three major banks getting together.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement caused a surge in bank shares on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, as investors bet that the 18 major Japanese banks
would eventually fall to fewer than half that number and make the
survivors far more profitable simply by reducing the number of
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While executives of the three Japanese merger partners said they
were determined to become a global force, American and European
banks saw little competitive threat from the combination, nor did
they see it as an obstacle to a push by foreign banks to enter
Japan's market.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way alliance, which the partners hope to formally
establish by the fall of 2000, would create a giant with $1.3
trillion in assets, the benchmark for measuring a bank's size.
</P>
<P>
   It would dwarf the current world leader, Deutsche Bank AG, which
has $866 billion in assets, as well as the biggest American bank,
Citigroup, which has $668 billion. The bank also would be twice the
size of what is now Japan's largest bank, the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which has about $580 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we will be the world's top bank in terms of assets,
we will not remain content just at that,'' Masao Nishimura,
Industrial Bank's president, told a news conference. ``We aim to be
among the world's top five banks in terms of capital, profits,
services and other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The union of three major Japanese banks comes at a time when
there have been signs of a revival in the Japanese economy, which
has been suffering through the worst recession since World War II.
The yen, the most visible symbol of the country's economic might,
has risen to the strongest levels in seven months. Japan's stock
market has soared this year on a bet by many international
investors that the country may finally be turning around.
</P>
<P>
   The banking merger in Japan also comes against a backdrop of
consolidation among the biggest banks elsewhere. Deutsche Bank
recently acquired Bankers Trust Corp. of the United States,
Citicorp and Travelers Inc. merged in the United States, UBS was
created through the combination of Switzerland's two biggest banks
and France's Banque Nationale de Paris is acquiring control of
rival Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Japanese merger deal, the three partners will put
their retail banking, investment banking and brokerage subsidiaries
under common management and cut costs by combining overlapping
businesses. The banks said that by uniting, they also expected to
save on the huge costs of installing new information technology.
</P>
<P>
   The banks said that once the merger becomes complete they plan
to eliminate 6,000 jobs, reducing the entire work force to about
29,000 people, and cut the total number of branches from the
current 704 to 620.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that the employee reductions did not go far
enough and reflected what they called a resistance on the part of
Japanese banks to shed one of the biggest drains on profitability,
a bloated work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite their size, I'm rather skeptical that they can compete
on an international scale unless they undertake some serious
restructuring,'' said Toru Nakakita, a professor of economics at
Tokyo University. ``I hate to say this but I think we've created
another Titanic: We have the biggest bank in the world but it's
certainly not the most competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that unless such mergers make banks more profitable,
they would not help the banks absorb the hundreds of billions of
dollars in bad debts that still litter their books. The government
has sought to help by slashing interest rates to nearly zero, which
lowers the cost of borrowing for the banks, and has injected money
into the largest banks to strengthen them. But many of these old
debts, vestiges of loans made during the speculative real estate
boom in the 1980s, will never be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident that this government is better at reforming the
banking system than previous governments,'' said Mary Davis, chief
economist for emerging markets in Asia at Credit Suisse First
Boston in London. If such mergers strengthen the banks, she said,
``it could be a significant development, but they've had this
enormous bad debt problem which they have just begun to address and
there's so much more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of the three-way merger, industry officials and
analysts said Friday that they doubted Japanese regulators would
challenge it as anticompetitive. ``Regulators think that there are
too many banks in Japan, so merging banks makes it easier to
improve profits,'' said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst for Merrill
Lynch. ``I'd be surprised if the government tries to block this.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hakuo Yanagisawa, chairman of the Financial
Reconstruction Commission, Japan's regulatory body, said: ``We
sincerely welcome the move, which meets expectations for creating a
top-notch institution from Japan that can withstand stiff
international competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The shares of all three banks, which rose Thursday on news that
they were in talks, surged Friday on the announcement of a deal.
Shares of Dai-Ichi Kangyo gained 11 percent, Fuji rose 9.4 percent
and Industrial Bank of Japan rose 10.2 percent. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange's bank index, a measure of bank stocks, rose 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks are among 15 major Japanese banks that received
7.5 trillion yen (about $675 billion) in public funds from the
government to help resolve their massive loan problems.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the cash infusion, the banks agreed to
restructure their operations and become more profitable. The banks
are now under pressure to make good on those promises.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the three banks that plan to unite said Friday that
they planned to concentrate investment in computer systems for
payment settlements, management of databases, credit risk
assessments and other electronic banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese banks are far behind their foreign competitors in
the use of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the three banks will jointly establish a
holding company by the fall of 2000. Bank operations will be
gradually integrated into the holding company over a two-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Individual shares of the three banks will be exchanged for a new
share in the holding company, which will be listed on stock
exchanges after the three banks exit the exchanges, the banks said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major Japanese banks Friday confirmed their intention
to combine operations under a similar holding company arrangement,
which could also lead to a merger. In response to inquiries from
local reporters, a spokesman for Tokai Bank Ltd. and Asahi Bank
Ltd. said the two institutions planned to establish a joint holding
company in the year 2001. The banks originally announced the deal
last September.
</P>
<P>
   The combined assets of the two banks are about $531 billion,
which would make the new entity Japan's second-largest bank and the
seventh-largest worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not scale that we are aiming for in this union,'' said
Tsuyoshi Yamashita, a spokesman for Tokei Bank. ``We are investing
in our ability to offer customers a wider range of products. For
example, it's too costly for us to do investment banking along, so
we are seeking mutual effectiveness with our merger.''

BUSH URGES PARENTS TO TALK TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ While remaining coy over whether he used drugs as
a young man, presidential candidate George W. Bush urged parents of
his generation Friday to use their experience and talk to their
children about the dangers of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think baby-boomer parents ought to say I've learned from
mistakes I may or may not have made in the past,'' the Texas
governor said after touring a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate arguably has faced the most challenging
week of his campaign as he tried to deal with growing media
pressure to answer the question of whether he had ever used illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had initially resisted responding to what he considered a
personal issue. But this week he has gradually confirmed that he
did not use drugs as far back as 1974, when he was 28.
</P>
<P>
   He would not confirm whether he had used drugs before that
period, only saying he made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked Friday what he would advise parents if their
children asked them about past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question facing baby boomers is, have we grown up?'' Bush
said. ``Are we willing to share the wisdom of past mistakes? The
message to all children is, don't do drugs and don't abuse
alcohol.``
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been reluctant to talk about the drug issue he
has talked about his past heavy drinking, which he gave up at age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said it was up to
Bush to decide how to handle the drug question and reaffirmed her
support for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to make the decision how he handles it,'' she said
Friday while visiting Austin. ``Only he knows what is best for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if felony drug use should disqualify someone from holding
public office years later, Hutchison replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Americans are very sophisticated in making judgments.
I think we have seen a number of people who have made mistakes in
the past. Everybody has made mistakes at some point in their lives.
And people will judge how long ago it was and what the nature of it
was, how it was handled on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison indicated that past drug use wouldn't cost the
governor her support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I'm going to look at what is good for this
country. I believe that Governor and Mrs. Bush will be great
representatives of our country as president and first lady. I have
every confidence that they will make us proud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's view seemed to mirror that of many Americans,
according to a poll released Friday by Time and CNN. Eighty-four
percent of those surveyed said that if Bush had used cocaine when
he was in his 20s _ and no credible evidence has surfaced that he
has _ it would not disqualify him from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans also were prepared to leave the question
unanswered as 58 percent said the media should now stop asking
about the issue. More than a third, 36 percent, believed the media
should pursue the question. And half of those who have followed the
issue believed Bush had done a good job of handling the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 942 adults was conducted Thursday and has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   While the drug question has dogged the presidential candidate
all week as he campaigned around the country, the intensity of the
media focus on the issue appeared to dim somewhat by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   At his Akron press conference he was asked about a variety of
other matters, even the matter he was in town to campaign on _ a
tour of the faith-based homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   After the tour of the shelter Bush traveled out to a hotel in an
affluent suburb to attend a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser for his
campaign. About 365 people attended the event.

JONES SEEMS READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Call the World Championships a trial run for
Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who plans to try for a record five gold medals at next
year's Olympics, wants an unprecedented four titles at these games,
which begin today.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, is competing in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, the
long jump and the 400- or 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 World Championships in Athens, Greece, Jones was the
lone female double gold medalist, winning the 100 and a leg on the
U.S. 400-meter relay team that set an American record.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who graduated from Thousand Oaks High, said her quadruple
in Seville is part of a buildup planned by her coach Trevor Graham
heading into the 2000 Olympics. The world championships follow
Jones' extraordinary performance at the 1998 U.S. championships in
which she became the first female in 50 years to win national
titles in the 100, 200 and the long jump in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were preparing way back then for what we are going to do
this year and obviously in Sydney, so I have had a little bit of
experience competing in multiple events,'' said Jones, who competes
in qualifying rounds of the 100 and long jump today.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100, 200 and long jump
in 1998, has been undefeated in the 100 and 200 for the last two
years. Only world-record holder Florence Griffith-Joyner has run
faster than Jones, who has timed 10.65 seconds and 21.62 in the 100
and 200.
</P>
<P>
   She faces her hardest test in the long jump, where she has lost
three times in the past year. In June, Dawn Burrell defeated Jones
in the USA Track and Field Championships to hand Jones her first
loss by an American in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Jones attributed her difficulties to not having found her rhythm
on the runway, but said she has made adjustments since her last
competition in Linz, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone back to the drawing board and we have made the
necessary corrections,'' she said. ``I feel quite confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene will be seeking gold medals in the 100, 200 and
400 relay. Greene, 25, has been on the rise since moving from
Kansas City to Los Angeles to train with the HSI track club under
the tutelage of UCLA sprint coach John Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Greene clocked 9.79 seconds to shatter the world 100
record of 9.84 set by Donovan Bailey of Canada at the 1996
Olympics. In the 200, Greene clocked 19.92 at Monaco on Aug.4 and
won at the U.S. championships despite stumbling out of the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just eager to get on the track,'' Greene said. ``They say
it's very fast. I'm eager to see how fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crear of Valencia, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist and
runner-up in the 1997 World Championships, has been in top form
this season. Crear defeated Olympic and world champion Allen
Johnson to win the U.S. trials, then followed that with a 12.98
clocking in Zagreb last month for the world's only sub-13 second
race this season.
</P>
<P>
   John Godina, a former NCAA champion from UCLA who trains with
newly appointed Bruins men's coach Art Venegas, is the two-time
defending world champion in the shot put. Godina has the world's
best put this season at 72 feet, 3 inches, and has produced four of
the top 12 puts in the world. He also has the second-best mark in
the world in the discus this season at 226-6{.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inaugural World Championships in 1983, the U.S. has
won more medals than any other country. The 132 medals (60 gold, 33
silver and 39 bronze) is 23 more than second-place Germany. In the
1997 World Championships, the U.S. led all nations with 18 medals.
</P>
<P>
   A record 203 countries are taking part in the championships in
Seville. No other sporting competition, including the Olympics, has
been attended by so many different nations. The previous record was
198 at the 1997 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Equally notable, however, will be the absence of several notable
performers _ including Ato Boldon, Sergei Bubka, Merlene Ottey,
Dennis Mitchell and Javier Sotomayor
</P>
<P>
   Boldon, the 1997 world champion from UCLA and Trinidad and
Tobago, is out for the season because of a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, winner of 14 world championship medals including six gold
medals, and expected to be one of Jones' top challengers in the
sprints, tested positive for the banned substance Nadrolone earlier
this week. Sotomayor, of Cuba, the world record-holder and 1992
Olympic champion from Cuba who tested positive for cocaine at the
Pan American Games in July, has withdrawn because of a herniated
disc.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the 1999 U.S. champion and 1996 Olympic bronze
medalist, competed in the national championships in June but failed
in an attempt to have a two-year ban for a positive drug test
overturned by the IAAF.

BUSH SEEKS TO SHIFT DRUG DISCUSSION TO CAMPAIGN ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRLAWN, Ohio _ Gov. George W. Bush, finishing his first tough
week on the Presidential campaign trail, tried Friday to use the
stir over his answers about possible drug use as proof of the need
to elevate American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of this country reject trash-mouth politics, and so
do I,'' Bush told 363 Republicans who paid $1,000 a plate to hear
him at a lunch here. ``The people of this country want a campaign
that is positive and hopeful and optimistic. I will have a campaign
that appeals to our better angels, not our darker impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor dealt with drugs in the speech, saying
children should be told that ``drugs will destroy you.'' But
neither here nor at an earlier news conference in Akron did the
topic that has followed him all week arise directly: whether he
ever used illegal drugs and why he will not deny it, if he had not.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Bush gave another awkward answer, like
those earlier in the week in which he stated periods during which
he did not use drugs, that have made the issue linger rather than
go away.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what he thought parents from the baby boom
generation should say, after telling a child not to use drugs, if
the child asked, ``Well, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ``I think the baby boomer parent ought to say,
`I've learned from mistakes I may or may not have made. And I'd
like to share some wisdom with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who has large leads in fund raising and public
opinion polls in the race for next year's Republican presidential
nomination, looked tired as he stopped first at the Haven of Rest
Ministries in Akron, an example of the faith-based institutions he
says the government should rely on more to help solve social
problems. But he seemed more at ease with reporters than on
Wednesday, the second day of the first storm to hit his campaign,
which had been sailing smoothly until now.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's complaints, both at the news conference and later in his
speech here, challenged the occasionally intense personal
questioning of presidential candidates, a recent reality of
American politics. But what he has been through this week does not
even remotely compare with the interrogations faced by Sen. Gary
Hart before he dropped out of the Democratic race in 1987, or by
Bill Clinton, who withstood accusations of adultery and
draft-dodging before winning the Democratic nomination in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the resonance of the issue has been Bush's claim
to success in fighting crime and drugs as governor. In 1997 there
were 26,436 arrests for possession of cocaine in Texas, and by
1998, the last year for which data are available, cocaine arrests
had increased to 28,158, Mike Cox, the spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's prison system, 13,501 inmates are being held on
various cocaine charges, including possession, sale and
manufacturing. That is about 10 percent of the state's prison
population.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of first-time offenders caught selling or
possessing one gram or less of illegal drugs are given probation,
said Tony Fabelo, executive director of the State's Criminal
Justice Policy Council, a state agency. Bush secured passage of a
law that gives judges the option of probation or jail; previously,
probation was required by law.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, other than saying he would not discuss what he had
told his own daughters, the governor spoke about the drug issue in
generational terms. At the news conference he said, ``I think
parents, particularly baby-boomer parents, ought to say to
children, `Do not use drugs.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``One of the interesting questions facing baby boomers
is, Have we grown up? Are we willing to share the wisdom of past
mistakes?''
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon, Bush was enthusiastically introduced by a
Republican colleague, Gov. Bob Taft, who said, ``Ohio is Bush
country,'' and by the Rev. Jim Wright of the St. Thomas Greek
Orthodox Church, who said in his invocation that Bush would
``restore dignity and honor not only to the Presidency but to the
politics of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used those themes himself. He told the applauding diners
that if elected President he would not only ``swear to uphold the
law of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the dignity and
the honor of the office to which I have been elected, so help me,
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to elevate politics,'' he said, ``after a time of
tarnished ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   On general policy questions, Bush covered familiar ground.
Arguing for more reliance on institutions like the Haven of Rest
Ministry, he declared that ``while government can hand out money,
it cannot put hope in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for tax cuts, saying, ``I support reducing marginal
rates so we can continue to have high-quality, high-paying jobs in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   And he defined his philosophy of compassionate conservatism this
way: ``It's conservative to cut taxes. It's compassionate to give
people their own money back so they can save and work and build.''
</P>

 CONTROVERSY DOESN'T STOP McCAIN, DOLE FROM PICNICKING WITH FINED By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Elizabeth Dole plan
to attend an annual Republican Party picnic on Saturday at a lush
island estate near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on Friday criticized their participation because
the event's host is a businessman who was fined $5 million by the
Federal Election Commission for making illegal donations to
political campaigns. The fine ranks as the third largest in history
for federal election-law violations.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, Thomas Stewart, also served a 60-day home
detention sentence last year after pleading guilty to federal
misdemeanor charges. He has invited all nine of the Republican
presidential candidates to the annual picnic at his Misty Isle
Ranch on Vashon Island near Seattle. But only McCain, the Senate's
leading advocate for campaign-finance reform, and Mrs. Dole have
agreed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   McCain declined to participate in the Iowa straw poll last week,
dismissing it as ``a scam.'' But his supporters said he agreed to
attend the picnic at Stewart's home because it was an opportunity
to bring his message of campaign-finance reform to a large crowd.
Organizers said 8,000 people were expected to attend the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more important to us to take the issue of
campaign-finance reform to the voters of Washington state than it
was to be concerned about this one individual who happened to be a
part of the event,'' said Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain's
campaign. ``This is not about the individual whose home the event
is at.''
</P>
<P>
   A top aide of Mrs. Dole's acknowledged that there was a debate
inside the campaign about whether to attend the picnic. After
lengthy deliberations, Mrs. Dole decided to attend, saying the
benefits far outweighed the inevitable criticism from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paid his fine and justice was served,'' Ari Fleischer, a
spokesman for the Dole campaign, said of Stewart. ``But does this
also mean that the Democrats who are criticizing will never attend
a Yankees game because George Steinbrenner was once fined? A lot of
hypocrisy going around.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York Yankees, was
convicted of making illegal contributions to President Richard
Nixon's 1972 campaign, but later pardoned by President Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Republican candidates, including Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and publisher Steve Forbes, were also invited to
attend this year's picnic, but they declined because of scheduling
conflicts, organizers said today.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Berendt, chairman of the Washington State Democratic Party,
criticized McCain and Mrs. Dole. ``It's especially ironic that
Senator McCain, an outspoken critic of dirty money in politics,
would come here to pay homage to a poster child for
campaign-finance reform,'' Berendt said Friday. ``Elizabeth Dole
went to Iowa to buy votes last week, and now she's coming to
Seattle to do it again. The Republican picnic proves again that in
the GOP, money is more important than principle.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Stewart said that the criticism by Democrats was
unfair and that Stewart had paid his debt to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that this has been settled,'' said Gary L.
Odegard, the vice president of corporate communications for
Stewart's food services company, Services Group of America. ``His
penalties have been paid and no such occurrence will take place
again. There's nothing here to suggest that this has any relevancy
to what will take place here this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 54, pleaded guilty to 24 misdemeanors for illegally
disguising about $100,000 worth of campaign donations, typically by
funneling them through employees of his company.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is the chief executive of his company, which is
privately held. The company's subsidiary, Food Services of America,
was fined $1 million in 1997 for selling tainted meat and poultry
in the northwestern United States.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-finance fine has hardly diminished Stewart's
enthusiasm for politics. ``I've never run from a fight in my
life,'' he told The Associated Press last year. Since then, Stewart
has continued to give large contributions to the Republican Party.
In the last decade, he has given more than $2 million to Republican
causes, making him the party's most generous donor in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, Tom Stewart was fined for tainted meat,''
Berendt said. ``Last year, he was fined for tainted money. Now he
wants to leave his mark on the presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's picnic, guests will partake of free soft drinks
and hot dogs. But more important than the free food, the picnic
offers candidates a valuable campaign stop. The Washington primary
comes relatively early, on Feb. 29, and is considered an important
one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich attended, drawing an
avalanche of criticism from Washington state Democrats. In past
years, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi and Jack Kemp have attended
the picnic.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, Aug. 19,
about press inquiries on whether Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had
ever used drugs referred incorrectly to the drug-related questions
posed to job applicants at the Clinton White House. Prospective
employees are asked to disclose any use of illegal drugs as far
back as age 18 (not during the previous seven years or to age 18,
whichever is more recent). Mr. Bush has declined to answer whether
he could deny using illegal drugs since he was 18.

about the Navy's ties to the Tailhook Association misstated the
military background of Senator John W. Warner, Republican of
Virginia. He served in the Navy in World War II, rising to the rank
of petty officer third class, and served again in the Marine Corps
in the Korean War as a communications officer, not as a pilot.

CHOPPING DOWN A LIMB BEFORE INVESTORS FALL OFF

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   News from the market stratosphere: Charles Schwab Corp., the
nation's largest discount and online brokerage firm, is steadily
reducing the number of stocks it allows its customers to buy using
borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 stocks are now off limits for Schwab customers
wishing to invest on margin. Expanding the list appears to be a way
for Schwab to protect itself against a plunge in prices that might
leave it holding the bag if the value of customers' shares falls
below the balances in their accounts. One customer says Schwab
employees told him the move was related to the firm's concerns
about the level of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel D. Hubbard, director of corporate communications at
Schwab, confirmed that the list of such stocks has expanded lately
but would not say how quickly or reveal which companies are on it.
Like many brokerage firms, Schwab has limited the amount of money
its customers can borrow to buy Internet shares, but most of these
stocks can still be bought on margin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the banned companies are thinly traded over-the-counter
stocks, Hubbard said: ``What we are trying to provide to the
customer is a sense of the volatile nature of securities markets in
general and margin investing.''
</P>
<P>
   David Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger &AMP; Harris in
St. Louis who is a Schwab customer, says the firm expressed
additional concerns when he called after having been notified that
securities he had bought on margin could no longer be bought that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Two Schwab employees, he said, told him that the switch was
motivated in part by fears held by the firm's risk committee that
the stock market would be increasingly volatile in coming months
and that share prices were vulnerable. Schwab told him it was
trying to protect itself and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard denied that Schwab is concerned about the broad market,
saying that any action by the firm was a result of liquidity
concerns. ``Say there's a stock that trades 1,000 shares a day,''
Hubbard explained. ``Say a customer owns that stock on margin and
the price goes down. Say the customer doesn't come up with the
required cash, and we have to sell the stock. That's going to drive
down the price.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eidelman pointed out that two of his holdings that were
scratched from the list _ Travis Boats &AMP; Motors Inc. and National
City Bancorporation _ trade fairly actively. In recent weeks,
Schwab also informed him that he could no longer borrow to buy
shares of American Bancorporation (Ohio). All three stocks can
still be bought on margin at six other firms Eidelman polled.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some of the stocks Schwab is eliminating from its
list of marginable securities are neither excessively volatile nor
overpriced glamour issues indicates that the firm may be concerned
about more than a few Internet fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is not alone in its concerns over vast numbers of
investors trading stocks on borrowed funds. Margin debt at the New
York Stock Exchange stands at $176.9 billion, a record that doesn't
count investors who have borrowed on credit cards to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing the number of stocks that its customers can buy on
margin, Schwab is giving up real money. Interest on customers'
borrowings is a big percentage of Schwab's net interest revenue,
which totaled $475.6 million last year, or 17 percent of all
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' Eidelman said. ``I can
see why Amazon.com, because of its volatility, is not marginable.
Or if trading is halted in a stock. But never to take a nice,
solid, stable company and say it's not marginable.''

UPSTARTS' RISKY CHALLENGE TO BABY BELLS

<P>
   For a long time, investing in the local telephone business meant
buying sleepy yet bedrock-solid stocks like those of the Baby
Bells. Substantially protected from competition until the enactment
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bells and other local
phone companies provided steady if unspectacular earnings growth,
healthy dividends and next to no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   As investments, these companies are still relatively
conservative and stable. But decades-old companies no longer have
the local communications business to themselves. Dozens of
upstarts, known in the communications business as competitive local
exchange carriers (or CLECs, pronounced ``SEE-lecks''), are out to
provide competition in local communications markets ranging from
phone service to corporate data applications. The companies hope to
use new communications technologies and lean cost structures to
undercut the local giants while still making money.
</P>
<P>
   Their stocks provide investors a new way to participate in the
local end of the communications revolution, but they are also an
entirely different breed of investment vehicle _ risky and erratic,
because of their dependence on borrowed funds. From mid-June to
mid-August, most of these stocks lost about 20 percent of their
market value, though they have started to crawl back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring a lot of rocket fuel to a portfolio,'' said Mark
Kastan, who tracks the stocks for Merrill Lynch. ``They could
significantly enhance performance. But it's obviously high-risk,
high-reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider RCN Corp., one of the few upstarts that is aimed at
residential customers, rather than at businesses. Along with
Nextlink Communications Inc., which was founded by Craig O. McCaw,
the cellular phone pioneer, RCN is one of Kastan's favorite CLEC's.
</P>
<P>
   RCN's stock opened 1998 at $17.0625, climbed as high as $30.625
and then fell that October to $8.75 as the bottom fell out of the
high-yield debt market. By April 1999, the shares had surged to
$54.50. But with interest rates rising, RCN's shares have swooned
again, closing on Friday at $39.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI was the only competitive player on the long-distance
landscape for a long time, and it was an unbelievably volatile
company,'' said Alex J. Mandl, chairman of Teligent Inc., a local
service provider that uses fixed wireless links. ``In a sense, I
think you're seeing a similar situation in the local environment,''
he said. ``As 30, 40, 50 percent of the local market is occupied by
new players, I think that volatility will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, said Alex W. Peters, a communications analyst
for Franklin Advisors and co-manager of the Franklin Global
Utilities fund, ``these are high-beta stocks, so they outperform
the market in good times and underperform in bad times.'' Among
Peters' favorites is McLeodUSA Inc., one of the more established of
the upstarts, which focuses on the Midwest and Rocky Mountain
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of whether times are good or bad for the CLEC's tend
to change swiftly, because creating local networks is very
expensive. Pulling optical fiber under downtown streets, for
instance, can cost tens of millions of dollars in one city.
</P>
<P>
   So to maintain their growth, almost all of them will have to
return to the high-yield well in the next 12 to 18 months. If
interest rates go up, so will the companies' cost of borrowing.
Because Wall Street values them on a discounted cash flow model
that focuses mostly on results in some distant year, a small change
in interest rates can imply a big swing in long-term valuations.
Some Wall Street analysts estimate that a 1 percent change in
interest rates can result in a 15 percent change in the value of
one of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been other, more industry-specific concerns, too
_ for example, the impact of a proposal by a coalition of big local
and long-distance phone companies to lower the per-minute fees that
long-distance carriers pay to their local counterparts for
beginning and ending calls. In exchange, the local carriers would
be able to charge their customers higher fixed monthly fees. If
approved by federal regulators, the plan would have a small but
negative impact on many of the local upstarts because they focus on
serving high-volume business users.
</P>
<P>
   But the essential issues facing investors in all these stocks
concern the basic structure of the telecommunications industry, not
relatively small regulatory questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, is the 100-year-old AT&AMP;T and Bell company
network the network for the next 10 or 20 years, given the way
people communicate now over the Internet?'' said David C. McCourt,
RCN's chairman. ``If the answer is no, then a basket of CLEC's is a
good investment. If the answer is yes, then CLEC's are not such a
great idea.''

 &HT;    Small Hall, but a big honor
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like Hollywood stars, four Braves heroes of yesteryear
pulled the wraps off bronzed, diamond-shaped plaques that are set
among the bricks in the Walk of Fame at Turner Field on Friday.
Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn and Phil Niekro received
smaller versions of the plaques to take home.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to these baseball legends was the recognition
that went along with their induction into the Braves Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening from park to park, it seems,'' Aaron said.
``It's a trend to have Walls of Fame or Halls of Fame. I'm just
happy that it happened because it could not have happened at all,''
said Aaron, who is in similar halls in Milwaukee, Eau Claire, Wis.,
Georgia, Alabama and the big one in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad people remember,'' Spahn said. ``They've got a statue
of me in Oklahoma. I wish I had that kind of recognition when I was
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's on the same level as Cooperstown,'' Mathews said.
``My saddest day was the day I got traded by the Braves to Houston.
I was going to hit my 500th home run as a Brave. I hit it in
Houston. But people never talk about me with Houston, or even
Detroit. So the Braves are stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperstown is big, there's 300 or 400 in that Hall of Fame,''
Niekro said. ``But there's only four here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves Hall of Fame is part of a new exhibit in the Braves
Museum at Turner Field. It features a highlight video on each
inductee's career with the Braves, historic photos and paintings of
each by noted illustrator Bart Forbes. The four men hold 75 percent
of all Braves career records and each was with the franchise for at
least 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ceremony began with a buffet luncheon in the 755 Club,
then moved outdoors to the plaza, where the sentiments of the four
honorees were as warm as the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy driving me in from the airport told me the Braves have
a putting green in their clubhouse,'' Mathews said. ``It got me
thinking about my first entrance into the Boston Braves clubhouse.
We had a clubhouse man named Short Pendleson. He walked me in and
took me over to this wall. He said, 'That's your nail.' Actually, I
had two nails. And a stool. You know, I was really proud of those
two nails and the stool. I was proud to be a Brave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) reminds me of a picture that is in Cooperstown of the
first inductees in baseball's Hall of Fame,'' Spahn said. ``One of
them happened to be Babe Ruth; he's got his legs crossed and he's
got his socks rolled. That was the thing of that era. So I've got
my socks rolled today because we are the first four inductees in
Atlanta's Hall of Fame. And what a cherished moment it is.

 &HT;    Burton sets record, takes Pepsi 400 pole
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Ward Burton is enjoying a career year in
Winston Cup. Burton, who is No. 11 in the points standings, has
accomplished a lot already this season without winning a pole or
race.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's qualifying at Michigan Speedway, the Pontiac No.
22 no longer lacks a Bud Pole. Burton set a track-qualifying record
of 188.843 mph to capture the top spot for the Pepsi 400 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team did it all,'' Burton said. ``(The car) was great from
the minute I got into it. All we did was a little fine tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, whose only career victory was at Rockingham in 1995,
will share the front row with Mike Skinner, who was clocked at
187.999 mph. Points leader Dale Jarrett, Geoffrey Bodine, and
Jeremy Mayfield round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ward was stronger than we were,'' Skinner said. ``We won
practice (against him), but he won qualifying. He had a perfect
lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who will start ninth on Sunday, had set the
previous record of 186.945 mph during the June race at Michigan
Speedway. It was Burton's first pole in 37 races since Pocono
during the '98 season, which was Burton's best in six years with a
16th-place finish in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
   Son ahead of father
</P>
<P>
   In his third Winston Cup race of the season, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
captured the No. 17 position for Sunday's race. His famous father,
however, ended up in the 35th position and will likely take a
provisional today to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just never got the car handling today,'' Dale Earnhardt Sr.
said sternly.
</P>
<P>
   Said the son, ``We made the first round, and I was worried at
the start of the year about just making the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. is scheduled to run in five Cup races this year, with
the final two being at Richmond, Va., and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecking crew
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan was not the only driver to make contact with the
wall during Busch practice on Friday. Gus Wasson was unhurt after
banging up the No. 96 Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Christopher, who suffered a bruised right knee during a
separate wreck, might consider changing the number on his No. 13
Chevy after this week's turn of events. He originally earned the
fourth position for today's NAPA 200, but it was disallowed due to
an unproven shock part. When he wrecked Friday morning, he was left
without a car to attempt second-round qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   Busch driver Mike McLaughlin, who is eighth in the Busch points
standings, has been picked up by Innovative Motorsports, Inc., for
the 2000 season. It's an expansion move for IMI, which already
fields a team for Andy Santerre. McLaughlin will finish out this
year with Cicci-Welliver Racing. ... Joe Nemechek, Cup driver of
the No. 42 Chevy, and Team SABCO are parting at the end of the
season under mutual agreement. ``This was an extremely difficult
decision for the both of us, but one we had been discussing for a
while,'' said Felix Sabates, owner of Team SABCO ... Sterling
Marlin was fined $5,000 for bumping Chad Little in the pit area
after last Sunday's Frontier at The Glen. Marlin had no complaints
with the fine. ``I did what I needed to do,'' Marlin said. ``If a
guy runs over me again, I'll do it again. I'm tired of getting run
over.''

 &HT;    Quarterback Barnette Wolfpack's backbone
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ North Carolina State's Jamie Barnette and
Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton are the top quarterbacks in the ACC,
probably in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Barnette, a shade under 6 feet and weighing 185 pounds, is
taller but about the same weight as Hamilton (5-10, 189), but
neither is big by college quarterback standards. No schools
recruited Barnette, a Roxboro, N.C., native, as a quarterback, but
his determination attests to his fortitude and single-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   Add his ability to run the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds, and any
plan Wolfpack coach Mike O'Cain may have had for using Barnette as
a flanker, safety or corner was set aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really have a choice,'' O'Cain said. ``He wasn't
fast enough to play one of the other skill positions, and he wasn't
big enough to play anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette almost didn't make it to Raleigh. He had a son his
senior year in high school and decided to work to help support his
child. But after working at a fast food restaurant for a month, his
father told him that he would support the child while Jamie went to
school and got an education.
</P>
<P>
   And it has paid off. After injuring his knee last year and
playing in a bulky brace, Barnette is now healthy and eyeing three
ACC career records. He needs 12 touchdown passes to better the 57
of Florida State's Danny Kanell. (Barnette had 18 last year.) He is
2,474 passing yards from exceeding the 9,614 of Duke's Ben Bennett.
(Barnette threw for 3,169 last season.) He needs 2,002 yards of
total offense to pass the 9,296 of Georgia Tech's Sean Jones.
(Barnette had 3,182 last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Barnette, who seems to be easy-going and perpetually smiling,
characterizes himself as ``laid back, humble. I'm just like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes him go?
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is my heart and desire,'' he said. ``I'm not a
yelling guy. I think my teammates can tell by my facial expressions
when I mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Cain: ``Jamie doesn't have to say a lot to get respect.
Our players want to play for him. People want to protect him.
They've seen him get knocked on his butt enough. We have a rule:
Nobody hits Jamie.''
</P>
<P>
   All-American flanker Torry Holt has graduated, and Barnette will
look to Chris Coleman, who caught 52 passes for 876 yards last
season but labored in the shadow of Holt (88 receptions, 1,604
yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie is very composed,'' Coleman said. ``But when he gets
fired up, you know there's a reason and you listen.''
</P>
<P>
   So Barnette is fire and brimstone when the going gets tough?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, like if I'm late breaking on a route or something, he
might say `Hey, Chris, the heat's on me. They're blitzing. Please
make that break a little quicker.

 &HT;    Kines adjusting to new position at UGA
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Nobody knows how Joe Kines feels about being
reassigned from Georgia defensive coordinator to assistant head
coach. He barely managed a smile when his new duties were first
announced at a Jan. 15 news conference, and he remained mum on the
subject this week when asked how he was adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about all that,'' he said. ``If you want
to talk about one of the kids or something like that, that's fine.
But I don't want to talk about that. That ain't nobody's business
but mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kines had been a Division I defensive coordinator for all but
six years since he entered coaching in 1972. Of those six years, he
spent four as linebackers coach with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers
and one as head coach at Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Kines was Georgia's defensive coordinator the past four years
before coach Jim Donnan brought in 37-year-old Kevin Ramsey after
last season. The move to assistant head coach was billed as a
promotion for Kines, 55, but he has not acted as though it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Joe about it,'' said Donnan, who made the moves
after assistants Chris Scelfo and Mickey Mathews left for head
coaching jobs. ``Obviously, he would rather be a coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Scelfo and Mathews) left, I had to rework our staff.
They were two of my top guys, ever since we were at Marshall.
They'd been with me a long time. I had to look at experience, and I
felt like Joe could do a lot of the things you need an assistant
head coach to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kines is the No. 2 man. He would call the shots if Donnan could
not be at a game. But Kines also is the defensive ends coach, which
means he must answer to Ramsey, a first-time coordinator 18 years
his junior.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey insists it's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Joe had a great talk when I got here, mostly football
language,'' Ramsey said. ``It's been a smooth transition, in my
opinion.

 &HT;    A big step for Ramsey as UGA's defensive man
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ At 37 years old, Kevin Ramsey may seem young for
an SEC defensive coordinator. Then again, one has to consider how
long he has been in coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those kids who would come home from school and
line little kids up in the fields and throw passes to them,'' said
Ramsey, who grew up in East St. Louis, Ill. ``I had my own little
team. I had a friend who lived about five blocks away, and I'd call
him up and say, `Hey, you get up your boys over there and y'all
come play the boys from Alhambra Court.' And we'd line 'em up and
play. So coaching has been a part of me for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like one of my gifts is mentoring and teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey has been a college coach for 14 years, with stops at
Kansas State, Northwestern, West Virginia and Tennessee. But he has
no experience as a defensive coordinator, which is one reason his
hiring in January raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramsey's arrival is as much about head coach Jim Donnan's
desire to hire him, period, as it is about his role on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan had followed Ramsey's career for several years. Ramsey
was at Kansas State while Donnan, a former K-State assistant, was
at Missouri. When Donnan was head coach at Marshall, Ramsey was
across the state at West Virginia. And from 1995 through last year,
Ramsey was the secondary coach at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   When Georgia assistant head coach Chris Scelfo left in December
to become head coach at Tulane and secondary coach Mickey Mathews
took the head coaching job at James Madison, Donnan made a move for
Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Volunteers won the national championship, Ramsey
had NFL offers from Philadelphia and Green Bay, as well as the
option of remaining in Knoxville. Donnan knew he would have to make
it worthwhile for Ramsey to come to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give him more money and more responsibility,'' Donnan
said. ``He wasn't going to come here just as a secondary coach.''
</P>
<P>
   That posed a problem. Twenty-seven-year coaching veteran Joe
Kines had been Georgia's defensive coordinator for seasons.
Donnan's solution was to make Ramsey defensive coordinator and let
Kines, his most experienced assistant, take over Scelfo's role.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan had a specific charge for Ramsey _ create more turnovers.
Georgia had the ball less on offense than any other team in the SEC
last season. Donnan considered that unacceptable for this season,
especially with Heisman Trophy candidate Quincy Carter at
quarterback. With more talent at linebacker and on the defensive
line, Donnan wanted the Bulldogs to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey had no trouble figuring out how to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is velocity,'' he said. ``I firmly believe that
defense is about getting the ball back. It's about swarming around
and creating turnovers. You create turnovers by playing with a lot
of velocity. That's what we're trying to get our kids to buy
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said that doesn't mean Georgia will look like Mississippi
State does or Mississippi did under Joe Lee Dunn, who stunted or
blitzed on nearly every down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about scheme, there's got to be a
balance,'' Ramsey said. ``But whether we're in a base defense or
we're bringing the blitz, we want all 11 guys playing with
velocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey doesn't care much for theories that Donnan hired him to
blunt Tennessee's recruiting efforts over the winter and infuse
Georgia's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, I've been ripe to play this role for a while,''
said Ramsey, who earned second-team All-America and All-Missouri
Valley Conference honors as a defensive back at Indiana State from
1980-84. ``I've been around a lot of outstanding programs and
coaches over the years. I appreciate the opportunity Coach Donnan
is giving me, but I feel like I've been ready for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   At least since those childhood days in East St. Louis.

 &HT;    Brooking quick to mark for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the eve of the big show, the magnitude of it all
left Keith Brooking in awe. For him, the idea of starting in the
NFL is not nearly as overwhelming as the idea of playing for the
right to go to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So when the former Georgia Tech star makes his second
consecutive preseason start tonight as the Falcons' weakside
linebacker, it will register as a relative blip on his screen.
</P>
<P>
   For Brooking, 23, it's possible no feeling will surpass that of
Jan. 16, 1999, the day before the NFC Championship Game at
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline of going to the Super Bowl was great, but when
we walked into the dome up in Minneapolis the day before, just
knowing we were going to play for the right to go to the biggest
game there is, that was incredible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had our walk-through, I was looking at other players
and you could tell their tempo was picking up, the intensity was
higher. When you're a rookie going through all this, it just floors
you. You have to be in the position to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking is now in a position to understand it better.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons waived Cornelius Bennett in February, Brooking
became a starter. He will not immediately make fans forget Bennett,
whose 121 tackles last season broke middle linebacker Jessie
Tuggle's nine-year hold on the team tackling title.
</P>
<P>
   But his $1.32 million charge against the salary cap will be
easier for the Falcons to handle than Bennett's $3.7 million charge
would have been.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking's speedy ascension to the starting lineup has to do
with both money, and, well, speed.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons made the former East Coweta High starter the
12th pick of the 1997 draft, his quickness stood out.
</P>
<P>
   That's what moved him into the team's nickel passing defense as
a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say if he's better this year because we haven't
played a game,'' said Tuggle, entering his 13th season. ``But he's
got the speed to get to the ball. Like every young player, he's
just got to recognize things quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, who is 6 feet 2, 242 pounds, knows he needs to be
quicker making his reads and his reactions need to become more
instinctive.
</P>
<P>
   But he's proud to note one tremendous improvement from his
rookie season, when he had 32 total tackles, one interception and
an impressive three forced fumbles in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   He's not getting tied up in traffic as much on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the biggest thing for me, getting separation from
offensive linemen,'' he said. ``Linemen at this level hold so much
more and get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't allow them to get inside of you and get hold of your
body because getting away from 350 pounds is not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a rookie was not easy. Being a first-rounder was worse.
</P>
<P>
   After setting a Tech record with 467 career tackles and leading
the Yellow Jackets in tackles three straight years, being drafted
by his hometown team was, in a way, not so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of expectations for me last year. Everyone
was expecting me to play,'' he said. ``But Cornelius is a great
player and he had one of the best seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I was frustrated last year, I really was, I admit it.
But I used it as more motivation to be a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of being a better player, Brooking said, came from getting
completely away from football.
</P>
<P>
   First, he took up golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a nice set of clubs and took a few lessons,'' he
said. ``I shoot in the 90s. I didn't have the time or the money in
college. It's an expensive game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, who occasionally is teased for being tight with his
money, nearly bought a house on two occasions, even putting
contracts down. But he backed out both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a big place,'' said the apartment dweller. ``I'm
single; I don't have a family. I'd like to live on a golf course,
but all those places on course are so big.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Brooking and teammate Tim Dwight and former
teammate Sherdrick Bonner went to Bonner's hometown of Phoenix, and
then spent time in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   And Brooking, who grew up on a farm, and his girlfriend spent a
week in Los Angeles as guests of his agent, Gary Wichard.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he went to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt 100 percent better going into training camp this year.
It really was like two straight years, going straight from playing
my senior season to trying to get ready for the draft,'' he said.
``I was working out harder than ever in my life for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you go straight into (strength and conditioning coach)
Al Miller's program, then into training camp, then into the season.
In college, you play 12 games, if you go to a bowl. Last year we
played 23, counting preseason. I was gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brooking insists he's not only much more knowledgeable now
than last summer, when he was learning at about 100 mph, but has
more gas in his tank.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he'll make fans forget Bennett sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being in awe of the NFC Championship Game he had his
best game. His eight tackles against the Vikings on Jan. 17 were
second on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the rookies now and I can tell their heads are
spinning,'' said Brooking, who needs to play just 45 percent of the
defensive snaps to void the sixth and final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view my situation as having any pressure. I'm just
living out my dream.

BRITISH RAIDS SEEK MONEY-LAUNDERING EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The National Crime Squad has raided the home and office
of a Bank of New York officer here as part of an investigation of
what is believed to be a major money-laundering operation by
Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The special crime unit said it had searched the apartment of
Lucy Edwards, a Russian-born vice president at the bank, and her
husband, Peter Berlin. Berlin is a businessman who had authority
over some of the accounts at the bank that are the focus of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also searched the Bank of New York's London
office. At its New York headquarters, a bank spokesman confirmed
the search of the offices and said the institution was cooperating
with the authorities. The bank declined to elaborate. It also would
not discuss whether its offices in New York had been searched.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe that Berlin and Ms. Edwards could
be involved in one of the largest money-laundering operations ever
conducted in the United States, with $4.2 billion passing through
one account alone from October through March.
</P>
<P>
   It was the British authorities who alerted the FBI to what they
suspected was a money-laundering operation at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the National Crime Squad refused to explain
what investigators had been looking for during the search of the
apartment, near Marylebone, an affluent London neighborhood, on
Wednesday night. The search lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, 41, who was suspended from her job on Wednesday,
may have left the country with her husband, friends of the couple
said. Neither Ms. Edwards nor Berlin has been accused of any
wrongdoing, and neither has been detained or arrested, said the
spokeswoman for the National Crime Squad.

   Japan signaled the start of a far-reaching consolidation of its
bloated and debt-ridden banking system with official word that
three of the country's biggest banks would unite to form the
world's largest financial institution, with $1.3 trillion in
assets. The merger agreement announced by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the
Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank was viewed by economists and
investors as a significant change, but not because of the
combination's size. Rather, they said it would hasten mergers among
other Japanese banks, winnowing the weakest and helping to reduce
one of the biggest drags on the Japanese economy. The proposed
merger poses little competitive threat to American or European
banks, analysts said, nor will it do much to disrupt the push by
foreign banks into Japan.

   CHAT ROOM PROPELS A SHARE PRICE
</P>
<P>
   Online stock traders, goaded by an Internet chat room leader,
commandeered the shares last week of Information Management
Associates, which owns an Internet shopping site, taking it on the
kind of roller-coaster ride that longtime traders worry may harm
investors and undermine faith in the market.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS BENEFIT AS BOND YIELDS FALL
</P>
<P>
   Stocks climbed, helped both by a drop in the yield of the
30-year Treasury below 6 percent and a rush to buy metals and
mining shares after a takeover offer by Phelps Dodge, the copper
giant, for two rivals. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced
136.77 points, or 1.25 percent, to 11,100.61. In the broader
market, the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index gained 13.02
points, or 1 percent, to 1,336.61, while the Nasdaq composite index
rose 26.90 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,648.33.

<P>
   CONTRACT EXTENDED FOR SOAP OPERA
</P>
<P>
   CBS agreed to extend its contract to broadcast television's
highest-rated soap opera, ``The Young and the Restless,'' in a deal
that will enable Columbia Tristar Television, the studio that
produces it, to use the program as a centerpiece in its plans to
begin a cable channel devoted to soap operas. The deal will give
CBS a stake in the channel, Soap City.

   RAID IN MONEY-LAUNDERING INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   The National Crime Squad raided the home and office of a Bank of
New York vice president in London as part of an investigation of
what is thought to be a money-laundering operation by Russian
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   RESIGNATIONS CALLED FOR IN INDONESIA
</P>
<P>
   Displaying internal divisions that could hamper efforts to
overhaul Indonesia's economy, lawmakers from President B.J.
Habibie's own political party are taking sides against him over a
widening banking scandal. Members of a faction in Indonesia's
ruling party joined opposition politicians in calling for the
resignations of both the Finance Minister and the chairman of the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency.

<P>
   SHARES OF DILLARD'S DECLINE 19.5%
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dillard's fell $5.75, or 19.5 percent, to $23.75, amid
declining sales and rising costs at former Mercantile stores being
converted into ones for Dillard's. The company said Thursday that
earnings in the quarter ended July 31 rose less than expected as
sales at acquired Mercantile stores dropped 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   QUANTUM PLANS TO CUT 800 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Quantum, which makes computer disk drives and storage drives,
said it would cut 800 jobs, about 13 percent of its work force, to
compete better in the rapidly growing low-cost computer market. The
company will take a $50 million second-quarter charge as a result.

INTERNET CHAT ROOMS SEND STOCK PRICES ON A WILD RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.) (rk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Online stock traders, goaded by an Internet chat room
leader, commandeered the shares of an obscure company last week,
taking it on the kind of roller-coaster ride that veteran traders
worry may harm investors and undermine faith in the overall stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Information Management Associates, which owns a
fledgling Internet shopping site, soared from $4.0625 to a high of
$14 before finishing the week below $10 in unusually heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the stock upward was Tokyo Joe, the Internet moniker of
Joe Park, who owned burrito restaurants in New York before becoming
a stock picker. Subscribers to his chat room cheered each other on.
``Wait until the traders see IMA after lunch,'' one participant
said mid-Thursday. ``It will be $14 when you get back,'' responded
Tokyo Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Such rapid-fire moves threaten to become commonplace as the
Internet captures the imagination and attention of investors eager
to profit from tips received electronically from people they
consider stock market sophisticates and wise men.
</P>
<P>
   The rocketing behavior, fueled by fickle chat room emotions, is
of concern to company management and securities regulators, who
fret that investors may begin to question the integrity of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Siebert, chairman of the discount brokerage firm that
carries her name, expressed outrage over a similar zest for her
company's shares last April. When recommended in a popular chat
room called trading-places.net, the stock catapulted from just over
$19 to about $70. It closed Friday at $18.875.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of accountability in these chat rooms, and it's
necessary for the regulators to do something if these people move
individual stocks,'' Ms. Siebert said. ``If the regulators want me
to lead a parade against some of the things going on, I would do
it.'' People approach her on the street, she said, describing their
anger over paying $70 for a stock that has now returned to a more
reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators as a matter of course do not comment on
investigations into suspicious movements in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns many experienced traders is that some of the
hottest Internet gurus have little to no investing background. The
man behind the run-up in Siebert Financial Corp. was Chris Rea, who
ran trading-places.net under the moniker Merlin. Before that, he
was designing mailers for automobile dealerships. Rea is not a
registered broker, but says he once was a trader in London.
</P>
<P>
   The man of the moment, traders say, is Tokyo Joe, aka Joe Park,
who runs Tokyo Joe's Societe Anonyme, an investing chat room.
Traders who subscribe to the chat room believe Park, who also goes
by the name Tokyo Mex, has some 900 followers who pay $100 or $200
a month, depending upon on the specific service.
</P>
<P>
   Stories about Park and his stock market exploits have appeared
in Money, The Wall Street Journal and New York magazine. An
immigrant from South Korea, he is in his early 40s and lives in
Manhattan. He has recently told subscribers that he intends to
start a hedge fund, a type of investing vehicle for the wealthy.
But he did not respond to an e-mail asking for comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Park put IMA stock on his alert list for subscribers on Monday,
Aug. 16. He called it ``the next Priceline.com,'' an Internet
company that allows consumers to name the price they are willing to
pay for a product. Priceline's stock has been a highflier; the
shares were brought public at $16 each in March and traded as high
as $165 in April. The stock closed Friday at $67.75.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison to Priceline was based on IMA's announcement on
Aug. 12 that the company had sold for $10 million a 29 percent
stake in a subsidiary, buyingedge.com, to the venture capital arm
of CMGI, an Internet giant.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Park posted the recommendation on his web site,
tokyojoe.com, the stock started to move. But the frenzy did not hit
until Thursday when Park told loyalists that shortsellers,
investors who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock will fall
and that they can replace the shares cheaper, were coming after the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock was around $10, Park predicted it would be $14
when traders returned from lunch. Throughout the day, Park and his
followers cheered the stock on as it rose. ``Shorts making a good
stand,'' chatted one participant. ``They will die soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has but 4.5 million shares available to be bought
and sold by the public, yet 14.1 million shares changed hands on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders say that Park has always been forthcoming about his
positions in the stocks he recommends. He informs subscribers that
he buys before he posts recommendations and that he may sell. On
Wednesday, he told subscribers that he held 48,750 shares of IMA,
but he did not respond to questions from subscribers about whether
he had sold shares into the rally Thursday and Friday as the stock
raced ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One trader who has been a Tokyo Joe subscriber for almost a year
said that Park's actions were out of character. ``He has run a
responsible operation until now,'' said the person, who requested
anonymity. Baiting shortsellers was something new, the trader said.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the week, many of Park's loyalists were building
large positions in IMA. One subscriber said he had bought 15,000
shares on Park's recommendation, another said he owned 27,000
shares.
</P>
<P>
   As the buyers multiplied, so did the stock price. On Thursday, a
subscriber named Tiny posted a fake press release that said IMA.
was going to spin off buyingedge.com, the Internet shopping site.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Harris, at Peppercom, IMA's public relations firm, said
Friday: ``We represent buyingedge.com, and I'm not aware of
anything like that going out.''
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed on Thursday, Tokyo Joe put his
recommendation on IMA on a public relations wire service consulted
by journalists and investors. The announcement noted that IMA
shares had gained 211 percent in three days since his
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the shares climbed to $14, but by late morning
started to fall. Participants in the chat room started to get
nervous. Then, at around 1 p.m., disaster. Subscribers were
disconnected from the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell to about $9.50 a share. Losing the connection was
highly unusual, and some traders suspect foul play. Park later told
subscribers a server had failed overseas. Then, a little after 1:30
p.m., the connection reopened, and Park pounded the table again on
the stock. At 4:03 p.m., Tokyo Joe exulted: ``I made over 250k.''
</P>
<P>
   One trader said the action in IMA stock was a parable for our
times. ``This is typical of the wild, wild west,'' she said, ``and
how day traders get buried.'' After all, those who bought at $14
had heavy losses, at least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Albert R. Subbloie, chief executive officer of IMA, which is
based in Shelton, Conn., and primarily creates software for
telephone call centers, was on vacation in Rhode Island on Friday.
When reached by phone, he said that he was unaware of the activity
in the stock but not distressed by the trading. He conceded that he
might feel differently if the shares collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The company's market capitalization, about $96 million, ``is
still quite low for a company that has gone headlong into the
internet,'' said Subbloie, who added that he had sold none of his
stock during the rally.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As many as 20 researchers from the United States
are going to Turkey to see if there are any lessons relevant to the
San Andreas fault in California.
</P>
<P>
   Teams from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., and
Golden, Colo., will be looking for lessons on ground shaking,
structural engineering and the geology of the North Anatolian Fault
where the earthquake occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Southern California will
examine the fault for lessons that can be applied to the San
Andreas Fault that runs through California, which bears several
similarities. Others from MIT, Columbia University and San Diego
State University will also be examining the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these large earthquakes is an important data
point for evaluating models that already exist, for modifying
models and for developing a better idea of how things work,'' said
David Schwartz, a geologist for the geological survey in Menlo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Izmit quake is the seventh to have occurred along the North
Anatolian Fault since 1939. The fault is similar to the San Andreas
in length, speed of slippage and type _ a ``strike-slip'' vertical
fault with horizontal movement. Both have branches at either end,
with the San Andreas' spreading out through the San Francisco Bay
area in the north and through the Palm Springs area in the south.
</P>
<P>
   By examining the way the earth moved and what the effects of the
movement were, both for the land and the structures built on it,
researchers hope to apply that knowledge to California in presaging
what will occur during quakes along the San Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is very important for thinking of building codes
and design of critical facilities,'' Schwartz said. ``North
Anatolian is really an analog of the San Andreas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nano Seeber, a research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Colombia University in Palisades, N.Y., said one
hypothesis that American researchers hope to test will be how fluid
under the earth's crust affects earthquake velocity, as waves move
in and out of cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of interest, Seeber and others said, will be
testing a theory that surface damage is worse in areas with soft
surface sediment than in areas with a stronger base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, if we can understand that, we can understand the
physics that regulate earthquake occurrences,'' Seeber said.
``That's basic understanding that you might be able to use in all
kinds of ways.''

U.S. BANKERS SEE NO THREAT IN PLANNED JAPANESE BEHEMOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With JAPAN-BANKS) 
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed merger of three Japanese banks into a behemoth with
$1.3 trillion in assets poses little competitive threat to American
or European banks, bankers and analysts said Friday, nor will it do
much to disrupt the push by foreign banks into Japan's home market.
</P>
<P>
   Combining Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial
Bank of Japan would create a powerhouse in assets alone _ not in
global reach, profitability, technology or productivity. None of
the banks is known abroad as an innovator. Facing loan losses at
home, the three have been scaling back their international presence
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if these banks consolidate their operations the way a
U.S. bank would, which is not likely, they have pulled away from
international markets, and a likelihood of a revived international
push is low,'' said Diane Glossman, banking industry analyst at
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The subdued reaction to the planned merger contrasts sharply
with the wariness toward Japanese banking power in the 1980s, when
those banks financing corporate Japan's sweeping international
expansion seemed poised to do to world banking rivals what Japanese
electronics makers did to American television manufacturers. Even
as recently as 1996, when Bank of Tokyo merged with Mitsubishi Bank
to form what was then the world's largest bank in terms of assets,
some rival bankers saw a rising competitive threat.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's prolonged recession and troubled real estate loan
portfolios have radically changed that image. Most foreign bankers
say they are more concerned that a Japanese banking implosion might
cause a world financial panic than they are about Japanese banks
stealing customers from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a purely defensive merger,'' said a senior executive
at a leading American bank. ``They are trying to protect themselves
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The banker said that none of the three banks was considered a
sought-after partner for foreign banks. He also said that he did
not expect the merger to curb the ability of foreign banks to lure
customers away from Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   Some American bankers view Japan's banking sector these days as
handicapped, even crippled. The Japanese government in recent years
has continuously increased its estimate of bad loans. In February,
the government put the figure at 76 trillion yen ($600 billion),
more than double a prevailing Japanese banking industry estimate.
</P>
<P>
   All banks must set aside capital to cover failed loans, so every
new yen in bad loans requires that almost that much be added to a
loan reserve _ taking away money the banks might have been able to
deploy profitably. For Japan in recent years, it has been a vicious
cycle: Several leading Japanese banks have flirted with falling
below a widely accepted international standard for the amount of
capital they have to support their loans, risking exclusion from
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese banks now promise that they will seek to reach
American levels of profitability. But they have a long way to go.
Some of the most profitable Japanese banks earn a 2 percent return
on equity, a standard way of measuring profits, analysts say. Top
American banks earn five to 10 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Measured by assets, many of the largest banks in the world are
still Japanese _ though the recent combination of Germany's
Deutsche Bank with the American company Bankers Trust made that the
No. 1 contender. But sheer asset size does not really measure
financial strength or sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Leading American banks now often serve corporate customers by
helping them get access to stock and bond markets, rather than
making loans and recording them on their books. Traditional ways of
making and recording loans build assets quickly, but are not
considered highly profitable. When American banks make corporate
loans, they are often syndicated, or sold off to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot equate asset size with financing power or
skill sets,'' Ms. Glossman said. ``American banks would be much
larger than the Japanese banks if they did things the same way.''

HALFWAY HOUSES ARE CLOSED IN MICHIGAN AS A RESULT OF
TRUTH-IN-SENTENCING LAW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Washington, D.C., Calif., Ohio)   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ As an unintended consequence of the state's
truth-in-sentencing law, halfway houses around Michigan are being
closed, leaving prisoners fewer chances to obtain job experience or
training, drug-abuse treatment or other services to help them ease
back into society.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, like 26 other states and the District of Columbia,
passed a truth-in-sentencing law intended to reduce or eliminate
the chances that violent criminals would be paroled before serving
their minimum sentences. Because Michigan's law, which went into
effect last December, specifically requires prisoners to serve
their terms in prisons, soon none will be eligible to serve the end
of their sentences in any of the state's 14 halfway houses, as
1,300 criminals now do.
</P>
<P>
   By next week, there will be just 900, and the number is expected
to drop to zero within a few years. Four halfway houses _ those in
Detroit, Flint, Battle Creek, and Port Huron _ closed on Friday.
One in Jackson and one in Monroe closed late last month. The
remaining eight are likely to shut down as the number of prisoners
eligible to use them dwindles over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Department of Corrections said that the halfway
houses should be kept open, but that they could not be used under
the state's new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer they were still open and a viable option for
us,'' said William J. Martin, director of the department, which
oversees the state's prisoners as well as offenders on parole or
probation. Martin said he otherwise supported the
truth-in-sentencing law.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1 percent of those who pass through Michigan's halfway
houses before being paroled end up being charged with committing
another felony within four years, while 14 percent of all prisoners
commit new felonies in the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's approach of eliminating halfway houses appears to be
unusual. ``Most states do not eliminate community programs from the
truth-in-sentencing model,'' said Richard J. Billak, president of
the International Community Corrections Association, a nonprofit
organization in La Crosse, Wis., that represents American and
Canadian halfway houses.
</P>
<P>
   Billak noted that many states with truth-in-sentencing laws,
including California and Ohio, have expanded their use of halfway
houses and other community-based programs to avoid sending
additional offenders to prison. ``What is troublesome is Michigan
used to be very progressive,'' Billak said.
</P>
<P>
   Billak and other criminal justice experts said closing halfway
houses would result in more repeat offenders. ``Halfway houses and
transitional programs have been proven time and time again to
reduce recidivism rates,'' said Barry A. Krisberg, president of the
National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a nonprofit criminal
justice research organization based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth-in-sentencing movement has had all kinds of
unintended consequences,'' Krisberg said, some of which are only
coming to light now because of the time lags between when the laws
took effect and when prisoners wend their way through the court and
prison systems. ``All these little sentencing land mines are
exploding now that were passed four or five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth-in-sentencing laws were part of the Republicans' 1994
Contract With America, which included a pledge to get tough on
crime, and many states, including Michigan, rushed to pass them in
the mid-1990s. Michigan's law was passed in 1994, but did not go
into effect until new sentencing guidelines could be drawn up,
which took several years. As a result, prisoners committing violent
crimes after Dec. 14, 1998, fell under the new law, and the law
will cover nonviolent crimes committed after Dec. 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for additional federal financing under a 1994 law,
states must demonstrate that their prisoners serve at least 85
percent of their terms. In Michigan, the law requires that violent
criminals serve at least the minimum time of their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the truth-in-sentencing law was passed, certain prisoners
who drew, for example, a 10-to-15-year term would serve perhaps 8
years of their 10-year minimum sentence in prison, then be released
to a halfway house for an average of 8 to 14 months before being
paroled. Now, prisoners must serve the minimum sentence _ 10 years,
in this example _ before they are eligible for parole, with the
full time served in a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Those who work most closely with the prisoners said the halfway
houses, also called corrections centers, helped prisoners lead
law-abiding lives after they were released.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times guys come to us with no skills,'' said David
Fields, a veteran corrections officer and author of children's
books at Detroit Western Corrections Center, which closed on
Friday. ``The centers do serve a good purpose to help equip them to
be law-abiding citizens. It is going to have a tremendous impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that it would take action from the Statehouse to
keep Michigan's halfway houses open as an option for some of the
state's 130,000 offenders. No such action seems to be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor of Michigan's truth-in-sentencing law, state
Sen. William J. Van Regenmorter, a Republican, said he did not see
why the state could not use halfway houses for prisoners who had
already served their minimum terms in prison. Closing them is ``an
administrative decision by the Department of Corrections,'' the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, a former state representative, disagreed. ``Our
statutory language is what causes our difficulty.'' He said he had
explained the problem to a number of state senators and
representatives. ``The general response has been, `Gee, I didn't
know that was what was going to happen, it is an unintended
consequence, and I'm busy doing other things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler, a Republican who strongly supported the
truth-in-sentencing law, also believes the halfway houses serve
good purposes. ``I prefer the option of taking people and putting
them in the community to see how they adjust rather than just
flinging the door open and letting them out,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Legislature is willing to look at this we're certainly
willing, and think it is worthwhile,'' his spokesman, John
Truscott, elaborated. But the governor has no immediate plans to
intervene because he feels that the truth-in-sentencing law, as a
whole, works well.

A GREGARIOUS BUSH WARMS TO POLITICKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Political Memo) 
(See also BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
(ko) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. _ Former President George Bush's biggest problem,
an old friend of his once suggested, was that he liked policy a lot
more than politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who has watched him would ever say that about Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who plunges into crowds _ a crowd of 10 at an
airport late at night, a crowd of hundreds at a fund-raiser, a
crowd of thousands at a rally _ with all the enthusiasm of Bill
Clinton or Nelson Rockefeller or that formidable flesh-pressing
Texan of yesteryear, Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would ever mistake him for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious on a two-day campaign swing this week that Bush,
the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination next
year, has a lot of work to do on his platform style. Ideas he
expressed with vigor and conviction in a private talk in his hotel
suite came out sounding tired, flat and mechanical when he tried
them later on a ballroom full of 400 New Orleans-area supporters
who had given him at least $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there much on offer for the policy wonk. He wants to set
his own pace and his own rhythm, Bush said, and to that end he
plans to make a half-dozen major speeches starting next month. But
Bush _ now referred to by newspapers around the country not as
George W. Bush or even George W. but simply as W. _ demonstrated
real mastery of one-on-one campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   His style is an amalgam of East and Southwest, Yale and the oil
patch. Call him the Madras Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him with a classroom full of second graders in Jefferson
Parish, near New Orleans. After a relaxed discussion of how
caterpillars turn into butterflies, a youngster asked him why the
sun had a smiling face. Beats me, the Governor replied; why does
the chicken cross the road? Well, his interlocutor said, the cow
crosses the road to go to the mooovies.
</P>
<P>
   Good television, of course, but something more as well: it gave
the governor a chance to promote the school, Jefferson Elementary,
as a prime example of the kind of public-private partnership he
wants to see more of _ in this case, Lockheed Martin and Shell Oil
helping a school set up a computer laboratory and Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him, again, reading with a group of mostly black
inner-city 6- and 7-year-olds at the West End Center for Youth here
in Roanoke. When ``hop'' and ``top'' sound the same, Bush asked,
what's that called?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhyme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right. Good.''
</P>
<P>
   I have two daughters the same age, he said, his hands resting on
the shoulder of a tiny child with red and yellow pony-tail holders
braided into her hair; what are they called?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right. Great.''
</P>
<P>
   He told them that his dog, Spot, had been born in the White
House, and assured them that, no, he had not arrived in Roanoke by
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finished, Bush had worked in a pair of plugs: one
for reading as the key to the American Dream, another for more
Federal aid to after-school facilities wholly or partly sponsored
by church groups, as is the West End Center. Then he stopped for a
chat on the playground with some older youths, and as he walked
back to his van, Sam Sapp, lanky and 13, walked with him, an arm
draped fraternally across the governor's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Then on to the Farmers' Market in downtown Roanoke, which has
been around since 1882. It is a traditional local campaign stop,
and 250 or 300 people had gathered on a hot August morning to meet
a candidate in an election that is not three weeks or three months
but 15 long months away.
</P>
<P>
   Bush keeps saying it is much too early for long speeches, too
early for debates. But his campaign is already an
industrial-strength gig, with long motorcades, a private jet, staff
and security people talking furtively into their sleeves, White
House-style ``bibles'' detailing every move and seven video cameras
(not to mention still ones, tape recorders and notebooks) following
along.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Dwight Eisenhower, a victor in history's greatest war
just a few years before, had this kind of entourage this early in
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seemed to faze Bush in the slightest as he moved slowly
past market stalls stacked high with peaches, pole beans, Japanese
eggplants and Silver Queen corn, the bounty of late summer in the
Virginia Piedmont. After he had spent more than an hour shaking
hands, posing for photographs, chatting about the military and the
local museum and the weather, kissing a baby swathed in pink (and a
grandmother or two as well), complimenting Gina Thomas on her
``good-looking'' family of four children and signing a lot of
autographs, a man handed him a $100 bill and asked him to sign
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be doing pretty darn well,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as well as you and your father,'' the man replied, and the
governor, laughing, gave him a chummy punch on the upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   Where did this come from, a campaign visitor asked, this knack
for putting people at ease, this common touch. Well, Bush said
pointedly, he grew up in Midland, Texas, and not in Greenwich,
Conn., like his father. Then he thought a minute and added, ``I
must get it from my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing, it was a loosy-goosey, laughter-punctuated
couple of days. Except for one big thing: the never-ending
questions about drugs. Bush tried without much success to fend them
off, insisting that he would not talk in any detail about the
various ``things,'' never specified, that he did 20 and more years
ago and now regretted having done.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Gov. Bush, of course, who has come down hard on
young hard-drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision not to play the game,'' he said in a long
talk aboard his campaign jet. ``No
float-a-rumor-and-force-him-to-answer. No more trash-mouth
politics. No politics of personal destruction. The baby boomers who
are so eager to purge their souls send a very mixed message to the
young. You know, if George Bush did it when he was a kid, why can't
I?
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing _ people are being turned off politics by all
this negativism. I can't control the nastiness and the ugliness of
the system, but I sure can do my best to clean it up. People want
it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has staked a lot on that proposition, and he is also
betting that the public is repelled by President Clinton's sexual
adventures. They want to know ``who you are today, not who were you
yesterday,'' he said, ``and they want someone to bring dignity back
into the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he was not bitter about Clinton's defeat of his
father seven years ago, even though he described that defeat as ``a
pretty nasty experience, limping back into Houston the night before
Election Day, knowing that you were beat.'' If he was bitter about
anyone, he said, it would be Ross Perot, who he thinks tipped the
election to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's involvement with Monica S. Lewinsky
``embarrassed lots of people,'' Bush said. ``They long for someone
they can trust, even though they're content with the economic
situation. They give Clinton credit for all this prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   One such person, he said, was a woman who approached him in Iowa
several weeks ago and gave him a picture of her 3-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to keep it, that she was counting on me to
remember that I had a big responsibility,'' Bush said. ``She was
saying that the president had not lived up to his, I guess. But I
don't think I can get elected president just by talking about Bill
Clinton. He's fading into history. His time is over.''
</P>
<P>
   So he talks more obliquely, about the need for a change in
leadership and in the nation's values. Two of his favorite lines
relate to this. Over and over, he talks about ushering in ``the
responsibility era'' and ending the present one, when ``if it feels
good, you do it, and if it goes wrong, blame someone else.'' He
promises a ``fresh start after a season of cynicism.'' Over and
over, he insists that ``prosperity alone is simple materialism''
and calls for ``a richness beyond money'' available to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worth of America has never been proven by cities of
gold,'' he said in New Orleans, as he has before, ``but by citizens
of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Details to follow on all that, but Bush is a bit more specific
about national security policy. He senses that the American
military services are dispirited, ``because they think their role
is not valued by our leaders'' and because military spending has
been cut too quickly. Yet he talks of a top-to-bottom
reorganization that would lead, for example, to a single
fighter-interceptor to be used by all branches of service. That
idea has been floated before, only to generate considerable
opposition from the services.
</P>
<P>
   He backed Clinton's action in Kosovo and endorsed his refusal
``to let the United Nations act as the surrogate for the United
States.'' He took a swipe at the Administration's Asia policy,
arguing that China was a competitor of the United States, not a
strategic ally.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, as the plane headed for Roanoke, the Governor talked
politics, swapping tales of campaigns old and not so old,
victorious and calamitous. He expected more attacks, he said, like
the one started last week by Marilyn Quayle, the wife of former
Vice President Dan Quayle, who dismissed Bush as ``a frat boy'' who
had accomplished very little in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried that before, and it hasn't worked,'' he
said. ``Ann Richards called me `Shrub' in the governor's race, and
it backfired. But I like the give and take of campaigning anyway. I
grew up with it.''

 Rumors Say H&AMP;Q For Sale
<TEXT>
<P>

 &QL; 
A surge in the stock price of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group, one of San
Francisco's leading securities firms, is prompting speculation that
the company could be sold soon.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q's stock rose 13 cents to $42.25 in trading of 581,700 shares
yesterday, more than twice the average volume of the last six
months. During the day, the company's shares changed hands for as
much as $44.63, a 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight trading days, the company's stock has jumped
nearly 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock has been suspiciously strong this week, which occurs
when rumors of a merger begin to circulate, whether substantiated
or not,'' said Michael Flanagan, an independent brokerage industry
analyst based near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said a buyer might have to pay as much as $1.3 billion,
or $50 a share, for H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dan Case was out of
town yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment. Paul Cleveland,
a managing director and head of the firm's merger advisory
practice, said he had no comment on the takeover speculation.
</P>
<P>
   If H&AMP;Q were taken over, it would mark the latest in a series of
acquisitions of leading San Francisco investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, both Montgomery Securities and Robertson Stephens
sold themselves to commercial banks. Today Montgomery is known as
Banc of America Securities and is owned by North Carolina's Bank of
America. Robertson Stephens is owned by BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of independent investment banks would be left in
the city if H&AMP;Q were bought, including Thomas Weisel Partners,
started last year by the former chief executive of Montgomery
Securities, and Volpe Brown Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders said speculation about possible buyers for H&AMP;Q
centered on discount and online brokerage giant Charles Schwab
Corp. or Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab in recent years has developed a close relationship with
H&AMP;Q, distributing the firm's public stock offerings and research to
its retail brokerage customers. And H&AMP;Q was nearly sold to Merrill
two years ago before the talks broke down, according to published
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Schwab and Merrill declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rumors, analysts said they were skeptical that H&AMP;Q's
business with corporations would fit with Schwab's consumer focus.
And Merrill, they noted, is widely thought to be exploring a much
larger merger with a big bank.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the strength of the technology, health care and
consumer products industries from which it draws clients, H&AMP;Q's
business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   It ranks seventh nationwide among stock underwriters, acting as
lead or co-manager in 94 initial or secondary public offerings so
far this year, according to CommScan, an investment banking
research firm. And in the quarter ended in June, H&AMP;Q earned $37
million on $178.1 million in revenue, up 166 percent and 73 percent
respectively from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The have a formidable franchise,'' said Lauren Smith, a
brokerage analyst with Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Since talks with Merrill broke off, H&AMP;Q officials have
repeatedly said they want to go it alone, maintaining that
independence allows the firm to be more nimble and provide better
service than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, noted Smith, ``Everyone who has sold out had previously
said they wanted to remain independent.''

 How Nestle's New Deal May Affect Dreyer's
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
What seemed Thursday like a vote of no confidence in Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc. by its biggest shareholder now looks like just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder, Nestle USA, announced two days ago it was
forming a joint venture with Haagen-Dazs Plc, best known for its
superpremium pints of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   That partnership raised questions about Nestle's commitment to
Dreyer's since Dreyer's, which is headquartered in Oakland, is on
the verge of launching its own superpremium line, Dreamery, which
will go head to head against Haagen-Dazs starting this month.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's also competes less directly with Haagen-Dazs through
its premium ice cream, which is sold as Dreyer's brand on the West
Coast and Edy's in the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing later
Thursday, Nestle indicated that it remains interested in Dreyer's.
The filing disclosed that, as part of the deal, Nestle and
Haagen-Dazs agreed that if either one attains a majority stake in
Dreyer's, it must offer to sell the stake to the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big question yesterday was whether ... Nestle was
no longer interested in Dreyer's,'' said Jeffrey Kanter, an analyst
with Prudential Securities, in a telephone interview yesterday.
``The wording in the filing suggests they certainly are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nestle would like to own us eventually,'' said
Dreyer's Chief Financial Officer Timothy Kahn. ``I think they see
this venture as a long-term vehicle'' that could one day include
Dreyer's.
</P>
<P>
   A Nestle spokeswoman said no executives were available to
comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle first acquired an interest in Dreyer's in 1994 and
currently owns 18 percent of the company. But Kahn said no
acquisition is likely before the expiration of a standstill
agreement that prevents Nestle from buying a controlling share of
Dreyer's until mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement points out the convoluted nature of the
ice cream sector, in which rivals often join in manufacturing and
distribution partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The joint-venture allows Haagen-Dazs to distribute Nestle ice
cream novelties, such as Nestle Crunch bars, to convenience stores,
a channel where Nestle wants to establish a greater presence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dreyer's distributes Nestle novelties to some
supermarkets, a business that represents about 3 percent of
Dreyer's total revenues, said Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's also manufactures and distributes ice cream in some
parts of the country for Ben &AMP; Jerry's, the other major player in
the superpremium pint category _ while Haagen-Dazs distributes Ben
&AMP; Jerry's in other parts of the U.S. Dreyer's also makes and
distributes the Godiva, Starbucks and Healthy Choice brands.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream companies have calculated that it makes more sense to
work together than for each to set up an extensive distribution
network, said Mike Corby, who manages distribution for Dreyer's.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the expense of transporting ice cream,
refrigerated trucks suitable for carrying ice cream cost $120,000
each, whereas bread trucks cost $25,000 to $30,000, Corby said.

 Critics charge Internet ticketing by airlines leaves
noncomputer  customers in the cold 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Consumers with access to airline Web sites are reaping discounts
not readily available to those without computers. That's raising a
howl from critics who think Internet ticketing discriminates
against those without computers and widens the digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, United Airlines was offering round-trip
tickets from San Francisco to Boston at a special $269 fare to
those booking travel over the Internet. The lowest-priced ticket
available by phone was $217 higher, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines offered $88 round-trip tickets from Oakland to
Seattle over the Net, $53 less than the next-cheapest seat booked
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   To some consumer watchdogs, this practice is elitist and should
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't matter whether you're closer to your telephone or
your computer, you should get the same deal from the airlines,''
says Mark Silbergeld, co-director of the Washington, D.C., office
of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA),
an Alexandria, Va., trade group, filed a complaint with the
secretary of transportation, overseer of the Federal Aviation
Administration, seeking to block Internet ticketing promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say they aren't necessarily looking to become
e-commerce powerhouses, or to compete with online ticketing
services like Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they want to reduce transaction costs and commissions
paid to travel agents, and they see the Web as a way to accomplish
that. For many airlines, travel agent commissions represent the
third-highest expense, ranking after labor costs and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines also say they are using the Internet to build loyalty
among the most well-heeled travelers, to give consumers a tool many
want, and to clear out unsold inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines aren't trying to segregate passengers,'' said
Mark Vacheresse, an analyst with Olde Discount Corp. in Detroit.
``They're trying to lower distribution costs. If they get people to
go to their Web site, they don't have to pay commissions to travel
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower prices aren't the only way airlines are enticing customers
to book flights over the Internet. They are offering bonus
frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _Southwest Airlines doles out a free ticket to members of its
Rapid Rewards frequent-flier program after they log four round
trips if they book those flights over the Internet. Other Rapid
Rewards members who book the traditional way need twice as many
round trips per year to get that free ticket.
</P>
<P>
   _American Airlines gives its frequent-flier program members
4,000 bonus miles when they book their first trip over the
Internet. Thereafter, they get 1,000 bonus miles for
Internet-booked flights in addition to regular mileage.
</P>
<P>
   _Delta Airlines and others give Internet customers a special 10
percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   As flight dates approach, many airlines dump remaining seats at
discounted prices on their Web sites. Southwest and United, for
example, post discounted seats each Wednesday and e-mail Web-site
customers to let them know what deals are available for travel
between cities customers have identified as significant to them.
</P>
<P>
   The ASTA complaint accuses the airline industry of
discriminating against consumers who don't have computers _ the
group of consumers that may need low prices most _ and of widening
the gap between the affluent and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks don't have computers now and they're never
going to have them,'' says Paul Ruden, vice president of legal
affairs for ASTA. ``The public owns the airspace and the airports.
We think there should be rules in place that make low prices
available to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A Transportation Department spokesman said the agency will look
into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll respond to ASTA when we have an answer,'' says spokesman
Bill Moseley. ``Since they're raising questions of deceptive
practices and discrimination, we take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline representatives say the digital divide argument, or fear
about a widening gap between technically proficient ``haves'' and
``have-nots,'' is a ruse. What ASTA really is mad about is
reductions in the commissions airlines pay travel agents, they say,
and the threat posed by Internet sites that let consumers book
their own flights.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree with the depiction of Internet users as rich
yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about every demographic group imaginable on the
Internet now,'' says American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith. ``We've
noticed a big increase in seniors with disposable income and
flexible schedules. The reality is that those without Internet
access are not doing a lot of flying anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But travel agents say they aren't simply motivated by
protectionist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites give the impression consumers are getting the
best prices, though that may not be the case. There's no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harsh reality is that it's often difficult and confusing
for people to use these sites,'' says ASTA's Ruden.
</P>
<P>
   In general, consumers still get the best prices by working with
travel agents, says Laurie Berger, editor of the Consumer Reports
Travel Letter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Web is there's no easy way to do good
cost projections,'' says Berger. ``It's hard to know if you're
truly getting a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   ASTA and Consumers Union are not the only ones concerned about
the fairness issue. U.S. Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., has introduced
legislation that would mandate that Internet fares be made
available to those using airline telephone reservations systems or
travel agents, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation isn't expected to make it into law this year,
but it has raised awareness of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The multiplicity of prices isn't about finding what the market
will bear,'' says Consumers Union's Silbergeld. ``It's about
finding what each consumer will bear.''

CAROLINA POWER MAY BE BUYING FLORIDA UTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Fla.)  (Eds.: This story is now on the Times business front page) 
(mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolina Power and Light Co., the second-largest utility in
North Carolina, is close to an agreement to buy Florida Progress
Corp., the second-largest utility in Florida, in a deal worth as
much as $5.3 billion, a person close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would be a combination of cash and stock valued
at about $54 a share, the person said. Carolina Power's board was
thought to have met Friday to discuss the proposal, and Florida
Progress' board was expected to meet over the weekend. As with any
deal, talks could collapse, but both companies were planning to
announce the deal on Monday, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Progress, based in St. Petersburg, would add 1.3 million
customers in Florida's west and central regions and along the Gulf
Coast to Carolina Power's 1.2 million in North Carolina and South
Carolina. Carolina Power, based in Raleigh, N.C., recently bought
North Carolina Natural Gas Co. for $354 million and is eager to
expand into the Florida electricity market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have no place left to expand, and they want to
stay in the fast-growing Southeast,'' said Edward Tirello, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, who has a ``hold'' rating
on both companies.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is announced, Carolina Power will compete with its
larger rival, Duke Energy Corp., which has 2 million electricity
customers in the Carolinas. Analysts have said that Carolina Power
needs to find more sources of revenue to remain competitive. And
Duke, the second-largest utility holding company in the United
States, has been expanding. Last year, Duke said it wanted to build
a $160 million power plant on Florida's eastern coast to sell power
to utilities and large energy users.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's electricity market is the fourth-largest in the United
States and has for some time been considered an attractive target
for companies outside the state. But many companies have been
restricted in their efforts to sell power into Florida because of
limited access to transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Progress has been seeking a merger partner. The company
has had numerous problems, including a trouble-plagued nuclear
plant and a lawsuit brought by regulators in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Progress began as St. Petersburg Electric Light and
Power Co. in 1899. During the 1920s and '30s, the company acquired
several rival utilities. But in the '80s, it decided to diversify
into equipment- leasing and life insurance, a decision that proved
full of problems.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Florida Progress ended talks with Scottish Power, the
British utility company, after the two companies failed to agree on
a price. Scottish Power agreed in November to buy Pacificorp, a
utility based in Portland, Ore., in a transaction valued at about
$11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Florida Progress rose $1, to $44.625, while Carolina
Power rose 6.25 cents, to $39.

   RACINE, Wis. _ There is no family feud over succession at S.C.
Johnson &AMP; Co., no pack of obstructionist cousins demanding larger
dividend checks. The 113-year-old family business has not gone the
way of Milwaukee's Schlitz Brewing Co., collapsing after the family
owners lost control. No one has been inquiring about the rise and
fall of the storied Johnson empire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a tiny, elegant sitting room at the headquarters
here of the old Johnson Wax empire, three of the four Johnson
children are seated knee to knee on a white sofa, listening to
their father, Samuel Curtis Johnson, explain to a visitor his
unusual plan to sustain one of the nation's largest family-owned
businesses by splitting it asunder.
</P>
<P>
   That plan _ to carve the $5 billion enterprise into three
unequal parts, giving each interested child a separate company to
run _ was more than 30 years in the making, Johnson said, and born
out of earlier brushes with family disaster. Framing it has
entailed patient planning and study, an eye toward history and
careful stroking as the children were positioned for the future,
each like a delicate chess piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read every article in a major publication about family
enterprises,'' said Johnson, 71 and usually called Sam, as he
described a succession plan that will fall into place in the next
few months. ``We think about what are the things that destroy
family enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his siblings, Sam Johnson's first child _ also named Samuel
Curtis Johnson, but called Curt _ heard horror stories about the
collapse of other family enterprises as he was growing up. Rather
than demand a birthright to ascend to his father's role, Curt
Johnson, now 44, has agreed to run a unit of the business that
sells to industrial customers. His sister Helen Johnson-Leipold,
42, was named chief executive of the family's recreational products
business in March.
</P>
<P>
   And next year, the giant consumer product unit _ with a stable
of familiar brands including Drano, Windex and Raid _ will be
entrusted to their brother, Herbert Fisk Johnson, 41, who is named
for his grandfather and great-grandfather and is called Fisk.
(Winnie Johnson-Marquart, 40, their little sister, hasn't wanted to
run a business. She has four children, lives in Virginia and works
part-time for S.C. Johnson in public affairs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure this is unusual,'' Sam Johnson said emphatically,
speaking later in his office. But he is resolute that giving his
children autonomy is the recipe for a successful transfer of power.
``One thing I know about brothers working for brothers,'' he
explained, ``is that it always has the potential for disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   If families like the Schlitzes, or the Binghams of Kentucky,
whose media company dissolved as father battled son and brother
battled sister, afford case studies in what can go wrong in the
passing of the generational baton, the Johnsons would like to
believe that their story will be a case study in what can go right.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews here, the family, which rarely talks
to the press, spoke passionately and eloquently about finding its
own path to family succession.
</P>
<P>
   To commune with their family roots, the Johnsons retraced the
path of an airplane trip that Sam Johnson's father made to the
Brazilian jungle in 1935. To work through hard problems of
governance and finance, they turned to a network of family advisers
and consultants. And always, the children felt the gentle prodding
of their father, who lured a reluctant generation back into the
fold so that the core enterprise might have a chance to remain in
family hands for the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course these Johnsons, the fifth generation, face all the
questions that come with taking over a family business. Are they
qualified beyond mere blood? Can they distinguish themselves _
without feuding _ in a competitive corporate environment? And will
their decisions about succession prove to be in the company's best
interest, or just the family's?
</P>
<P>
   There is no tried-and-true formula to success in family
businesses, but there is a sense among historians that the best
model may be the Johnsons' _ no model at all, really, just subtlety
and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family dynastic situation has to find its own solutions,
and they have to be tailored to a family's particular quirks and
personality,'' said Alex S. Jones, who wrote about the Binghams,
longtime owners of The Louisville Courier-Journal, and is about to
release a book he wrote with his wife, Susan E. Tifft, about the
Sulzberger family, which controls The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's often the quirks _ and more fundamental flaws, like
pride, greed or sloth _ that snuff out family business dynasties.
Few even field a fifth generation of family managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How unusual is it for a company to be in the fifth
generation?'' said Joseph Astrachan, a professor of family business
at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. ``There's a .2
probability.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; All in the Family: A Floor Wax Fortune Kept Close to Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1886 by an earlier Samuel Curtis Johnson, Sam
Johnson's great-grandfather, who sold parquet floors before
venturing into floor wax, the company blossomed as Johnson Wax
early in the 20th century. Its ascendancy _ and its unconventional
spirit _ came into public view in 1939, when the company hired
Frank Lloyd Wright to design its headquarters here, a building best
known for its huge, open interior spaces and the golf-tee-like
columns that held up the floors above. (Two years later, Wright
designed Wingspread, the majestic Prairie-style Racine home where
the current Sam Johnson grew up.)
</P>
<P>
   S.C. Johnson also has a tradition as a benevolent enterprise.
Before such donations were fashionable, the company gave 5 percent
of its pretax profits to charities. A profit-sharing plan begun in
1917 gives 25 percent of the company's earnings to employees, who
also have access to a 146-acre park and a vacation resort in
northern Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Fisk Johnson, the second to lead the company, called the
Johnson approach ``enlightened selfishness.'' And to this day, S.C.
Johnson is considered one of the nation's most conscientious
corporate citizens, repeatedly designated by Fortune magazine as
one of the ``100 best companies to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   Its early products were waxes and enamels, but in 1954, Sam
Johnson, then 26 and the head of product development, emerged from
a company lab with the formula for Raid House and Garden Bug
Killer, the first water-based insecticide that could be used safely
on plants. Within a decade, it was one of the company's
best-selling products.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the labs developed Pledge furniture polish,
and then Edge, the first gel-based shaving cream. Publicly, the
company declared that innovation was its hallmark; privately, the
mantra was that each Johnson heir would make a major contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather set the tone in the 1920s, and my father came
with international growth and technology,'' Sam Johnson said
proudly. ``Each generation brings something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Transitions, however, weren't always smooth. When Herbert Fisk
Johnson Sr. died suddenly in 1928, he left no will. A struggle
ensued for control of the Johnson empire, pitting brother against
sister. Eventually, a 60-40 split gave control to Herbert Fisk
Johnson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It took my father 10 years before he was able to settle my
grandfather's estate,'' Sam Johnson recalled. ``Fortunately, it
didn't wreck the family. My father said, `I'm never going to let
that happen to my son.''' In his will, he clearly designated Sam as
his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Johnson wasn't going to let it happen again, either. After
his father had a stroke in 1968, Johnson, by then the company's
president and chairman, took a year off to reflect. When he
returned, he outlined a plan to begin ``downstreaming'' his assets,
setting up trusts for his children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He diversified the company in the 1970s, buying makers of
outdoor recreation equipment to form what has become Johnson
Worldwide Associates, the publicly traded company that Helen
Johnson-Leipold now heads, and starting the Johnson Bank, which is
now one of the largest banks in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   These steps, he acknowledges now, were made as much out of fear
as logic. ``I thought the wax company might get smothered by
Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' said Johnson, whose wealth is now estimated at
$3.6 billion by Forbes magazine. ``I also thought these companies
might make a good farm team for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Schools for Scions: Different Routes Back Toward Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   First, Johnson had to convince his children to join the team,
which he always said was large enough for everyone. It wasn't easy.
They all had distinct interests _ and trepidations about their
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Helen Johnson ventured off on her own. After earning
a degree from Cornell University (all four children, and their
parents, went to Cornell, where the business school is called the
Johnson Graduate School of Management), she worked at an
advertising firm, moonlighted as a bartender and then opened her
own restaurant in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready for the company,'' she said. ``There were very
high expectations for the next generation. So I knew everybody
would be watching. You also want to prove yourself to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Johnson also took a detour. After Cornell, he got an MBA at
Northwestern and then dabbled in real estate and venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have an interest in the family business right away,''
he said. ``Initially, I was interested in small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Fisk Johnson trained specifically to work at S.C. Johnson.
He studied chemistry and received an MBA and then a Ph.D. in
applied physics at Cornell before joining the company in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I wanted to come back,'' he said. ``I thought we
had something unique here.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, Curt and Helen had come back, too, and their father
orchestrated the children's training, taking care that one never
had line authority over another, that each found a way to
demonstrate his or her strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never talked about who would be the ultimate successor,''
Johnson said. ``They were all in the mode of trying to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Top executives helped in job placement. ``They weren't assigned
to a bed of roses,'' recalled Neal Nottleson, a former chief
financial officer. ``Fisk was in an extremely competitive
environment, and Curt was general manager of Mexico in a difficult
period.'' Helen had a tough assignment involving the marketing of a
hair-care product, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A family council was formed. Sam Johnson, his wife, Imogene, and
all four children met regularly to discuss the business and the
family. There were also family advisers with expertise in estates
and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Curt, Helen and Fisk each had a private audience
with their father to declare a primary interest. Curt, the last to
join the company, carved out a niche on the industrial side,
becoming the first to set his sights on a top post. (``That started
the domino effect,'' Ms. Johnson-Leipold said.) Less sexy than the
consumer brands _ selling floor-care products, food sanitation
systems and polymers _ the business had been overlooked as a growth
vehicle, he believed.
</P>
<P>
   Helen, the athletic tennis player and diver, got the
recreational business, which had gone public in 1987. And Fisk, the
scientist, got the big prize, leadership of the core consumer
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnsons say there was little jealousy or competition,
little currying of their father's favor. Yes, they ``fought like
cats and dogs'' as youngsters, Ms. Johnson-Leipold said, but as
adults, they just fell into place, largely because of their
father's attention to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each found our spot,'' she said. ``Curt was the
wheeler-dealer entrepreneur, Fisk was the technician and I was the
one interested in marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Their cousins, the Lewis family _ 38 living descendants of
Herbert F. Johnson Jr.'s sister _ had virtually no say in the
succession, despite their nearly 40 percent interest in the old
Johnson Wax empire.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the internecine battles of the '20s and '30s, the
Johnsons long ago determined that the Lewises would have no role in
running the business. According to Dr. Herbert Johnson Lewis, 71,
that hasn't always gone over well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my kids aren't too happy,'' said Dr. Lewis, a surgeon
who lives in Arizona. ``But I would hope that if they became superb
businessmen, the Johnsons would have to consider them. They'd be
silly not to.'' None of the Lewises now work in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis' side of the family had early concerns about the
current succession. ``Anybody who's looking at a fifth-generation
company has to be very suspect about who's taking over,'' Dr. Lewis
said. ``But I have absolute confidence in Fisk.'' And Sam Johnson,
he added, has been a superb communicator: ``He doesn't let turmoil
boil over.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Onward Bound: Family Bonding And Family Fable &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Johnsons _ for all the dysfunction one can imagine
their circumstances spawning _ seem a remarkably congenial bunch.
They bank at Johnson Bank and eat at Johnson-owned restaurants.
They love the outdoors; they love shared adventures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most important came a year ago, when Sam Johnson suggested
that he and the boys re-enact a trip his father made to Fortaleza,
Brazil, in 1935. Johnson's father flew a Sikorsky S-38 amphibious
aircraft 15,000 miles, from Milwaukee to the Brazilian rain forest
and back, to study an area rich with carnauba palm trees, a key
ingredient in Johnson wax, and to open a school there. In a copy of
a book he published privately about the ``journey of his life,''
Herbert Jr. wrote to his son: ``Sammy, I hope you take this trip
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sam, Curt and Fisk Johnson went scuba diving in
Indonesia, hoping to recover the original Sikorsky plane, which had
sunk in the Manokwari Bay in 1938, after the Johnson family had
sold it. They found nothing. So they had a replica built. The
``Spirit of Carnauba'' took off from Racine last Oct. 22, with a
few squabbles along the way as father and sons jockeyed for the
pilot's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad gave new meaning to the term `back-seat driver,''' Fisk
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   After stops to refuel and rest, they arrived nearly a month
later in Fortaleza and were joined by the rest of the family. More
than just an Outward Bound-style adventure, there was something
almost mystical about this pilgrimage to what the Johnsons call the
``Tree of Life,'' their way of connecting the carnauba to the
company's mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip has provided us with an opportunity to talk about
some of the issues and opportunities facing the family
businesses,'' Curt Johnson wrote in an Internet posting to Johnson
employees. ``I feel connected to the visioning process my
grandfather experienced when he made this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pursuit of Profit: Facing the Rivals On the Outside &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With a succession plan in place, the Johnsons now face the
prospect of leading what soon will be three companies into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Johnson's unit, Johnson Professional, now has its own
building in Racine, a crisp, new, red-brick structure whose lobby
pays homage to Johnson Wax and the Johnson family. He hopes to rev
up sales, and after the company is spun off in November, the family
may consider taking it public to finance its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson-Leipold's business, Johnson Worldwide, has struggled
as a public company, its stock lagging behind even the anemic
Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks over the last
three and a half years. Revenues jumped 12 percent in the most
recent quarter, but amounted to just $356 million for the 12 months
through June.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Johnson-Leipold is happy with her role in the family
enterprise. ``We all came with slightly different strengths,'' she
said, adding, ``You're not in it for yourself, and it doesn't
matter which piece is bigger than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer business, Fisk Johnson faces his own formidable
set of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   According to his father, revenues are growing about 8 percent
annually. But the gains in the past few years have come from
acquisitions. Last year, SC Johnson, as the familiar part of the
business is called, bought Dow Brands, whose products included
Ziploc bags and Fantastik cleaner. Those operations must be
integrated, and new sources of growth found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of their consumer goods businesses are slow-growth
businesses,'' said John Nevin, a marketing professor at the
University of Wisconsin, who has followed the company for decades.
``And so they're going to have to do it through innovation or the
acquisition of innovative businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the company also continues to face
stiff competition. ``They face a formidable competitor in Clorox,
which understands how to build a brand,'' said William H. Steele,
an analyst for Banc America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson ranks No. 1 or 2 in market share in nearly every
major category where it competes. According to Information
Resources Inc., a market research firm in Chicago, Raid and Windex
hold 60 percent shares of the United States market for products in
their categories; Drano has a 43 percent share among drain
cleaners, and Edge is the top-selling shaving cream.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson executives say they are seeking growth overseas and
benefiting from huge sales of Glade scented candles, a relatively
new product line. Though it cannot distribute stock options, the
company says that its compensation plans are competitive with
publicly held companies, and that it has no trouble attracting and
retaining top talent.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk Johnson says that he recognizes the pressure to create new
and innovative products, as his father did, but that he won't rush
out with something just to prove himself. ``I don't plan on making
any bold moves,'' he said _ the kind of comment rarely heard from
the chairman-to-be of a publicly held corporation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Children's Hour: A Patriarch Ready To Call It a Day &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sam Johnson, however, remains confident about both the company's
prospects and his children's preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' he said with a smile, sitting in an office
decorated with model planes and fishing gear. ``They're all well
qualified to do what they're doing, and now it's up to me to let
them do it.
</P>
<P>
   He even has a plan in place to resolve disputes, a board made up
of the four children and three advisers they selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of us goes berserk, there's a system to remove that
person,'' Ms. Johnson-Leipold explained; the advisers will break
any ties.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is distancing himself from day-to-day operations; his
office is three miles from company headquarters. ``I'm 71 years
old, going on 72, and 72 seems to be the magic age to vacate one's
seats on boards and things like that,'' Johnson said reflectively.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he cannot influence at all is whether his children
will be able to keep the enterprise in Johnson family hands into
the sixth generation, in which there are already 11 potential chief
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation and environmental issues will get Johnson's
attention, and he will oversee Johnson International, the
850-employee financial services company that sprang from the
Johnson Bank. He even plans to open up his own banquet facility in
downtown Racine, right next to Ms. Johnson-Leipold's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in place,'' Johnson said. ``The management is in
place. The product line-up is in place. There are no looming
problems. I can step aside without any serious worries.''
</P>
<P>
   And in any event, ``it's up to them,'' Johnson said of his
children. ``I can't operate from my grave.''

</P>
<P>
   WHITE-RAP-MUSIC (Undated) _ Rap _ like most everything from the
blues to alternative rock before it _ has been officially embraced
by those who originally ostracized it, avariciously consumed by
those who it was invented in part to declare independence from. Of
course, rap has been integral to pop music and suburban youth
lifestyle since at least 1986, when the first rap album (by the
Beastie Boys) crossed over to number one on the Billboard charts.
But the difference is that back then, when white kids _ the Beastie
Boys, Rick Rubin and hard-rock bands like Faith No More and Anthrax
_ were getting into rap, it was a genre they were only just
discovering. Soon after, rappers began appearing who spoke almost
solely to white concerns, like Me Phi Me and Kid Rock, but they
didn't succeed because then because they were too early (and not
very good either). But today, rap is like the Beatles. It is a
birthright, something many white kids grow up listening to, a
standard by which they calibrate their lifetime notion of pop
music. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).

<P>
   FOUNTAIN-DANCE (Undated) _ The quirky story-ballet of Rostislav
Zakharov's ``Fountain of Bakhchisarai,'' which, though dating from
1934, had never been seen in New York until the Kirov Ballet
brought it to the Metropolitan Opera House this summer.
``Fountain'' arrived with a strange reputation. Based on a poem by
Pushkin, it dates from the time when Socialist Realism dominated
the arts in Soviet Russia. So it was easy to fear that it would toe
a dull party line. Instead, despite its occasionally trite score by
Boris Asafiev, it proved lively. By Jack Anderson. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   LIVE-SAX-ACTS (New York) _ Two bare-chested men, wearing
tartanless kilts and effeminate jazz shoes, dance and play the
saxophone; the same pair, dressed in tuxedos, speak to each other
through bullhorns, slap each other's faces or grab each other's
crotches without flinching, all the while exchanging gentlemanly
chitchat; finally, as two guys in business attire, they wheel and
deal on the telephone. These are just some of the loaded images
that the choreographer-dancer Dan Dorfman and the
composer-performance artist Dan Froot have devised for their three
comic duets, ``Horn'' (1990), ``Bull'' (1994) and ``Job'' (1996),
respectively. The roughly 20-minute pieces have been performed
several times since their premieres as ironic accents in Dorfman's
and Froot's individual performance gigs. Now they will present them
as an evening unto themselves under the title ``Live Sax Acts'' at
Dance Theater Workshop. By William Harrris. (Moved).

   RABIN-RENARDY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Sony Classical's Masterworks
Heritage series was conceived to celebrate the past, but with a new
CD devoted to the violinists Michael Rabin and Ossy Renardy (MHK
60894), the label is also paying homage to two artists cut down in
their prime. Both players were already superior musicians when they
died, and in certain circles their demise still elicits palpable
regret. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).

<P>
   SALZBURG-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ Salzburg is in good part a city of
shopkeepers, and streets are jammed with visitors spending money.
How much of a magnet the music festival is, and how much the small,
pretty and reasonably historic city surrounded by Alpine scenery,
is hard to judge. A lot of visitors, and they are 40 percent from
German-speaking places, don't look as if they can afford $400, or
even $100 tickets; residents often appear more prosperous than
their customers. Calls for a small-scale, small-budget, homegrown
festival have been heard, but businessmen are not protesting too
loudly about Gerard Mortier, who has ran the festival since 1991.

   STILL-LIFE-ART (Amsterdam, Holland) _ A new show at the
Rijksmuseum here, ``Still Life: Paintings From the Netherlands,
1550-1729,'' with 70 carefully selected paintings, many on loan for
the occasion, claims to be the first exhibition to display all the
different types of still life from the golden age of Dutch and
Flemish painting. And it succeeds in demonstrating why they were so
popular in their day and why they are attracting new interest
today. The show runs in the Rijksmuseum's South Wing through Sept.
19 and will then be on display from Oct. 31 to Jan. 9 at the
Cleveland Museum of Art, which has a rich collection of still life
of all periods and is a co-organizer of this exhibition. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).

<P>
   SITE-SANTA-FE-ART (Santa Fe., N.M.) _ The biennial exhibition of
international contemporary art that opened here last month was
devoted to exploring the meaning of ``place.'' But even before the
opening festivities were over, two installations had been shut down
precisely because of their locations. ``Looking for a Place'' was
the title of the third biennial sponsored by SITE Santa Fe, a

   TV-BEHIND-THE-MUSIC (Undated) _ In the two years since it was
first broadcast, ``Behind the Music'' has become the music
industry's closet compulsion. Members of the media elite may not
blithely volunteer the information, but just start asking and
you'll be amazed at how many people admit to watching. ``Behind the
Music'' is ``Entertainment Tonight'' without the heavy cheese
factor, ``Biography'' minus the historical pretensions. It's a
simple, brilliant formula: a one-hour documentary about the ups and
downs of music careers, with subjects from Fleetwood Mac to David
Cassidy to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Madonna. By Karen Schoemer.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark McGwire played in the World Series in his
second, third and fourth seasons in the major leagues. He thought
that was how his career would always be.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McGwire has to glance into the opposing dugout for the
surreptitious scoreboard watching _ the players cheering a
strategic fine point, the tension of a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   He is not complaining about his station in life _ he hit a
ridiculous 70 homers last year and had 48, one behind Sammy Sosa,
going into Friday night _ but McGwire looks wistful when he
remembers those early autumns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spoiled at a young age,'' McGwire said, hoping to take
his home run cuts at a soggy Shea Stadium, as the moribund St.
Louis Cardinals were playing the contending Mets.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, now 35, came over from Oakland in August 1997 in one of
those modern baseball clearance sales, a low-budget team divesting
itself of a respected slugger it could no longer afford. Now, by
the vagaries that allow a small-market team to actually compete
once in a while, Oakland has hopes of the wild card and the
Cardinals have no hopes at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy for them,'' McGwire said Friday night. ``I watch
the scoreboard. They've got a brand-new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to Jason all the time,'' McGwire added, referring to
Jason Giambi of the A's. ``He says they are all eager to go to the
ballpark every day.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is happy to come to the ballpark, too. He has the
positive glow of a man who has known physical pain and psychic pain
and has come through to the other side. Friday night he recalled
his role models when he came up. ``Don Baylor, Carney Lansford,
Dave Stewart, Dennis Eckersley,'' he said. ``They had a great
coaching staff. Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   He came from one of the great college programs, the University
of Southern California and coach Rod Dedeaux, but he said he was
stunned at the mental scope of the major leagues under manager Tony
La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up thinking you can play with physical ability,''
McGwire said. ``And you can, for a while. But not for long. You
learn baseball is 99 percent mental'' _ the little things that win
pennants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every athlete wants to win,'' McGwire said. ``Nobody puts on
the uniform and doesn't want to win. But people don't understand
how difficult it is for six months. It's not easy. Injuries.
Players not playing up to their level that year.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not being critical of anybody, just acknowledging that
the Cardinals could be spoilers, and not much more. However,
McGwire does not buy the theory that being out of contention frees
him and Sosa to take three big swings every time up, 12 or 15 each
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My swing's the same all the time,'' McGwire said, flexing
those massive forearms. ``I think I'm pretty patient. I get a lot
of walks. You're not going to hit a home run off a pitcher's pitch.
It's got to be off a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He expected that fans in Shea might cheer for him to hit one,
but not if it would jeopardize the Mets' run toward October. On one
level, McGwire is chasing Henry Aaron's career record of 755. On
another level, he and Sosa are a stirring sideshow to the pennant
races.
</P>
<P>
   He accepts that, just as he accepts that he cannot go out for
dinner anonymously, just as he accepts that he must answer his
complicated relationship with the substance androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was criticized because his 70 home runs drew
attention to a bodybuilding steroid that just might cause long-term
health problems. Baseball looked worse, however, tolerating the
stuff as if afraid to tarnish McGwire's record.
</P>
<P>
   This year, McGwire stopped taking andro at the start of the
season but never mentioned it for four months. Friday night,
McGwire explained his reasoning, saying: ``It's legal; you can buy
it over the counter. I still don't think there's anything wrong
with it, but I got tired of hearing about young kids under age who
were probably taking it improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said the ban by most sports leagues and federations was
``hogwash _ it's all natural.'' But he said that he would advise
his own son, Matthew, 11, against using it because ``I wouldn't
want him associated with it,'' meaning the stigma rather than any
physical danger.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes showed great zest for the last six weeks of the season,
another race with Sammy, another weird flirtation with 60, maybe
even 70. But he grew a trifle somber when he recalled the joy, the
terror, the challenge of a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciated it,'' McGwire said. ``If I ever get it again,
I'd appreciate it more.''

NEWSPAPER STOCKS AN INTERNET STORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom of the new economy says newspapers ought
to be on their last legs. In this view, it will not be long before
the Internet eats the newspapers' lunch by siphoning off readers
and advertising to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, that kind of thinking depressed share prices of
the big publicly traded newspaper companies. In 1998, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was rising 26.7 percent, the Bear
Stearns Diversified Newspaper Index inched up just 1.5 percent, and
the trend was little better in the first part of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Since April 1, newspaper stocks have surged 22
percent while the broader market has been bouncing up and down. And
there may be more good news ahead for the sector, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   William Drewry, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
the spurt is just the start of a long stretch of outperformance, as
stock valuations catch up with important improvements in
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   A new cadre of cost-conscious and shareholder-friendly managers
has been slashing payrolls, shedding ancillary businesses, reducing
debt and buying back stock, Drewry said. By his calculations,
industry revenue is growing at 5 percent annually, bolstered by
firm advertising prices, while costs apart from raw materials
(mainly for labor) are growing only 3 to 3.5 percent a year. And
with the often-volatile price of newsprint now low, he expects the
industry to parlay its widening margins into double-digit earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors make newspaper stocks attractive as a value
investment, even after the recent run-up. But there may be a growth
investment here, too: Largely unnoticed by the market, newspapers
have invested aggressively in their supposed nemesis, the Internet,
and are already generating impressive revenues on line. For
example, the second-largest job recruitment Web site,
CareerPath.com, is run by a consortium of newspaper companies.
</P>
<P>
   And newspapers control valuable Internet assets in their vast
archives of articles and photographs, as well as data bases and
reporting resources, said Steven Barlow, an analyst with Credit
Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, moving on line means grappling with a host of nimble
and aggressive new competitors for readership and ads. ``The big
question,'' Drewry said, ``is not how big the Internet market
becomes, but how much can newspapers capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gruneich, an analyst with Bear Stearns, said he thinks
``the Internet fear factor'' may wane in coming months. Gruneich,
who began advising investors to shy away from newspaper stocks in
early 1998, turned bullish in June on near-term prospects for
several of them. A broad-based rebound in advertising and a sharp,
23 percent decline in newsprint costs since January prompted his
change of heart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder is an example of a company with an upside both on
line and off, he said. Every decrease in newsprint prices bolsters
its profits, he noted, while its Internet operations, principally
the Realcities news, entertainment and commerce Web site, yield at
least $30 million a year in revenue. He expects the stock to rise
to $64 or $65 within a year, from $54 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   William Bird of Salomon Smith Barney is bullish on the
Washington Post Co. because of its combination of strong free cash
flow and a history of using cash effectively for share repurchases
and acquisitions. The stock is also attractive, Bird said, because
of its overfunded pension plan, its Internet assets and its Kaplan
Education subsidiary. His 12-month price target for the stock is
$675; it now trades at $556.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow of Credit Suisse First Boston said he thought
newspaper-company profit margins would hold up relatively well,
even if the economy slowed. His choices in the sector include the
Gannett Co. and the Tribune Co., which get one-third to one-half of
their cash flow from broadcasting operations. He sees Gannett
rising to $80 a share, from $68.9375 Friday, and Tribune to $100,
from $94.75, within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Marcin of Gabelli Asset Management said she is keen on
The New York Times Co., because ``the best way to invest in the
Internet is through companies that sell their own products over the
Web.'' She expects the company's Internet operations to expand the
reach of its principal newspaper properties, The Times and The
Boston Globe, and account for $4.50 of the $48 price she expects
the stock to reach within a year; it closed at $37.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's price-to-earnings multiples, which ran at an
average 40 percent premium to the broader market from 1988 to 1998,
now lag behind the S&AMP;P 500. But bullish analysts like Drewry think
the multiples will rise again as newspapers spin out their online
businesses with their own stock listings.
</P>
<P>
   Drewry sees a precedent for newspapers in the shift in investor
perception that turned cable stocks into highfliers. ``Two or three
years ago, cable companies were seen as losers in the next
generation of communications,'' he noted. But partly because of
Microsoft's investment in the Comcast Corp. in 1997, investors
began looking at cable companies as attractive bets on the Internet
infrastructure. Newspapers look ripe for a similar rethinking by
investors, he said, even if Bill Gates doesn't buy one.

OPENING THE BOOKS ON AMERICAN BUSINESS, 1841-1891 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ With his large hands clad in delicate white
gloves, Travis Blackman gingerly opened the sheepskin-bound book
and blew gently on the onion-skin-thin pages to separate them. He
treated the aged volume with the reverence normally reserved for a
first-edition Dickens or Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   But all this fuss over a credit report? Or rather, over 2,580
volumes of handwritten credit reports that date back to 1841 and
run through 1891. As unromantic as it sounds, for people who study
the wheelings and dealings of days gone by, the R.G. Dun &AMP; Co.
Collection at Harvard University is the Holy Grail of business
history.
</P>
<P>
   For within the books' light blue pages, written in curvaceous
script, are titillating details about whether a particular
businessman drank too much or attended church, if he got his money
from his rich wife or his business was a front for a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   Ne'er-do-wells are boldly named, like one storekeeper in Halifax
County, N.C., who in June 1873 was referred to as a ``purchaser of
stolen goods, a great scamp.'' Long before the existence of the
Securities and Exchange Commission or the annual stockholder
meeting, it was the credit report that told the real dirt on a
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These volumes represent the creation of a national business
network,'' said Blackman, who oversees the use of the archives for
what is now Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp., which donated them to the
university in 1962. ``Every nook-and-cranny village on the
frontier, somebody was there sending a report to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, more people are noticing. The number of people
poring over the collection almost doubled over the last three
years, from about 900 in 1995 to approximately 1,700 in 1998.
Blackman, who must sign off on all the books and theses that quote
the Dun collection, said that a few years ago, he might have
reviewed one or two manuscripts a month. Now he sees five or six.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Linard, director of historical collections at the library,
said use has increased significantly because more scholars
appreciate the worth of business records. It is the most used of
all the library's historical records, to the point that Ms. Linard
is a little frightened for its safety. ``The collection is very,
very fragile,'' she said. ``It's in incredibly poor condition,
because these books were used during their lifetime, consistently,
constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   To scholars, the credit assessments are invaluable for piecing
together American business history, in part because they avoid
corporate spin and show the view of a third party _ in this case,
the agents, or ``correspondents,'' across the nation who reported
back to R.G. Dun's home office on the creditworthiness of local
carpenters, grocers and lightning-rod makers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kenzer, a history professor at the University of
Richmond, recently trawled the books for information on Civil War
widows who took over their husbands' businesses. ``They were broad
in their perspective,'' Kenzer said of the Dun reporters. ``They
rate the elite and they rate the common people. Right next to the
Rockefellers you find someone you've never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   A June 1870 entry on one J.B. Alford, who sold groceries and
liquors, read: ``This man is said to be in thriving circumstances.
He has some Real &AMP; personal estate &AMP; I think it is safe to trust
him.'' Alas, the December 1876 entry read, ``Failed abt 3 mos ago &AMP;
went into Bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and historians like Kenzer use the archives to
study the growth of a particular industry, like pottery, or a
specific topic, like Jewish-owned businesses before the turn of the
century. Over the last 20 years, Kenzer has made many trips to
Boston, researching subjects like black-owned businesses in the
South. Once, he spent six weeks copying every page of one ledger.
``It's pretty exhausting work,'' he said. ``Fortunately, they had
good handwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the kind of summer reading only a number-cruncher
could love, and Harvard business students seem to agree. For
although the archive is housed in the Baker Library at the School
of Business Administration, it is used infrequently by Harvard's
MBA candidates, most of whom are more concerned with strategic
mapping and venture capital than the cost of antebellum dry goods.
Only scholars with very good reasons _ and white gloves _ are
allowed to handle the fragile books. The library no longer allows
genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are lessons from the past that young executives
could take with them into the business world. For starters, there
is the danger of first impressions. One entry from June 1863
reports that a produce merchant named J.D. Rockefeller ``is not
much of a businessman, but had some capital, it is said, advanced
by his father, who is reputed well off.'' He turned out to be a
good credit risk; that was the year he set up a refinery that
blossomed into Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the power of courtesy, as demonstrated in some
handwritten requests for payment. Who wouldn't cave at this gentle
entreaty: ``If you will kindly favor us with a check at your
convenience, you will much oblige''?
</P>
<P>
   The Dun correspondents were often inspiring in their
objectivity, for although they reported on the race or religion of
a business owner, as was common at the time, those facts did not
necessarily affect their rating of someone's business acumen.
Women, it seems, could sometimes get credit when men could not,
because, as one researcher found, they were seen as ``cautious''
and ``economical.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking was another matter. ``If you were intemperate, they
were not going to extend you credit,'' Kenzer said. Ponder the fate
of G.H., an Ontario innkeeper, listed as ``fond of drinking and
gambling. Considered bad stock unsafe for credit.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Millennium watchers might take comfort in the business disasters
of the past. Kenzer, who is starting research on the Chicago fire
of 1871, said: ``The problem wasn't just the people who were burned
out. You don't know who you owe money to, or who owes money to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be similar to a Y2K issue,'' he said. ``How do you
recover when you lose a lot of information?'' Chicago, after all,
bounced back fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   One can get a snapshot of the early career of businessmen like
Frank Winfield Woolworth, who borrowed $300 from former employers
to open ``The Great Five Cent Store'' in Utica, N.Y., in 1879. Or
of the catalog tycoon Richard Warren Sears, a telegraph operator
from Minnesota who started a business in mail-order watches and in
1887 took up with a young watchmaker named Roebuck.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Lewis Tappan, the founder of what would become Dun
&AMP; Bradstreet, did not like the idea of credit. Tappan was a
Calvinist whose motto was ``Owe no man anything but to love one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a depression in the early 1800s left businesses in
tatters, the practical Tappan saw that lenders needed to know whom
they could trust to pay debts. Twice a year, correspondents would
send their reports to Tappan's office in New York, then called the
Mercantile Agency. The subscribers or their personal clerks could
come to the office to hear credit reports on their business
associates, read in discreet whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Graham Dun took over the agency in 1859, and it would be
known as R.G. Dun &AMP; Co. until it merged with its main competitor,
Bradstreet Co., in 1933. Throughout that time, credit reporting
grew along with American business. When the railroad expanded
business horizons, correspondents traveled west to report on
saloonkeepers and cattle ranchers. One correspondent wrote of his
work: ``One method was to go on the railroad as far as possible,
then to visit the towns on horseback. I traveled many miles on the
hot plains of Texas by saddle, buckboard or mail hack.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the correspondents, usually lawyers who received fees for
collecting debts, were four future presidents: Ulysses S. Grant,
William B. McKinley, Grover Cleveland and Abraham Lincoln. After
Lincoln's assassination, an agency clerk marked up an entry on the
president, drawing a weeping willow tree and a grave marker and
writing in the words: ``This office has had the honor of having Old
Abe as a correspondent.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant's commentaries could be especially colorful: He reported
that a particular young lawyer he evaluated had nothing but an
office chair, a barrel with a board for a desk, and a fine young
wife. Still, he argued that ability and ambition were as important
as capital, and recommended credit.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the last century were sometimes branded by the
company they kept. In 1869, a correspondent wrote that Hannah
Griffith, a milliner in Springfield, Ill., was ``about to marry a
fellow (of) no account.'' An entry two years later noted, with some
relief, that that plan had fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   Modern credit write-ups, of course, are far less prying, not
even denoting whether a business executive is a Mr. or a Ms. The
streamlining came about through a natural technological evolution.
With the introduction of things like typewriters, telephones and
fax machines to do the reporting and computers to do the analyzing,
it was easier to have some sort of consistency in the reports, and
easier to compare businesses within particular industries.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Dun's clients started demanding more facts and
less gossip. ``Social mores change,'' Blackman said. ``All of a
sudden our customers stopped asking whether a person drank to
excess and started asking things like `How is World War II
affecting this manufacturer?'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today's reports are strictly factual, with their
tabulations based on bills, suits, liens and government filings,
information gleaned from enormous databases. For all its pride in
its almost 160-year history, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet might like to forget
the references to a Jewish business owner as ``another of the
tribe'' or the abbreviation ``col'd'' after the name of every black
business. But it does allow today's researchers to track the role
of different races and religions in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Should 20th-century businesses fear that future generations will
entertain themselves with their credit histories? Blackman said no:
New information on a company supplants the old, and when a business
closes, its file is left all but blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be anything like this ever again, as far as a
snapshot of American business history,'' he said.

PHELPS DODGE BIDS FOR SMALLER COPPER PRODUCERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.Y.)  (ko) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing a consolidation trend among basic commodity
industries, Phelps Dodge Corp., the copper producer, made a bid
Friday and then sweetened it to acquire Cyprus Amax Minerals Co.
and Asarco Inc., which themselves had just agreed to merge. The
Phelps Dodge bid was promptly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Phelps Dodge's all-stock bid, which started at
$2.4 billion and grew to $2.66 billion by the end of the day, may
ultimately be hard for the newly combined targets to resist given
the difficult economics of the copper industry. Prices are hitting
rock bottom, there is global overcapacity and there are no apparent
prospects for a change in this dismal combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phelps bid is a bold move; it is a complex move, and, at
the end of the day, it will prevail,'' said Vahid Fathi, a metals
industry analyst with ABN Amro in Chicago. ``The combined trio
would be propelled to the top of the chain as the No. 1 producer.
Truly, this is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   An equally bold note was sounded Friday by Phelps Dodge's chief
executive, Douglas Yearley, who said, in a call to analysts, ``We
are now prepared to take all necessary steps to make this happen.''
Among those, Yearley said, was perhaps raising the bid again.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus Amax, which is based in Englewood, Colo., and Asarco,
based in New York, reaffirmed their intention of going it alone
Friday. On Thursday, the boards of the two companies met
separately, and both voted to reject the Phelps Dodge bid, saying
the directors of both companies had ``determined that pursuing the
Asarco-Cyprus merger was in the best interests'' of both companies'
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Cyprus and Asarco are simply holding out
for a higher price from Phelps Dodge or if they are firm in their
determination to resist it. Also unclear is whether their
shareholders will allow them to continue to reject this offer. The
sweetened Phelps Dodge offer would give 0.4098 shares of Phelps
stock for every Asarco share and 0.3135 a share for every Cyprus
share.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's closing price of $59.125 for Phelps Dodge, which was
up 56.25 cents, this would be valued at $24.23 for every Asarco
share, which rose $4 Friday to close at $22.4375. And it would be
valued at $18.54 for every Cyprus share, which rose $2.875 Friday
to close at $17.375. The sweetened Phelps Dodge offer values Cyprus
at some $1.7 billion and Asarco at roughly $960 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of should the shareholders accept is a pretty
easy one,'' said Raymond Goldie, an analyst at St. James Securities
in Toronto. ``Cyprus and Asarco have given their shareholders
returns in the minus-20 percent range, while Phelps has had
something like a 160 percent return in the same time period. I'd
take the money and run.''
</P>
<P>
   If the three-way deal goes through, it would create a company
that would surpass Chile's state-owned Codelco as the world's top
copper producer and would unite production in the copper-rich
American Southwest. Right now the world copper market is being
flooded with copper from Chile and Indonesia, where the mining
costs are lower and the mines are newer.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect that copper prices, which have plunged in
the last few years, should remain relatively flat for the
foreseeable future. Copper has been trading at around 70 to 75
cents a pound lately, the lowest levels in over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is swimming in copper,'' said John C. Tumazos, an
analyst with Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``And North American companies
realize they are in big competitive trouble. It's a given that
things have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Tumazos, however, said Cyprus and Asarco shareholders might be
persuadeded by management to give the newly combined entity a
chance on its own. That would leave Phelps Dodge, the world's No. 4
producer, out of a global merger wave unless it raised its bid even
further. If it did so, it could run the risk of overpaying for
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's bidding was part of a large consolidation trend
sweeping not only copper but all basic commodities: aluminum,
chemicals and oils. Commodity giants have been pairing up to gain
market share and reduce costs in a world flooded by raw material
overcapacity and declining demand. This week, the world's largest
aluminum maker, Alcoa Inc., won agreement to acquire Reynolds
Metals, which would make it even bigger. This comes on the heels of
a three-way merger on both sides of the Atlantic to unite a
Canadian, a Swiss and a French aluminum maker into one giant
company rivaling Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus and Asarco announced their merger plans in July and have
set a Sept. 30 date for shareholders to vote on the deal. Those two
companies say this union will save $200 million in costs. Fathi of
ABN Amro said a merger with Phelps Dodge could realize another $200
million in savings _ by eliminating redundant operations.

CLINTON, IN ROLE REVERSAL, HELPS HIS WIFE AS FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ For the first time in the strange odyssey of
a sitting president whose wife is seeking public office, President
Clinton stepped into the role of supportive spouse Friday night to
help Hillary Rodham Clinton build up a war chest for her likely
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a Nantucket dinner that cost $1,000 a ticket, Mrs. Clinton
pulled in more than $100,000 in the first of numerous fund-raising
events that she plans to attend in the next two weeks during the
couple's summer vacation. She is expected to raise about $600,000
toward the more than $20 million she needs for her all-but-declared
candidacy for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, President Clinton started stumping for his vice
president, Al Gore, introducing him to small clutches of
fund-raisers and crowds of others. Friday night he began the same
supportive duty for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was the star of the show as 140 people gathered at
the Nantucket home of Smith and Elizabeth Bagley, longtime
Democratic donors. Bagley is an heir to the R.J. Reynolds tobacco
fortune, and Mrs. Bagley is a former ambassador to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the draw,'' Mrs. Bagley said in an interview before
serving her guests a buffet dinner of chicken, Portuguese sausage,
mussels and clams at their spacious, weathered cedar-shingled home.
``There are people calling like crazy. We promised we'd help in any
way we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The guests included Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as
those with lower profiles, like several longtime island residents,
like Chuck Lenhart, an architect, Martin McGowan, a gardener, and
Paula Gonfrader, who owns a hairdressing salon. But most, Mrs.
Bagley said, are longtime Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   The buffet, which was closed to the press, came after the couple
spent the first full day of their vacation by flying to Nantucket
from Martha's Vineyard, where they are based for the next two
weeks. After the couple landed on Nantucket in the smaller DC-9
version of Air Force One, Mrs. Clinton's four-vehicle motorcade
broke off from the president's, and they pursued separate
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spent a secluded day golfing at the Nantucket
Golf Club, where some club members were miffed that his arrival
might interfere with their tournament tee times. He played with
Kerry and two major Democratic contributors, Wayne Rogers and Jack
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent the morning helping to raise money to rebuild
the 176-year-old United Methodist Church as part of her program to
help preserve national historical sites. She received a standing
ovation from the 80 people inside the church and cheers and
applause from the 250 people outside.
</P>
<P>
   She then went on a tour of Nantucket's historic, cobblestoned
downtown, trailed by many of the 250 people who had gathered
outside the church, and repeatedly hopped out of her car to chat.
She inspected the Dane Gallery and its New England crafts and
stopped in at Nantucket Loom, whose owner, Elizabeth Winship, had
sent Mrs. Clinton a throw-rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't shopping,'' Ms. Winship said later. ``She was
learning the history of Nantucket.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the afternoon, the Clintons reunited at the Bagley
house before a brief outing to help raise money for the American
Ireland Fund, which promotes peace in Northern Ireland, at the
Nantucket home of Bob Matthews, a New England real estate
developer.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner honored Tim Russert, the NBC newsman, and raised more
than $90,000 for a program called ``Vital Voices,'' which brings
Catholic and Protestant women together. The money is being
contributed in Mrs. Clinton's name. Both Clintons spoke and
afterward, the crowd of more than 100 people, which included actor
Ben Stiller, sang ``Happy Birthday'' in honor of Clinton's 53rd
birthday, which was on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the Bagley's ocean-front house, which like much
of Nantucket was festooned with both Irish and American flags, for
the fund-raising dinner for Mrs. Clinton.

<P>
   BAR, Montenegro _ The rows of slate-gray missile boats rock at
their moorings behind a chain link fence, the Yugoslav sailors
shaded from the unforgiving sun by tarps over the back decks.
Frigates patrol the emerald green waters off the coast and board
incoming freighters for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   A few thousand Yugoslav Army soldiers, in a spacious, grassy
base up the road from the port, drill in combat fatigues and do
maintenance work on Soviet-style tanks and armored personnel
carriers. The outward appearance of order, aided by the soporific
heat, belies a looming rebellion, one that could draw these units
into yet another conflict in Yugoslavia's seemingly endless cycle
of war.
</P>
<P>
   As Montenegro, the second Yugoslav republic, grows more
vociferous in its demands for independence, there are mounting
calls for military intervention from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The political leadership in Montenegro says that in recent days
the generals and admirals who command some 10,000 Yugoslav soldiers
and sailors here have become antagonistic and uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Bar, a major deep-sea commercial port, would probably be the
first piece of real estate seized by Belgrade in the event of a
clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav Navy abuses its privileges in the port,'' said
Mico Orlandic, Bar's deputy mayor. ``During the NATO air strikes
the navy fired missiles at NATO planes and blocked entry to the
port. We were powerless to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The navy ships stop freighters coming into the harbor to carry
out inspections and look for arms,'' he said. ``The army, when it
leaves its barracks, sets up unauthorized roadblocks and seizes
goods. When we try to speak to the high command, they ignore us, as
if this is not our country. If the conflict worsens, we expect
Belgrade to try to seize the port.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, a republic of 600,000 people, occupies 5 percent of
Yugoslav territory. The rest is Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Its president, Milo Djukanovic, once a protege and ally of the
Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, has moved steadily to
distance himself from Belgrade and build ties with the Western
alliance, a policy that largely spared Montenegro from NATO attacks
during the bombing. Djukanovic made his boldest bid to break away
on Aug. 5, proposing that the union between the two states be
scrapped to create a ``commonwealth of the states of Serbia and
Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, he said, would maintain its own army and foreign
ministry and issue its own currency. If the proposal, which has
been branded ``unconstitutional and undemocratic'' by Belgrade, is
rejected, as now seems certain, Montenegro will hold a referendum
this fall calling for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has compared the proposal to the one it spurned with
the Kosovar Albanians in Rambouillet, France, one of the incidents
that led to the war. The Yugoslav government has been lashing out
daily at the Montenegrin leadership in the state-controlled media,
painting it as a ``stooge of NATO'' and part of the Western effort
to topple Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, allies of Milosevic, like Montenegro's
Socialist People's Party, have asked the Yugoslav military to
``restore order.'' The party, led by the current Yugoslav prime
minister, Momir Bulatovic, lost power to Djukanovic in elections in
Montenegro last year, but is the only party representing Montenegro
in Belgrade. The Belgrade press now paints him as the legitimate
leader of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Tomislav Nikolic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, said
this week that if Montenegro goes ahead with the referendum ``the
army will have to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrija Perisic, an executive member of Montenegro's ruling
Democratic Party of Socialists, said he and other Montenegrin
officials are convinced that Belgrade is secretly preparing ``the
same scenario that was used in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montengrin republic, bereft of profitable industry, has
become a haven for smugglers who race fast boats across the
Adriatic to Italy. Djukanovic, Western diplomats say, made his
fortune running untaxed cigarettes and fruit to Italy and importing
black market gasoline. Pencil-thin cigarette boats line the docks
or cruise slowly in the harbor, their powerful engines purring.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, unlike Slovenia, Croatia or even Bosnia, would have
a tough time severing economic ties with Serbia. The port, an
extremely profitable enterprise, has been deserted since NATO
bombed the rail links with Serbia. The airy warehouses, vast
30,000-ton grain silos and docks are lifeless. Bar, which can
handle 5 million tons of goods a year, has moved less than half a
million tons this year. The tourism industry that brought in $150
million a year before the war is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be suicide to try to run the port without Serbian
imports and exports,'' said Alexsander Jovtic, one of the directors
of the port.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day two off-duty soldiers sat writing letters home.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did not relish any clash with the local
population, but would not disobey orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the army one does what one is told,'' said one of the
soldiers. ``We are being prepared for this. If we are told to take
the port, we will do it. It is our job.''

<P>
   Edna Campbell juggles the demands of her job with the
responsibility of being a parent, a dual life complicated because
she is also a single mother.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike women in the male-dominated corporate world, she
works in an environment dominated by women who share her burden and
who help ease the strain. Campbell plays basketball for a living.
</P>
<P>
   As a guard for the Phoenix Mercury she is one of 13 mothers who
play in the Women's National Basketball Association. The league,
which ends its regular season Saturday, also has a working mother,
Valerie B. Ackerman, as its president.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who are mothers are nothing new, especially in
individual sports like golf, where age does not diminish skill and
itineraries can be tailored for each player. But just as
high-profile team sports are new for women, so are the demands on
mothers who travel with the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the U.S. women's national soccer team are married
mothers who traveled with their children _ but not their husbands _
for the six months they were preparing for the World Cup
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the WNBA mothers say, the complexity of parenthood, coupled
with the problems of travel and night games, has forged changes in
the way they organize their work and family lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're charting new waters, but it's a great way in which we
are doing it,'' Carla McGhee, a guard with the Orlando Miracle who
is raising two children, said. ``We're including extended families,
getting friends and our teammates involved. It makes the job a lot
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   McGhee, like nearly half of the players with children, is a
single mother. So is one of the league's biggest stars, Sheryl
Swoopes. The Houston Comets player, whose pregnancy coincided with
the WNBA's making its debut in 1996, announced her separation from
her husband before the WNBA season began in June.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, mothers throughout the 140-player league were
distressed when they learned that Pamela McGee, who played forward
last season for the Los Angeles Sparks, had lost custody of her
3-year-old daughter after her former husband said she missed
several scheduled visits with the child. The husband's lawyer
argued in court that McGee's WNBA career interfered with her
parenting. Before the start of the season, McGee, who is also
raising a 10-year-old son from a previous relationship, retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``As athletes we're disciplined and strong minded and think we
can handle it,'' said the Miracle's McGhee, who also recently
separated from her husband and is raising a 17-month-old son,
Chancellor, and a 13-year-old stepdaughter, Alexandria. ``Being a
professional woman, in the spotlight, making good money, would put
a strain on any relationship. Then with the travel. A lot of people
can't handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   The league does not provide child care, and the issue did not
arise during contract negotiations between the league and the
players union earlier this year. The WNBA's 32-game schedule, which
runs from June to August, makes child-care arrangements easier
because players can draw from a pool that includes college
students, family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely helps having that spouse there,'' said Suzie
McConnell Serio, whose husband, Pete, a schoolteacher, cares for
the couple's four children while she plays guard for the Cleveland
Rockers. ``The biggest thing for me is having the support of my
husband to do this, and having him be able to take care of the
kids. I can put time into training camp and stay focused on what I
need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball mothers routinely bring their children to the
workplace, taking them to home games, practice, shoot-arounds and
on the road _ nannies and grandmothers in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having him on the road with me eases my mind,'' said Swoopes,
who has a nanny travel with her on the road to care for her
2-year-old son. ``Something could happen to him, but at least we're
in the same city. If he were at home, it would drive me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has managed to raise her 15-year-old son, David, and
pursue a successful nine-year career overseas, in the defunct
American Basketball League and now in the WNBA, with help from
family and friends. No matter how far she traveled, she called
David every other day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when she is out of town on business, he runs up her
cellular phone bill calling her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were supposed to call me when you arrived at the hotel,''
he has told Campbell when she forgets to call home the minute she
checks in. He calls to say he loves her. He calls to compliment her
on a job well done. He calls if he thinks she is slacking off.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, before Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands became
the only woman to win four gold medals in track in one Olympics,
she was criticized for competing despite having two children.
Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Swoopes, who graced the cover of Sports
Illustrated for Women magazine when she was nearly nine months
pregnant, managed to make her WNBA debut six weeks after giving
birth to her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my role model,'' said McGhee, who turned a deaf ear to
those who suggested she hang up her ABL jersey after giving birth
to her son. ``A lot of people questioned my decision to return
after I had Chance, but I talked to Sheryl and seeing her do it
gave me the incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior mother of the league is Campbell, whose son is the
oldest of the players' children.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was a 15-year-old sophomore at Pittsburgh's Taylor
Allerdice High School when she discovered that she was pregnant.
She played 17 games before her coach, Janet Davis, found out that
her 5-foot-8-inch shooting forward and one of the school's most
popular students was three-and-a-half-months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The child's father offered little help. Campbell's mother was
battling alcoholism and her father had difficulty coping. Were it
not for Davis and her maternal grandmother, Jane McCloud, Campbell
might have become another statistic _ one of the millions of unwed
teen-age mothers who spend a lifetime wondering what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be another statistic, a welfare mother living
in a project raising my child,'' Campbell said during a telephone
interview from her Phoenix home. ``I had standards for the life I
wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   McCloud cared for David while Campbell attended college, first
at the University of Maryland, then at the University of Texas. In
1991, soon after she earned her degree in kinesiology, McCloud
died. David was 6 and Campbell was prepared to defer her dream of
playing overseas until Davis agreed to take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave my son, but I knew I also had to
provide for him and I wanted to play basketball,'' said Campbell,
adding upon reflection that if she had to do it again, she would
take David with her. ``Those were some tough times because I was
making decisions, not for the moment but for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   She played in Brazil for two years (1993-95) and in Hungary
(1995-96), leading the team in scoring. She called David every
other day. Still, she missed the hugs, the kisses, the tucking him
into bed at night, and when the ABL started in 1996, she jumped on
it like a loose ball. She signed with the Colorado Xplosion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, mother and son have been inseparable. He is her
biggest fan. Those who know David, described him as smart, polite
and mature beyond his age. She is his role model, the player he
aspires to be like, measuring his own progress on the court by what
she accomplished at a similar age.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Campbell recently started a youth foundation in Colorado aimed
at helping teen-age parents pursue their education and future
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many constraints and restrictions about what a
woman should or shouldn't do when she becomes a parent,'' Campbell
said. ``Should she stay at home with the kid or find a job or do
both? Over the years, I've found that it's not so much what people
think you can and cannot do. It's what you decide you want to
do.'' &QL;

   For Stock Investors, A New Star System
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola got an F for value, Amazon.com flunked profitability
and Fruit of the Loom received a failing grade for financial
health.
</P>
<P>
   That was the harsh judgment of Morningstar Inc., best known for
its star system of mutual fund rankings, which has begun to rate
individual stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to ``take the frustration out of analyzing stocks by
wrapping up all the calculations and financial statistics into a
straightforward grading system,'' said Haywood Kelly, editor of
Morningstar Stock Investor. About 7,500 American companies are
evaluated, relative to their industry peers, on four criteria:
growth rate, profitability, stock price and overall financial
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings, updated each Saturday, are available free on the
company Web site, www.morningstar.com, though it takes some
burrowing. Type in a stock symbol, and then click on ``snapshot.''
</P>
<P>
   For the week ended Friday, Morningstar gave 43 companies all A's
. About 35 got three F's; most of these stocks are too young to be
rated on all four measures, though two _ Cogeneration and Robotic
Vision Systems _ did flunk across the board.
</P>
<P>
   By rating stocks on a variety of counts, the Morningstar grades
let investors plug holes in their portfolios or shop for companies
that fit their style.
</P>
<P>
   For example, though Fruit of the Loom got D's for growth and
profitability to go with its F for financial health, it may still
merit consideration because its stock is so cheap _ down from over
$30 a year ago to around $7 last week, when it had a B for
valuation from Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   The rating systems of Standard &AMP; Poor's and Value Line, by
contrast, boil their findings down to a single score _ a star or
number, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sanborn, research director at Value Line, said he did
not want to denigrate the new competition. But he noted that his
company's rankings offer much more background data on companies.

   FUNDS WATCH: Spiders and Their Close Kin
</P>
<P>
   As the bull market lures more mutual fund investors to trade
individual stocks, the giants of finance are devising more and more
investments that blend the characteristics of mutual funds,
closed-end funds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney is joining Barclays Global Investors in
making plans to widen the assortment early next year of these
so-called exchange-traded funds, which are listed on the American
Stock Exchange. Barclays is expected to offer dozens of the
products, which trade like individual stocks but, like index funds,
represent a bundle of shares; Salomon Smith Barney will offer a
single Internet fund. So far, each company has filed only a request
for certain legal exemptions, but not a registration statement.
</P>
<P>
   The filings are further evidence of the growing popularity of
exchange-traded funds. The first such investments, Standard &AMP;
Poor's depository receipts, commonly known as SPDR's (pronounced
``spiders''), have virtually doubled in trading volume each year
since their introduction in 1993. Now SPDR's and similar
investments account for almost $21 billion in assets and are core
products of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a kind of cottage industry around here,'' said
Gary Gastineau, senior vice president for new products at the
exchange. ``While we do some marketing, it has not been done in a
professional way.'' He expects Barclays and other fund sponsors to
do more. And, Gastineau added, he is expecting other investment
firms to announce plans in the next two months for as many as 50
more exchange-traded funds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the funds have proved most attractive as hedging
vehicles for managers of smaller funds. But intraday pricing, the
ability to sell short and place limit orders, and the low costs
should appeal to retail investors, said Ed McRedmond, senior
analyst at A.G. Edwards, the St. Louis-based brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The 51 prospective funds listed in the Barclays filing would
track 24 Dow Jones and 16 S&AMP;P domestic and international equity
indexes and 11 Russell domestic equity indexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect _ and no one expects _ that Barclays will do
all of those,'' Gastineau said. ``But everything they say suggests
that they will do a substantial number of them.'' Barclays declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are designed so that any deviation from the value of
the indexed stocks provides someone with an arbitrage opportunity;
the trading, in effect, forces the funds to track the index. They
have low annual fees, but investors must pay commissions on
transactions. _SARA ROBINSON

RALLY AGAINST MILOSEVIC FAILS TO CATALYZE OPPOSITION PARTIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ While opposition politicians spoke with
pleasure Friday about the size and passion of Thursday night's
rally against President Slobodan Milosevic, they continued to
disagree on how best to harness that energy effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But all seemed to agree that a period of reflection was in
order, and that they needed more time to agree on the best way to
oust Milosevic, who showed no signs of volunteering to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the largest opposition party, the
Serbian Renewal Movement, insisted that the only way forward would
be to schedule early elections in November under fair conditions
and with international observers, conditions that would have to be
negotiated with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of the Alliance for Change, in particular Zoran
Djindjic of the Democracy Party, were explicit in calling for more
street protests to force Milosevic's resignation, and were
ambiguous at best about early elections, saying the only way a fair
election could be held was if Milosevic resigned first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two sides in Serbia today _ the regime and the
people,'' Djindjic said at a news conference Friday. ``Everybody
will soon have to take a side.'' But Djindjic also seemed to pull
back from the 15-day deadline he announced at the rally Thursday
night for Milosevic to resign or face such protests.
</P>
<P>
   Vladan Batic, the coordinator of the Alliance, said, ``The
citizens of Serbia want the removal of Slobodan Milosevic, and they
do not want compromise or any deal with the government.'' Batic
said the group will wait for another rally in Belgrade on Sept. 21
before organizing street protests and a general strike.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same news conference, another member of the Alliance,
Vuk Obradovic of the Social Democracy Party, a former general,
warned that street protests could prove to be a dangerous route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only with a well-organized, even military-style action can we
remove this regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church will try next week to get
all the opposition leaders to agree on a single platform, but that
will be a difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   A key Draskovic aide said that after the rally, the divisions
between his party and the Alliance are ``worse than before.'' He
said he was surprised by the crowd's desire to force Milosevic to
leave office without elections or a transitional government, but he
said he doubted, based on polling information, that the rally was
representative of Serbia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd booed Draskovic when he urged early elections, and
some called him a traitor. Draskovic had harmed himself by first
refusing to speak at the rally, and then crashing it to speak
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djindjic says that Milosevic must go in 15 days, but after 15
days he will still be there, and Djindjic can't force him to go,''
said the Draskovic aide. ``We agree he should go. But how, no one
knows. Not him, and not us.''
</P>
<P>
   The only answer, Draskovic insists, lies in early elections,
much as Milosevic's aides have been suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   But Alliance officials, with less support among the voters, say
Milosevic is only buying time with the idea of fresh elections,
which he will manipulate through state propaganda and fraud. They
say Draskovic is simply playing Milosevic's game, seduced or
pressured by power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Draskovic is thinking,'' a key Alliance
official said. ``He must know that Milosevic is close to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Draskovic say that is not self-evident, and that
the exodus of Serbs from Kosovo under NATO rule allows Milosevic to
claim that he was right to try to fight for Kosovo, and that the
opposition is only furthering NATO's efforts to finish the war by
ousting him.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run news media called the rally a failure and a
disappointment to its organizers, claiming that only 25,000 people
attended. Other estimates had ranged from 50,000 to more than
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic was conciliatory about Draskovic's sudden decision to
speak at the rally. But he said: ``We are hoping that after this
rally all those who thought they could make a deal with Milosevic
have realized they were wrong. The people understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Nis Friday, a monument to the icon of Draskovic's party,
Draza Mihajlovic, the monarchist World War II guerrilla leader, was
destroyed. Draskovic told Reuters that the Democratic Party was
responsible for the incident, but that he would not retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no conflicts with the Democratic Party,'' he
said. ``They have made us give up on having any relations with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was Milosevic's 58th birthday, and student members of the
Otpor, or Resistance movement, staged a mock party for him in
Belgrade. They sang to him, lit candles on a huge cardboard cake
and made a wish that he resign.
</P>
<P>
   In a spoof of a government plea to ``give a dinar'' to
reconstruction efforts after the war, the students asked passers-by
on a main pedestrian shopping area to ``give a dinar for
resignation.'' They said those dinars _ not foreign funds _ would
pay for future protests.
</P>
<P>
   The cake was sliced into nine pieces, representing parts of the
former Yugoslavia lost by Milosevic in his 10 years in power.

   BAR, Yugoslavia _ The rows of slate-gray missile boats rock at
their moorings behind a chain link fence, the Yugoslav sailors
shaded from the unforgiving sun by tarps over the back decks.
Frigates patrol the emerald green waters off the coast and board
incoming freighters for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   A few thousand Yugoslav Army soldiers, in a spacious, grassy
base up the road from the port, drill in combat fatigues and do
maintenance work on Soviet-style tanks and armored personnel
carriers. The outward appearance of order, aided by the soporific
heat, belies a looming rebellion, one that could draw these units
into yet another conflict in Yugoslavia's seemingly endless cycle
of war.
</P>
<P>
   As Montenegro, the second Yugoslav republic, grows more
vociferous in its demands for independence, there are mounting
calls for military intervention from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The political leadership in Montenegro says that in recent days
the generals and admirals who command some 10,000 Yugoslav soldiers
and sailors here have become antagonistic and uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Bar, a major deep-sea commercial port, would probably be the
first piece of real estate seized by Belgrade in the event of a
clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav Navy abuses its privileges in the port,'' said
Mico Orlandic, Bar's deputy mayor. ``During the NATO air strikes
the navy fired missiles at NATO planes and blocked entry to the
port. We were powerless to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The navy ships stop freighters coming into the harbor to carry
out inspections and look for arms,'' he said. ``The army, when it
leaves its barracks, sets up unauthorized roadblocks and seizes
goods. When we try to speak to the high command, they ignore us, as
if this is not our country. If the conflict worsens, we expect
Belgrade to try to seize the port.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, a republic of 600,000 people, occupies 5 percent of
Yugoslav territory. The rest is Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Its president, Milo Djukanovic, once a protege and ally of the
Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, has moved steadily to
distance himself from Belgrade and build ties with the Western
alliance, a policy that largely spared Montenegro from NATO attacks
during the bombing. Djukanovic made his boldest bid to break away
on Aug. 5, proposing that the union between the two states be
scrapped to create a ``commonwealth of the states of Serbia and
Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, he said, would maintain its own army and foreign
ministry and issue its own currency. If the proposal, which has
been branded ``unconstitutional and undemocratic'' by Belgrade, is
rejected, as now seems certain, Montenegro will hold a referendum
this fall calling for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has compared the proposal to the one it spurned with
the Kosovar Albanians in Rambouillet, France, one of the incidents
that led to the war. The Yugoslav government has been lashing out
daily at the Montenegrin leadership in the state-controlled media,
painting it as a ``stooge of NATO'' and part of the Western effort
to topple Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, allies of Milosevic, like Montenegro's
Socialist People's Party, have asked the Yugoslav military to
``restore order.'' The party, led by the current Yugoslav prime
minister, Momir Bulatovic, lost power to Djukanovic in elections in
Montenegro last year, but is the only party representing Montenegro
in Belgrade. The Belgrade press now paints him as the legitimate
leader of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Tomislav Nikolic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, said
this week that if Montenegro goes ahead with the referendum ``the
army will have to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrija Perisic, an executive member of Montenegro's ruling
Democratic Party of Socialists, said he and other Montenegrin
officials are convinced that Belgrade is secretly preparing ``the
same scenario that was used in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montengrin republic, bereft of profitable industry, has
become a haven for smugglers who race fast boats across the
Adriatic to Italy. Djukanovic, Western diplomats say, made his
fortune running untaxed cigarettes and fruit to Italy and importing
black market gasoline. Pencil-thin cigarette boats line the docks
or cruise slowly in the harbor, their powerful engines purring.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, unlike Slovenia, Croatia or even Bosnia, would have
a tough time severing economic ties with Serbia. The port, an
extremely profitable enterprise, has been deserted since NATO
bombed the rail links with Serbia. The airy warehouses, vast
30,000-ton grain silos and docks are lifeless. Bar, which can
handle 5 million tons of goods a year, has moved less than half a
million tons this year. The tourism industry that brought in $150
million a year before the war is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be suicide to try to run the port without Serbian
imports and exports,'' said Alexsander Jovtic, one of the directors
of the port.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day two off-duty soldiers sat writing letters home.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did not relish any clash with the local
population, but would not disobey orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the army one does what one is told,'' said one of the
soldiers. ``We are being prepared for this. If we are told to take
the port, we will do it. It is our job.''

A NIGHT OUT WITH WES ANDERSON DISSECTING FILMS AND SERIAL KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on Sunday, Aug. 22) 
(jt) 
 By SUSAN M. KIRSCHBAUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly after 10 p.m. the other night, Hampton
Fancher was at Black and White, a bistro in the East Village,
nursing a minibottle of Buzet, an inexpensive Bordeaux he had
bought at the corner wine shop. The 60-year-old screenwriter, best
known for the 1982 sci-fi thriller ``Blade Runner,'' was at the
post-screening party for ``The Minus Man,'' a low-budget feature he
wrote and directed about a mild-mannered serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   By Hollywood standards, it wasn't a glamorous affair: no rope,
no paparazzi, no one dressed to kill. Fancher, in a wrinkled check
shirt, was clocking time at the bar, waiting for the arrival of his
pal the writer and director Wes Anderson, the party's host. So was
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the J.D. Salinger of film,'' Fancher said of Anderson,
30, whose first film, ``Bottle Rocket,'' propelled him to cult
status. Anderson's second film, ``Rushmore,'' a surprise-hit comedy
about an eccentric prep school student, added to his legend among
obsessed cineastes whose idea of a big night is sitting around
drinking and talking about film theory and Truffaut's use of the
iris shot.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo, who stars in ``The Minus Man'' as the killer's
girlfriend, was one of the first to arrive, dressed in navy sweat
pants and an Iams dog food T-shirt. ``What are your doing here?''
Fancher asked, surprised she was in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taping some bumpers for the MTV video awards,'' Ms.
Garofalo said, ``and I'll be doing some voice-overs for
`Felicity.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Felicity?'' he asked, unaware of the show, set in a
New York University dorm. ``A cartoon?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make it clear,'' Ms. Garofalo said. ``I'm not Daria.
It's a series, like ``My So-Called Life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those references, too were lost on Fancher, who is more
interested in Chekhov and Fellini. Just then, Anderson arrived. In
thin-rimmed glasses and a button-down shirt, he sat in a booth
beside Fancher, looking like a college preppy or a Salinger
character. A waiter was taking orders for dinner. ``I'm having the
flank steak,'' Anderson said. ``I've gotten criticism for being
skinny all of my life. I want to put on a solid 10 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the round table of cinemaspeak. ``How many good scripts
have you read in your life?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked `Rosemary's Baby,''' Anderson replied. Then he began a
discussion of Truffaut films including ``Love at 20'' (1962).
``There's something about those movies that's not cynical,''
Anderson said, ``an affection for his characters, trying things to
give emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson finished his steak, Erik Feig, a producer of the
teen-age blockbuster ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' stopped
by to pay homage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Wes that `Rushmore' was a soul movie,'' Feig recalled,
``so Wes said, `Yes, but you're making a movie that kids like.' I
felt better after that.'''
</P>
<P>
   By dessert, the table was deep in a discussion of the
photographer Jacques-Henri Lartigue, until Anderson ran out of gas.
``I've got to go speak to some people,'' he said, excusing himself.
Fancher joined him, saying, ``I'll come, too.''

BANKING SCANDAL THREATENS EFFORTS TO CHANGE INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Displaying internal divisions that could hamper
efforts to overhaul Indonesia's economy, lawmakers from President
B.J. Habibie's own political party are taking sides against him
over a widening banking scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a faction in Indonesia's ruling Golongan Karya party,
or Golkar, joined opposition politicians Friday in calling for the
resignations of both Finance Minister Bambang Subianto and Glenn
Yusuf, the chairman of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Their demands came after a closed-door meeting of a special
parliamentary committee investigating a bank loan recovery deal by
Bank Bali. Thomas Suyatno, a member of Golkar, referring to the
finance minister, told reporters: ``He has to step down. It is his
moral responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy revolves around a fee of 550 billion rupiah ($78
million) that Bank Bali paid a company controlled by Golkar's
deputy treasurer to recover loans from a bank that the
restructuring agency had taken over. Opposition politicians contend
the money went to President Habibie's campaign for election in
November.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the first day of the committee's inquiry, Bambang
and Yusuf, along with the central bank governor, Sjahril Sabirin,
testified for 12 hours. Another Golkar legislator said Friday that
the party had rejected their explanations. The committee has
threatened to summon Habibie to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that the scandal could further destabilize Indonesia
politically and undercut the agency's authority to revamp the
nation's financial system have roiled financial markets in Jakarta.
Indonesia's government set up the restructuring agency in January
1998 as part of the terms of the International Monetary Fund's
$42.3 billion bailout of the economy. Earlier this week, the IMF
demanded a full investigation by an independent auditor. The World
Bank echoed that call in a statement Friday by its country director
in Indonesia, Mark Baird.
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter needs to be resolved, not only because of the
large sums of money involved, but also because of the greater
confidence and credibility issues at stake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank agency has hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct an
independent audit of the Bank Bali transaction. The company that
received the fee, meanwhile, repaid the money to Bank Bali this
week.
</P>
<P>
   A Finance Ministry spokesman said Bambang had asked Parliament
to wait for the results of the audit, expected in two weeks, before
passing judgment. A spokesman for the bank agency said Yusuf was
not planning to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The bank restructuring agency said this week that it was on
target to surpass its 17-trillion-rupiah fund-raising goal for the
year ending next March, but analysts said its credibility had
suffered tremendously, and people close to the agency said morale
was very low.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank Bali case is expected to be one of many such
discoveries involving mysterious and possibly illegal deals as
regulators and bankers unravel decades of cronyism at Indonesian
banks and companies. Last week, talks on reorganizing $1.3 billion
in debts at the Indonesian cement maker Semen Cibinong collapsed
when the company informed creditors that $250 million was missing.
And earlier this month, the management of the family-run Bank
International Indonesia was removed after failing a central bank
ethics evaluation.

MANNING MAKING AN IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It did not take long for freshman cornerback Ricky
Manning Jr. to make an impact on the field. He is smart, swift and
aggressive. He can play man-to-man coverage, he's technically
sound, and he understands the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   But during the first week of training camp, Manning's most
impressive performance came in the film room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really mature for a freshman,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said. ``He catches on quick. He has great natural understanding.
When we test him in the meetings, he's a real sharp kid. I'm
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a Fresno native, is one of four freshmen the Bruins
expect to contribute immediately, along with tight end Mike Seidman
and two linebackers, Marcus Reese and Asi Faoa. But because of
injuries and suspensions in the secondary, Manning could be the
first rookie to break the starting lineup. Currently, he's the top
reserve cornerback, and no one is surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky didn't just emerge as a prospect the second half of his
senior year,'' Bruins defensive coordinator Bob Field said. ``He's
been a top player all along. Some guys are just wired that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's resume includes three years as Edison High's
quarterback (67 passing touchdowns) and a rigorous offseason
conditioning program that prepared him for his first college
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced with Edison's receivers. He watched UCLA's defense
on videotape, and he studied the playbook. He also played
rookie-league baseball for the Minnesota Twins, who picked him in
the 22nd round in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball wasn't that heavy a workout, so I made sure I got in
the weight room two or three times a week,'' Manning said.
``Sometimes I'd do my football drills in the pool, work on my
backpedaling and breaking with my hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I did was to get ready to play this year. I never
planned on redshirting, not even before the suspensions. I wanted
to jump right into the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell update: UCLA's most experienced cornerback, by far, is
senior Jason Bell. Despite offseason heel surgery and limited
practice time, it appears Bell will be ready for the Sept. 4 opener
against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we played right now, he could play and do OK,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   How they stand: The Bruins have moved sophomore Julius Williams
to safety and hope to survive the season with four cornerbacks:
Manning, Bell and two redshirt freshmen, Joe Hunter and Lovell
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bell and Hunter are the starters, Manning is third, and
Houston, who has a strained thigh, is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Hunter was the only one who participated in spring
practice, so he's ahead of the other young guys,'' Field said.
``He's a little smarter because of his experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Jason Stephens is starting at strong safety. Senior
Joey Strycula, who doubles as the holder on place kicks, is the
No.1 free safety.
</P>
<P>
   If the secondary seems young, it is: Five of the top seven
defensive backs are freshmen or sophomores. That will change when
senior starter Ryan Roques returns from the two-game,
disabled-parking-tag suspension. He'll play either cornerback or
free safety, wherever the Bruins are weakest.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Fullback Durell Price has changed uniform numbers.
He's now wearing No. 36, to honor former linebacker Ramogi Huma,
who retired last spring because of injuries....
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, a 400-meter hurdler for UCLA, has joined the football
team as a safety. A junior from Anaheim, Hall tried out two seasons
ago as a cornerback, then opted for track. He'll wear No. 45.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regarding summer babies of New York, there are
probably none whose eyelashes are as long and lovely as those of
James the 11th, who arrived July 8, at the Bronx Zoo. He is a
giraffe, and like all male giraffes born at the zoo is named for
James Walter Carter, a benefactor who died in 1981, at age 85.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 11 James the giraffes born at the zoo since this
practice began, shortly after the death of Carter. Female giraffes
are named for Carter's wife, Margaret, who died in 1984, and there
have been only three. The zoo does not keep all its Jameses and
Margarets, but at present, in its 7-member herd, five are so named,
which, from a zoo keeper's point of view is like being invited to
dinner at George Foreman's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them other names,'' says Kristine Theis. ``James 5th,
for instance, who is the father of James 11th, we call James Lee,
for one of the keepers. People think giraffes aren't that
intelligent, but they do know their names, and if we called them
all James, they would all come. At one time we had 11 giraffes; it
got a little confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is this guy Carter and why are all our fine New York City
giraffes being named for him?
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who also underwrote the Carter Giraffe Building _ which
opened in 1982, was a private fellow who specified in his will that
all personal files and records be destroyed. &UR;  &LR; Newspapers carried
the briefest of obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a coal miner in Virginia and he owned a farm in
Virginia, and when they sold the farm and were divvying it up, they
asked us if we'd like the tractors and some of their stuff,'' says
Linda Corcoran, the spokeswoman for the Wildlife Conservation
Society, which runs the zoo. ``They were regular folks. They had
either an apartment in the Carlyle or stayed in the Carlyle. I
remember her, she was quite elderly, this teeny, tiny little lady
they were always loading into a golf cart.''
</P>
<P>
   A coal miner living in the Carlyle?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an owner of some kind. They weren't pick and shovel
people.''
</P>
<P>
   An amplification, from Dr. William Conway, who heads the
Society, and met the pair on many occasions: ``He made a lot of his
fortune in coal mining and had sat across the table from John L.
Lewis, the famous labor leader. They were not friends.''
</P>
<P>
   One hopes that a fellow who was so generous to a public park was
not a union buster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too nice a man,'' says another zoo person and another
James, this one being James G. Doherty, a curator who holds the
Carter Chair of Mammalogy at the zoo. ``They were both wonderfully
gentle human beings. I don't think they would have stepped on an
ant.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Carter giraffes, which the zoo has been
shipping all over the country, have quite a history in Virginia.
George Lafayette Carter, the father of James Walter Carter, was a
wealthy mine, rail, and land owner. So strong was Carter's desire
for privacy that he forbade his own newspaper, The Bristol Herald
Courier, to print his name. His son, James Walter Carter, the owner
of the Carter Coal Co., was, according to information furnished by
the Virginia Historical Society and the United Mine Workers, a
``lone wolf.'' He sold the Carter Coal Co. in 1947 during a
nationwide strike involving the creation of a health and retirement
fund for the mine workers, ``because he refused to submit to union
domination.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Portraits of the young and handsome Carters _ he, on
horseback, in a riding costume; she in a feathered evening gown,
with a fan _ by the noted portrait artist Sir Oswald Birley hang at
the offices of the Virginia Historical &UR;  &LR; Society.
</P>
<P>
   Why the couple, who collected rare books and coins, and left
equal parts of their estate to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
the zoo, were interested in giraffes, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of naming the giraffes for Carters, ad infinitum, was
Conway's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the usual bronze plaque on the Carter Giraffe
House,'' Conway says, ``but a living memorial is so much nicer.
They gave us a series of magnificent gifts and remembered us very
generously.''
</P>
<P>
   How generously?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just under 20 million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There are, Conway notes, other animals at the Bronx Zoo named
after humans. A rhino is named for Mrs. Gordon B. Pattee, the vice
chairman of the society, who has given ``most generously.'' Jack
Rudin, the real estate executive, contributed an elephant, or
rather the cost of an elephant, a few years ago in honor of his
father, Sam. The zoo wanted a female and got one, but the elephant
is still called Sammy. Conway does not recall whether the tab was
$25,000 or $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Are animals ever named for people who don't have money?
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess there are a pair of gibbons at Jungle World named
for my wife and myself,'' Conway says. ``There are animals that are
named for an important employee or some trusted keeper. We do have
some fun with the mole rats. Mole rats _ I hate to say this about
any animal _ but mole rats are not pretty. Naked little pink guys
with big protruding teeth and little squinty eyes that do not work
and holes for ears. We sometimes joke with the trustees or other
donors: `You have a choice of making a gift or not making a gift
and having us name a mole rat after you.'''

A WORLD-CLASS WEEK IN SEVILLE: HOT, FAST, HOTTER, FASTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Brazil, Germany, the Ukraine, France, Trinidad and Tobago,
Cuba, Jamaica, Switzerland, N.C.)   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ There is a painting by Gonzalo Bilbao in the
Museo de Bellas Artes here that is called ``A Summer Night in
Seville.'' It depicts people sleeping in the street in an attempt
to cope with the heat for which the Andalusian capital is nearly as
famous in Spain as for its Moorish monuments, elegant bullring,
flower-filled patios and Sybaritic spring festival, La Feria.
</P>
<P>
   August, with temperatures that routinely approach and surpass 40
degrees centigrade (more than 100 Fahrenheit), is not usually a
month for moving fast in a city where beads of sweat can form in
the midst of a very short stroll or even a very long siesta. But
this August will be a glaring exception: most of the world's best
runners, jumpers and hurlers of javelins and sundry other objects
have arrived, and beginning Saturday, they will spend nine
potentially steamy nights competing for medals in the world track
and field championships.
</P>
<P>
   It is a somewhat curious marriage: this event and Seville, a
proud, provincial city whose denizens remain, in principle, much
more interested in El Juli, the extraordinary teen-age matador,
than in Hicham el-Guerrouj, the extraordinary middle-distance
runner; more interested in whether Real Betis or FC Sevilla will
win their soccer matches over the weekend than whether Maurice
Greene will win the men's 100; more interested in having a private
caseta at La Feria than a private box for this event.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the seventh edition of the world championships,
which began in 1983 and shifted from a quadrennial to biennial
affair in 1991 in Tokyo. It was hot that year in Japan, too, just
as it was hot in Athens in 1997. But Seville could raise the bar
and the mercury to new levels, although the sagacious scheduling _
there will be only a smattering of competition between 1 p.m. and 6
p.m. _ should alleviate some of the suffering. With the exception
of the women's marathon, all medal events will be held in the
evening, and though recent evenings have been pleasant, if hardly
cool, a heat wave is forecast for next week.
</P>
<P>
   At least one distance star, Ronaldo da Costa, the Brazilian who
ran the fastest marathon in history last year in Berlin, has
decided not to compete here because of the heat. He is hardly the
only prominent absentee. Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, who has won the
gold medal in the pole vault in all six previous world
championships, is still recovering from injury. Heike Drechsler,
the German long jumper who also had competed in every previous
championships, withdrew on Friday with an injury of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Jose-Perec of France, a double gold medalist in the 1996
Summer Olympics, only recently returned to minor competition after
recovering from Epstein-Barr syndrome and other ailments. She is
not yet ready for a major event like this one. Ato Boldon of
Trinidad and Tobago, the defending world champion in the men's 200
meters and perhaps the only man who could have threatened Greene's
dominance in the 100, has withdrawn with a hamstring injury.
Donovan Bailey, the reigning Olympic champion in the 100, is not
entered here because he is still finding his form after rupturing
his Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Brien, the best if hardly healthiest decathlete of the
1990s, is out, as is James Beckford, the Jamaican long jumper and
former world silver medalist, along with Beckford's star teammate
Merlene Ottey, who withdrew after traces of the banned steroid
nandrolone were found in one of her urine samples. Javier
Sotomayor, the defending world and Olympic champion in the high
jump from Cuba, tested positive for cocaine earlier this month and
then withdrew, citing a herniated disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   El-Guerrouj, the world-record holder in the 1,500 and the mile,
once announced plans not to compete here and focus instead on
winning the Olympic gold medal next year. But he was persuaded to
change his mind, and after an acute case of hemorrhoids sidelined
him in July, he returned for meets (and big appearance fees) in
London and Zurich and ran well enough to re-establish his dominance
in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Other overwhelming favorites in their events include Marion
Jones in the women's sprints, Greene in the 100, Wilson Kipketer in
the 800, Haile Gebrselassie in the 10,000 and Ivan Pedroso in the
long jump. In normal circumstances, Michael Johnson would be on
that list, too. But the three-time defending world champion in the
400 has had recurring problems with his hamstrings and withdrew
from the U.S. national championships, where he planned to run
against Greene in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Though thousands of tickets remain unsold, the crowds should be
quite respectable, despite the fact that many locals are in the
midst of their annual pilgrimage to the highlands or the beach.
They have fled to escape the heat, leaving their monuments and tapa
bars to the tourists and their fast new track to the athletes.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With the death toll from this week's
earthquake projected to soar into the tens of thousands and the
huge dislocation of people showing no sign of ending, relief
workers and government officials turned Friday to the challenge of
preventing the outbreak of disease.
</P>
<P>
   In many towns in the earthquake zone, the stench of decomposing
bodies has become thick and almost unbearable in the damp summer
heat. Medical supplies are scarce, and running water is unavailable
in most of the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of victims _ dead, injured and missing _ is
impossible to determine with precision in the chaos of a city and
country unprepared for such destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The official crisis center announced Friday night that more than
10,000 bodies had been recovered so far, and that the number of
injured had risen to 34,000. Anyone still alive among the many,
many thousands more still missing were at grave risk if they were
not found and rescued soon.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to gain control over the disorder, and under heavy
criticism both for the extent of the damage to poorly constructed
buildings and the government's disjointed response, Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit ordered that the dead be buried as soon as they are
found. He said the bodies should be photographed so that relatives
could identify them later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of
epidemic,'' Ecevit, dressed in black, said Friday. He described the
earthquake as ``one of the worst in human history and the heaviest
in Turkish history.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, relief agencies, journalists and others
were left to try to divine the overall human cost from outward
signs, like an aerial survey of Istanbul that produced a rough
estimate of the populations of the demolished areas.
</P>
<P>
   But after estimates that had spoken of many thousands injured,
the predictions Friday jumped to tens of thousands. Government
officials have asked the United Nations for 10,000 body bags. And a
U.N. official said the death toll could reach 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimated 35,000 people are under the rubble,'' the
official, Sergio Piazzi, told reporters in Geneva. ``This is from
the Turkish authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically one-third of the Turkish population lived in the
area affected by the earthquake,'' Piazzi said. ``I can only add
that in the Golcuk area alone, 10,000 people are expected to be
under the rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazzi, who heads the European desk of the U.N. Office for
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that some of those
buried could survive until Monday or Tuesday, but that he feared
that most were beyond hope. Asked if the death toll could reach
40,000, he replied, ``It is a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was among the
hardest hit, city officials issued an urgent appeal for portable
toilets as a way of lessening the risk of disease as hordes of
residents continued to camp outdoors. Relief workers there and in
other towns said they had treated cases of dysentery, diarrhea and
gastroenteritis, but that there had been no reports of cholera, a
far more serious disease that sometimes breaks out under these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important now is that the bodies be recovered from
underneath the ruins so that microbes from the corpses do not
spread,'' said Senol Ergunsay, a doctor in Golcuk.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement Friday by the World Health
Organization, though, while unsanitary conditions can spawn
disease, the bodies of the earthquake victims themselves do not
present a significant health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Muslim clerics have ruled that under the current extreme
circumstances, Islamic burial customs need not be followed. They
said that bodies could be buried in a single shroud instead of
three, that the bodies could be washed with sand if no water was
available, and that men and women could be buried together.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 2,000 foreign relief specialists who have arrived
here since Tuesday continued to take the lead in rescue operations,
and public anger toward the government remained intense. Newspapers
carried banner headlines like ``Total Fiasco'' and ``We Died
Twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the earthquake zone said they had still not seen
any Turkish relief workers. They are relying on untrained
volunteers and hoping that foreigners will show up to direct them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rescue operation has been very slow, I must admit,'' Sukru
Gurel, a Cabinet minister who is helping to coordinate the effort,
said at a news briefing. ``But in that region, we are talking about
tens of thousands of buildings wrecked. To move quickly, we need
tens of thousands of rescue teams, which no government in the world
can mobilize.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked how high he thought the death toll might reach, Gurel
replied: ``We are afraid it could be beyond our initial estimates.
The magnitude of this tragedy is beyond imagination, because such
an event only happens once every 200 or 300 years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to historians, major quakes have shaken the Istanbul
region more frequently than that. Their accounts say that in the
last 5,000 years, there has been such a quake about once every 175
years. Istanbul is now home to 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area where this recent quake was centered will not be hit
again any time soon, because the seismic pressure there has
dissipated,'' said Ahmet Cakmak, a professor of engineering at
Princeton University who is an expert on Turkish seismology. ``But
the fault that runs closer to Istanbul is still very dangerous, and
a major quake here is very likely. ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's plenty of time to prepare for that quake,
but usually the memory of devastation lasts five years at most, and
then people go back to building and living as they did before. The
newspapers are saying we survived the big earthquake, but that's
silly. It's a big mistake. What we should do is learn from this
one, expect a bigger one and be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 400-mile stretch of the earthquake zone, tens of
thousands of buildings were destroyed. Counts of the injured and
dead began to be made available by towns. In Izmit, perhaps the
hardest hit, 3,242 were dead and 8,759 injured; in Adapazari, 2,995
were dead and 5,081 injured. In the town of Yalova, 1,442 died and
4,300 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, 984 were dead and 9,541 injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the earthquake zone, more victims were rescued Friday, most
of them by foreign relief teams. Israeli soldiers working in the
village of Cinarcik, where several Israeli tourists are missing,
pulled an 11-year-old Turkish girl from the rubble after working
for 17 hours to reach her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising that she managed to survive,'' said an
Israeli doctor who worked alongside the soldiers. ``During the long
hours while we rescued her, we managed to teach her a few words in
Hebrew, and we built a lot of trust.''

ARMSTRONG ISN'T KING   OF EVERY   MOUNTAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT SNOW, Vt. _ At times Friday, Lance Armstrong hardly looked
like the 27-year-old Texan who less than a month ago won the Tour
de France. He huffed and puffed and ached and cramped. Every lap,
he had to get off his bike and carry it for a hundred yards.
</P>
<P>
   He was still the brash storybook hero who had returned from
testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain.
As an adoring public discovered, he was also mortal.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first important American competition since France,
and illogically it was a mountain-bike race, the sixth and final
race of the Chevy Trucks series to crown the national cross-country
champion. Over the years, Armstrong had ridden in a handful of
races on these sturdy bikes with knobby tires. But this, he said,
was nothing like racing on a road bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real hard sport,'' he said. ``Nothing in the Tour de
France compares to this. It was much harder than I expected. It's
only a two-hour race, but it was the hardest two hours of my life.
I have a lot of respect for these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rode aggressively for as long as he could. Of the 88
riders who started and the 64 who finished, he placed sixth, 3
minutes 27 seconds behind Travis Brown, who won the series
championship. As Brown said of his Trek-Volkswagen teammate, ``I
think for the amount of experience Lance has on a mountain bike,
his race was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend competition at the base of Mount Snow in southern
Vermont attracted 10,000 spectators. The men's pro race consisted
of six laps of a 3.8-mile course over trails and pebbled roads, and
thousands watched from the hills and kept chanting Armstrong's
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one section,'' Armstrong said, ``I kept getting off the
bike and carrying it. I don't think anyone rode the whole course
uphill. It was mossy and rooty and rocky and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard course because it was undulating the entire
time. There were probably 10 separate little climbs on every lap.
My back was tight and tired. My legs were cramping up. That never
happens in road racing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first third of the race, Armstrong was riding in the
front five, and at one point he led. But his diminished training in
recent weeks took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two laps,'' he said, ``I told myself: `This is going to
be tough. We're 33 percent done and I'm hurting already.' The first
half of the race was sort of fun. The second half wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is he riding two races in two days here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a competition,'' he said beforehand, ``and I'm a
competitor. It is also something I find enjoyable. Whether it is a
road bike or mountain bike or tandem bike, I enjoy riding a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   And people enjoy watching him ride bikes. Especially that
overweight, middle-age man lugging a video camera who ran alongside
a struggling Armstrong on one of those frightening climbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing,'' the man shouted. ``Remember Sestriere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sestriere is an Italian ski resort in the Alps where Armstrong
blew away the competition in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   As the man yelled encouragement, Armstrong winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no clue,'' Armstrong said. ``This is 10 times tougher
than Sestriere.''

SUPPORT SLIPPING FOR FLAT VEHICLE-LICENSE FEE, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELA GALLOWAY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ A ballot measure to cut vehicle license taxes
to $30 still enjoys wide support among voters, but that support is
eroding, a new poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Initiative 695 would impose a flat $30 license tax for all
vehicles, regardless of worth, and would require voter approval for
all new government fees or taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Elway Research, an independent pollster, reported this week that
59 percent of voters polled supported the initiative; 32 percent
opposed it; and 9 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, with a margin of error of 5 percentage points,
surveyed 400 voters throughout Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The results buoyed the initiative's supporters. ``The Elway poll
simply confirms people's own common sense and conviction that I-695
will pass overwhelmingly this November,'' said sponsor Tim Eyman.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Funk, spokesman for the No-on-695 campaign, said the
results show that support for the measure is dropping.
</P>
<P>
   A June poll found that 73 percent supported the initiative, with
22 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Eyman) is not cresting 60 (percent) on this one, he could
have some tough times coming up,'' Funk said. ``Clearly,
something's happening out there. The numbers are coming down and we
think it's going to be a steady trend downward.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings came on the heels of the Secretary of State's
Office releasing its voter guide on the measure a few days ago on
the Internet. Eyman interpreted that guide as a breakthrough for
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased that the statement against the initiative
contained only two endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Eyman's voters guide statement for the initiative had eight
other endorsements _ from campaign volunteers including retirees, a
plumber and a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Funk said the two men endorsing the opposition statement
represent thousands of Washington entrepreneurs and workers. They
are Don Brunell of the Association of Washington Business and Rick
Bender of the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   While Eyman has pitched his campaign as a battle between
Everyman and the ``special interests that own Olympia,'' few
politicians have spoken out against the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But Eyman's group should not underestimate the grass-roots
opposition on the horizon, Funk said. It's a movement expected to
spend $2 million to $4 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those opponents will bring home to voters how the measure's
elimination of an estimated $1 billion in revenue over the next two
years will hurt police and fire services, health programs, mass
transit and highway construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see in the next few weeks that there are going to be
hundreds and thousands of people in Washington state that are going
to come out against this proposal,'' Funk said. ``We will have
plenty of people in the trenches when this thing gets up and
running, trust me.''

MOST SUMMER SCHOOL STUDENTS PASS A TEST FOR PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 60 percent of the students from the third,
sixth and eighth grades who took the standardized tests at the end
of mandatory summer school in New York City this year passed and
will be allowed to move on to the next grade, according to
preliminary results released Friday, pleasing Board of Education
officials but suggesting that thousands of children will be held
back.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials said it would be a couple of weeks before they
could say definitively how many students would be promoted to the
next grade, though local administrators could begin notifying
students next week.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and his aides said that except for
extraordinary mitigating circumstances students who failed the test
or tests they were required to take would not advance to the next
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that absolute,'' Crew said Friday in an interview. ``I am
not letting kids go forward if they did not pass the tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said he was heartened by the results, which he said
demonstrated that the small class sizes _ none were to exceed 10
students _ and intensive focus on reading and math could yield good
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of instructional format works,'' he said. ``I was
pretty pleased about all of it.'' He added that he found the
results encouraging because ``the range in actual percent that
passed was pretty much within what we thought was feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   There was wide variation in test results, with performance
generally reflecting patterns observed on other standardized exams.
Poorer districts still did worse overall than more affluent ones.
</P>
<P>
   The data released Friday is not the final word on the program,
which was the largest use of mandatory summer school in New York
City in a decade. In past years, students were routinely promoted
to the next grade regardless of their academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials said 37,050 students were in the mandated
program, but they did not release a figure for how many of them did
not take the tests or how many of the students took both tests,
which were given Aug. 3 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Tobias, the board's director of assessment, said that at
least 70 percent of the students took at least one test but that
officials were still reviewing the results and score sheets for
discrepancies and could not yet release a firm number.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the percentages of who passed and failed are likely
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all pretty raw,'' said Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for
the board, which nevertheless released the early findings because
of the strong public interest in summer school.
</P>
<P>
   The board reported the results of 20,000 students who took
reading tests in grades 3, 6 and 8; 19,000 who took math tests in
those grades, and, as part of a smaller program, 2,145 bilingual
students who took a written portion of the English proficiency
exams, the Language Assessment Battery.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20,000 students who took reading tests, 63.8 percent
passed, the board said. Of those who took math exams, 61.2 percent
passed. And among students who took the Language Assessment
Battery, 72.2 percent passed.
</P>
<P>
   There were wide variations among the grades and among community
school districts. In third-grade reading, for example, a barometer
for the overall academic health of the system and an area Crew has
vowed to greatly improve, 57.9 passed the test citywide. But among
eighth graders, the passing rate on the reading exam was 74.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Rizzo, the deputy chancellor of instruction, said
officials would review the results and make changes for next year,
when Crew has proposed expanding the program to grades 3 through
12.

PAPADAKIS OUT INDEFINITELY WITH BROKEN FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC had its first significant injury of
training camp Friday when senior tailback Petros Papadakis broke
his right foot in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis, who averaged 3.9 yards per carry last season, broke
his foot while being tackled by defensive end Kori Dickerson during
a full-contact play and will be sidelined indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just broke it clean and a guy tackled him from behind. It
wasn't anything unusual,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``How
extensive is it? We don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis was USC's short-yardage specialist last season,
scoring eight touchdowns and rushing for 468 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Petros, he will be back as soon as humanly possible.
That's a blow,'' Hackett said. ``He's really the power guy. That's
going to be one of the real challenges the rest of camp, to see who
takes that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Papadakis, several players will now try to replace him
as the No.2 tailback behind Chad Morton.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are redshirt freshman Sultan McCullough,
sophomore Frank Strong, senior Jabari Jackson and sophomore
Malaefou MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie is practicing only once a day, as Hackett tries to
bring him back slowly from last year's knee surgery and a sore
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be wide open,'' Hackett said. ``We've got to give that
a lot of thought now.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere: It's early, but true freshman
linebacker/defensive end Omar Nazel, who received little publicity
coming out of high school, might not redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked his way into an opportunity in our nickel
defense,'' Hackett said. ``If he continues to progress, he'll get
some playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazel is among those who are surprised that Hackett is already
offering praise this early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say being a freshman, I'm surprised,'' Nazel said. ``A
lot of people are skeptical. I don't pose any threat to anybody.
I'm not the biggest thing out there. I don't scare anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazel is 6-foot-5 but weighs just 220 pounds. His athleticism
has impressed coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Steele practices: Linebacker Markus Steele finally practiced,
although he was allowed to wear only shorts. He has missed nearly a
week while waiting for his junior-college transcripts to be
processed and sent to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Steele hasn't practiced or worn pads since Dec.13 of last year,
when he played for Long Beach City College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very possible for me to go out there and try to start
(the season opener against Hawaii),'' Steele said. ``I feel very
confident at weakside linebacker. I feel like I'm two weeks behind
everybody. It'll probably be another week before I'm in game
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Steele will practice at least two more days in
shorts before wearing pads.
</P>
<P>
   Steele will wear No. 55, which was worn by Chris Claiborne and
is traditionally worn by USC's best linebacker. Middle linebacker
Zeke Moreno declined the number to wear his high school No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Craig Mitchell, another JC transfer, visited USC
on Friday but has not received his transcripts and is not expected
before midweek.
</P>
<P>

practicing behind Windrell Hayes at wide receiver while Marcell
Allmond is behindh &Cx1f; FyD

DONALD L. MASON, WHO LED FBI UNIT TRACKING STOLEN ART, DIES AT 74  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Pa., Ill. Switzerland)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Louis Mason, an FBI agent whose fascination with art
inspired him to create a loosely organized unit within the bureau's
major theft squad in New York that became the scourge of art
thieves in the 1970s, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Haworth, N.J.
He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mason had no formal training in art, he was an
enthusiastic museumgoer and, his wife said, ``was fascinated by all
forms of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his work was undercover, said Margot Dennedy, an agent
who was drawn into the art-theft unit by Mason and who is now a
vice president of Sotheby's, the auction house. ``I can remember a
time when I went to Connecticut with him. We were posing as
prospective clients to buy a stolen Arshile Gorky painting. The guy
went to jail. Mason knew what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Mason's achievements was recovering a Fantin-Latour
painting stolen from John F. Kennedy International Airport. ``You
seem OK, but you could be an FBI agent,'' said one of the thieves
in trying to sell the work to Mason, who had posed as an art
appraiser.
</P>
<P>
   On another case, again posing as an art appraiser, he went to a
hotel room to inspect a stolen painting. Outside fellow agents
waited for the opening of the draperies in the hotel room windows:
the signal for them to rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the painting, Mason complained to the thieves that he
needed more light. Obligingly, one of them threw open the drapes,
bringing on the federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely publicized case in 1976 the film director Otto
Preminger reported to the New York City police that a Kandinsky
painting, ``Leise Deutung'' (``Soft Interpretations''), had been
stolen from his New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Mason became involved in the case and traced the painting from
New York to Philadelphia, back to New York and finally to Basel,
Switzerland, where it was seized and returned to a jubilant
Preminger. An advertising salesman was charged in connection with
the theft.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, then 51, was jubilant, too. ``Today is my last day before
I retire,'' he said, winding up a 25-year career in the FBI. ``And
I can't think of a more satisfying way to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason then became a private consultant on art security. His
clients included the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Newberry
Library in Chicago and the Art Institute of Chicago. He was also a
consultant for the Central Archive for Stolen Art, established by
the International Foundation for Art Research, a scholarly
organization focused on authentication and attribution.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was born in Bristol, Conn. He earned a bachelor's degree
in physical education from Arnold College in Hartford in 1950 and a
master's in education from New York University. In World War II he
was a radio operator in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``The Fine Art of Art Security'' (Van Nostrand
Reinhold, 1979) and contributed a chapter, ``Purloining the World's
Art,'' to Joseph Grau's ``Civil and Criminal Investigation
Handbook'' (McGraw-Hill, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Donna
Albert of Bergenfield, N.J., and Sherill Garvey of St. Petersburg
Beach, Fla.

WOMAN HAS WATCHED THE WORLD CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN HER 107 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDI HUNT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olufina Gjertina Duesund Andvik is frail, her skin is cellophane
thin and she is cold most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But 107 years have not dimmed many memories of her long tenure
on Earth or blunted her mental sharpness. She has strong opinions
and doesn't hesitate to voice them.
</P>
<P>
   Andvik has watched the world change dramatically since her birth
Sept. 8, 1891, in Masfjord, Norway, a town about 60 miles north of
Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like many of the changes, especially in the United
States where she has lived since 1924. ``So much has changed for
the worse,'' she flatly declares, her bright blue eyes flashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the worst that's happened is there's nothing that's
wrong anymore. There is no morality, no rules. Nothing is right or
wrong these days.''
</P>
<P>
   She blames greed and materialism, people grabbing for everything
without concern for other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have too many things. They think these make them happy,
but they don't,'' she said. ``Happiness comes from living a good
life, caring about their family and neighbors and most of all,
being kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Andvik grew up on a modest Norwegian farm that was big enough
for a few cows, sheep and goats.
</P>
<P>
   She went to school in the winter, rowing across the fjord to
classes held in private homes. In the summers she and the other
village girls took the livestock into the mountains where they
lived in primitive cabins, tending the animals, making goat cheese
and churning butter.
</P>
<P>
   She married her husband in 1922, when she was 31 years old. ``He
was a nice man,'' she said. ``The marriage wasn't always smooth and
sometimes I cried when my feelings were hurt, but we never talked
about divorce once.''
</P>
<P>
   Farming proved too difficult in Norway, so the couple came to
Seattle in 1924. By that time the family included their first son
Bjarne, who was followed over the next few years by Martin and
Orville.
</P>
<P>
   They bought a home in Seattle's Phinney Ridge neighborhood where
Andvik took loving care of her family, attended church, knitted and
crocheted. The family later moved to a former summer cabin above
Lake Sammamish. Her husband died in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Andvik loves reading, although she now is blind in one eye, said
her son, Bjarne Andvik, 76, of Camano Island, Wash. ``She reads
everything she can get her hands on, especially if it's world
affairs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She enjoyed her independence for more than three decades, but
finally decided to move into Crista House, a home run by an
independent Protestant religious institution, when she was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Her health remains good, although an old hip and back injury
bother her sometimes. ``It makes my foot hurt,'' she grumbles to
her son, Orville, during a visit.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the first airplane flight by the Wright brothers
and marvels at how far air travel has gone. ``I wonder sometimes
how God keeps those big machines in the sky and I think it must be
a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   While family and friends are looking forward to Andvik reaching
her third century, she is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I don't live until then. I never expected to live this
long and, to tell the truth, I'm getting tired. I'm looking forward
to the time when God takes me home, but it's his decision so I just
have to wait.''

MUSIC INDUSTRY HITS FLAT NOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The nation's music industry hit a flat note in
the first half of the year with shipments sliding 0.3 percent to
501 million units while sales edged up 1.8 percent to $5.95
billion, a trade group reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The no-growth trend, disclosed by the Recording Industry
Association of America, stemmed from consolidation among retailers,
an exceptionally high return rate of 8 percent and plunging sales
in a pair of old-line categories _ cassettes and music videos.
</P>
<P>
   But RIAA officials said they are not worried about the tepid
performance and pointed to the 6.9 percent jump in compact disc
shipments along with a 6 percent rise in sales to $5.17 billion _
85 percent of all revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the core of the business, which is now CDs,
we're at a very healthy growth rate,'' said Tim Sites, the trade
group's senior vice president of marketing. ``That's the news here.
We're seeing a very efficient distribution pipeline at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, RIAA president and chief executive officer, noted
in a statement that significant numbers of fourth-quarter seasonal
releases drove the higher-than-usual rate of returns during the
first half of the year. ``The industry is also feeling the ripple
effect of consolidations amongst the largest retailers and,
subsequently, more conservative buying on the part of these
retailers as they assess their inventory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the survey did not break out performance by genre,
Sites noted that three areas continued to generate strong
first-half results _ Christian-gospel, rap and ``boy bands'' such
as 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Cassette shipments dropped 17.9 percent to 56.3 million units,
and sales dropped 21.8 percent to $616.4 million. The separate
category of cassette singles nearly vanished, with shipments
falling 47.9 percent to 8.8 million units and sales down 51.9
percent to $30.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   CD singles dropped 12.9 percent to 29.8 million units and fell
6.7 percent in sales to $120.4 million. ``Record companies continue
to assess how to strategically utilize the configuration,'' the
RIAA noted.
</P>
<P>
   Music videos also posted impressive declines, falling 35.1
percent to 4.8 million units and 26.1 percent in sales to $96.3
million. However, DVD music videos began picking up strength as
shipments rose 520 percent to 800,000 units, and sales jumped 623
percent to $23.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a thirst in the marketplace for new
technology,'' Sites said of the explosive gains in the 17-month-old
DVD format.
</P>
<P>
   DVD sales approached those of the once-dominant vinyl format.
Vinyl album shipments fell 7.9 percent to 1.4 million, and sales
declined 12.6 percent to $14 million; vinyl singles fell 6.6
percent to 2.8 million as sales rose 3.8 percent to $14.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not track sales of music downloaded from online
sites. A previous RIAA telephone survey showed 9 percent of all
music purchasers had bought music from the Internet this year, and
that 18 percent plan to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Sites said second-half sales, when the industry usually racks up
60 percent of its annual revenues, appear to be on track to top
last year's performance. He cited high expectations for albums from
Toni Braxton, Puff Daddy, 'N Synch and Sting.

FOR RELIGIOUS LEADERS, CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM IS A MATTER OF
FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PETER STEINFELS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is campaign finance reform a religious issue? Obviously, some
religious leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Council of Churches' longstanding commitment to
campaign finance reform grows directly from profound religious
faith,'' the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the council's general
secretary, said in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell cited the belief that ``every human being is a
person of dignity and worth as a child of God'' and that ``in our
democracy a signal of that dignity and worth is a fair and just
electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   She was speaking at a news conference called by Religious
Leaders for Campaign Finance Reform, a group of leaders from more
than 20 Christian denominations or churches as well as Reform
Judaism and the Unitarian Universalist Association.
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, Rabbi David Saperstein, director of the
Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, declared that ``campaign
finance reform is not an esoteric technical issue of election
regulations, but one that goes to the essence of the ethical and
moral life of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still pressing its cause, in a letter sent to House members in
May, the group stated, ``Campaign finance reform is a moral matter
for the religious community. The temptation to use money to buy
unjust favors is an ancient one that is dealt with often in
Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, what these religious leaders say is undeniable,
and, as vast sums are being amassed for next year's elections, even
more timely now than when they organized in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that if campaign finance is a moral, and
therefore a religious, issue, the same can be said of much, perhaps
most, of what politics is about. If organized religion has a
distinctive contribution to the public debate, the question becomes
not whether religious bodies should care about campaign finance
reform but how. How should they mobilize religious categories and
rhetoric? What ought to be their tone and who their primary
audience?
</P>
<P>
   There are several models, not necessarily mutually exclusive.
The Religious Leaders for Campaign Finance Reform present the
standard lobbying model. Their statements appeal to familiar moral
arguments: government's responsibility to the common good rather
than special interests, the equality of citizens and the need to
protect the weak from the powerful, the danger of public cynicism
and the erosion of trust in public authorities, honesty and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The language is similar to what many politicians might use,
although the group does provide a list of pertinent Scriptural
references. Many are condemnations of bribery in the Hebrew
Scriptures and of partiality for the rich over the poor in the New
Testament.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition specifically endorses the Shays-Meehan bill in the
House and the McCain-Feingold bill in the Senate as first steps and
the Kerry-Wellstone proposal for public financing of campaigns as a
more comprehensive solution.
</P>
<P>
   A draft statement on campaign finance reform being circulated
for comment by the state conference of Roman Catholic bishops in
Wisconsin offers another model. At about 3,000 words, it is much
more discursive and philosophical in tone than the religious
leaders' punchier assertions, although it makes similar points. It
begins, for instance, with ``a central tenet of Catholic social
teaching,'' the view passed from Aristotle through Aquinas, that
``the human person is a social being.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Wisconsin bishops' draft moves to ``the right
and responsibility to be involved citizens,'' the common good, the
need for virtue in public life and the distorting effect of current
campaign financing. There are no references to Scripture but
several to church documents.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops also offer some disclaimers. First, they note that
``like most citizens, we lack expertise in the art of campaigning
for office.'' Second, they warn that no reforms can substitute for
citizens' willingness to devote time and effort to political
activity. Third, they indicate that ``we do not intend to endorse
any specific reform proposal'' but instead propose criteria for
evaluating various proposals.
</P>
<P>
   While leaving the specifics of reform ``to lay citizens and
their elected representatives,'' the draft takes up two questions
of special moral or religious concern. Would public financing of
campaigns make taxpayers morally complicitous in advancing opinions
or practices they find morally repugnant? Would limiting campaign
expenditures restrict free speech, ``including educational efforts
by religious groups''?
</P>
<P>
   Both questions may reflect the concerns of anti-abortion groups,
who have sometimes worried along with some civil libertarians about
the impact of restrictions on private political expenditures. It is
interesting that the bishops' conclusion is ``no'' on both counts,
but perhaps not as interesting as their diligence in airing the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a third model emerges from the efforts of the Religious
Action Center of Reform Judaism. On the one hand, the center is a
major partner in the Religious Leaders for Campaign Finance Reform.
On the other hand, like the Wisconsin bishops, it addresses the
issue within its own community in the terms specific to that
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the center alerts Jewish congregants not only to
Biblical passages but also to passages in the Talmud where the
rabbis warned that gifts blind the eyes of the wise as well as the
foolish and pervert the words of the righteous as well as the
wicked. The center addresses concerns that the Jewish community's
security and political role depend on campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Leaders for Campaign Finance Reform are obviously
not afraid of appearing in tone and approach like other lobbying
groups. As a coalition, their approach cannot tap deeply into any
one religious tradition. Instead, it looks outward to the citizenry
at large and the nation's legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's Roman Catholic bishops just as obviously assume that
their effectiveness depends on much more restraint. Their approach
strongly reflects a Catholic style of reasoning about public
issues. It looks inward more than outward, more concerned with
educating Catholics than lobbying legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Action Center seems to look both inward and
outward, drawing on familiar moral and political arguments but also
reflecting specific Jewish sources and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from all three groups, by the way, certainly agree on
one point: It's an uphill battle.

MUSIC INDUSTRY HITS FLAT NOTE
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES -- The nation's music industry hit a flat note in
the first half of the year with shipments sliding 0.3 percent to
501 million units while sales edged up 1.8 percent to $5.95
billion, a trade group reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The no-growth trend, disclosed by the Recording Industry
Association of America, stemmed from consolidation among retailers,
an exceptionally high return rate of 8 percent and plunging sales
in a pair of old-line categories _ cassettes and music videos.
</P>
<P>
   But RIAA officials said they are not worried about the tepid
performance and pointed to the 6.9 percent jump in compact disc
shipments along with a 6 percent rise in sales to $5.17 billion _
85 percent of all revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the core of the business, which is now CDs,
we're at a very healthy growth rate,'' said Tim Sites, the trade
group's senior vice president of marketing. ``That's the news here.
We're seeing a very efficient distribution pipeline at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, RIAA president and chief executive officer, noted
in a statement that significant numbers of fourth-quarter seasonal
releases drove the higher-than-usual rate of returns during the
first half of the year. ``The industry is also feeling the ripple
effect of consolidations amongst the largest retailers and,
subsequently, more conservative buying on the part of these
retailers as they assess their inventory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the survey did not break out performance by genre,
Sites noted that three areas continued to generate strong
first-half results _ Christian-gospel, rap and ``boy bands'' such
as 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Cassette shipments dropped 17.9 percent to 56.3 million units,
and sales dropped 21.8 percent to $616.4 million. The separate
category of cassette singles nearly vanished, with shipments
falling 47.9 percent to 8.8 million units and sales down 51.9
percent to $30.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   CD singles dropped 12.9 percent to 29.8 million units and fell
6.7 percent in sales to $120.4 million. ``Record companies continue
to assess how to strategically utilize the configuration,'' the
RIAA noted.
</P>
<P>
   Music videos also posted impressive declines, falling 35.1
percent to 4.8 million units and 26.1 percent in sales to $96.3
million. However, DVD music videos began picking up strength as
shipments rose 520 percent to 800,000 units, and sales jumped 623
percent to $23.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a thirst in the marketplace for new
technology,'' Sites said of the explosive gains in the 17-month-old
DVD format.
</P>
<P>
   DVD sales approached those of the once-dominant vinyl format.
Vinyl album shipments fell 7.9 percent to 1.4 million, and sales
declined 12.6 percent to $14 million; vinyl singles fell 6.6
percent to 2.8 million as sales rose 3.8 percent to $14.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not track sales of music downloaded from online
sites. A previous RIAA telephone survey showed 9 percent of all
music purchasers had bought music from the Internet this year, and
that 18 percent plan to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Sites said second-half sales, when the industry usually racks up
60 percent of its annual revenues, appear to be on track to top
last year's performance. He cited high expectations for albums from
Toni Braxton, Puff Daddy, 'N Synch and Sting.

FBI SEEKS MONEY-LAUNDERING EVIDENCE AT BANK OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete rewrite with new lede and new reporting. Note
different byline and hed.)  (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Agents from the FBI searched the Wall Street
headquarters of the Bank of New York Friday, removing more than two
boxes of documents from the office of a top officer of the bank who
is at the center of an investigation of what is believed to be a
major money-laundering operation involving Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   An individual close to the bank said that on Friday afternoon,
the authorities searched the office of Natasha Gurfinkel
Kagalovsky, a senior vice president of the bank, who supervised its
Eastern European division. The agents sealed Ms. Kagalovsky's
office before they left.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time federal agents had entered the bank's
headquarters, said the individual with knowledge of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky was one of two bank employees suspended from the
bank on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The other employee was Lucy Edwards, a vice president in London.
Both women are married to Russian businessmen, one of whom is
believed by investigators to have controlled some of the accounts
that are the subject of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The action was the third such raid this week. In London, the
National Crime Squad searched the home and office of Ms. Edwards on
Wednesday and Thursday. Ms. Edwards' husband, Peter Berlin, had
authority over some of the accounts at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The individual close to the bank in New York confirmed the
search of the London offices. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe that Ms. Kagalovsky and Ms.
Edwards could be involved in one of the largest money-laundering
operations ever conducted in the United States, with $4.2 billion
passing through one account alone from October through March. But
because some accounts have remained open to help a continuing
investigation, the authorities estimate that as much as $10 billion
may have flowed through the bank since early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Edwards nor Berlin has been accused of any
wrongdoing, and neither has been detained or arrested, said a
spokeswoman for the National Crime Squad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said it was the British authorities who
alerted the FBI to what they suspected was a money-laundering
operation at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman for the National Crime Squad refused to explain
what investigators had been looking for during the search of Ms.
Edwards' apartment, near Marylebone, an affluent London
neighborhood, on Wednesday night. The search lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, 41, may have left Britain with her husband, friends
of the couple said.

NEW CABLE CHANNEL TO PRESENT CBS'S TOP-RATED SOAP OPERA
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ CBS agreed Friday to extend its contract to broadcast
television's highest-rated soap opera, ``The Young and the
Restless,'' in a deal that will enable Columbia Tristar Television,
the studio that produces it, to use the program as a centerpiece in
its plans to begin a cable channel devoted to soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give CBS an equity stake in the channel, to be
called Soap City. The network will share that financial stake with
its affiliated stations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS entered into a new long-term agreement with Columbia, whose
parent is Sony Corp., guaranteeing that ``The Young and the
Restless'' will be broadcast on CBS through 2004 and at the same
time allowing the studio to use episodes of the show on Soap City.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia plans to present the episodes in prime time on the same
day they are shown on CBS. The ``day and date'' repeat is central
to Columbia's plans to establish Soap City as a viable channel,
which it will distribute not only on cable, but also on satellite
and future digital channels.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is competing with ABC, which has announced plans for a
soap channel of its own. ABC's channel will feature same-day
repeats of four soap operas it owns, including ``General
Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding ``The Young and the Restless'' means that Soap City will
be able to fill its prime-time hours with at least two of the
highest-rated soaps on television, the other being NBC's ``Days of
Our Lives,'' which Columbia also owns.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., went through difficult
negotiations with its affiliated stations earlier this year over
its plans to reuse episodes of ``General Hospital'' and its other
soaps. Network executives said they needed to find ways to generate
additional revenue from soap operas, which are expensive to
produce. Executives from the affiliated stations complained that
the same-day repeats on a cable channel could reduce audiences for
the daytime telecasts and could pull viewers away from ABC's
competing prime-time programs.
</P>
<P>
   ABC later reached an agreement with the affiliates that
guaranteed them certain exclusive rights to ABC shows, but the
network retained the right to repeat episodes of its soap operas on
the cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbia announced its own plans for a soap opera channel
in May, CBS executives, citing deference to the network's
affiliates, said CBS would not relinquish its exclusivity. But CBS
was faced with the need to maintain rights to ``The Young and the
Restless,'' which has led the network to dominance in daytime
ratings for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of winning a long-term renewal for the show,
coupled with Columbia's offer of equity in the new channel,
persuaded CBS to make the deal, a senior CBS executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The network won a measure of support from its affiliates with
its offer to share in the financial stake in the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Karpowicz, the chairman of the CBS affiliates board, said
Friday in a statement: ``Obviously it's difficult for CBS
affiliates to agree to any loss of exclusivity in our local
markets. However, the affiliates and group owners that we talked to
agreed that it was important to keep `The Young the the Restless'
on our network and we certainly appreciate having a stake in
Columbia Tristar's new channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither ABC nor Columbia has said how widely it expects its new
soap channel to be distributed. Both channels are scheduled to go
on the air in January.
