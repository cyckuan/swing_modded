<HEADLINE> WFP Calls for Emergency Aid to S. Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
Friday calls for urgently funding needed airdrops of food aid to
victims of war and drought in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The airdrops will be part of a 65.8 million U.S. Dollars
operation starting the day to deliver 83,000 tons of food to 2.48
million Sudanese facing famine over the next 12 months, said the
WFP in a news release Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is extremely serious in southern Sudan where
the combined effects of insecurity, drought and floods have
caused widespread crop failure," said the Rome-headquartered
body.
</P>
<P>
"Up to 200,000 people in northern Sudan also need aid because
of chronic shortages due to drought," it continued.
</P>
<P>
Food deficits of 30 to 60 percent are expected in Bahr el
Ghazal and Eastern Equatorial in the south, South Kordofan and
North Darfur in the north and displaced persons camps around Wau
in the south and the capital Khartoum, said the WFP.
</P>
<P>
The long civil war and repeated restrictions of access and
aircraft clearances in the past few months by authorities have
hampered attempts to reach the hungry, said WFP.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum, which banned flights to four locations in Bahr el
Ghazal, has now allowed airdrops in any area within the province
and given WFP permission to use a second C-130 aircraft. Roads
are impassable due to the recent El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The move came ahead of the May 2 peace talks with southern
rebels in Nairobi, the second one since 1994.
</P>
<P>
WFP, the food aid arm of the United Nations, has provided
362,237 tons of relief food to an estimated 4.7 million victims
of war and drought in Sudan since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese civil war between the Moslem-ruled government and
rebels in the animist and Christian-dominated south dragged on
into the 14th year in 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records March Trade in Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected surge in imports
pushed South Africa's trade account into the red in March,
dashing hopes of a consecutive monthly surplus, The Star paper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A deficit of 361 million Rand (72 million U.S. Dollars) was
recorded in March from a surplus of 511 million Rand (101 million
U.S Dollars) in February, the South African Revenue Service was
quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected dip into the red confused economists, who were
expecting a surplus of between 500 million Rand (99 million
Dollars) and 800 million Rand (159 million Dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
The service said imports jumped 8.5 percent from 10.6 billion
Rand (2.1 billion Dollars) in February to 11.4 billion (2.26
billion Dollars) in March, owing to a 35 percent rise in
machinery imports. Exports remained almost unchanged at 11.1
billion Rand (2.2 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists were expecting imports to slow because of the
sluggish economy. They said the March import figure was "odd"
given the traditional volatility of trade data.
</P>
<P>
Others said the rise in imports could have been prompted by
anticipation of lower interest rates and a weaker Rand.
</P>
<P>
The latest trade data ignited fears that the first-quarter
deficit on the current account might be bigger than the 3.1
billion Rand (615 million Dollars) deficit in the fourth quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists warned that the negative impact of the recent
turmoil in east Asia and Zimbabwe, both important export markets
for South African goods, was still to be reflected in export data
in coming months.

<HEADLINE> Live Water Fowls From Mainland Arrive in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 live ducks and
geese from the Chinese mainland were imported to Hong Kong Friday
morning under new stringent import control measures.
</P>
<P>
These water fowls arrived at two Western Wholesale Food Market
stalls which have been ready to serve as central slaughter and
wholesale outlets for water fowls.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department, this was the first batch of live water fowls imported
under the new control systems and the policy to segregate chickens
from ducks and geese.
</P>
<P>
"The policy aims to minimize the risk of transmission of avian
influenza H5N1 from water fowls to live chickens and subsequently
to humans," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Those water fowls for export to Hong Kong are segregated from
other birds in mainland farms five days prior to export and tested
negative for the H5 virus, with health certificates signed by a
competent mainland veterinary authority, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The bird flu scare which broke out late last year prompted the
government to slaughter some 1.5 million chickens in Hong Kong in
December and to ban poultry imports from China's mainland in a
bid to curb the spread of the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
Chicken imports were allowed to resume on February 7 after
strict new hygiene measures were implemented.

<HEADLINE> HK Considers Tougher Measures Against Copyright Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will consider clamping
down on copyright piracy with tougher measures in an effort to
uphold its international reputation and the interests of its
people, a senior government official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Secretary for Trade and
Industry Chau Tak-hay listed a series of new measures which would
be studied and considered by his bureau to combat copyright
piracy.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures are confiscation of the assets of those
convicted of copyright piracy, imposition of closure orders on
premises including shops and factories which have been engaged in
piracy-related business so that they could not be sold or leased
out for a period of time and introduction of some form of legal
liability against end-users who purchased pirated optical discs.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is investigating the feasibility of these measures
and no conclusion has been reached yet, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
It is of paramount importance to educate consumers that buying
pirated optical discs is tantamount to buying stolen goods, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chau noted that the judiciary has been handing down heavier
sentences for convicted copyright offenders and he welcomed this
development.
</P>
<P>
In view of the imminent announcement of the U.S. Special 301
Report, Chau said, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government would be most disappointed if Hong Kong were retained
on the "Watch List" because such action would be unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the press conference was Commissioner of
Customs and Excise Lawrence Li Shu-fai, who emphasized customs'
determination and efforts in combating copyright piracy.

<HEADLINE> Strong Unions Vital for S. African Future: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela said
Friday strong organization of working people was as important for
the future of South Africa as it was for their own interest.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark May Day today in Kimberley, central South
Africa, Mandela said trade union struggles had been part of the
ruling African National Congress' fight for freedom and struggle.
</P>
<P>
South Africa relied on organized workers to strengthen the
offensive against crime and corruption in the work place,
including the criminal justice system and the civil service,
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
On improvement of living conditions, Mandela said in striving
to improve life of all, people should dispel the idea that change
came from the government alone while people waited passively for
delivery.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that one of the most urgent and critical
challenges facing the country was the creation of more jobs. As
preparations for a job's summit were being finalized, the
government was looking at how it could further enhance job
creation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations between trade unions and the
government, Mandela said his government could depend on unions
within the ANC alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said as long as the ANC and its allies -- the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, and the South African Communist Party
-- remained strong and united, it would keep the country on the
path of change.
</P>
<P>
"Above all it will help to ensure that the needs of the
poorest and most vulnerable come first," Mandela said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Jordanian FM Hold talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani held talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah Friday on the stalled Middle East peace
process, said a senior Palestinian official close to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Arafat briefed Anani on the ongoing
efforts by U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross to break the
deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, said the
official who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also mentioned about preparations for next Monday's
London talks which will be separately held by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that the London meetings would be
decisive for breaking the deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations, which have been stalled for over a year after
Israel broke ground for a settlement project in Arab East
Jerusalem in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ross has held several rounds of talks with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders in an attempt to persuade them to accept a
U.S. proposal on Israel's withdrawal from 13.1 percent of West
Bank before the London meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have pledged to back Washington's suggestion
despite it falls far below their expectation of 40 percent
pullback, but they said they would made no more concessions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has insisted on rejecting the U.S. plan,
saying that it is only willing to hand over 9 percent of the West
Bank's land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the visiting Jordanian minister that so far, there
is no specific policy changes on the Israeli side concerning its
troop redeployment in the West Bank and he is not certain whether
the London talks could make progress in this field.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to meet Ross again Friday evening in
Ramallah to hear from him what has been decided by the Israeli
side.
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, Arafat will fly to Cairo to brief Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on his meetings with Ross and what to be
discussed in the London talks. Egypt is a key Arab mediator in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Anani, who arrived in Ramallah at noon, has returned home after
his talks with Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy's Driver, Bodyguard Arrested in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The driver and the bodyguard of the
Russian president's envoy in Chechnya, who was kidnapped on the
border between Chechnya and Ingushetia Friday, have been arrested
by the Chechen police, the Itar-Tass news agency reported from
Grozny, capital of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Russian representative to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, on
President Boris Yeltsin's order, had attended to the Chechen
settlement in the previous government and in his former capacity
as Russian Security Council secretary, flew to Grozny Friday
evening, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Vlasov was abducted when he was traveling in the republic of
Ingushsetia, just a few kilometers from the border of the
breakaway Chechen Republic when he was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
CIS Executive Secretary Boris Berezovsky regarded the
kidnapping of the commissioner of the Russian president in
Chechnya as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
"It was a thoroughly planned, absolutely political
provocation," Berezovsky said. He held that the event was linked
with the attack at a tank brigade in late December 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Boris Yeltsin and his circle nor the Grozny
authorities, including Aslan Maskhadov, Shmil Basayev and Movladi
Udugov, are interested in the current developments and the
aggravated regional situation," Berezovsky noted.
</P>
<P>
Chechen minister of Shariah and state security Islam Khalimov
said, "The abduction is politically motivated and designed to
aggravate the tension in the region and in the relations between
Russia and Chechnya when a new Russian government is taking over."
</P>
<P>
Under the instruction of the president a group consisting of
Acting Vice-Premier Ivan Rybkin, deputy head of the Russian
Security Council General Boris Agapov and government commissioner
in Chechnya Georgy Kurin have left for Chechnya to investigate
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has instructed all law
enforcement agencies to identify the organizers and perpetrators
of the crime and take steps to set Vlasov free.

<HEADLINE> German Union Leaders Slap Government's Job Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade union leaders jointed
in a chorus Friday to criticize the government's failure to combat
record-high unemployment and call for a policy change in Bonn
after the general elections in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before 5,000 participants in a May Day rally in
Dortmund, leader of the German trade union for public services
OETV Herbert Mai said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government was
no longer in a position to win the battle against mass
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the IG Metall metalworkers union Klaus Zwickel also
told a rally in Ingolstadt that Kohl's government had "neither the
ideas nor the power to lead Germany into the 21th century."
</P>
<P>
Job creation and social justice must finally become the focus
of all political activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Schulte, who heads the main trade union federation DGB,
on Friday also voiced sharp criticism over the government policy
of cutting social spending, warning that such a policy would widen
the gaps between the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
According to DGB estimates, about 500,000 people took part in
the traditional May Day demonstrations and rallies across Germany
Friday to press for more jobs and social justice.
</P>
<P>
With jobless totals hovering at post-war highs of around 4.6
million, unemployment has become a key campaign issue in Germany's
national elections on September 27, in which Kohl is running
against his Social Democratic challenger Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has been hampered in the battle to cut joblessness after
failing to push through 30 billion German marks (16.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in tax cuts last year. He has also been blamed for
backing down on his promise to halve joblessness by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lack of Fuel, Power Throws Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The news of the break-down of one of
Nigeria's two operating refineries Wednesday afternoon might be
the worst news to most people of the country.
</P>
<P>
For sometime this year, most Nigerians have been suffering
from a nightmare resulted from the twin vice-grip of fuel
scarcity and erratic power supply.
</P>
<P>
Lack of petroleum products and electricity has a serious
impact on business which sustains declining capacity utilization,
loss of man-hours, under-productivity, reduced sales, depressed
profit margins, higher cost of production and increased
extra-budgetary expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The losses of the business circle, which is yet to be
prosperous with the uncertainty of the country's political
situation, are estimated at millions of U.S. Dollars a day,
according to the Federal Office of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Apart from small businesses, high-powered institutions such as
the Central Bank of Nigeria and th Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)
were also caught up by the twin-grip.
</P>
<P>
For a whole week in early March, the Central Bank reportedly
had no power supply because it could not get diesel to power its
generating sets and calculating machines.
</P>
<P>
Interbank checks for transaction among banks estimated at six
million Dollars were stalled that week.
</P>
<P>
The ports under NPA, whose performance is very crucial to a
highly import-dependent country like Nigeria, were paralyzed for
most of March.
</P>
<P>
The same problem: NPA could not power its machines and
equipment for loading and discharging cargoes.
</P>
<P>
For ordinary people, in a local government area of Lagos State
alone, 500,000 inhabitants have lived in darkness for six weeks
running.
</P>
<P>
With the spread of power supply problem across the country,
almost every facet of life is affected, including water supply in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In Ogun State, western Nigeria, two kids, aged eight and 10,
drowned in a river in a bid to fetch drinkable water.
</P>
<P>
Erratic power supply is not a new problem in Nigeria due to
aging infrastructure, vandalization of functional facilities and
illegal connections and consumption.
</P>
<P>
Diesel generators of various sizes therefore find a big market
in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the poor situation of refineries has forced most of
the generators out of operation as there is only one of four
refineries now operating far under capacity, resulting in
scarcity of diesel.
</P>
<P>
The supply of gasoline is also in tight shortage, creating
difficulties for people to move around and goods to be
transported to where they are needed.
</P>
<P>
It seems the Nigerian government did not discuss conundrum of
which problem comes first -- power or petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
As a rescue means, the government has ordered the import of
petroleum products for domestic use until the overhaul of the
refineries is completed.
</P>
<P>
Now, turn-around maintenance of the refineries is yet to begin
for some reason despite the funds set aside by the government for
the job.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to allocate part of this
year's budget for the rehabilitation of the failing power plants.
But the Ministry of Finance reportedly said it is not in a
position to meet the immediate funding needs.
</P>
<P>
It appears that most Nigerians have to accept the reality
although they are desperately longing for a better life.
</P>
<P>
"When the going gets tough, the tough gets going," said Bola
Adekoya, a sales clerk in a Lagos supermarket.

Turkey is closely following the latest developments in the
Yugoslav province with grave concern, a written statement issued
by Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the region would not be dragged into an
atmosphere of unconfidence and unstability as was experienced in
Bosnia-Herzegovina," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said Turkey welcomes international efforts made by the
six-nation Contact Group comprising the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the six countries held a meeting Wednesday in
Rome, Italy to discuss ways of easing tensions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The statement, however, noted that the Kosovo issue should be
resolved within the framework of maintaining territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Yugoslav province with an ethnic Albanian
majority. Conflicts between Serb police and ethnic Albanian
protesters demanding independence from Serbia have reportedly
killed at least 80 people since February.

<HEADLINE> Car Rental Franchise Agrees to Pay to Settle Racism Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The owner of an Avis franchise
has agreed to pay 2.1 million dollars to settle allegations he
refused to rent cars to blacks.
</P>
<P>
New Hanover Rent-A-Car also agreed to provide sensitivity
training for its employees and allow a civil rights monitor to
observe its activities for five years, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a class-action lawsuit filed in 1996, black customers
claimed they were repeatedly denied rentals at New Hanover
locations in Wilmington, Greenville, New Bern and Jacksonville in
North Carolina and in Florence, S.C.
</P>
<P>
Former employees said the owner, John Dalton III, trained his
staff to avoid renting to blacks by requiring them to show proof
of employment and higher credit-card limits.
</P>
<P>
In December, Avis Inc. agreed to pay nearly 3.3 million dollars
to settle allegations that it failed to do anything about Dalton's
practices.
</P>
<P>
New Hanover admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement agreement,
which was reached earlier this month. The agreement is subject to
approval by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
John Relman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Friday that the
total number of people entitled to share in the settlement isn't
yet known. Fourteen plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Government Hails Ex-Prime Minister's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has hailed
the guilty plea made at the United Nations Arusha Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR) by Rwanda's former interim prime minister Jean
Kambanda Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is no surprise that Kambanda has pleaded guilty," Rwandan
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anastase Gasana told the media.
</P>
<P>
Gasana pointed out that Kambanda, as a ring-leader, was aware
of the enormous amount of evidence, made of videos, recorded
speeches, as well as witnesses' accounts attesting his heavy
involvement in genocide.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very much appreciated if he reveals all he knows
about the genocide plan, its organization, and how it was carried
out throughout the country," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the view of Gasana, Secretary-General in the Ministry
of Justice Gerard Gahima told foreign reporters that "many people
in Rwanda would welcome it, because here is somebody who was in a
position of leadership and he is willing to tell the truth about
what happened."
</P>
<P>
In a spectacular move Tuesday, the former Rwanda Prime
Minister under the interim government that organized the 1994
genocide, pleaded guilty of all charges leveled against him by
the ICTR.
</P>
<P>
These charges include genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide,
direct and public incitement to commit genocide, as well as
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda pleaded guilty of all charges and told ICTR President
Judge Laity Kama that no one forced him to do so, and that he was
aware of the consequences of making such a move.
</P>
<P>
"There is really nothing to rejoice about a hard-core criminal
acknowledging the crimes he committed four years after the
genocide was carried out in Rwanda," said Philbert Muzima, the
Secretary-General of "ASRG-Mpore," which is a local association
of genocide survivors.
</P>
<P>
"He should be punished according to the law, and there should
be no lighter sentence for him," Muzima underlined. "Other
criminals roaming throughout the world, or those in jail in
Arusha or in Rwanda should follow suit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The indictment brought in by the ICTR accused Kambanda of
failing in his capacity as interim prime minister to provide
protection to the population.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda's plea occurred only a week after the first 22
genocide suspects tried in Rwanda courts were executed in public.
</P>
<P>
"This sent a strong message to the genocide criminals,"
Minister Gasana said. "The Rwandan government showed that it was
serious about punishing the perpetrators of the genocide," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Because of Kambanda's inflammatory speeches and his repeated
calls to exterminate Tutsis, even regions where residents have
shunned mass-killings of their neighbors like southern Butare
were affected.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda himself ordered the slaughter of Jean Baptiste
Habyarimana who had maintained security in the prefecture of
Butare.
</P>
<P>
More than one million people, mostly Tutsis and some
opposition Hutus were killed during the 1994 genocide that was
conceived and orchestrated by Hutu hard-liners like Kambanda,
Col. Theoneste Bagosora and other dignitaries of late President
Juvenal Habyarimana.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges U.S. to Pay U.N. Dues Unconditionally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday urged the United States to pay its arrears to the
United Nations without setting any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to a legislation approved by the U.S.
Senate on April 28 which would provide 819 million dollars in back
U.S. dues to the United Nations. But at the same time, the
legislation sets a precondition to the payment, which imposes a
ban on any U.S. aid to international family planning groups that
lobby for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said he
is pleased to see the level of support in the Senate for payment
of a significant portion of the U.S. arrears to the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary-general regretted that U.S. fulfillment
of its financial obligation remains uncertain due to an extraneous
matter.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. system does many things each day which
benefit the citizens of the United States, and of the world.
Conversely, the continuing support of the United States is
critical to the success of the United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief urged President Bill Clinton and the
congressional leadership to resolve this issue without any
conditions.

KUWAIT CITY, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
arrived in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea city of Jeddah Friday on a
Middle East tour to discuss with Israeli and Arab leaders the
current situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in Saudi Arabia, Gore will hold talks
with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz in this regards, the Kuwait News Agency reported
from Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
The talks will particularly focus on U.S. Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross' current visit to Israel and Palestinian self-rule
areas to prepare for the May 4 London talks, which will
be separately held between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The London meetings are aimed at reviving the Mideast peace
process which has been suspended for over a year after Israel
decided in March 1997 to build thousands of Jewish houses in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Gore is also expected to discuss with
Saudi leaders situations in Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the second leg of Gore's Middle East tour which
has already taken him to Israel and will also take him to Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- At least seven persons died in
Nigeria's southwestern city of Ibandan Friday during the
confrontation between protesters and the police.
</P>
<P>
A report from Ibandan said that violent incidents took place
in a demonstration organized by the opposition United Action for
Democracy (UAD) to protest against the possible self-succession
of General Sani Abacha, the current head of state.
</P>
<P>
However, the British Broadcasting Corporation report could not
specify the killer as it said the police, who reportedly used
tear-gas, did not shoot.
</P>
<P>
It said the police did not confirm the casualty but confirmed
the arrest of coordinator of UAD for western zone and five
others.
</P>
<P>
UAD Thursday called on Nigerians to participate in its planned
nationwide protest against "military dictatorship" on the May
Day.
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy and human rights groups in the country have
recently been wooing the support of the public in their
activities, particularly since the five political parties adopted
Abacha two weeks ago as their sole consensus candidate for the
August presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ibandan has been a hot spot of protest.
</P>
<P>
So far, no reports of demonstrations have been heard from
other parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> ECOFIN Recommends Same 11 Countries for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The European economy and finance
ministers (ECOFIN) unanimously agreed to recommend the same 11
countries to be the founding members of the single currency, euro.
</P>
<P>
The ECOFIN ministers are to recommend Belgium, Germany, Spain,
France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria,
Portugal and Finland for approval to Saturday's summit of European
Union heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the chairman of the ECOFIN council
meeting, Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
The British chancellor of the exchequer also told the press
that following reports by the European Commission, the European
Monetary Institute, the relevant commission recommendation and the
European Parliament opinion, his council adopted the
recommendation on its findings on which member states have
fulfilled the necessary legal as well as economic requirements.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the end of a process but only the beginning of it,"
said the chancellor who added that the single currency will serve
as a platform for stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
The British finance minister said that economic and structural
reforms will be the ensuing challenges on route to fully
materializing the single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The ECOFIN council will recommend the 11 countries to a special
European Parliament session as well as the European Union summit
for final approval.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, in a Thursday session in Strasbourg,
voted 402-79 with 27 abstentions in favor of the recommendation
made by the European Commission on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended the 11 countries to be in the first
wave of euro. Britain and Denmark opted out while Sweden and
Greece were judged not economically ready to join.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the council made any progress in resolving
the row about the candidate for the presidency of the future
European Central Bank (ECB), Brown said that there was some
progress and he believed that progress would continue on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands are backing Dutchman Wim Duisenberg
as the single candidate for ECB presidency whereas France is
championing its central banker Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, went to the Netherlands
for a lightning visit to talk with his Dutch equivalent Wim Kok on
the candidacy row.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer said earlier on
Friday that the commission would not breach the Maastricht Treaty
while making the European central banker recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The treaty stipulates that the ECB president serves an
unrenewable eight-year term, though some reports suggested that
the commission was seeking a compromise to let Trichet succeed
Duisenberg in that one eight-year tenure on the grounds of old
age. Duisenberg is now 63 years old.
</P>
<P>
The euro summit has reserved a third day for the choice of the
ECB president, which has been deemed to be the trickiest and
thorniest issue of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Observers here commented that unresolved row would backlash on
the image and stability of euro, to be launched on January 1 next
year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Warns U.N. of Serious Consequences if </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq warned Friday the U.N. Security
Council of serious consequences if it does not lift its sanctions
on Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq issued the warning in an open letter to the U.N. Security
Council on Friday following a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council and Iraq's Regional Command of the Baath Socialist
Party.
</P>
<P>
"After eight years and all the sacrifices made by the Iraqi
people, we still cannot see the minimal response from the
Security Council, this will lead to serious consequences," warned
the letter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the letter is the Iraqi leadership's formal
response to the U.N. Security Council's recent decision to renew
for another six months the sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The letter criticized the United States for blocking the
lifting of the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
on disarmament in Iraq has sent 397 inspection and monitoring
teams to Iraq which involved 3,200 inspectors and arms experts,
said the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Those UNSCOM teams conducted more than 7,000 visits to sites
throughout Iraq, but found no banned weapons of mass
destruction," the letter noted.
</P>
<P>
The non-fly zones created by the United States and Britain in
the north and south of Iraq contradict with the U.N. Charter which
provides non-interference of member states' internal affairs,
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United States and Britain maintain military
presence in the Gulf region in order to control the oil fields in
the region and threaten Iraq and other Arab Gulf states.

<HEADLINE> Ahern Criticizes IRA's Statement on Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) - Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
attacked Friday the Irish Republican Army (IRA) for a
"provocative" statement on the Northern Ireland peace deal,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued Thursday, the IRA said the accord
marked a significant development but added that "viewed against
our republican objectives" it fell short of being a solid basis
for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
Ahern told a news conference that "the decommissioning of
paramilitary weapons is an essential part of any settlement."
</P>
<P>
But Ahern said that while the IRA statement contained
provocative comments, it would be wrong to interpret it as an
outright rejection of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We don't want decommissioning to become an obstacle,"
adding "the most important principle to be adhered to is the
commitment to non-violence."
</P>
<P>
Referendums on the Northern Ireland peace accord will be held
on May 22 both north and south of the Irish border, and a "yes"
vote is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
"Let us show that we really care, that we do not want to see
anyone else killed, any more families bereaved, by turning out to
vote," Ahern said.

KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Kampala City Council (KCC) has
started spraying drugs in the most affected areas in Kampala and
its neighboring areas to kill Nairobi fly.
</P>
<P>
The insect number was increasing and so KCC launched the
spraying operation in Kampala and Mpigi District, the daily
newspaper Monitor Friday quoted Herbert Semakula, KCC's public
relations official, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spraying is underway in Mekerere University, Kololo, old
Kampala, Mbuya, Nakasero and Muyenga Divisions in the capital
city and Makindye, Kawempe, Nateete and Nalukologo in Mpigi
District bordering Kampala, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi fly is propagated in areas covered by substantial
plants under warm and rainy conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the insect never bites people but it
spreads a kind of poisonous substance which causes pain and
swelling in human skin. It bothers patients in a period of some
two weeks and poses no danger to its victims.
</P>
<P>
The drugs used in Kampala also kill flies, mosquitos and other
harmful insects, the paper said.

ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Around 5,000 demonstrators clashed
with riot police Friday in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey,
leaving 74 people injured and 200 demonstrators arrested, local
TV reports said.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-government slogans, the demonstrators tried to
force into the Caglayan Square to celebrate the May Day, but were
blocked by heavily armed police.
</P>
<P>
Then the protesters broke into small groups and marched toward
the Taksim Square in downtown Istanbul, where a bloody clash in
May 1, 1977 claimed 30 lives.
</P>
<P>
They clashed with riot police who tried to prevent them from
heading for the square. Angry demonstrators smashed windows of
many roadside shops with sticks and stones and set a truck on
fire.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured were 42 demonstrators, 28 policemen and four
journalists, a police spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
From the early morning hours, Istanbul police station received
dozens of anonymous phones calls warning that time bombs were
planted in different sites of the city.
</P>
<P>
Police, however, finally found many empty cases and boxes
left in garbage cans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy in Cyprus for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential Emissary for
Cyprus Richard Holbrooke said here Friday that a settlement to
the protracted Cyprus problem lies in self-efforts by Greek and
Turkish Cypriots more than U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
Beginning his second visit to Cyprus within one month,
Holbrooke stressed that Washington cannot make peace or find a
settlement if the parties themselves do not favor it.
</P>
<P>
"Parties must be equally committed to making progress to reach
a viable and lasting solution," he said upon his arrival at the
Larnaca airport.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's return to Cyprus came at the specific request of
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash. He said he will stay here for three to four days to
hold a series of meetings with the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled southern part
and Turkish Cypriot-dominated northern part in 1974 when Ankara
landed its troops on the island after a failed coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece. The Turkish Cypriot
established a republic in the north, but was only recognized by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Denktash walked out of the U.N.-led peace talks with Clerides to
protest a EU decision to open accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he will not return to the negotiating
table unless his breakaway republic in northern Cyprus is
recognized and the peace talks are conducted between "two states."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Holbrooke failed in his mission to promote
the resumption of the stalled political dialog between the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
However, he vowed to "try... even if difficulties are very
great."
</P>
<P>
"For a number of reasons we believe we have an opportunity to
move forward now on the substance of issues required to resolve
the Cyprus problem," he said.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 1 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Friday urged workers in all sectors to work harder in order
to increase production and build up the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big rally at the Kambarage Staduim in
northwestern Shinyanga City to mark the May Day, Mkapa stressed
that Tanzania should not keep borrowing from donors and it should
use its own manpower and resources to boost the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzanians should not blame the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank for their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
"IMF and the World Bank are like doctors, so they did not come
to us. But because we are sick, we have no choice but to go to
Washington and ask for a cure," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also reiterated the government's determination
to privatize the parastatals, saying that in most cases the
government failed to run them well.
</P>
<P>
"In order to save our industries and our economy, the
government will continue to encourage foreign investors to come
and invest in different sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed the importance of cracking down on the
corruption of government officials, calling all his people to
fight against them by revealing their names.
</P>
<P>
"We leave our culprits stealing large sum of public funds
allocated for national development projects, but we take up the
law in our hands in stoning to death young boys suspected of
stealing 1,000 (Tanzanian) Shillings," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Finland dashed on Friday hopes that
it could bring forward a compromise candidate in the row over who
should head the future European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto, upon arriving in
Brussels for a special European economy and finance ministers
council meeting, ruled out the compromise that the Finnish central
banker stands as an alternate candidate.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands are backing Dutchman Wim Duisenberg
as the ECB president candidate whereas France is championing Bank
of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg now heads the European Monetary Institute, the
actual forerunner of the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish minister said that the Dutch banker and the French
banker were the only candidates.
</P>
<P>
The row has been feared to ruin Saturday's special summit by
the European Union heads of state and government that, apart from
confirming which member states should be the founding members of
the single currency, is to pick the one candidate to head the ECB
that regulates the euro policy and the exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, prime minister of Britain that is serving the
rotating presidency of the 15-nation European Union, went to the
Netherlands Friday for a lightning visit to talk with his Dutch
counterpat Wim Kok on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But Kok told Dutch television that he would rather that EU
leaders delayed a decision on who heads the ECB than chose the
wrong man.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is preparing for its general elections to be
held next Wednesday. The elections are important for Kok and his
labor party as well.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer brushed aside
earlier on Friday rumors that his commission was seeking a
compromise to arrange for Trichet to succeed Duisenberg on the
ground of age. Duisenberg is now 63 years old.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the United
Nations Kofi Annan Friday urged African governments, civil
society and the U.N. organizations to make gender equality a
reality.
</P>
<P>
Annan made his call in his concluding remarks at the forum of
heads of state and government at the International Conference on
African Women and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference closed on Friday by passing
recommendations in four aspects.
</P>
<P>
As for the role of women in developing African economies,
participants recommended, among others, the inclusion of gender
concerns into national budgetary and procedures, the promotion
and protection of women's access to and ownership of land, and
the enhancement of women's access to markets and regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the participation of women in achieving good
governance, they proposed the launching of a series of trainings
on gender awareness and political skills, the decentralization of
power to enable women to take part in local politics, as well as

<HEADLINE> "Long March Rocket Ideal for Commercial Launches," Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Long March 2C rocket is
capable of competing in the international market for commercial
launches of medium- and low-orbit satellites, an official of the
China Great Wall Industry Corp. said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north
China's Shanxi Province, Liu Zhixiong, vice-president of China
Great Wall, said that the capability of the Long March 2C has been
proved in three launches of Iridium satellites in succession.
</P>
<P>
At 17:16 pm (Beijing Time), a Long March 2C rocket lifted off
from the launch center here and successfully carried into
preset orbits two Iridium satellites made by the Motorola
Corporation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the improved version of the Long March 2C rocket was
manufactured in line with the requirements of Motorola for the
task of launching Iridium satellites; it is made up of two
sub-stages and a newly-made satellite distributor.
</P>
<P>
Compared with ther Long March 2C rocket, the improved Long
March 2C carrier rocket has adopted more new technology, including
the 3.35-m-diameter fairing of the improved Long March 3A rocket,
an extra-long two-stage storage container for fuel and oxidizing
agent, and two-stage jet-pipe engines.
</P>
<P>
The rocket is about 40 m in length and its lifting-off
weight is 213 tons. It can carry two Iridium satellites into
preset orbits with one launch.
</P>
<P>
On the international market for the commercial launching of
medium- and low-orbit satellites, Liu said that in the coming
decade there will be a boom in the launching of such satellites,
adding that the number will reach more than 700.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the potential market for such launches
offers opportunities and challenges for Long March rockets.
</P>
<P>
The improved version of the Long March 2C rocket was first
launched on September 1, 1997. On December 8 last year and March
26 this year, the rocket respectively carried two Iridium
satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that 1998 will be a busy year for the Long March
2C rocket, as it is expected to undergo three or four launches.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary agreement between China Great Wall
and Motorola, the next launch of an Iridium satellite will be in
July this year, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
China Great Wall will carry out four or five launches for
Motorola before the Iridium satellite network goes into operation
and six or more launches for the maintenance of the network in the
next few years.

compromise taking shape, he will not serve a full eight-year term,
but at some point he will step aside in favor of Jean-Claude
Trichet, 55, the French central bank governor.

For now, Britain, Sweden and Denmark opt to stay out, while
Greece does not meet the entry criteria, such as low inflation and

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Greece of Supporting Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry on Saturday
strongly accused Greece of supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) of Turkey to set up a bureau in Athens.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said that Greece's support and
protection of the PKK group, which is aimed at spoiling Turkey's
territorial integrity, openly violates the act of the United
Nations and international law.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the participation of Acting Greek
Parliamentary Speaker and Greek deputies in the opening ceremony
of the PKK bureau in Athens, capital of Greece, is a
"representation which directly organizes terrorism against
Turkey's territorial integrity".
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish rebel organization PKK has been outlawed for its
struggle to establish an independent Kurdish state in eastern and
southeastern Kurdish areas of Turkey. Nearly 30,000 people,
including policemen, armymen, civilians and the Kurdish rebels
have been killed in the conflicts since 1984 when the rebels
started an armed struggle against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz called on
Greece to give up its hostile attitude towards Turkey, warning
that such a stance will impede normalization of the Turkish-Greek
ties.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is a member state of the European Union
(EU), has been blocking Turkey from entering into the European
organization for its poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Greece, however, has categorically denied the charges, saying
that Turkey's claims were aimed at defaming Greece's international
reputation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, have long been at odds over a number of
issues concerning the Aegean, including air space limits, sea-bed
mineral resources, as well as sovereignty over many uninhabited
islets.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Address Nation on Launching of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac will
address the nation Sunday on television regarding the launching of
the European single currency euro by the European Union (EU)
summit in Brussels this weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a special program by TF1 television, Chirac will discuss the
event which he considers "historic" and which France has been
working hard to realize since its inception.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is deeply worried about anti-euro agitations at home and
strong opposition to the abandoning of monetary sovereignty by
France to a greater European central bank.
</P>
<P>
In a vote last month on the adoption of the euro at the
National Assembly, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, a
traditional power base of Chirac's, abstained while the Communist
Party voted against.
</P>
<P>
The extreme-right National Front has called on the French
people to reject "a thousand times" the euro, which it accused of
being a tool to "enslave" France by a Europe engaged in economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, France's mainstream rightwing is in full disarray
after suffering a major setback in the regional elections in March.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference two weeks ago, Chirac called the fear of
euro "groundless and excessive."
</P>
<P>
EU leaders are meeting Saturday in Brussels to give their final
green light to the launching of the euro by January 1, 1999,
despite a lingering dispute over the nomination of the president
of the European central bank.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that a compromise is within reach between
France, which insists on nominating the president of the Bank of
France Jean Trichet, and other EU countries, which prefer Dutch
Wim Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
In a previous address on March 25, Chirac paid tribute to all
his predecessors, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and President
Francois Mitterrand, as well as all other French leaders -- both

<HEADLINE> Greek Firms Start Preparations for Transition to Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek firms have already started
to prepare for the transition to the euro, the European Union's
common currency, according to a survey released here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Association of Greek Industries
(SEV) in the past two months among 100 local enterprises, shows
that 26 Greek firms have determined the field of application of
their euro plan, 31 have appointed a plan manager, 24 have studied
the consequences from the introduction of the euro, 14 have
defined a transition plan, 11 have already taken concrete action,
and 11 have briefed staff on the plan.
</P>
<P>
The euro is expected to be launched on January 1, 1999, with
the participation of countries such as France, Germany, Italy,
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Austria,
Finland and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Britain, Denmark and Sweden are unlikely to join, but
of the 15 EU members, Greece is the only country which has now not
met the convergence criteria.
</P>
<P>
To join the euro by January 1, 2001, the Greek government has
announced in recent months a series of drastic measures including
the incorporation of its national currency with the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and partial privatization of
loss-making state-run companies and banks.

<HEADLINE> Berger: U.S., China Cooperate on Larger Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security Advisor
Samuel R. Berger said here Friday that the projected U.S.
strategic partnership with China should lead to broader
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a policy address to the Brookings Institute, he said the
United States has a "great interest" in building a strategic
partnership with China.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a strategic partnership in the sense that it
should not only be dealing with trade issues and issues that are
of smaller scope, but we should be dealing with the larger issues
where we can cooperate, for example, the future of the Korean
peninsula," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China agreed to establish a "constructive
strategic partnership for the 21st century" in October when
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Washington and held a summit
meeting with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have since steadily improved despite some issues
including trade imbalance, human rights, religious freedom,
nonproliferation and particularly the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have, I think, moved the U.S.-China relationship from one
of a downward spiral to at least an upward trajectory," said
Berger, a leading advocate of engagement policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
He added that "what we would like to accomplish is a strategic
partnership in this sense: a relationship in which both sides deal
with each other's strategic interests in a forthright way; where
we find areas of cooperation on which we can work together; where
we deal with our differences candidly, forthrightly and directly,
and what ultimately benefits both our people."
</P>
<P>
Berger made the remarks shortly after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright left Beijing for Mongolia after two days of
talks with Chinese leaders in preparation for President Clinton's
visit to China in late June.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his China trip is aimed at building on the
momentum created by the fall Washington summit in the
Sino-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
Berger explained why the United States attaches importance to
China. He said: "How China evolves over the next 10 or 20 years
may be one of the great questions that determines our future.
</P>
<P>
"Whether China is integrated into the global community that I
spoke about, on the one hand, or whether China drifts or heads off
in a more nationalistic, a more insular direction, I think will
determine not only the fate of Asia, but very much our own
future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official spoke highly of China's policy regarding
nonproliferation and nuclear cooperation with foreign countries.
"The fact of the matter is there are a number of things that they
have not only committed to do, but have done."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Saturday that the youth are a driving force of his country's
development and should be given hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks in a speech read on his behalf by
Minister of Presidential Affairs Erick Silwamba at the official
opening of the Boys Brigade Council in Ndola, northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said the youth need hope because they are faced with
difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Youth organizations must engage in active dialog with the
government if their concerns are taken into account, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiluba, alongside the program being pursued by
the government, the state will endeavor to create a social
atmosphere that will enable the youth to fully develop.
</P>
<P>
In order to redress youth problems successfully, the
government has identified and targeted a number of development
issues for policy implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of their objectives include reducing unemployment among
the youth through the promotion of health employment enterprises
and upgrading the quality of life among young Zambians through
income generating measures, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Francis Kalunda, president of the Boys Brigade, said the
brigade will give youth entrepreneurs scheme to enable them to
survive.

<HEADLINE> India's BJP Discusses Party Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) decided on Saturday to make fresh efforts to attract
minorities to its fold in a bid to reach out to wider sections and
areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the BJP's National
Executive Committee, Gandhinagar, capital of the western state of
Gujarat, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held ahead of the two-day National Council Session
beginning on Sunday, discussed a draft political resolution to be
approved at the Council session.
</P>
<P>
BJP spokesman Venkaiah Naidu told reporters later that the
party was considering plans to widen its base to reach out to all
areas.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address to the meeting, outgoing BJP president
Lal Krishna Advani expressed confidence that the party would
overcome difficulties faced by the BJP-led coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"The trials and tribulations of the first six weeks of the
Indian government have steeled its resolve to stabilize and
strengthen itself," Advani, also home minister, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the three-day National Executive and
Council meetings of the BJP are deliberations on its strategy on
expanding the base of the party and strengthening the
organizational structure. But the most difficult task facing the
BJP leadership is how to project a new image to the party in the
era of coalition politics.
</P>
<P>
The topics of the meetings also include the role of BJP's
allies in the central government and their relations, and ways to
ensure a smooth functioning of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected BJP president, Kushabhau Thakre, will
formally take over from Advani at the Council meeting, to be
attended by more than 2,300 delegates from across the country,
including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, district presidents
and state-level office bearers.

<HEADLINE> UK Denies Having Tension with Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The British High Commission in
Harare said here Saturday that relations between Britain and its
former colony, Zimbabwe, are "excellent."
</P>
<P>
The high commission stressed in a statement that workshops are
being held to involve a wide range of local stake-holders in the
process of discussing bilateral aid packages.
</P>
<P>
There was no tension between Britain and Zimbabwe contrary to
some media reports that the Zimbabwean government had not been
invited at a British-organized meeting held here Thursday where
bilateral aid packages and other issues were discussed.
</P>
<P>
"The process of stake-holder consultation is designed to
complement in the formal talks, of which the Zimbabwean
government has a central role," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier media reports said the British government had
deliberately excluded the Zimbabwean government from a review of
priorities for British development assistance to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has raised serious concern in the Zimbabwean
government, which feels the British government has breached the
code of international relations and basic diplomatic etiquette,"
newspapers published here reported.
</P>
<P>
The papers added that the British side recently had second
thoughts about honoring last year's agreement with the Zimbabwean
government in which they promised a grant aid of more than 200
million Zimbabwean Dollars (over 11 million U.S. Dollars) for the
purchase of 1,500 Land-Rovers for the Zimbabwean police.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it very difficult for the government to have a
smooth working relationship with the British High Commission,"
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs had
refused to comment on the matter.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 110 passengers and five
crew members were injured when a jet-foil hit an underwater object
near Hong Kong's new airport early Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about one mile off Tai O at 12:25 p.m.
(local time) when the jet-foil "Flores" carrying eight crew
members and 236 passengers was on its way to Macao, the Government
Information Services (GIS) Department said.
</P>
<P>
Several police launches and Marine department vessels were
dispatched to the scene immediately. All the casualties had been
taken to hospitals for treatment, GIS said.
</P>
<P>
The police have made arrangements for other passengers to
return to town.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa sent his regards to the
injured. "Staff from all departments concerned and hospitals are
making their best efforts to treat the injured," he said.
</P>
<P>
Director of Home Affairs Shelley Lau went to hospitals to visit
the injured and to ensure that help desks were set up efficiently.
</P>
<P>
"Setting up help desks is one of the recommendations made the
Garley Building Fire investigation report," Lau said. A fire broke
out in the commercial building in November 1996, killing dozens of
people.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the recommendation has been put into
practice," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Home Affairs Department (HAD) coordinates the running of
the help desks together with staff of the Social Welfare
Department, the Police and the Hospital Authority.
</P>
<P>
HAD will continue in the next few days to offer assistance to
the injured and their families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Marine Department started an investigation into
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Department has issued a navigational warning message
to shipmasters and a marine patrol boat will stay at the scene
Saturday night.

Sultan Satuyev was "suspected of being connected with the incident
when Vlasov was abducted."
</P>
<P>
The Russian's bodyguard, who was not named, was under
investigation for failing to resist the attack by the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The suspects can be held 20 days before charges are brought.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rybkin, dispatched to the region by Yeltsin on Friday for
urgent talks with senior Chechen officials, said Vlasov's
abduction was intended to further undermine stalemated peace talks
between Moscow and the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Chechen and Russia's other North Caucasus republics have become
a fertile ground for hostage-takers since a ceasefire ended the
Chechen war in August 1996, but it has also frozen the question of
Grozny's political status for five years.

<HEADLINE> Sino-European Commercial Ties Keep Positive Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Trade statistics for the first
quarter of 1998 show that China's commercial ties with
Europe have maintained their momentum of growth.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume in the first three months topped 9.7
billion U.S. dollars, up 11.4 percent from the year-ago period,
according to statistics released by China's General Administration
of Customs.
</P>
<P>
China exported 6.12 billion U.S. dollars-worth of commodities
to Europe in this period, which represented a 30.1 percent
increase, while its imports from the region dropped 10.2 percent
valued at 3.58 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts here agree that this favorable momentum should be
attributed to the booming commercial activities between the two
sides, the frequent bilateral high-level visits and a deeper
mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter's growth was achieved against a background of
progress: Last December the European Commission removed China from
its list of "non-market economies"; on March 25 this year the
European Commission launched a new China policy in a document
titled, "Building a Comprehensive Partnership with China", which
called for more dialogue, wider cooperation and the upgrading of
overall ties with China.
</P>
<P>
The second Asia-Europe Meeting, held in early April, witnessed
China and Europe hold their first summit meeting, at which it was
decided to build a long-term and stable constructive partnership
toward the 21st century, and to establish an annual summit
meeting mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade and economic ministers from Portugal, the
Netherlands, Turkey and Germany visited China one after the other
and exchanged views with Chinese officials on bilateral commercial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The 1990s have also seen the scale of bilateral investment
and financial cooperation enlarged.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) countries had invested in 8,352 projects in
China by the end of 1997, involving 31.47 billion U.S. dollars in
contracts, of which 13.05 billion U.S. dollars was actually
used. The EU ranked fifth among the countries and regions
investing in China at that time.
</P>
<P>
China has borrowed most of its foreign government loans from
Europe, whose member countries and official financial
organizations had provided, by the end of last year, contracts
worth 12.808 billion U.S. dollars to China. This accounted for
41.9 percent of such loans China had received.
</P>
<P>
China also introduced, in the same period, 6,864 items of
technology from the EU, with the contracts valued at 38 billion
U.S. dollars, which made up 44.9 percent of China's total
introduction of technologies.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still some problems remaining in bilateral
trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The EU has for a long time accused China of dumping, and
stopped importing some agricultural products from China. It also
discriminates against four kinds of non-textile Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
However, trade experts said, the EU's decision to remove the
"non-market economy" label from China would help solve the
anti-dumping problem. They also noted that the EU would gradually
ease controls on Chinese exports to the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A wide-bodied aircraft of Hong
Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Saturday successfully landed at the
new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok as part of the
first airdrome trial conducted by the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific's B747-200 aircraft, "the Spirit of Hong Kong
97", landed at Chek Lap Kok at 15:20 and taxied to bay S23 where a
number of ground handling services were performed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cholera Outbreak Hits Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Apart from the humanitarian
difficulties created by the civil strife in Lower Jubba in south
Somalia, the people of the town of Jilib are now facing a new
outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 people are reported to have died of cholera in
Jilib town in the past three days alone.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Abdulle Sandhere, head of Mercy
International, an American aid agency, more than 60 people who
are suffering from cholera are now being isolated in the former
municipal facility of the town.
</P>
<P>
Sandhere said samples taken from the patients for laboratories
in Nairobi have all tested positive cholera. As the people are
being treated with few stocks of anti-cholera drugs, there are
also dozens of others who are falling for the disease as the days
go past.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the town whom this reporter contacted on the VHF
radio said they receive little medical assistance from the few
international aid agencies including Mercy international, United
Nations Children's Fund and the International Committee of the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that the assistance is insufficient to
combat the epidemic taken into account its current rate
propagation.
</P>
<P>
The local medical staff have attributed the cholera outbreak
to the recent rains which hit the town and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
The medical assistance said the spread of the disease is
supported by poor sanitation and lack of enough latrines for most
of the people in the town, who are internally displaced by last
year's disastrous floods which hit southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The current outbreak of fighting in Lower Jubba is also said
to have added more refugees to the town which is already afloat
with people.
</P>
<P>
The cholera epidemic is one of Somalia's repetitious diseases
that kill hundreds of people each year, especially during the
rainy seasons. More than 200 people, mainly children under five,
are known to have died of the disease in Mogadishu alone early in
the year.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Two US-Made Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 2C rocket
successfully sent two US-made Iridium satellites into orbit from
the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north China's Shanxi
Province late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The rocket lifted off from the center at 17:16 pm (Beijing
Time).
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that a Long March rocket has carried
into space two Iridium satellites made by the US-based Motorola
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The other two launches were on December 8, 1997 and March 26,
1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The continuous overcast and rainy weather with thunder in the
past few days add difficulties to the launch, and every day there
were only 36 seconds for the launch command.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists, however, succeeded in the launch, based
on their rich experience and precise calculations.
</P>
<P>
After 11 minutes, the distributor stage successfully altered
course and boosted the two satellites into their predetermined
orbit at a perigee of 632 km, apogee of 634 km, and bank angle of
86.4 degrees.
</P>
<P>
In line with a contract signed in April, 1993, China in the
coming years will continue to use the Long March 2C rockets to
send 16 Iridium satellites into orbit from the Taiyuan center to
maintain the communications network.
</P>
<P>
Iridium satellites are part of a state-of-the-art mobile
telecommunications system developed by Motorola for Iridium LLC,
which is developing and commercializing a global wireless
communications network that will combine the worldwide reach of 66
low earth orbit satellites with land-based wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
The system offers communications services for individuals,
vehicles, ships and airplanes using handheld telephones, pagers
and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The 66 satellites are to be launched by Delta 2 rockets of the
McDonnell Douglas Corporation of the United States, Proton rockets
of Russia and Long March 2C rockets of China.
</P>
<P>
The system is expected to go into operation by the end of this
year, when a Delta 2 rocket completes the last launch.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch was the 51st using the Long March rocket series.
</P>
<P>
Since it was put into international commercial service in 1985,
the Long March rockets have sent a total of 15 foreign commercial
satellites into space.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan University President Attends Beida Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The president of Beijing University
(Beida), Chen Jiaer, today sat next to Wei Jao Chen, president of
Taiwan University, at a forum for higher education in Beijing to
mark the centennial of Beida.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jao Chen, the first elected president of Taiwan University,
said the most obvious similarity between his university and Beida
is a free and open academic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, scholars from Beida took the university's
tradition and influence to Taiwan University, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiaer said the common cultural tradition and their
respective characteristics have been the basis of exchanges
between the two universities for many years.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Beida signed a memorandum on mutual cooperation
with its Taiwan counterpart, covering the fields of traditional
Chinese culture, philosophy, psychology, history and economics.
</P>
<P>
Despite some man-made barriers, academic exchange programs,
exchanges of teachers and students' activities such as sports
competitions have also been conducted frequently between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Expressing gratitude for being invited to attend the
celebration of the centennial of Beida, Wei Jao Chen said Beida is
a giant international academic forum.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jao Chen, who will chair the 70th anniversary celebrations
of Taiwan University this year, said exchanges between the two
most prestigious universities on the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits will never be limited to sending congratulations to each
other, adding that he believed that more in-depth exchanges would
be conducted between them in the future.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The chiefs of state and government of the 15 European Union

Saturday in Brussels. The dispute over the nomination of the
president of the future European Central Bank remains the only
point of friction.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac has threatened to veto the nomination of
Dutch candidate Wim Duisenberg. But a compromise seems highly
possible between France and its European partners.
</P>
<P>
-- The depositions given by Semdin Sakik, the former number two
of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) who was arrested recently by
Turkish security forces in northern Iraq, is bewildering the
Turkish authorities. During 10 days of questioning by Turkish
security agents, Sakik "revealed" a list names of Turkish
personalities including journalists, politicians and businessmen
and Islamists who he claimed had supported the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Jacques Santer, the president of the European Commission,
Friday hailed the European Union as "a community of destiny"
which will have its single currency euro launched this weekend
during the summit if its 15 member countries in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"Euro will not only be a factor of economic integration, but
also one of political integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- During a traditional demonstration in Paris on Friday, the
extreme-right National Front (FN) president Jean-Marie Le Pen
called on French people to reject the European single currency "a
thousand times," and described the euro as a tool for "enslaving"
France.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Urged to Participate in Return Preparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua commentator's article
issued Friday called for the Macao people's large-scale
participation in the preparations for Macao's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article said local residents' support and participation
would be the guarantee for Macao's smooth return and is also
important for the realization of "Macao people governing Macao".
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong people's active participation guaranteed Hong
Kong's smooth transition and return to the motherland, it added,
and thus set a good example for Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important tasks, the article noted, is to drum
up local residents' support for the Macao Special Administrative
Region Preparatory Committee (SARPC), to be established May 5.
</P>
<P>
Macao compatriots are urged to set forth suggestions for
building the future special administrative region in political,
economic, legal, cultural and social fields.
</P>
<P>
The collection of Macao residents' opinions will enable the
Macao SARPC to adopt policies that can represent the rights and
interests of people of various social strata and organizations,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
So long as all parties adhere to the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and the basic law, China's resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Macao will surely be achieved smoothly, based
on the full-scale preparations made by the Macao SARPC, the
commentator's article said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Warns Against Bomb Sabotage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has accused
the opposition of planning a bombing campaign to discredit the
on-going transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The warning was contained in a recent statement issued by
Minister of Information and Culture Chief Ike Obasi Mokelu, the
Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Key public installations would be targeted by bombers with
the intention of embarrassing the administration of General Sani
Abacha, which has promised to restore civilian rule on October
1," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It warned that "this government's disposition to continuously
invite dialogue should not imply weakness on its part."
</P>
<P>
The warning followed the explosion of two devices last week in
Lagos and Ile-Ife in the southwest, which is considered as
opposition heartland.
</P>
<P>
At least eight civilians were killed in the bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
The target of the unknown bombers was not clear and
investigations are underway.
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy and human rights groups in the country have
recently been soliciting the support of the public in their
activities, particularly since the five political parties adopted
Abacha two weeks ago as their sole consensus candidate for the
August presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration was organized by the opposition coalition
United Action for Democracy (UAD) Friday in the southwestern city
of Ibadan to protest against the possible self-succession of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges Closer Ties With Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States will expand
bilateral relations and multilateral cooperation with Mongolia,
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released after meeting Mongolian Prime
Minister Tsakhiya Elbegdorj, Albright pledged U.S. support for
Mongolia's ongoing economic and political reforms and continued
U.S. aid to Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The United States backs Mongolia's efforts to join
international organizations which are influential in the world,
and recognizes its status as a nuclear-free state, she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said she was pleased to see
Mongolia improving and expanding relations with neighboring Russia
and China, as well as other nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Elbegdorj thanked the United States for its
support and said Albright's visit will advance the
Mongolian-U.S. ties. The United States and Mongolia established
diplomatic relations in January 1987.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to expand relations in political, economic,
scientific and cultural sectors, and explored the possibility of
cooperation in environment protection.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction over their cooperation in the
defense area, such as programs for non-combative trainings and
disaster relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is here for a nine-hour stay starting Saturday
morning, also met Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and
Tadnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, chairman of the Great Hural, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
She is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Mongolia
since former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's visits in
August 1990 and July 1991.
</P>
<P>
The United States supports the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank to extend preferential loans to Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Begins Shuttle Diplomacy in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
Saturday insisted on the demand for international recognition of
his regime in northern Cyprus as U.S. presidential envoy Richard
Holbrooke began a shuttle diplomacy to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting with Holbrooke in Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia, Denktash said a
statement made by the U.S. envoy on Friday is "irrelevant."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told reporters upon his arrival here Friday night
that neither the U.S., nor the U.N. and the European Union (EU)
can recognize the Denktash's breakaway state, unilaterally
declared in 1983 and recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Holbrooke has to say things diplomatically but we are not
going to change our position," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
"We exist and we are going to exist as Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if you want Cyprus to be united, two states are
ready to unite. If not, Cyprus be divided."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north in 1974 after Turkey landed
troops on the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Denktash walked out of the U.N.-led peace talks to protest a
European Union decision to open accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he will not return to the negotiating
table, unless the peace talks are conducted between "two states,"
instead of two communities.
</P>
<P>
After his 90-minute meeting with Denktash, Holbrooke came to
the Greek Cypriot side of Nicosia to have a working lunch with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides. He is expected to meet
Denktash again after discussions with Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Holbrooke has brought here a
formula for talks with the two Cypriot community leaders in an
effort to break the current deadlock in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Visits Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
that "computer technology has revolutionized every aspect of
American industry" during a visit to Silicon Valley on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks not in a computer company, but in Therma Inc.,
a maker of air conditioning and heating equipment.
</P>
<P>
The president told sheet metal workers that their firm has
proved that "Silicon Valley's economic revolution does not just
include computer programming." The firm's biggest customers are in
the computer industry and biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has been on a four-day visit to California devoted
mostly to raising two million U.S. dollars at three political
fund-raisers and spending time with daughter Chelsea, a freshman
at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
While speaking in Therma Inc., he urged Congress to approve the 18
billion dollars to replenish the International Monetary Fund. He told
the workers that U.S. exports played a significant role in America's
economy, and that they could sag if foreign economies experience a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of U.S. exports go to Asia, he said. "(The Asian
countries) are an important part of our future," he said, "And I
think we ought to pay our fair share to the IMF."
</P>
<P>
California, America's first trillion-dollar economy, has strong
economic and trade ties with Asia and is likely to suffer more than
the rest of the country from a slowdown in sales to Asia and visits
from Asian tourists.

<P>
WARSAW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksande
Kwasniewski on Friday welcomed the U.S. Senate's approval of the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Kwasniewski also thanked Clinton for his supports in Poland's bid
for NATO membership, the Polish Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After a fierce debate, the U.S. Senate on Thursday voted 80-19
to approve funding for NATO's eastward expansion, with Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic as first group of its new members.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said the
U.S. senate's approval of NATO expansion means that there is only
one step left for Poland to join the Western military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Poland's NATO membership, he said, will help its bargaining
into the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Polish entry into NATO is not directed against Russia, its
former ally in the now defunct Warsaw pact group, the prime
minister stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops have
killed 68 rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in
the current military operations in eastern and southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported on Saturday
that with the support of the Turkish warplanes and Cobra
helicopters, about 40,000 Turkish government troops took part in
the military operations codenamed "Murat" in the provinces of
Diyarbakir, Bingol and Mus starting from April 25.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Turkish security forces killed five
of a group of PKK militants at Cudi mountain and Deytussebap town
of Sirnak province, who infiltrated into the Turkey from northern
Iraq, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are around 4,800 PKK
guerrillas involved in the separatist war, 2,300 in eastern and
southeastern Turkey and 2,500 in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels, who have sheltered in northern Iraq, often
cross into Turkey to attack Turkish military and civilian targets
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old bloody war against the
Turkish government in an attempt to establish an independent
"Republic of Kurdistan" in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 people, including PKK rebels, government
soldiers and civilians have been killed in armed conflicts since

<HEADLINE> Euro Trading to Begin Next Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Trading in Europe's new single
currency will begin on Monday as a United States bank and a Dutch
one have offered to quote prices in the euro.
</P>
<P>
Citibank, the world's largest foreign exchange operator, and
ABN-AMRO said that they had planned to quote prices in the euro for
their clients starting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The founder countries of the euro, as the new single currency is
known, are scheduled to adopt new currency while banks and exchanges
will start using euro in all scriptural transactions such as writing
checks, using credit and charge cards, and buying bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
Euro bank notes and coins will become legal tender on January 1,
2002 while national currencies of the euro founder countries stop
circulating completely by July 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The two banks' announcement to offer an unofficial market in the
new single currency before it effectively comes into existence shows a
strong sign that the financial markets have fully accepted the launch
of the euro.
</P>
<P>
The European summit at heads of state and government level is
scheduled to confirm which European Union member states are
eligible to become the original members of the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Both the European Parliament and the European council of
economy and finance ministers have approved the recommendation of
the European Commission that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and
Finland be the founding countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is serving the rotating presidency of the
15-nation European Union, and Denmark have opted out of the euro
club whereas Greece and Sweden have been judged by the commission
not economically ready to join in.
</P>
<P>
Once confirmed by Saturday's summit of European heads of state and
government, the 11 euro countries will have to prepare to put 70
billion euro into circulation while pool another 50 billion euro in
the reserve to make the new money impregnable against speculators.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of introducing the euro is estimated to be at 1
to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product of the 11 euro
countries.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African Generals to Face TRC Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing chief of the South
African National Defense Force Georg Meiring and retired army
general Kat Liebenberg will face hearing of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
The two apartheid-era military generals will be questioned on
Monday at a closed-door session in Cape Town on a 1993 raid in
which five sleeping children were killed, said sources from TRC,
a special court authorized by the government led by President
Nelson Mandela, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The raid was carried out by the then apartheid military on a
house in Umtata, Eastern Cape, which was wrongly believed to be a
base of the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), an
anti-apartheid guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
Meiring and Liebenberg will be questioned on all operational
orders and instructions to the 12-member team which carried out
the raid on October 8 1993, TRC official Dumisa Ntsebeza said.
</P>
<P>
The TRC also wants the two generals to name the people
involved in the planning of the operation and to provide details
of intelligence reports that led to the operation.
</P>
<P>
Ntsebeza said that a police sergeant, Thapelo Mbelo, gave
testimony on the Umtata raid to a closed TRC inquiry last month.
Mbelo was involved in intensive police investigations into APLA
activities at that time.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Building Industry Grows by 4.2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Building Industries
Federation South Africa (Bifsa) has reported a 4.2 percent growth
rate in real terms for the building industry during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Figures recently released from the South African Reserve Bank
revealed that the total turnover reached 21.5 billion Rand (4.3
billion U.S. Dollars) in nominal terms, 11.9 percent up than in
1996, Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Ian Robinson, executive director of Bifsa, said in a statement
that the residential sector had shown no real growth in the
10-billion-Rand (two-billion-Dollar) turnover, whereas the
non-residential sector rose by eight percent in real terms, with
a total turnover of just over 11 billion Rand (2.2 billion
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not say when the statement was made.
</P>
<P>
There was a gradual decline during the four quarters of 1997,
with growth in the third and fourth quarters stabilizing. A much
lower growth rate is evident when compared to the same periods in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry has since 1980 accounted for almost
half the total gross domestic fixed investment. However, since
the middle of 1991, and particularly during the past six years,
there has been a steady decline to where it now stands at 35
percent of the total fixed investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this change has been a result of
significant advances in information technology in the machinery
and equipment sector from just above 30 percent to 50 percent in
17 years.

handled a total of 250,000 TEU containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The port, constructed in the early 1980s, was formerly a major
transit port linking the international and domestic
markets. Ningbo Port was transformed into one of the nation's
largest container docks in the early 1990s, and has since served
as a transit port for containers destined for Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Local port authorities have placed priority on improving port
facilities and services for container shipping.
</P>
<P>
The port has introduced ocean-going shipping services in recent
years in cooperation with various domestic and international
shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo Port has opened three regular container shipping routes
to ports in Europe and the Americas.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rights Group Urges Laws Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Africa Human Rights
Commission (SAHRC) has expressed concern about pornography on the
Internet, saying it will ask parliament to make stricter laws to
curb the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
SAHRC spokesperson Anne Routier said at the weekend that
pornography on the Internet had arisen because it appeared that
neither current nor coming legislation dealt expressly with
distribution of pornographic material through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The commission was extremely concerned about the abuse and
violation of children for pornographic purposes and condemned the
use of the Internet for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
Given the increased use of the Internet as both communications
and entertainment channel, and also the relatively easy access to
the net for both children and adults, this aspect of the law
requires urgent attention," Routier said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition National Party in the country also
made complaints about child pornography circulated on the
Internet.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Hebei Province Favor Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Wang Junhuai, a farmer in north
China's Hebei Province, presses a few keys on his new personal
computer and finds answers appearing on the screen. That is how
Wang manages his small business.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a good hand at computer technology, is a farmer living in
the Liuxinzhuang Village in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City,
capital of Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"I save a lot of time in managing my own business with this PC
586, and don't need thick account books any more. I turn on the
computer, and everything is clear," Wang said proudly.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 31 other families in his village have bought
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
But Wang Libin, another villager, had to persuade his parents
to buy a computer with money set aside for indoor decoration.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to learn more skills and techniques; that is why I
bought this computer," he said. With this computer, Wang, who
works in a village-run factory, helped his factory solve many
problems.
</P>
<P>
However, his colleague, Wang Su'e, bought a computer for her
child in 1996. She hopes the computer will be able to help her
child improve his studies with a set of educational software.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth the money only if the computer is helpful to my
child's study," she said.
</P>
<P>
The young men in the village interested in computers have
formed a society to learn the technology, said Wang Xueping,
deputy secretary of the village's committee of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The village has also decided to take out some money to allow
their computers to be connected with the Internet. The village
last year reported a net income of 260 million yuan, with the
annual income per capita reaching 5,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
More and more personal computers will enter the well-to-do
farmers' families with rapid development in the rural economy,
said Shi Yuzhen, an official in charge of the administration of
computers in the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Hebei Province bought nearly 100,000 PCs last year,
which created a big potential market for computer manufacturers,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Foreign Minister on Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- As their relations expand rapidly,
Kazakhstan and China in recent years have deepened cooperation in
all areas, said Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
The advance of the Kazakh-Chinese relations -- political,
economic and trade -- has been smooth as it is blessed by leaders
of both countries, Tokayev told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The two sides entered into a new era of bilateral economic
cooperation last September with the signing of an agreement to
work more closely in the oil sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
That accord was forged during then Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing's visit to Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
As a latest development, the foreign minister said, extensive
preparation work for Kazakh Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbaev's
visit to China is currently under way.
</P>
<P>
The China tour, scheduled to begin next Thursday, is expected
to forge more cooperation agreements and bring fresh momentum for
the Kazakh-Chinese ties, said Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
And a summit meeting of Kazakhstan, China, Russia, Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan here this summer will further the cooperative ties
among the five countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, he predicted, will be fruitful and beneficial to
the peace and stability of the region.

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Furor Looming Between Zimbabwe, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A diplomatic furor is looming
between Zimbabwe and Britain following the latter's organization
of a private meeting with 14 selected Zimbabweans to discuss a
new strategy for future British aid to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Normally, bilateral aid packages are discussed at
government-to-government level. But none of the 14 invitees to
the Thursday meeting which was organized by the British
Department for International Development in Harare directly
represent the government, The Herald daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The situation has raised serious concern in the Zimbabwean
government, which feels the British government has breached the
code of international relations and basic diplomatic etiquette,
diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
"By circumventing the government, the British are indirectly
sending a very strong message that they have lost confidence in
the capacity of the present government to interpret its needs and
therefore those of its people," one source said, adding that it
would be justifiable for the government to think that relations
were no longer state to state.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it very difficult for the government to have a
smooth working relationship with the British High Commission,"
another source said.
</P>
<P>
Recently the British were reported to have had second thoughts
about honoring last year's agreement with the Zimbabwean
government in which they promised a grant aid of more than 200
million Zimbabwean Dollars (over 11 million U.S. Dollars) for the
purchase of 1,500 land rovers for the Zimbabwe republic police.
</P>
<P>
After their own assessment, the British side has predicted
political instability in Zimbabwe, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to a letter to the invitees, most of whom with no
known constituencies, the workshop would be the first in a series
planned to obtain views of Zimbabweans on the "issues and
priorities" for British aid over the next few years. The process
of defining the new aid strategy to Zimbabwe is scheduled to be
completed by September.
</P>
<P>
"We will be revising our aid to Zimbabwe. The new strategy
will be prepared on the basis of extensive consultations in
Zimbabwe, both with the government and non-governmental
representatives," read the letter.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
refused to comment on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Increases Minimum Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has raised
the general minimum wages in industrial and agricultural sectors
by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Labor Day celebrations here Friday, Labor
Minister Joseph Ngutu said the hike would help cushion workers'
purchasing power against inflation, local press reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But workers in the country demanded the amendment of the
current wage guidelines to give their respective unions the
leeway to negotiate for up to 100 percent compensation for lost
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Ngutu told workers at the rally that the government was
examining the possibility of discarding current practice which
pegs salary increases to the cost of living and attaching it to
productivity and the forces of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The government is in the process of establishing a
productivity enhancement and measurement center to research and
advise on how to raise productivity in the labor market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On child labor, the minister said a Children Bill would be
introduced in Parliament to strengthen the legislative protection
of children in the country.
</P>
<P>
He announced that a National Council of Children Services
would be set up to supervise, control and coordinate all child
welfare activities and advise the government on aspects of the
welfare of children.

<P>
CHENGDU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in southwest
China's Sichuan Province has achieved rapid progress thanks to the
local government's preferential policies to encourage private
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the number of self-employed people increased
by six percent in 1997 and privately owned businesses increased 23
percent.

yuan, increasing by 37.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Privately owned enterprises generated 15.6 billion yuan of
industrial value, up 20 percent, and 8.4 billion yuan of sales
turnover, an increase of 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Training Managers of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has launched an extensive training program to teach
management skills in business administration, marketing and sales
to state-owned enterprise managers.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to train managers of local state-owned enterprises
and their replacements, who will be able to help the state economy
take off within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, which has nearly 10 percent of the country's medium-
and large-sized state-owned enterprises, is China's oldest
industrial production center. Many local state-owned enterprises
are suffering losses.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of qualified managers is one of the factors in the
losses, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
They said that Liaoning will have 1,000 enterprise management
personnel study for master's degrees in business administration,
train 2,000 licensed accountants, and develop a 10,000-member
sales and marketing team.
</P>
<P>
Managers of 1,000 local medium- and large-size state-owned
enterprises and 10,000 managers of non-state sector firms will
receive at least a three-month training program of business
administration before the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 managers of state-owned enterprises have finished
their training courses and returned to their jobs.

HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six Zimbabweans have died of
cholera since February this year, while 744 others are suspected
of having been infected with the disease, The Herald daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases were reported in Manicaland and Masvingo
provinces in south Zimbabwe while five cases were in the capital
Harare.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare has
discouraged large gatherings in areas without adequate safe water
and sanitary facilities to curb the spread of cholera.
</P>
<P>
"All organizations wishing to hold large gatherings, including
funerals in the affected areas, should apply for clearance from
their provincial medical directorate," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is caused by drinking contaminated water and eating
dirty food. The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare has since
launched a campaign to discourage people from eating cold and raw
food.
</P>
<P>
The campaign by the ministry also encourages people to use
public toilets and to increase their quantities of fluids if they
suspect having cholera.

<P>
CHENGDU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The dam of the Ertan Hydropower
Station located on the lower reaches of the Yalong River in
southwest China's Sichuan Province was locked on Friday to start
water storage.
</P>
<P>
In the following seven days, a 10-km-long river course starting
from the dam will have no water flow, and after that the sluice
gates will be lifted to let water flow in. By late June, the water
level of the reservoir is expected to get to 1,155 meters high,
which will enable electricity generating.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts conducted examinations last month on the
reservoir's preparation work for water storage, including
vegetation clearing and environmental protection. They agreed the
hydropower plant is ready for water storage.
</P>
<P>
A power generating unit with a capacity of 550,000 kw, the
first among the six in total, is now under installation and
tests. It is scheduled to generate electricity in July.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan Hydropower Project, built on the tributary of the
Yangtze River and near Panzhihua City, is the second largest of
its kind in China next to the Three Gorges Project.

<HEADLINE> Trade Fair to Help Open Up Central, Western China to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A trade fair on economic and
technical cooperation scheduled for October is designed to
introduce China's central and western regions to the world, said
Li Haifeng, vice-director of the Office of Overseas Chinese
Affairs of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fair sponsored by the office and the Hunan
provincial government October 17-20, Li said the event signals the
central government's support for economic development and the
opening-up of the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
"The competition in economic and technological fields and the
overall national strength in international markets is becoming
more fierce, especially after the Southeast Asia financial
crisis. This has made China's efforts to attract overseas
investment more difficult," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the trade fair, to be held in Changsha, Hunan's
provincial capital, can be approved by the State Council
illustrates China's resolve to develop the economy in a sustained
manner and to continue to vigorously attract overseas investment."
</P>
<P>
Li is upbeat about China's prospects for attracting overseas
investment, pointing to China's stable political situation and
sound economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
She said the projected trade fair is designed to promote the
participation of foreign businesses and overseas Chinese, as well
as investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, a similar fair in 1996 in Zhengzhou was a
great success, drawing over 6.9 billion US dollars of investment
to central and western regions by investors from more than 30
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Suffers Forex Shortage and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Rong Shoujun)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is suffering a critical
shortage of foreign exchange and the currency Kwacha has been
depreciating drastically.
</P>
<P>
This will hinder the country in its effort to realize its
targeted 5.5 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Kwacha continues depreciating in the past four
months, falling steadily in value from 1,330 last December to an
average of 1,950 per U.S. Dollar late this week at most of the
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia's foreign reserves have declined to the
lowest level in the past eleven months, and could only meet about
seven weeks of national import requirements in case of a
disaster, according to the latest weekly newspaper Financial
Times.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's reserves, which reached 255 million U.S. Dollars last
September and dropped to 237 million U.S. Dollars three months
later, fell further to 165 million U.S. Dollars in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's gross domestic product can only
grow by about 3.5 percent instead of the estimated 5.5 percent,
an earlier economic report released by the Barclays Bank (Zambia)
said.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of foreign exchange and constant depreciation of
the Kwacha can be attributed to the country's huge debt
servicing, lack of balance of payment support, unexpected
importation of food as well as the failure of the privatized
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the country's biggest
foreign exchange earner and supplier.
</P>
<P>
Zambia spent 208 million U.S. Dollars last year and another 40
million U.S. Dollars between January and April this year to serve
its foreign debt which now stands at 7.1 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country has also not been receiving balance of payment
support since the foiled military coup last October and the
subsequent detention of opposition leaders, which has drastically
tarnished Lusaka's international image.
</P>
<P>
And the Zambian government has imported 250,000 tons of maize
and mealie meal worth of 40 million U.S. Dollars since last
October to deal with the food shortage due to bad harvest in the
1997/1998 season.
</P>
<P>
Finally, ZCCM's failure to constantly supply foreign exchange
also worsens the situation. ZCCM had not released any funds
until last week when it supplied 20 million U.S. Dollars which is
not enough for the market.
</P>
<P>
However, ZCCM can not be blamed because the conglomerate
itself now faces great operational difficulties and the copper
price has remained low on the world market.
</P>
<P>
To straighten out the situation, the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) is
determined to take measures, Jacob Mwanza, governor of the
central bank, revealed to journalists at a news conference held
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The governor announced that BOZ will siphon the excess Kwacha
from circulation to lessen the demand on foreign currency in
order to curb the continous depreciation of the Kwacha and
stabilize the country's foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, local reports quoted a senior BOZ official
as saying that the central bank is inclined to take control
measures on foreign exchange, but the reports were denied later
by the bank.
</P>
<P>
Whether the central bank of Zambia can effectively deal with
the present situation without huge inflows of foreign currency,
and whether the reduction of Kwacha's supply can help eventually
and fundamentally to diversify the high demand of foreign
exchange, remain to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong, Haven for Drug Trafficking: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's largest port city
Chittagong has turned into one of the outposts on the world's
busiest route for drugs and narcotics trafficking, the latest
issue of Observer Magazine available here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 700 kilograms of narcotics are being illegally
exported out of Bangladesh through the port every year, the
magazine quoted the Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong port had shot up in importance as clearing center of
drugs and narcotics in Southeast Asia, it said.
</P>
<P>
Narcotics wrapped in paper make their passage into Chittagong
mainly from poppy growing fields of northern Myanmar which is
called South Asian's "Golden Triangle", the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar drugs get passed to the port through the Chittagong
Hill Tracts, it said, adding a considerable quantity of drugs and
narcotics also reaches Chittagong route from Afghanistan, Pakistan
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of narcotics and drugs that pour into Chittagong
through traffickers finally get dispatched by sea onto the West
and America, and the crew of ships usually act as drug carriers
from Chittagong port.
</P>
<P>
The DNC in Chittagong seized 30 kilograms of narcotics over
past three years and over 50 persons were rounded up on charge of
drugs trafficking in the period, and the sea customs also
separately hauled a considerable quantity of drugs in the past,
the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh's customs authorities and the DNC appear
unable to deal with the staggering drug traffickers mainly for
lack of expertise knowledge on narcotics, effective intelligence
network and transports.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi officials concerned have called for introducing
specialized training for staff to deal with this increasing menace
of drug trafficking.

<P>
Water levels in Vietnam's hydro-power plants are at record lows
due to the severe drought. This year's water flow into dams by
mid-April was only 69 percent of last year.

<HEADLINE> Dengue Fever Spreads Quickly in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever, a cholera-like
disease, had affected 16 provinces in Indonesia as of April 30,
killing at least 531 people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The present spread of the disease is very fast and two weeks
ago only 11 provinces were affected, Dr. Thomas Suroso, director
general of communicable disease and environmental health, and Dr.
P.R. Arbani, regional advisor on malaria with the World Health
Organization, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over 19,000 people have contracted the disease, which broke out
in January this year. Experts predicted that it is expected to
peak over May and June, but continued community awareness of the
disease should prevent it from claiming more victims.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, has been worst hit by dengue
fever this year. As of April 30, the dengue epidemic had killed 62
people in the city, said Suroso.
</P>
<P>
Arbani said Jakarta's high population makes it very susceptible
to dengue fever. "In fact, the current dengue fever epidemic has
hit other parts of the globe. The wave of the disease has spread
in Thailand, Myanmar and some countries in South America," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, acute tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes,
leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains in the joints
and back.
</P>
<P>
Last year, dengue fever killed 240 people and affected 13,207
others in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Expatriate Workers Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The total number of new expatriate
workers from January to March this year was 35,125 in comparison
to 31,982 for the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Of this figure, nearly 25,000 persons had been recruited by
agencies approved by the Sri Lankan Bureau of Foreign Employment
(SLBFE) while the balance had found jobs on their own, probably
through friends and relatives, SLBFE sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka received 65 billion rupees (1.08 billion U.S.
dollars) in foreign exchange by way of remittances from expatriate
workers in 1997 compared to 46 billion rupees (770 million
dollars) in 1996, an increase of over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SLBFE is set up to provide 200,000 new jobs abroad in this
year. In this context, the SLBFE has already taken initiatives to
find new job markets in countries such as Malaysia and Singapore,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are about one million Sri Lankan workers
overseas, of whom 600,000-700,000 are in the Middle East and more
than 70 percent are reportedly females.

<P>
BELGRADE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The way out of the Kosovo crisis is
to give high cultural autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Albanians,
Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian deputy prime minister and leader of
the Serbian Radical Party (SRP), said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Seselj as saying, when
interviewed by a Russian television station, that Kosovo ethnic
Albanians could have their own cultural autonomous bodies, but
couldn't establish their own government.
</P>
<P>
Seselj proposed that the Kosovo local authorities institute a
two-chamber system in order to prevent the Kosovo ethnic Albanians
having overwhelming majority in regional votes.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for a senior Yugoslav leader to
publicly clarify his beliefs on solving the Kosovo issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- As many as 1,800 private companies
in Indonesia have reported their foreign debts worth between 63
billion and 64 billion U.S. dollars to Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The number of private companies reporting their debts has
increased after the government obliged every private firm which
has foreign debts to report to Bank Indonesia, Chairman of the
Team for Private Corporate Debts Radius, said here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Of Indonesia's offshore debts amounting to 133.687 billion U.S.
dollars by April 1998, 67.686 billion dollars were corporate
debts.
</P>
<P>
"Banks' debts should also be addressed as they could hamper
economic activities and bank facilities. Therefore, we still need
much time to settle the trade financing affairs," Radius said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian debtors are scheduled to meet with their foreign
creditors in Tokyo on May 8-10 to discuss the settlement of the
country's external corporate debts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We begin to talk about a strategy we are going to use in
settling the corporate debts, including bank debts," he added.
</P>
<P>
The huge amount of corporate debts is one of the reasons of the
depreciation of the Indonesian currency rupiah.

SHENYANG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment will continue
to increase in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province, even though Asian investors might reduce investments in
the city because of the Southeast Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The city expects to attract one billion US dollars of overseas
investment this year, with 400 more foreign-funded enterprises put
into operation.
</P>
<P>
The city approved 742 foreign-funded projects last year, and
overseas cash flow into the city reached 868 million US dollars
in 1997, up 40 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of the new contractual overseas investment
will come this year, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Shenyang will turn to Europe, North
America and Australia to seek potential investors. Meanwhile, it
will cooperate extensively with well-known multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang plans to select 172 medium- and large-sized
state-owned enterprises, and eight-to-10 private businesses for
cooperation with overseas investors, and support them to explore
international markets.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Praises Government's Euro Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
Friday praised the work of the center-left government and the
goverment's opposition which helped Italy enter the European
single currency.
</P>
<P>
At a May Day ceremony in the presidential Quirinal Palace,
Scalfaro said the road towards the single currency began with
"tragic conditions" in 1992 when bouts of currency speculation
drove the Italian lira out of the European exchange rate mechanism
and into devaluation.
</P>
<P>
It would be unimaginable for Italy to enter the euro system as
a founding member without the positive and efficient work of the
government, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that the government still had many
difficulties, such as high unemployment and the national debt, to
deal with after its entry into the euro system.
</P>
<P>
Of Italy's public debt, which is still of special concern to
Germany and the Netherlands, Scalfaro said: "We know this and have
never denied it."
</P>
<P>
Italy has a debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of 121.6
percent, much higher than the EU's suggested ratio of less than 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The president said he was moved by the historic occasion of the
euro's arrival and reaffirmed that the single currency was only
the first step towards a Europe of the European people, "people
who can finally unite and say no to war in a century which has
seen so many tears and so much blood".
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament approved Thursday the European
Commission's recommendation for 11 countries to join the single
currency mechanism in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, recommended that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland
be the founding countries of the single currency, the
euro.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Upgrades Water Supply Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a major port city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has significantly improved
urban water supply networks and facilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city achieved a daily water supply capacity of 1.2 million
cu.m. following the 1997 completion of the third phase of a
project to divert water from a local river. Nonetheless, the water
supply capacity in urban areas has remained inefficient due to
ageing water supply pipelines and pressurized water pumping
stations.
</P>
<P>
The new upgrading project will be carried out at a total
investment of 1.19 billion yuan, including a Japanese loan
totalling 5.5 billion Japanese yen, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The project will include the construction of a water pumping
plant with a daily production capacity of 300,000 cu.m, a water
purification plant capable with a daily capacity of 400,000 cubic
meters and the installation of a 89.1-km water supply pipeline
with a diameter of 1.82 meters, as well as the introduction of new
treatment processes to the city's two existing water supply
pipelines. The project will be completed over a five year period.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the project will provide Dalian with annual
savings of 22.7 million yuan on power bills. The savings will
accrue from changing outdated multiple pressure water supplies to
a single pressure system. In addition, the city's daily water
supply capacity will rise from 1.2 million cu.m. to 1.31 million
cubic meters.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 25,000 Cambodians, mostly Khmer
Rouge dependents, crossed into the northeastern areas of Thailand
Friday when Cambodian government forces launched an attack at the
base of the guerrillas at Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Bangkok Post quoted Thai military sources as saying
that Anlong Veng, the headquarters of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas
led by Ta Mok, was completely controlled by government forces at
about noon time Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the Cambodian government forces pushing for Anlong Veng,
thousands of Khmer Rouge dependents began to gather near Sangam
Pass on the Thai-Cambodian border late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thai troops manning a gate at Sangam Pass allowed the Cambodian
civilians to enter Friday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, estimated at about 25,000, were later moved to a
site and would be allowed temporary stay, probably only a few days
before they are sent back across the border to the care of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Thai
military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government has contacted the Thai military,
saying they had asked the UNHCR to take care of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Thai military sources said a camp would be set up on the
Cambodian soil to accommodate the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government also assured Thai military that the
Khmer Rouge dependents would be safe once they are back and they

<HEADLINE> New Machine for Cutting Metal Saves Energy, More Efficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua)-- A Chinese scientist has developed a
petrol-driven metal dicing machine that can replace the widely
used oxyacetylene metal-cutting machine.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe the patented petrol-driven machine is the
world's most advanced for metal dicing in terms of energy-saving.
</P>
<P>
The development of the machine had been a state major research
program in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
If 200,000 petrol-driven cutting machines were used in Chinese
factories, 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) would be saved
each year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The machine, developed by Zhong Gonglue, 38-year-old board
chairman of the Beijing Gonglue Zhonggong Petrol-Driven Dicing
Technology Company, can also make the metal dicing process safer.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the metal utilization ratio will be improved
from 65 percent to 85 percent because of the more accurate
character of the machine.
</P>
<P>
The petrol-driven dicing process also reduceds pollution.
</P>
<P>
Acetylene has been the main source of thermal cutting for a
long time. It not only causes environmental pollution but also
consumes more energy.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based company has signed contracts with a venture
in Beijing and others in four provinces to jointly produce the
machine.

HAVANA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds-of-thousands of Cubans
paraded on Friday in celebration of International Workers' Day,
vowing support for socialism and protesting the embargo by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Paraders waved national flags and banners with slogans backing
socialism and condemning the U.S. embargo as they marched in the
main parade in Havana's Revolution Square. The parade was reviewed
by President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the parade, Pedro Ross Leal, general secretary
of the official trade union, Central de Trabajadores de Cuba
(CTC), gave a speech demanding the total and unconditional end to
the 36-year U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The only ethical thing to do is to totally and unconditionally
lift the blockade," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CTC leader said Cuban workers were determined to continue
resisting until they defeated "the criminal economic war" imposed
by the U.S.. He called it an "inhuman attempt to annihilate an
entire people through hunger and illness."
</P>
<P>
He said the parade was also in celebration of the United
Nations' rejection of a U.S. draft resolution on alleged human
rights violations in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Return Nazi Camp Commander to Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will allow the
extradition of former World War II concentration camp commander
Dinko Sakic to Croatia, where he is to face trial for war crime
charges, justice sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The former Nazi officer has told an Argentine federal judge
that he would not contest the extradition order.
</P>
<P>
Sakic was arrested Thursday in Santa Teresita town, Buenos
Aires province, after Croatia formally requested his extradition
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government accused Sakic of committing crimes
against humanity when he headed the Jasenovac camp in Croatia
between 1942 and 1943.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Jews, Serbs and Gypsies died at the camp when
Sakic was commander, according to the National Institute Against
Discrimination and Xenophobia of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Sakic was found guilty of war crimes in 1946 by a special
commission of the former Yugoslavia, but escaped to Argentina in
1947 and has lived there since.
</P>
<P>
He was identified in early April by a group of journalists
during an interview on local television. They alerted the
authorities about the presence of the alleged war criminal in
Argentina.

CHANGCHUN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The local branch of the China
International Travel Agency in Ji'an City, northeast China's Jilin
Province, Friday reopened three tourist routes to several cities
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The new tour itineraries resulted from agreement reached
between the Chinese travel agency and the International Travel
Agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), said
Yu Yang, director of the Ji'an City Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The three routes to Pyongyang and other areas were initially
opened in 1992, but were discontinued last October due to the
harsh winter climate in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Dandong in Liaoning Province, and Ji'an, Tumen and Changbai in
Jilin Province engage in related business activities. However,
travel groups bound for Pyongyang are required to depart from
Dandong or Ji'an.

<P>
Tens of thousands of domestic tourists visit China's
neighboring country on an annual basis.

<P>
MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A provincial governor who is seeking
a second term under the banner of the ruling party has survived an
assassination attempt in Surigao del Sur province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer Saturday reported that governor Primo
Murillo were ambushed Friday morning in Lingig town by armed men
in the 26th election-related violence recorded by the police. He
survived while his four escorts were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Chief superintendent Manuel Raval, regional office director of
the Philippine National Police, said Murillo was ambushed by
members of the New People's Army, a rebel group operating in the
south.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling Lakas-NUCD party said the attempt was
"politically motivated and could have been perpetrated by the
governor's rivals in the opposition".
</P>
<P>
Sixteen candidates running for various local positions have
been killed so far in the run-up to the May 11 elections. It is
believed that more cases of violence would happen during the
election period.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 presidential elections, at least 100 people were
killed in election-related violence.

LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Welshman Mark Williams came from
behind to take a 13-11 lead over defending champion Ken Doherty
in their world snooker championship semi-final in Sheffield on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final tie, world number two John Higgins
stunned Ronnie O'Sullivan by winning all eight frames in their
second session.
</P>
<P>
Finding himself on the wrong end of a 6-2 scoreline at the
start of play, Williams powered back against the Irish champion
by winning 11 of the 16 frames.
</P>
<P>
Williams reeled off the last three frames of the first session
to level at 8-8 and took the first four frames after the
resumption in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Doherty pulled three frames back but he was unable to end the
night on level terms. Williams produced a frame-winning break of
56 and needs just four of Saturday's nine frames to reach the
final.
</P>
<P>
After resuming at 4-4, Higgins put on a dazzling display to
end the day 12-4 ahead and needing just five more frames to win
through to his first world championship final.
</P>
<P>
Higgins will knock fellow Scotsman Stephen Hendry off the top

<HEADLINE> More U.S. High School Graduates Go to College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A record 67 percent of high
school graduates last Spring attended college in the fall as more
and more young people want to be prepared for the 21st century,
the U.S. Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The need for advanced training was one factor drawing more
students into colleges, universities and community colleges, the
Department said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that a record 70.3 percent of female high school
graduates enrolled in college, part of a longer growth trend for
women.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to see that more and more of our young people
see a college degree as more than just a piece of paper, but
rather as the ticket to success in the 21st Century," said Labor
Secretary Alexis M. Herman.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2.8 million members of the high school class of 1997,
nearly 1.9 million were enrolled in college. Among them, 1.7
million were enrolled full-time and nearly two-thirds were in
four-year institutions.
</P>
<P>
Of the male graduates, 63.5 percent were enrolled in college in
October 1997, a rate that could be compared to the Vietnam-era
level of 63.2 percent for men in 1968, when college enrollment was
a way to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
The department recorded that college enrollment of male and
female high school graduates was 54 percent and 38 percent
respectively in the 1960s. The percentages dropped in the 1970s
and remained flat in the early 1980s, but started to pick up in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that among the young people aged 16 to
24, the unemployment rate was 20 percent for those who had not
graduated from high school, compared with 11 percent for those
with a high school diploma and 2.1 percent for those with a
college degree.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday signed an emergency spending bill that would fund U.S.
military operations in the Gulf and Bosnia as well as domestic
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton criticized lawmakers, who approved the bill
Thursday night, for not including money to pay the nation's U.N.
debt and support the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to pay our fair share to the IMF. I don't
care what other political business is going on in Washington,"
Clinton said from California, where he traveled to conduct some
political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
The emergency spending bill provides a total of 6 billion U.S.
dollars for the spendings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had sent Congress the bill that also included 1 billion
dollars for back U.N. dues and 18 billion dollars for helping the
IMF to replenish loan funds depleted by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
But because conservatives have problems with the IMF and U.N.,
Congress stripped them from the emergency legislation and will
deal with them separately.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Down Against Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, Mary 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell Friday
against a strengthening mark as the German currency benefited from
the European Union's move to name 11 countries to participate in
its new single currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the yen as Japanese reports continued to
show a weakening economy.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the U.S. currency also was changing
hands at 1.7799 marks, down from 1.7957. The dollar was also
quoted at 133.13 yen, up from 132.72 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the mark rallied on the belief that EU heads of
state will agree on who will be the first president of the
European central bank as well as naming the eleven member
countries to Economic and Monetary Union next year. It is
believed that former Dutch central banker Wim Duisenberg might
get the seat.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also affected by U.S. data that indicated the
economy continued growing at a moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, economic reports released Thursday and Friday showed a
worsening economy.
</P>
<P>
Average wages and household spending in Japan fell in March,
with salaries falling for the first time in four years, the Labor
Ministry reported.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also strengthened on reports that Japan's foreign
reserves had fallen nearly 18 billion U.S. dollars, mainly because
of intervention last month to prop up the yen.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.4890 Swiss francs, down from 1.5010; 5.9745 French
francs, down from 6.1065; 1,759.75 Italian lire, down from
1,772.45; and 1.4346 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4316.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6681 dollars, down from
1.6725 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis C Infect Over 170 Million Worldwide: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 170 million people
worldwide have been infected by hepatitis C but no vaccine has
been available yet, said the World Health Organization (WHO) here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is now estimated that about 80 percent of acutely infected
patients progress to chronic hepatitis, that about 20 percent of
these chronic infections develop cirrhosis, and that one percent
to five percent of cirrhotic individuals will develop
hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) during the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, active immunization against hepatitis C
will not be possible until early next century, WHO said in press
release issued after an expert meeting at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Prevention efforts should include screening of all blood donors
and organ donors worldwide, informing health workers on the risk
and means of transmitting hepatitis C, educating school children
and others in the community about the disease, its effects and
means of stopping its spread, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, they said, it is estimated that 90
percent of cases of hepatitis C infection are in current and
former intravenous drug users and those with a history of
transfusion of unscreened blood or blood products, such as
haemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
The experts believed that unsterile injections and unscreened
blood are the predominant modes of transmission in developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> US Computer Companies Back Microsoft in Windows 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of Microsoft allies has
warned that any delay of Windows 98 operating system could hurt
businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The claim was made in a letter to the U.S. Justice Department's
antitrust division, when federal and state regulators ponder
whether to try to delay the release of Windows 98, an upgrade of
Microsoft's dominant computer-operating system.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, signed by 26 computer company executives
including those of Intel, Compaq, Del and Hewlett-Packard, the
industry leaders said that many companies in the United States
have spent millions of dollars on developing, marketing and
promoting products that depend on the on-time launch of Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft plans to ship Windows 98 to computer manufacturers in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft and Justice attorneys have been battling since last
October, when Justice accused the software giant of violating a
court agreement by requiring computer manufacturers to install its
Internet Explorer with Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
The executives said that they are not expressing an opinion on
the investigation of Microsoft. But, they said, interferring with
the release of Windows 98 would drag down the entire industry's
efforts to deliver value to customers and return to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The letter is just one of the latest developments in the debate
whether Windows open or shut the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent newspaper advertisements and meeting with the U.S.
press, Microsoft has been arguing that consumers have benefited
greatly from the constant additions to its operating system -- the
basic software that control the operation of a computer.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Microsoft has pieced together such as a
graphical user interface, memory management, built-in networking
and multimedia support, messaging, scheduling, faxing, file and
print sharing.
</P>
<P>
It indeed benefits consumers to have a number of the features
in Windows today. But as the scope of Microsoft's "integration"
has broadened, the competitors are in the danger of being
squeezing out of the market, in which they could develop those
components and innovate.
</P>
<P>
So the competitors say that Microsoft is trying to block
innovation. But Microsoft says that the competitors could focus on
other areas to "innovate."

<HEADLINE> 11 Million Childhood Death Due to Environmental Factors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- In the poorest regions of the
world today, an estimated 11 million children will not live to see
their fifth birthday, primarily because of environmentally-related
diseases, such as malaria, acute respiratory infections and
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
These are among the many sobering findings of a new report on
health and the environment worldwide, released here today jointly
by the World Resources Institute, the United Nations Environment
Program, the United Nations Development Program and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "World Resources 1998-99", said
environmental factors are still a major cause of illness and death
in many parts of the world and children are the most at risk. 25
percent of the global burden of death and disease is due to
environmental factors. Globally 1.4 billion people are exposed to
polluted air. Infectious diseases kill 17 million and malaria is on
the rise which kills between 1 and 3 million people each year.
</P>
<P>
Leslie Roberts, Editor-in-Chief of the report, said the
developing countries suffer more severe environmental problems,
but this by no means indicates that developed countries such as
thoses in North America and Europe, have no environmental
problems. In these countries, threats stem mostly from industrial
pollutants, such as air pollutants or toxic chemicals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns of Danger of Travel to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Friday warned American tourists to be very careful when traveling
in Mexico because of a worsening crime wave.
</P>
<P>
"There certainly has been a major increase in crime in Mexico,
given the economic problems that country has faced over the last
three or four years," State Department spokesman James Foley told
a briefing.
</P>
<P>
In an updated report, the State Department warned of increasing
resentment against foreigners in the southern state of Chiapas and
advised U.S. tourists to avoid engaging in activities deemed
political by Mexican authorities.
</P>
<P>
The State Department restated its earlier warnings that
tourists should "absolutely avoid" taking any taxi that was not
summoned or contracted in advance.
</P>
<P>
In March, a former Yale University art instructor, Carol Janet
Schlosberg, 30, was raped and murdered on a beach in Puerto
Escondido, a resort in the southern state of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it did not expect the travel warning
to hurt the tourism industry in Mexico, the United States' second
most important trading partner.
</P>
<P>
"If you have 20 million Americans visiting that country, it
would be a tall order to make a very big dent in those kind of
figures," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico obviously remains a very attractive tourist destination
to Americans," he added.

<HEADLINE> Dow Approaches Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied again and
charged back toward record levels Friday as investors believed that
interest rates will hold steady at more friendly economic data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 83.70 points to 9,147.07.
The Dow gained nearly 200 points in two days and less than 40
points shy of last Tuesday's closing record of 9,184.94.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues led decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 571.84 million shares as
against 693.06 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 9.26 to 1,121.01, the
Nasdaq composite index rose 5.03 to 1,873.44, and the NYSE
composite index rose 4.53 to 581.90.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.05 to
484.94, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.34
to 749.86.,
</P>
<P>
The market was supported today by a series of reports on
manufacturing, construction, and personal income and spending
reinforced arguments that the economy isn't growing at an
inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
Stocks tumbled on Monday on fears of an interest rate hike,
but the blue-chip index recovered all the lost ground after more
government data were revealed in the following days.
