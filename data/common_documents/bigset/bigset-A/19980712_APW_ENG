<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A body clad in a diving suit was found
on a beach on South Korea's east coast Sunday and the military was
investigating the possibility it was that of a North Korean spy.
	   State-run Yonhap News Agency said authorities were looking into
the possibility the body was that of an agent from a North Korean
submarine found off the east coast last month.
	   Nine bodies were found in the sub, all shot to death in what
military investigators described as a murder-suicide committed by
senior officers to avoid capture.
	   At the time, officials said they believed the nine bodies
accounted for the submarine's entire complement of six crewmen and
three espionage agents.
	   The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed that a body dressed in a
rubberized suit like that worn by skin divers was found on a beach
near Donghae, 195 kilometers (117 miles) east of Seoul.
	   A spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the military
was investigating, but declined to provide further details.

Early voter turnout up as Japan goes to polls in Parliamentary
</HEADLINE>
elections
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest voter turnout figures, comments from
voters; polls close at 1100 GMT
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters turned out in unexpectedly high numbers
early Sunday for Parliamentary elections seen as a referendum on
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's efforts to pull Japan out of its
worst recession since World War II.
	   The bigger turnout could mean trouble for Hashimoto _ analysts
have predicted that more votes could mean more protest votes will
be cast against Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   At stake are half the 252 seats in the Parliament's upper house.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats are in no danger of losing their
hold on power because of their strong majority in the lower house
and Hashimoto himself was not up for re-election.
	   But the elections are an important test of whether voters hold
Hashimoto and his party responsible for the Japan's economic
malaise. If the ruling party does poorly, Hashimoto will be under
intense pressure to resign.
	   Four hours after polls opened Sunday, 17.68 percent of Japan's
99.4 million registered voters had cast ballots, up 1.73 percentage
points from the last election, according to the Home Affairs
Ministry.
	   The elections are the first in the upper house since Hashimoto
came to power in early 1996. With record-high unemployment, rising
bankruptcies, and party members tainted by bribery scandals the
ruling party had geared up for a rough ride.
	   ``We did everything we could,'' Hashimoto was quoted as saying
Saturday night by Kyodo News as he wrapped up 17 days of
campaigning on behalf of his party. ``All we can do now is to wait
for the judgment.''
	   Opposition parties called on voters to send a message that they
are unhappy with the way Hashimoto has handled the economy.
	   At polling places Sunday some voters seem to have done just
that.
	   ``As long as the LDP is in power the economy will only get
worse,'' said Akira Nagaoka, 34, as he left a polling place in
central Tokyo.
	   Nagaoka said he supported the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition group.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then seemed
to backtrack two days later by saying the reforms wouldn't reduce
the nation's overall tax revenues.
	   He now says he supports cuts.
	   Polling was scheduled to continue until 8:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) _
two hours longer than usual due to concerns over falling voter
turnout in recent elections. The results of about 90 percent of the
races were expected by 1 a.m. Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would leave the ruling party eight
seats short of majority, forcing it to seek outside partners to
pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have distanced
themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   Other opposition parties have also had trouble capitalizing on
the LDP's sagging support.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party had 38 seats in the upper house going
into the election and polls predicted it would pick up only one
more. Kan's personal popularity has been clouded by the party's
vague stance on major issues.
	   And despite the country's recent troubles, many voters seemed
reluctant give the opposition a crack at leading Japan.
	   ``Japan needs steady policies,'' said 78-year-old salesman Kunio
Kanno, explaining why he had decided to continue supporting the
Liberal Democrats.

Indonesian leader scores big victory in ruling party

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of party reorganization, graf 7-8; ADDS
other details, background throughout
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In a major political victory for
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, the ruling party has
overwhelmingly elected a new reformist chairman and has severed
ties with former autocrat Suharto in its search for more democracy.
	   Habibie, who replaced ex-President Suharto in May, has promised
to liberalize the tightly controlled political system and hold free
elections next year for the world's fourth most populous nation now
battling its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Akbar Tanjung, a member of Habibie's Cabinet and the president's
personal choice for the party chairmanship, won 17 out of the 27
votes cast by party delegates, trouncing a rival backed by
supporters of Suharto.
	   Saturday night's election of Akbar was held at the end of a
three-day special congress of Golkar members held less than two
months after violent protests forced Suharto to step down, ending
32 years as president.
	   Habibie, a longtime Suharto Cabinet minister and friend, took
over power and has tried hard since then to dismantle much of the
old leader's authoritarian legacy.
	   Within hours of Akbar's victory, party officials said Golkar had
formally dissolved its board of patrons, headed by Suharto who lost
his position as chief patron.
	   Until now the body had been instrumental in deciding party
policy.
	   In a major reorganization of the party, announced early Sunday,
many of the old president's supporters were replaced, including two
of his wealthy children, who with their father are fighting off
allegations of corruption.
	   Suharto's eldest daughter, Tutut, a former Cabinet minister, had
been a junior party chairwoman and second son Bambang had been
party treasurer. Neither were named in a new executive line-up.
	   ``There is no place for the Suharto family in the new Golkar,''
said Sarwono Kusumaatmajda, a former environment minister.
	   During his three decades in power, Suharto blatantly used Golkar
to dominate a largely symbolic form of parliamentary democracy that
legitimized his authoritarian rule.
	   Some have speculated that he had wanted to maintain his
influence within Golkar to protect his family's huge business
interests in the face of an ongoing corruption investigation.
	   However, Saturday's ballot appears to have ended any chance of
that.
	   Under Suharto Golkar dominated the 500-member parliament and
routinely won every general election since the early 1970s.
	   Although the party has millions of members and remains
organizationally and financially strong, there are doubts about its
future as new parties are founded ahead of promised free elections
next year.
	   Akbar made it clear that Golkar must reinvent itself to win
voter support.
	   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
	   In a statement, party officials said Golkar would be ready to
contest elections based on a multiparty system.
	   Saturday's ballot was the first time Golkar delegates were asked
to vote for a new party chief since it was formed in 1964.
	   In the past, chairmen were chosen by Suharto and a small group
of advisers and then endorsed by the party machine.
	   Analysts said Suharto's followers, many of them retired
generals, had sought to slow down political reform to protect the
positions they had gained under Suharto.
	   Akbar's victory followed a strong call for reform made by
Habibie in a speech to the congress on Thursday.
	   In mainly symbolic change, Akbar announced that Golkar would,
for the first time, formally describe itself as a political party.
	   Although it had effectively operated as a party for years,
Golkar under Suharto had maintained that it was only a collection
of groups representing various sectors of society.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A body clad in a diving suit was found
on a beach on South Korea's east coast Sunday and the military said
it appeared to be that of a North Korean spy.
	   ``A body dressed in a diving suit was found along with a machine
gun, hand grenade and portable oxygen tank. The military is
currently investigating the case,'' the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
in a statement.
	   The statement said the body was found on a beach near Donghae,
195 kilometers (117 miles) east of Seoul, and the military
increased land and sea patrols in the area.

China frees four dissidents, five others still in detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities released four democracy
activists rounded up in a crackdown on an opposition political
party but still kept five others in detention, a human rights group
said Sunday.
	   Police formally arrested three of those detained in Friday's
crackdown and told their families to prepare clothes for them, in a
possible sign they may be tried or sentenced to a labor camp, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Chinese police can send people to labor camps without trial.
	   The three _ Wang Youcai, Wang Donghai and Zhu Yufu _ were
leading members of the China Democracy Party, a political group
dissidents tried to set up to challenge the ruling Communist Party.
They were detained in Zhejiang province, eastern China, according
to the Hong Kong-based Information Center.
	   Two other party members, Zhu Zhengming and Cheng Fan, also
remained in detention, although their whereabouts were unknown, the
Information Center said.
	   Police also were searching for Lin Hui, a founding member of the
party, according to a party statement faxed to Beijing by Chinese
dissidents in exile.
	   The statement said police arrested the party's leaders on the
serious charge of plotting to subvert the government.
	   The Information Center said four other democracy campaigners
detained in Friday's clampdown _ Fang Xiaohuang, Wang Peijian, Wang
Qiang, and Wu Gaoxing _ were released Saturday.
	   Wang Youcai, Wang Donghai, and Lin Hui announced the formation
of the China Democracy Party on June 25, the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's nine-day China tour.
	   But authorities have refused to allow the group to register, as
required by law, and Wang Youcai, Zhu Yufu and another dissident
were each detained at least once before Friday's clampdown. They
were released with warnings to stop campaigning for the party.
	   In a statement condemning the latest clampdown, dissidents in
exile in the United States urged the U.S. Congress to hold an
emergency meeting to evaluate ``the serious consequences and harm''
done to the embattled Chinese democracy movement by Clinton's trip
and his China policies.
	   Clinton used his trip to showcase a modern, tolerant China and
to publicly cajole Chinese leaders to allow more dissident. Clinton
was aiming to defend his policy of `constructive engagement' with
Chinese leaders from critics who want to see him take stronger
action against human rights abuses and other problems in China.
	   Meanwhile, a dissident in southeastern Fujian province, Lin
Xinshu, was detained for eight hours Saturday and released with a
warning about his pro-democracy activities, the Information Center
said.

	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Kenya's Fred Kiprop won the Gold
Coast Marathon on Sunday ahead of countryman Sammy Lelei and
Australia's Greg Lyons in a time of 2 hours, 11 minutes and 15
seconds.
	   More than 2,000 competitors battled head winds in a bid to break
Robert de Castella's 16-year Australian record and win a US dlrs
155,000 bonus.
	   Kiprop, 24, finished nearly two minutes off de Castella's record
of 2:09:18. Kiprop ran alone for the last seven kilometers after
pacesetter Godfrey Kiprotich dropped out at the 35-kilometer mark.
	   Defending champion Pat Carroll of Australia, who has won the
event four times, was up with the leaders early but dropped out at
the halfway mark. He will compete in the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth
Games in 10 weeks.
	   In the women's event Estonia's Jane Salumae, who trains in
Kenya, also missed out on a bonus prize when she failed to overhaul
Japanese runner Eriko Asai's Australian all-comers record of
2:29:29 she set at the Gold Coast marathon in 1993.
	   Salumae, 30, finished in 2:33:43. Australia's Lisa Dick was
second in 2:36:54 in her first marathon while countrywoman Sylvia
Rose was third with a time of 2:39:29.
	   In the half marathon Japan's Toshiaki Tezuka won with a time
1:03:24 from countryman Daisuke Fujimoto and Australia's Dean
Cavuoto.
	   In the women's half-marathon, Japan filled the top three places
with Shiki Terasaki winning ahead of Takako Kotorida and Saori
Kawai. (djp)

Leija claims IBA lightweight title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Leija-Nelson fight. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ ``Jesse'' James Leija claimed the IBA's
vacant junior lightweight title with a unanimous decision over
Azumah Nelson on Saturday night.
	   A crowd of only 7,681 showed up at the Alamodome to watch
hometown favorite Leija (36-3-2, 14 KOs) outpoint Nelson (39-5-2)
in the 12-round fight. Leija led on all three judges' scorecards _
119-110, 116-112 and 116-112.
	   ``My conditioning was the key,'' Leija said. ``For me to win
this fight, I had to be strong in every round.''
	   Although the two had met three times before with each gaining a
victory and one draw, both were very cautious over the first three
rounds of their fourth fight.
	   Leija was the more aggressive, throwing more punches and
pressing the attack, while Nelson appeared tight and uneasy.
	   But in the fourth round, Nelson asserted himself on the inside
as Leija was forced to counter. As Nelson attacked, he left himself
open to Leija's left hook to the face and body.
	   And Leija didn't hesitate to throw it, often doubling up. Each
boxer landed flurries in rounds five through seven. However,
neither could get the upper hand despite Nelson breaking his left
hand in the fifth round.
	   But at the end of the eighth round, Leija stunned Nelson with a
left hook. Sensing Nelson was hurt, Leija threw 15 straight punches
before the bell sounded.
	   Leija had Nelson hurt again late in the ninth round. He caught
Nelson with a stiff right and later landed a left-right
combination. The two bumped heads midway through round 11 and a
small gash opened above Leija's eyes.
	   But with blood trickling into his eyes, Leija rallied and won
the round with a late flurry.
	   Nelson needed a knockout in the 12th round but Leija was too
strong, holding off every attack.
	   On the undercard, the winners were Gabriel Ruelas, Goyo Vargas
and Miguel Angel Gonzalez.
	   Ruelas (45-4, 23 KOs) claimed the IBA junior lightweight title
over Troy Dorsey after referee Rafael Ramos stopped the fight at
1:25 of the sixth round. Both Dorsey's eyes were severely swollen
with his right eye completely shut.
	   ``Dorsey is a great friend,'' Ruelas said. ``I take my hat off
to him. I would hit him with greats shots and he would hit me back
and I'd smile.''
	   It was Ruelas' first fight since losing to Arturo Gatti last
October.
	   Both fighters traded heavy blows throughout the bout. Most of
the damage was done on the inside.
	   But as Dorsey (15-11-4, 11 KOs) came out for the sixth round, it
was obvious that his right eye was too swollen for him to continue.
	   Vargas stopped veteran Tracy Patterson at 1:02 of the sixth
round in a non-title junior lightweight fight.
	   The bout was scheduled for 12 rounds but referee Rueben Carrion
called the fight after Patterson's left eye was badly swollen.
	   Carrion stopped the bout on the urging from Patterson's corner.
	   ``Before the sixth round, I examined him and he could see out of
his eye,'' said ringside physician Ruben Tenorio. ``But it was the
corner who asked the fight to be stopped. I think it was
appropriate.''
	   ``I was holding back and pacing for later rounds,'' said Vargas,
who won the WBC featherweight title in 1993. ``Patterson is the
kind of fighter who comes on strong.''
	   Patterson (61-6-1, 43 KOs) twice lost to Gatti for the IBF
lightweight title.
	   Vargas (37-6-1, 27 KOs) threw 300 punches and landed 167 while
Patterson threw 222 and connected on only 71.
	   Gonzalez (43-1-1, 33 KOs) stopped Alexis Perez (21-12-2, 18 KOs)
in the fifth round of their junior welterweight bout.

hit two home runs in Cincinnati's sixth straight victory.
	   Rookie Paul Konerko also homered for Cincinnati, which has won
11 of 12 since losing a season-high 11 straight games. The winning
streak is the Reds' longest since they won seven straight in June
1996.
	   Remlinger (6-9) walked five, struck out seven, hit a batter and

Angeles to four hits in eight innings.
	   Ashby (12-5), who has seven victories in his last eight starts,
allowed the only run on Eric Karros' second-inning homer. Trevor
Hoffman, the brother of Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, pitched the
ninth for his 26th save.
	   Ismael Valdes (6-9) lost for only the second time since June 5,
giving up three earned runs in six innings.

British China expert: Hong Kong an asset to warming relationship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong is a gateway, not an obstacle, to the
warming relationship between China and Britain, a former British
ambassador to China said Sunday.
	   Speaking in a pre-recorded address on government-owned Radio
Hong Kong, China expert Percy Cradock said the British Labour
government has ``quietly drawn the line under the time of troubles
provoked by (former Hong Kong Governor Chris) Patten.''
	   ``Hong Kong is seen as a gateway, a positive asset, not as an
obstacle, a bone of contention,'' in Britain's new and more
constructive relationship with China, said Cradock, one of Patten's
loudest critics.
	   The relationship between the two countries became icy when they
were preparing for Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule last July,
mainly because of disagreements over the territory's political
future.
	   Beijing vigorously opposed the democratic reforms Patten
advocated in the final years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong.
In protest, Beijing dismantled the legislature elected under his
reform and installed a temporary, handpicked lawmaking body after
the handover.
	   Sino-British relationship has been warming since the handover,
with both countries eager to establish lucrative trade ties.
Cradock said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's April visit to Britain
heralded a new era of cooperation, and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's forthcoming visit to Beijing will carry this relationship
forward.
	   He also said Beijing so far has honored the handover pledges to
stay off Hong Kong affairs with ``remarkable sophistication and
restraint.''

Indonesian opposition leader says country edging towards
</HEADLINE>
disintegration

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A prominent Indonesian opposition leader said
his troubled country is edging towards disintegration, while its
ruling party is now a ``spent force,'' according to a Sunday
newspaper.
	   Delivering a Saturday talk to a local Islamic think-tank in
Singapore, Muslim leader Amien Rais said Indonesia is beginning to
resemble the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union before they broke
apart.
	   ``There is a danger that the country may go the way the two
states had gone... crumbling into pieces,'' he was quoted as saying
by The Sunday Times.
	   Rais noted the uncertainty over the future political process,
separatist tendencies in provinces like Aceh and Irian Jaya, and
the worsening economic situation.
	   ``Prices of basic commodities are now beyond the reach of the
masses,'' he warned.
	   Rising food and petrol prices sparked widespread popular unrest
throughout the fourth most populous country in May, leading to the
eventual resignation of former President Suharto and succession by
B.J. Habibie.
	   Rais _ a prominent figure in Suharto's ousting _ praised Habibie
for introducing some political reform since assuming power, but
cautioned that the country's economic problems remain massive.
	   He said he would not rule himself out of the next presidential
election, and urged Habibie to finish drafting new electoral
legislation so that polls could take place as soon as possible.
	   The opposition figure, who leads Indonesia's largest Muslim
group comprising 28 million members, disparaged the ruling Golkar
Party, calling it a ``spent force'' and the current congress ``its
last hurrah.''
	   During a interview with Singapore state-run television aired
late Saturday, he predicted that in the next election ``Golkar will
become just another political party, especially because the support
of the armed forces and the bureaucrats will be withdrawn.''
	   He criticized recent comments by President Habibie that cited
good foreign relations between Indonesia and Malaysia as a result
of ethnic and religious similarities between the two neighbors.
	   ``I think this is unwise because by saying that, our relations
with Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore will be different
	   Rais added that he was losing faith in the International
Monetary Fund, which has orchestrated a dlrs 40 billion bailout
package but delayed installments following the May unrest.
	   ``By delaying it, the economy of Indonesia is sinking
systematically and progressively,'' he said during the talk.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A body clad in a diving suit was found
on a beach on South Korea's east coast Sunday and the military
believed it is that of a North Korean spy.
	   ``By the various equipment and personal belongings found, it
appears certain that the body is that of an armed North Korean
agent,'' the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
	   The statement said the body was found on a beach near Donghae,
195 kilometers (117 miles) east of Seoul, and the military
increased land and sea patrols in the area.
	   Quoting military doctors, the statement said the body was
believed to have been dead ``24 hours to 48 hours'' when it was
found.
	   The body was found along with a Czech-made machine gun, a hand
grenade, a red-painted portable oxygen tank, a dagger and a radio
set, it said.
	   Also found was a self-propelled, semi-submersible craft commonly
used by North Korean agents to infiltrate, the statement said.
	   Lee Jang-soo, 29, who first spotted the body, told military
investigators that oxygen was still coming out of the portable
oxygen tank, indicating that the agent was dead while trying to
land ashore.
	   The military ruled out the possibility that the body was that of
an agent from a North Korean submarine found off the east coast
last month.
	   Nine bodies were found in the sub, all shot to death in what
military investigators described as a murder-suicide committed by
senior officers to avoid capture.
	   At the time, officials said they believed the nine bodies
accounted for the submarine's entire complement of six crewmen and
three espionage agents.

Early voter turnout up as Japan holds key parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Hashimoto, latest turnout figures;
polls close at 1100 GMT
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters turned out in unexpectedly high numbers
Sunday for parliamentary elections seen as a referendum on Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's efforts to pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The bigger turnout could mean trouble for Hashimoto _ analysts
have predicted that more votes could mean more ballots cast in
protest against Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   At stake are half the 252 seats in the Parliament's upper house.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats are in no danger of losing their
hold on power because of their strong majority in the lower house
and Hashimoto himself was not up for re-election.
	   But the elections are an important test of whether voters hold
Hashimoto and his party responsible for the Japan's economic
malaise. If the ruling party does poorly, Hashimoto will be under
intense pressure to resign.
	   By mid-afternoon, 30.15 percent of Japan's 99.4 million
registered voters had cast ballots, up 3.29 percentage points from
the same time during the last election, according to the Home
Affairs Ministry.
	   Polling was scheduled to continue until 8:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) _
two hours longer than usual due to concerns over falling voter
turnout in recent elections. The results of about 90 percent of the
races were expected by 1 a.m. Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   Sunday's elections are the first in the upper house since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996. With record-high
unemployment, rising bankruptcies, and party members tainted by
bribery scandals, the ruling party had geared up for a rough ride.
	   ``I think I did as much as I can do,'' Hashimoto told reporters
Sunday morning. ``I really hope for a good result.''
	   Opposition parties called on voters to send a message that they
are unhappy with the way Hashimoto has handled the economy.
	   At polling places Sunday, many voters seem to have been
listening.
	   ``As long as the LDP is in power, the economy will only get
worse,'' said Akira Nagaoka, 34, after voting in central Tokyo.
Nagaoka said he supported the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition group.
	   Others, however, said they felt the Liberal Demoicrats were the
safest bet.
	   ``Japan needs steady policies,'' said 78-year-old salesman Kunio
Kanno.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then
backtracked two days later. He now says he supports cuts.
	   Going into the polls, ruling party leaders had replaced earlier
predictions of a big victory with declarations that all the party
wanted was to break even.
	   According to several reports, Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _
the break-even point _ if he is to stay in office.
	   Just breaking even, however, would leave the ruling party eight
seats short of majority, forcing it to seek outside partners to
pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
Both of the LDP's previous coalition partners have distanced
themselves from the ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   The decline of the Socialists, which until a few years ago was
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party held 38 seats in the upper house going
into the election. But Kan's personal popularity has been clouded
by the party's vague stance on major issues.

Singapore travel agencies succumbing to regional crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As the region's economic slump curtails
vacation spending and air travel, a growing number of Singapore
tour firms are losing money or folding, according to a Sunday news
report.
	   Four out of ten local travel companies are now operating at a
loss and at least 30 agencies have closed down over the past 18
months, travel consultant Steve Lavato was reported as saying by
The Sunday Times.
	   During a Saturday conference on the beleaguered industry,
National Association of Travel Agents of Singapore chief Renton de
Alwis said the business has been hard hit by recessions across the
region.
	   He also noted declining profits because of ``intense price
competition'' among travel agents due to the shrinking market.
	   The Singapore Tourism Board said 114 travel agencies closed
between 1993 and June this year, according to the newspaper,
demonstrating a broader trend through the mid-90's.
	   The government-linked body has in the past also blamed regional
instability, such as the deteriorating situation in Indonesia, and
recent haze episodes for declining tourist revenue.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Reveling in new freedoms and bedeviled
by the worst economic crisis in decades, Indonesia is starting to
fray at the edges.
	   Violent protests have broken out in recent days in remote
eastern provinces where separatists are demanding independence
after years of suppression by the old regime of ex-President
Suharto.
	   In the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, which Indonesia
seized in 1975, troops shot a protester to death outside a Roman
Catholic cathedral where visiting European diplomats chatted with a
local bishop last week.
	   In Irian Jaya, the western, Indonesian half of New Guinea, at
least one man was killed and more than 20 wounded when soldiers
fired into a crowd of 700 that unlawfully raised a rebel flag last
Monday. Earlier protests also resulted in deaths and injuries.
	   Suharto used the army during his 32 years in power to maintain a
seemingly strong unitary state despite its diverse elements. But
some people fear the world's fourth most populous nation may be
ripe for splintering.
	   Indonesia consists of 17,000 islands that stretch for 3,100
miles (4,990 kilometers) along the equator, from strongly Muslim
Sumatra in the west to Christian and tribal New Guinea in the east.
Its 202 million people are divided among more than 300 ethnic
groups, 500 languages and five main religions.
	   Critics say heavy-handed policies by the government, based in
Jakarta on the island of Java, have paid only lip service to the
national motto ``Unity in Diversity.''
	   Independence movements have long simmered in Aceh, a province in
northern Sumatra where many people want to establish an Islamic
religious state.
	   Rebels continue to fight a jungle war in Irian Jaya, which
Indonesia took over from the colonial Dutch in 1963.
	   Guerrillas have roamed the hills of predominately Catholic East
Timor since mainly Muslim Indonesia annexed it.
	   Insurrections have also erupted in the past on the islands of
Sulawesi and Borneo. Settlers and bureaucrats who moved from
overpopulated Java have occasionally been targeted with violent
acts by resentful indigenous people.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has promised democratic reforms, and
the government is tolerating almost daily anti-government protests.
But the military chief, Gen. Wiranto, has warned that
demonstrations for regional independence are treasonous and will be
put down by his troops.
	   Amein Rais, a prominent Muslim leader and a government critic,
is urging Habibie to tackle inequities among regions and economic
classes or face possible national disintegration.
	   ``It is not impossible that what happened to Yugoslavia could
also happen to Indonesia,'' Rais said recently.
	   Other analysts doubt the country will split as dramatically as
Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, they predict separatist movements will
gather strength as discontent in outlying areas grows and is
matched by unrest in communities closer to Jakarta.
	   Mochtar Buchori, a political commentator and former head of the
Indonesian Institute of Science, worries the political and cultural
frustrations that have built over many years could boil over due to
hardships from Asia's economic crisis.
	   Indonesia's once booming economy is in deep recession. Its
currency has plunged more than 80 percent in value, and the
inflation rate is above 50 percent and could reach 85 percent by
year's end. Unemployment is soaring, and some experts say one in
four Indonesians is living in poverty.
	   Outlying areas have been hit badly.
	   Food shortages and sharp increases in food prices have triggered
waves of riots, including the violence that helped pushed Suharto
out of office two months ago.
	   Hundreds have died from disease and hunger because of severe
drought in Irian Jaya in recent months.
	   ``For decades under Suharto, many people had felt they had no
freedom to express themselves,'' Buchori said. ``Now there are so
many problems from the economic crisis, things could get worse.
There's been too much social jealousy and disparity.''

China frees four dissidents, five others still in detention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 18 dissidents issuing petition calling for
release of those detained in graf 9, edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities have released four democracy
activists rounded up in a crackdown on an opposition political
party but are keeping five others in detention, a human rights
group said Sunday.
	   Police formally arrested three of those detained in Friday's
crackdown and told their families to prepare clothes for them, a
possible sign they might be tried or sentenced to a labor camp, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Chinese police can send people to labor camps without trial.
	   The three _ Wang Youcai, Wang Donghai and Zhu Yufu _ were
leading members of the China Democracy Party, a political group
dissidents tried to set up to challenge the ruling Communist Party.
They were detained in Zhejiang province, eastern China, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center said.
	   Two other party members, Zhu Zhengming and Cheng Fan, also
remained in detention, although their whereabouts were unknown, the
Information Center said.
	   Police also were searching for Lin Hui, a founding member of the
party, said a party statement faxed to Beijing by Chinese
dissidents in exile.
	   The statement said police arrested the party's leaders on the
serious charge of plotting to subvert the government.
	   The Information Center said four other campaigners detained in
Friday's crackdown _ Fang Xiaohuang, Wang Peijian, Wang Qiang, and
Wu Gaoxing _ were released Saturday.
	   On Sunday, 18 dissidents nationwide appealed for the release of
those still detained, the Information Center said. In a letter to
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, the dissidents said
the detentions ran counter to government pledges to improve human
rights, it added.
	   One of those who signed the petition, dissident Lin Xinshu from
southeastern Fujian province, was detained for eight hours Saturday
and released with a warning about his pro-democracy activities, the
Information Center said.
	   Wang Youcai, Wang Donghai, and Lin Hui announced the formation
of the China Democracy Party on June 25, the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's nine-day China tour.
	   But authorities have refused to allow the group to register, as
required by law, and Wang Youcai, Zhu Yufu and another dissident
were each detained at least once before Friday's clampdown. They
were released with warnings to stop campaigning for the party.
	   In a statement condemning the latest clampdown, dissidents in
exile in the United States urged the U.S. Congress to hold an
emergency meeting to evaluate ``the serious consequences and harm''
done to the embattled Chinese democracy movement by Clinton's trip
and his China policies.
	   Clinton used his trip to showcase a modern, tolerant China and
to publicly cajole Chinese leaders to allow more dissent. Clinton
was aiming to defend his policy of ``constructive engagement'' with
Chinese leaders from critics who want to see him take stronger
action against human rights abuses and other problems in China.

Center expected to be recalled for All Blacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Rugby union center Mark Mayerhofler
is expected to be recalled to the New Zealand team to play South
Africa following the 24-16 loss to Australia in the Tri Nations and
Bledisloe Cup test on Saturday.
	   Mayerhofler was a late withdrawal from the All Black side
because of a strained hamstring, but he's being monitored daily and
should be in the team to be announced Tuesday for the July 25 match
against the Springboks at Wellington.
	   All Black coach John Hart said the team would have a training
run on Friday and he's optimistic Mayerhofler will be fully
recovered.
	   He said Mayerhofler's injury had forced the selectors to play
Waikato Chiefs center Scott McLeod earlier than they would have
liked following his return from a lengthy injury layoff.
	   Hart said the team was in a transition stage and the New Zealand
public could no longer expect it to win every time it played.
	   ``What we're trying to do is build a team long-term and we have
to get these players into form,'' Hart said.
	   ``We must look ahead _ most people would understand that. It
would be nice to have the experience but we need to have no more
rustiness.'' (djp)

Turkish and Cypriot ferry boats collide off Corfu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two ferry boats collided Sunday off the
coast of the Ionian island of Corfu, causing material damage to
both ships but no injuries, the merchant marine ministry said.
	   The head-on collision between the Turkish-flagged Eskederoun and
the Cypriot-flagged Valentino occurred 15 nautical miles (27
kilometers) west of Corfu at around 9 a.m (0600 GMT), the ministry
said.
	   The Valentino had left the southern Greek port of Patras for
Italy, while the Eskederoun was headed to Izmir, Turkey, from a
Croatian port, the ministry added.
	   The number of passengers on either ship was not immediately
available.
	   Both ships were still able to sail, and Greek authorities
ordered them to head for the nearby port of Igoumenitsa in order to
assess the damage and for an investigation into the incident.
	   The cause of the collision was not immediately known.

Clan war leaves 10 dead on southern Philippine island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASILAN, Philippines (AP) _ Sporadic heavy fighting between two
powerful clans has killed 10 people, left at least 60 houses burned
and forced many residents to flee a small southern Philippine
island, officials said Sunday.
	   Local civilian and military officials were trying to negotiate a
truce to stop the clashes, which started Wednesday on Bubuan Island
off Basilan province, said army Col. Glicerio Sua, who is based in
the province.
	   Sua said supporters and members of two families led by Hadji
Faizal Abdulkarim and Hadji Abdurahman Ahalul started attacking
each other with rifles, grenade launchers and dynamite for reasons
still unknown.
	   Sua and other local officials said at least 10 people on the two
sides have been killed and an undetermined number have been
injured.
	   He said officials have been trying to make peace between them,
but ``if they do not stop, we're going to hit whoever blocks our
way.''
	   Basilan Governor Wahab Akbar said at least 60 houses, mostly
grass huts, have been burned since the fighting began, forcing
about 100 residents to flee and local officials to suspend classes
on the island, about 910 kilometers (564 miles) south of Manila.
	   The two families have been at odds since the early 1980s due to
a land dispute and the alleged killing of a son of Ahalul by one of
the Abdulkarims, local officials said. Nobody knows what touched
off the latest encounters, they added.
	   The island of about 5,000 mostly impoverished fishermen is
reportedly a drop-off point for smuggled goods in the southern
Philippines.
	   Many armed separatist insurgents and powerful political clans
are active in the southern Philippines, one of the country's
poorest regions.

Power struggle, sex scandal shake Taiwan's Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's Cabinet has been shaken by a
power struggle that surfaced last week when the intelligence chief
publicly accused the justice minister of bringing up a false charge
of attempted rape to discredit him.
	   The news media have reported intensively on the rape allegations
as they uncovered bitter factional strife within the government.
	   The United Evening News cited unidentified officials as saying
Sunday that the Cabinet has decided to replace both men this week
to save the government's public image.
	   The episode began last month when a National Assembly deputy
accused Cheng Chuan, acting chief of the Bureau of Investigation,
of fondling his friend's daughter on a business trip to France
three years ago when he offered to treat her throat illness by
giving her a massage.
	   Cheng is known to have mastered a traditional Chinese massage
treatment, but the deputy quoted the 19-year-old woman's father as
saying Cheng failed in an attempt to rape her only because of her
mother's timely return to the hotel.
	   A government investigation team said in a report last week that
it found no evidence of attempted rape or sexual harassment, but
accused Cheng of misconduct for having touched sensitive parts
during the massage.
	   On Thursday, Cheng called a news conference to say the whole
incident was a plot by Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao to bring him
down because he had rejected Liao's requests to appoint his own
allies to key positions at the bureau.
	   Liao denied the charges and accused Cheng of ``smearing his
superior.'' Colleagues said Cheng had claimed to hold a doctorate
of law from the University of Paris but was never able to prove it.
	   The Investigation Bureau was responsible for cracking down on
political dissent during the martial law era. But following
Taiwan's democratic reforms, it has shifted its focus to criminal
investigation.
	   Newspapers said the chief of the National Security Bureau, Ying
Tsong-wen, has backed Cheng as part of maneuvers to place the
Investigation Bureau back under the national security wing. Ying
has denied it.
	   Returning Friday from a trip to three South Pacific nations,
Premier Vincent Siew said he regretted the development and promised
to punish officials who had engaged in any wrongdoing.

Eyeing the presidency no longer a taboo in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos HAR101,102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ In the office where thugs tried to kill
him, labor leader Morgan Tsvangirai leaned back and contemplated
the possibility of becoming president.
	   The idea of replacing President Robert Mugabe, the country's
revered independence leader, would have been considered a delusion
only a few years ago. But the economy has gone sour, causing
increasing unrest, and many Zimbabweans now view Tsvangirai as a
likely president.
	   He is head of the country's main labor confederation, which has
shot to prominence as a potent political force in the past year,
elbowing aside a dozen small and fractious opposition parties.
	   ``The situation is desperate and people are looking for
alternatives. Certainly, there's pressure on me (to challenge
Mugabe), but circumstances still have to evolve,'' Tsvangirai said.
	   Not only his supporters see him as a rising star.
	   Seven assailants beat Tsvangirai unconscious with pieces of
office furniture in December, two days after he led a national
strike that forced the government to scrap tax hikes. They were
trying to toss him out a 10th floor window when office workers
alerted by a secretary's screams chased the attackers away.
	   Tsvangirai calls it an assassination attempt by political
opponents. After police closed an investigation without arresting
anyone, his labor group, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions,
conducted its own probe and gave the names of three suspects to
authorities.
	   The names haven't been released, but Tsvangirai described them
as security operatives with Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front.
	   Mugabe, 74, an ascetic intellectual, was long seen as an able
statesman who guided the nation through the transition from a
bloody bush war to become a model of prosperity, racial harmony and
democracy.
	   But in recent years, the reign of the country's only black
leader since white rule ended in 1980 has become increasingly
corrupt and dictatorial.
	   In 1996 he married his former secretary _ 40 years his junior
and widely disliked for her regal airs _ at a two-day ceremony
criticized for its lavish feasting.
	   Since then, the unemployment rate has soared to more than 50
percent. Prices have jumped more than 30 percent since the Zimbabwe
dollar lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar in
November.
	   ``The time is ripe for change,'' Tsvangirai said. ``Things are
falling apart because the government has lost the capacity to
manage the economy.''
	   In late May, students tried to mount a protest campaign like the
one in economically straitened Indonesia that drove President
Suharto from power a few days earlier. But a sit-in outside
Parliament broke up in disarray after three days.
	   Still, however inept, the students scared the government into
closing down the University of Zimbabwe, said John Makumbe, a
political science professor at the school.
	   ``There is a real fear of Indonesia syndrome, and this was a
warning of things to come,'' he said.
	   Makumbe said the biggest danger to Mugabe's hold on power lies
in the threat by Tsvangirai's labor confederation _ representing 80
percent of labor groups _ to stage a five-day national strike to
protest economic policies.
	   ``A five-day strike takes on massive political overtones to get
rid of the current regime, and people know it,'' Makumbe said.
	   In response to the economic turmoil, Mugabe created ``a national
economic consultative forum'' of officials and business leaders.
But he has repeatedly refused to listen to the panel's advice, its
members have said.
	   A proposal to give policy-making powers to the forum, putting
professional expertise alongside political experience, was rejected
by Mugabe.
	   Opposition groups trace the beginning of Mugabe's troubles to
the May 2, 1997, death of Shepherd Mhongo, a young civil servant
who leaked details of corruption at a state war victims
compensation fund. The government said Mhongo committed suicide
after being questioned by security agents.
	   His disclosures that politicians and favored ruling party
supporters took the equivalent of dlrs 22 million from the fund
after submitting false disability claims led to violent nationwide
demonstrations by former independence fighters.
	   Mugabe ordered tax increases to pay new pensions and bonuses to
the veterans, but no officials were punished. That led to the
strike by Tsvangirai's federation that forced Mugabe to back down
on the tax hikes.

Three Catholic children die in sectarian fire in Northern Ireland

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three Catholic children dying in house fire &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three Catholic children died in
a sectarian house fire early Sunday and Protestant protesters once
again clashed violently with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road.
	   Neighbors reported hearing a loud bang just before the arson
attack in Ballymoney that killed brothers Richard, Mark and Jason
Quinn, who ranged in age from 7 to 10. Two men and a woman in the
house _ located in a mixed, but mostly Protestant estate _ managed
to escape, police said.
	   Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy leader of the new Belfast
Assembly, said the boys had been ``sacrificed for the so-called
principles of the people of the north of Ireland, who have been
unable to resolve what is basically a parochial dispute'' over the
Protestant march.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' Mallon said on BBC-TV.
``Does it take one child, two children, three children?''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ All military and police forces on
South Korea's rugged east coast went on increased alert Sunday
after the body of a suspected North Korean spy was found washed
ashore.
	   ``The alert is in response to a probability that some North
Korean armed agents could have come ashore undetected,'' said Col.
Hwang Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered a thorough search for possible
infiltrators from North Korea, with which South Korea technically
remains in a state of war.
	   The alert was issued after the body, clad in a wet-suit, was
found on a beach two kilometers (1.2 miles) from a major South
Korean naval base on the east coast.
	   ``From the various equipment and personal belongings found, it
appears certain that the body is that of an armed North Korean
agent,'' the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
	   The statement said the body was found washed ashore near
Donghae, 195 kilometers (117 miles) east of Seoul, and the military
immediately increased land and sea patrols in the area.
	   The military later put all units in the area on increased alert
after a self-propelled, semi-submersible craft, capable of helping
infiltrate up to five agents, was found near where the body was
found.
	   The craft, made of aluminum, was similar ones used by North
Korean agents to infiltrate into South Korea in the past, military
officials said.
	   ``The size of the cone-shaped craft indicates that some armed
agents might have come ashore undetected,'' Hwang said.
	   Quoting military doctors, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the
body was believed to have been dead ``24 hours to 48 hours'' when
it was found.
	   The body was found along with a Czech-made machine gun, a hand
grenade, a portable oxygen tank, a dagger and a radio set, it said.
	   Lee Jang-soo, 29, who first spotted the body, told military
investigators that oxygen was still coming out of the portable
oxygen tank, indicating that the agent died while trying to come
ashore.
	   The military ruled out the possibility that the body was that of
an agent from a North Korean submarine found off the east coast
last month.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   At the time, officials said they believed the nine bodies
accounted for the submarine's entire complement of six crewmen and
three espionage agents.
	   In 1996, a shark-class North Korean submarine was found stranded
off South Korea's east coast, touching off a 53-day manhunt for the
craft's 26 occupants who came ashore.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.

Newcastle holds outright first
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Newcastle Knights escaped with an
18-17 win lowly Western Suburbs on Sunday to leapfrog over
Melbourne and back into first place in Australia's National Rugby
League.
	   The Knights won for the 14th time in 18 matches for 29 points to
remain two points ahead of the first-year Storm. Parramatta, which
won Friday night over Cronulla, is tied for third place with
Brisbane on 26 points following the Broncos' 18-12 win Sunday over
Illawarra.
	   In other matches Sunday, Adelaide beat South Sydney 34-18, St.
George defeated North Sydney 22-14 and Canterbury beat Canberra
24-22.
	   The Knights trailed 10-0 early and only took the lead with 10
minutes left.
	   Newcastle coach Mal Reilly said the Knights played well below
their best.
	   ``We were our own worst enemy, we kept turning the ball over,
and let them offload the ball all day,'' Reilly said. ``We'll take
the two points and know we played badly and manage to get away with
it.''
	   On Saturday, the Penrith Panthers staged a second-half comback
to beat Sydney City 24-18.
	   The Roosters piled on 14 points in the final minutes of the
first half to lead 14-8 at the break. But the Panthers regained the
lead after the break with a try by David Woods and a goal by Chris
Hicks that leveled the scores.
	   Sydney City scored four tries to three, but Hicks' boot got the
Panthers home _ he landed all six of his shots at goal.
	   Balmain halfback Michael Gillett set up three first-half tries
as the Tigers beat North Queensland 18-0.
	   Halfback Wes Patten scored two tries and had a hand in two
others as the Gold Coast Chargers beat Auckland 31-18.
	   On Friday, Melbourne ended its two-game losing streak with a
gritty 22-12 win over Manly while Parramatta kept pace with
Newcastle and the Storm by beating Cronulla 22-12.
	   The Melbourne-Manly match was level at 12-12 with 10 minutes
remaining, but late tries to the Storm's Wayne Evans and Paul Bell
sealed the result. (djp)

Volcano warning reduced to `caution' in Central Java
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hot lava still poured sporadically
Sunday from Indonesia's most active volcano, but authorities
downgraded warnings from ``alert'' to ``caution.''
	   The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) Mount Merapi in Central Java was
shaken by a loud explosion before dawn Saturday, and gray ash
spewed over a wide area, raising fears of eruption.
	   ``Its status was downgraded from `alert' to `caution' beginning
at 12:00 (noon, or 0500 GMT) today as there is a decrease in its
activities,'' said Sunarto, an official at the volcanology
monitoring post.
	   ``Caution'' is the second level of Indonesia's four-stage
warning system. Higher levels are ``alert'' and ``danger,'' which
requires evacuation of nearby residents.
	   Sunarto said an alert remained in effect for people and sand
miners living along rivers around the volcano.
	   Meanwhile, Ratdomo Purbo, a volcanologist at another post, said
at least two volcanic quakes occurred Sunday, with one at 10:13
a.m. (0313 GMT) sending hot clouds to up to two kilometers (1.2
miles) above the peak.
	   ``But there are small possibilities for any eruption,'' Purbo
said. Both Purbo and Sunarto were contacted by phone from
Yogyakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Saturday's explosion occurred three days after lava and hot
gases began to pour from the top of the volcano.
	   Residents said the blast rattled their homes and could be heard
20 kilometers (12 miles) away.
	   News reports said heat clouds from the initial explosion blew to
an uninhabited area six kilometers (3.7 miles) west of the
mountain, while volcanic heat reached areas as far as 60 kilometers
(37 miles) to the west and southwest.
	   At least 40 big explosions had occurred up to Sunday night.
	   Merapi, on the border of Central and East Java, one of the
world's most densely populated areas, is the most active of 500
Indonesia's volcanoes.
	   A sudden eruption in 1994 sent a steam cloud that flattened a
village on its slopes, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300 people
in 1930.

Dalai Lama calls off planned visit to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama,
has called off a planned visit to Taiwan this fall, the state-run
news agency reported Sunday.
	   The Central News Agency quoted Ching Hsing, head of the Chinese
Buddhist Association, as saying the trip was called off because he
feared he could not mobilize enough followers to give the Dalai
Lama the big welcome that was accorded him on his first visit last
year.
	   The Taiwanese Buddhist leader refused to comment on whether the
Dalai Lama canceled the trip because of its political sensitivity,
the report said.
	   On a recent visit to China, U.S. President Bill Clinton had
urged Chinese President Jiang Zemin to open dialogue with the
Tibetan spiritual leader.
	   Jiang replied that one of the preconditions for the dialogue
would be for the Dalai Lama to recognize Taiwan as a province of
China.
	   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet following an abortive uprising in 1959
against Chinese rule.
	   His visit to Taiwan last year healed a long rift between Taiwan
and the Tibetan government in exile in India.
	   For decades, the exiled Tibetan government had accused Taiwan's
ruling Nationalist Party of meddling in its affairs. Before the
1949 Communist revolution, the Nationalists ruled China and
regarded Tibet as their territory, as do the Communists today.

Games Federation gives final approval for venues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Commonwealth Games Federation
gave its final approval Sunday to facilities for the September
games, but cautioned organizers that there was very little time to
complete their work.
	   ``The time frame is very short. There cannot be any slippage,''
warned Michael S. Fennel, the federation chairman.
	   A two-member team commissioned by the federation submitted a
report of its weeklong appraisal of the various facilities in Kuala
Lumpur for the 10-day games beginning on Sept. 11.
	   ``We would have liked to see all the facilities finished,'' said
Roger Jackson, a Canadian expert on evaluating cities that bid for
international sports events.
	   ``I am confident that the games will be a success,'' said
Richard Palmer, executive vice president of the British Olympic
Committee and Jackson's partner on the evaluating team.
	   But, he warned, ``the next 60 days are critical.''
	   Neither gave details of what they saw as drawbacks, but Palmer
said these were ``not of overwhelming concern.''
	   Although experts have praised the new stadiums, tracks and pools
that Malaysia has built, there have been concerns over transport
arrangements, media facilities and the danger of haze like that
which blanketed the region at the same time last year. Low ticket
sales have triggered worries about a revenue shortfall.
	   The 1.2 billion ringgit (dlrs 300 million) main venue for the
16th Commonwealth Games was inaugurated Saturday night amid the
bursting of firecrackers.
	   The National Sports Complex, with its 100,000-seat Bukit Jalil
Main Stadium, boasts a cable-tension membrane roof that covers
38,000 square meters (410,000 square feet), making it the biggest
of its kind in the world, according to sports authorities.
	   But workers would still be putting finishing touches on most
other venues to be tried by athletes from Malaysia and some
neighboring countries during the weeklong pre-games starting
Monday.
	   Fennel, the Games Federation chairman, also said that the
withdrawal of a 5 million ringgit (dlrs 1.25 million) sponsorship
by beer maker Carlsberg would not cripple the Kuala Lumpur event.
The budget for the games is 310 million ringgit (dlrs 77.5
million), he said.
	   The Malaysian Cabinet ordered the national organizing committee
to drop the beer sponsorship after local Islamic groups and some
others objected to the alcohol advertisements on public transport.
	   ``We have come to an amicable solution (with Carlsberg) and have
parted as friends,'' said Hashim bin Mohd. Ali, the chief of the
local games organizing committee, Sukom.
	   He said negotiations were continuing with the company on the
amount to be returned since the advertisements had already been on
display for weeks before been taken down.
	   More than 4,100 athletes from 68 countries are expected to
participate in the games, being staged for the first time in Asia.

Flagship Singapore Airlines to introduce Internet ticket sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's national airline will introduce
ticket sales on the Internet early next year, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   During its annual general meeting Saturday, Singapore Airlines
chairman Michael Fam said the flagship carrier will begin offering
the service in the first quarter of 1999.
	   The airline disclosed that administrative costs for ticket sales
rose 8.6 percent _ or 722 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 422
million) _ in its fiscal year ended March 31, 1998.
	   No-frills Internet sales offer the potential of reducing these
costs, though the airline stressed that it was not abandoning
ticket sales by travel agents, who receive a commission.
	   Responding to criticism that SIA's profits had not kept pace
with revenue growth, chief executive officer Cheong Choong Kong
said it was ``difficult under present conditions to grow even 8
percent a year'' in profits.
	   The airline had decided, therefore, to rely less on Singapore as
a hub and to pursue joint ventures, including negotiations to
acquire a stake in Thai Airways and South African Airways.

Madrid holds centennial exhibition to Hemingway _ a year early

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An exhibition commemorating Ernest
Hemingway's centennial has opened in Madrid _ 99 years after his
birth.
	   It's not a mistake, the organizers assure, but rather a pointed
indulgence of one of ``Papa'' Hemingway's white lies.
	   Anxious for adventure, Hemingway added an extra year to his age
so he could drive ambulances on the Italian front in the First
World War. The official centennial celebrations will not take place
until his real 100th birthday year in 1999.
	   ``He was always a bit of a liar'' said biographer Jose Luis
Castillo-Puche as he surveyed the exhibition of Hemingway
memorabilia he has organized at the prestigious Circle of Fine
Arts. The show opened July 1, a day before the 37th anniversary of
Hemingway's suicide in 1961.
	   ``He was a great man and (his age) was a little lie, a secret he
kept for years,'' said Castillo-Puche, who claims to be the first
his biographers to expose the American literary legend's vulnerable
side. His books include ``Hemingway in Spain,'' published in 1974.
	   Towering over his friends and his wives, tending to the wounds
of a gored bullfighter, pensive, ironic, questioning or drunk,
nearly 100 photos of the self-promoting, macho man-of-action and
self-destructive alcoholic cover the walls of Madrid's exhibition,
which runs through July 31.
	   ``His vital arrogance and triumphalism were just a mask to hide
his weakness, his insecurity and above all his terror of death''
writes Castillo-Puche introducing the exhibition that focuses on
Hemingway's fascination with Spain.
	   The two men's friendship dates from the early 1950s. By that
time Hemingway had already written a handful of books that
established Spain in the international imagination as a land of
bullfighters, heroic battles and romance.
	   The exhibition's opening came a week before the San Fermin
festival in the northern town of Pamplona. Many of the foreigners
who flock to run with the bulls through the town's cobbled streets
would never have heard of the festival had it not been for
Hemingway's ``The Sun Also Rises,'' written in 1927.
	   As well as first editions of all his Spanish opus, the
exhibition also includes stills of Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman
in the movie version of 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.'
	   The exhibition also displays a letter of rejection from the
censor in 1968, ruling that the bestseller set in the Civil War was
too sympathetic to the losing republican forces.
	   Hemingway first came to Spain in the early 1920s and returned as
a reporter during the Civil War. He stayed away for 15 years after
Gen. Francisco Franco's victory in 1939, but by the mid-1950s had
adopted the country as a second home.
	   For Castillo-Puche, Hemingway's fascination with Spain stemmed
from ``his love for the fact that people stick to their beliefs,
and his obsession with the sanctification of death that makes it a
liberation, the ritual bloodbath in bullfighting and the priestly
figure of the matador.''
	   Bullfighting was one of Hemingway's greatest passions along with
big-game hunting and deep-sea fishing.
	   But Castillo-Puche's mixes his memories of the author's exploits
with less exuberant images. ``All the years I knew him he always
slept with the light on. He was afraid of the dark.''
	   The ghosts that haunted the man credited with revolutionizing
English prose style also make their appearance at the exhibition.

Background facts on Japan's parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese voters went to the polls Sunday to elect
126 of the 252 lawmakers in the upper house of Parliament. The
elections are seen as among the most important Japan has held in
years. Here are some of the reasons:
	   SINKING ECONOMY: Japan's economy is deep in its worst recession
since World War II. Its banks are foundering under a mountain of
bad debt and unemployment is at a record high of 4.1 percent.
Japan's economic morass has already aggravated a financial crisis
throughout Asia, and economists believe that a continuation could
threaten world markets as well.
	   SHAKY PRIME MINISTER: Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
assumed office in early 1996, has been widely blamed for adding to
Japan's economic problems by supporting a sales tax increase last
year that economists say squelched a budding recovery. Going into
the polls, his approval ratings had slipped as low as the 30
percent range, strengthening calls for him to step down. A
leadership change, however, could further slow Japan's efforts to
strengthen its economy.
	   REALIGNED OPPOSITION: The biggest challenge to Hashimoto's
Liberal Democratic Party has come from the newly formed Democratic
Party. The Democrats, representing a more liberal stance than
Hashimoto's conservatives, have a popular leader in Naoto Kan, but
have been vague on policy. The farther-to-the-left Socialists, who
for decades were the LDP's main rival, lost their appeal to many
followers by making an about-face and aligning with the LDP in
1994.
	   POLITICAL APATHY: Surveys indicate more voters than ever before
support no particular political party, and are increasingly
pessimistic about the effectiveness of politicians in general.
Voter turnout for national elections in Japan has been in a steady
downward trend, hitting a record low of 44.52 percent when upper
house elections were held three years ago. To turn that around,
polling hours were increased and regulations on absentee balloting
loosened for the elections Sunday.

Vickers sells Cosworth engine subsidiary to Germany automaker Audi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British engineering group Vickers PLC said
Sunday it has sold its engine-making subsidiary Cosworth to German
automaker Audi.
	   Audi, which is part of the Volkswagen group, offtered 350
million marks, or dlrs 192.3 million, for Cosworth in early June.
But the deal was contingent on regulatory approval and the sale of
Vickers' Rolls Royce division to Volkswagen.
	   Volkswagen AG completed its purchase of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
Ltd. on July 3. Europe's No. 1 automaker beat out its German rival
BMW and paid dlrs 780 million for Rolls-Royce.
	   Vickers said Sunday the sale of Cosworth was due to be completed
following regulatory approval by the European Commission.
	   Sir Colin Chandler, chairman of Vickers, said: ``Vickers has
secured excellent value from the sale of Rolls Royce Motor Cars and
Cosworth at a time when prospects for these businesses indicate
that they will benefit from a strong new automotive industry owner.
	   ``Moreover, within the Volkswagen Group, both Rolls Royce and
Cosworth will be able to grow and expand their unique blend of
British engineering expertise.''
	   Cosworth, which has an international reputation for advanced
automotive engine and power train technology, is involved in
racing, engineering, castings and manufacturing.
	   The purchase is seen as vital for Volkswagen after BMW announced
it would no longer supply engines to Rolls Royce from next year.
	   Last year, Audi produced about 546,000 cars with sales of more
than 22 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion). The German company employs
some 38,000 people.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana took
the sole lead at 8-0 as ozeki (champion) Musashimaru from Hawaii
suffered his first defeat Sunday, eighth day of the 15-day Nagoya
Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Tied with Musashimaru at 7-1 were yokozuna Akebono from Hawaii
and No. 9 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kotonowaka.

at 6-2.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, sent out winless No. 3 maegashira Gojoro
with hand thrusts.
	   New yokozuna Wakanohana improved to 6-2, coping with winless No.
4 maegashira Tochinowaka's initial sidestepping and pulling tactics
and bulldozing him out.
	   New sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai (6-2) charged
Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, with hand thrusts and pulled him
enough to send him stepping out of the ring.
	   Kotonowaka grabbed No. 14 maegashira Dewaarashi's belt and
forced him out, leaving Dewaarashi at 3-5.
	   Ozeki Takanonami attacked No. 5 maegashira Tochiazuma (5-3) with
an arm throw attempt, pushed him to the ring's edge and crushed him
out for his sixth victory against two defeats.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
suffered his fourth defeat against four victories as he was thrown
down by No. 7 maegashira Wakanojo (3-5).
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho (2-6), or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also
from Mongolia, was toppled by equally ranked Kinkaiyama (3-5).
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 10-ranked
Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, remained undefeated
at 4-0 by slapping down No. 6-ranked Tochifudo.
	   No. 27-ranked Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, was
thrust out by No. 30-ranked Tamanohana for his third defeat against
one victory.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Kim Jong Il moves to assume North Korea's presidency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on
Sunday announced the district from which he will run in upcoming
parliamentary elections, a move seen as preceding his rise to the
president's office.
	   Since the death of his father Kim Il Sung in 1994, the
56-year-old son has been running the Stalinist country as the
supreme military commander and head of the ruling Workers' Party.
	   But he has yet to assume full formal power by taking over the
other title left vacant by his father _ president.
	   North Korea's 680-member Supreme People's Assembly, its
rubber-stamp parliament, has the authority to elect the president,
and Kim Jong Il's move Sunday was seen as showing his willingness
to assume the top executive post, South Korean analysts said.
	   ``The abnormal state in North Korea may finally be coming to an
end,'' said Naewoe Press, a government-run news agency specializing
in North Korean news.
	   Elections for the North Korean parliament are scheduled for July
26.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim sent an
open letter to all voters Sunday, agreeing to be registered as a
candidate for ``constituency No. 666 for the 10th Supreme People's
Assembly.''
	   The move followed appeals by all North Korean parliamentary
constituencies nominating Kim as their only candidate last week.
	   Kim said he wanted to become a candidate for all constituencies
but North Korean law calls for one candidate for each constituency.
The KCNA report did not say where Kim's constituency No. 666 is
located.
	   South Korean monitors of North Korea said the slow but elaborate
process is aimed at building a personality cult around Kim Jong Il
like that enjoyed by his late father, who ruled the country for
nearly a half century as a demigod.
	   ``The 10th SPA (Supreme People's Assembly) is an important
political event that is of historic significance in strengthening
the people's government ...,'' KCNA quoted Kim's open letter as
saying.
	   Kim said all voters should take part in the upcoming elections,
in which only ruling party candidates are allowed to run. North
Korea boasts of a 100 percent voter turnout and 100 percent support
for candidates in all past elections, South Korean officials say.
	   North Korea watchers in Seoul say that Kim Jong Il is likely to
be elected president around Sept. 9, when the North celebrates the
50th anniversary of the founding of its government.
	   The last time North Korea held parliamentary elections was in
1990. The next elections, scheduled in 1994, were canceled because
of the death of Kim Il Sung.
	   The country has since been running without a legislative body.

Ozaki wins 107th career victory in Yonex Open Hiroshima
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki won his 107th
career title Sunday as he shot a 6-under-par 66 and edged
Australian Peter McWhinney by one shot in the Yonex Open Hiroshima.
	   Ozaki's final round of seven birdies and a bogey gave him an
18-under 270 total. McWhinney shot a 68 and finished at 271.
	   The victory, Ozaki's first of the season, was worth 18 million
yen (dlrs 128,000) from a purse of 100 million yen (dlrs 714,000).
	   ``I've been in too shaky a condition to win since the beginning
of the season,'' said the 51-year-old Ozaki. ``I now feel that it's
all over and an upward trend in my game has just started.''
	   Ozaki, who turned pro in 1970, has been the national tour's top
money earner in 11 seasons, including the last four in a row.
	   His 107 victories include 88 Japan PGA titles since the
association was founded in 1973, 18 other Japanese tournaments that
he won before 1973 or that are categorized as minor events, and a
1972 New Zealand PGA tournament.
	   McWhinney, who led overnight by one stroke, had a round of four
birdies.
	   ``I think I had a solid round today,'' said McWhinney, who was
seeking his first title of the season and second overall in Japan.
``But it's just a challenging job to beat Jumbo.''
	   Shingo Katayama and Akihito Yokoyama shot 66s and shared third
place at 272.

Cargo operations partially resume at Hong Kong's new airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cargo operations partially resumed Sunday at
Hong Kong's new airport, raising hopes that the costly halt on most
cargo shipments because of computer and mechanical glitches would
end soon.
	   A Frankfurt-bound cargo plane of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific
Airways left Chek Lap Kok airport early Sunday, government
spokeswoman Yvonne Leung said.
	   At the same time, the government said it was trying to gain
permission for airlines to temporarily use airports in the nearby
Portuguese enclave of Macau and the bordering Chinese city of
Shenzhen for cargo transport.
	   Macau has given approval, and a manager at Shenzhen's airport
said extra staff were deployed to prepare to handle about 500 tons
of cargo from Hong Kong daily, the government-owned Radio Hong Kong
reported.
	   These arrangements were part of government emergency measures
announced late Saturday to clear the cargo glut after a computer
systems breakdown at the cargo terminal at Chek Lap Kok paralyzed
air cargo shipments last Tuesday.
	   The territory's main air cargo handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, announced Friday it was halting almost all cargo
shipments until next Sunday.
	   Government officials said the cargo embargo could cut 0.1
percent off Hong Kong's gross domestic product just as the economy
had shrunk for the first time in 14 years.
	   Fears have been raised that Hong Kong's reputation as the
world's leading cargo hub would be jeopardized by the embargo.
	   Cathay Pacific spokeswoman Jemma Moore said the airline hopes to
resume up to 70 percent of export shipments at Chek Lap Kok as soon
as possible, and may use the Macau airport for incoming cargo.
	   ``Our plans are quite fluid at this point,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, the airport's passenger services have improved
steadily in the past week after early problems with delays in
disembarking and baggage handling.
	   On Sunday, thousands of local tourists jammed the airport,
resulting in long queues at restaurants and restrooms and a
temporary breakdown of escalators, Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   The government ordered a probe to find out what went wrong and
who was responsible for the debacle at the U.S. dlrs 20.1 billion
airport.
	   Chek Lap Kok, built on reclaimed land at the tip of Lautau
Island, opened last Monday to replace the 73-year-old Kai Tak
airport.

Body of suspected North Korean spy found on South Korean beach

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ All military and police forces on
South Korea's rugged east coast went on increased alert Sunday
after the body of a suspected North Korean spy was found washed
ashore.
	   ``The alert is in response to a probability that some North
Korean armed agents could have come ashore undetected,'' said Col.
Hwang Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered a thorough search for possible
infiltrators from North Korea, with which South Korea technically
remains in a state of war.
	   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed in the area to help in the
search.
	   Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek, cutting short his trip to the
United States, was to fly back to Seoul Monday. Chun, who met
Defense Secretary William Cohen in Washington last week, had
planned to return home Wednesday after visiting Hawaii.
	   The alert was issued after the body, clad in a wet-suit, was
found on a beach two kilometers (1.2 miles) from a major South
Korean naval base on the east coast.
	   ``From the various equipment and personal belongings found, it
appears certain that the body is that of an armed North Korean
agent,'' the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
	   The statement said the body was found washed ashore near
Donghae, 195 kilometers (117 miles) east of Seoul, and the military
immediately increased land and sea patrols in the area.
	   The military later put all units in the area on increased alert
after a self-propelled, semi-submersible craft, capable of helping
infiltrate up to five agents, was found near where the body was
found.
	   The craft, made of aluminum, was similar to ones used by North
Korean agents to infiltrate into South Korea in the past, military
officials said.
	   ``The size of the cone-shaped craft indicates that some armed
agents might have come ashore undetected,'' Hwang said.
	   Quoting military doctors, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the
body was believed to have been dead ``24 hours to 48 hours'' when
it was found.
	   The body was found along with a Czech-made machine gun, a hand
grenade, a portable oxygen tank, a dagger and a radio set, it said.
	   Lee Jang-soo, 29, who first spotted the body, told military
investigators that oxygen was still coming out of the portable
oxygen tank, indicating that the agent died while trying to come
ashore.
	   The military ruled out the possibility that the body was that of
an agent from a North Korean submarine found off the east coast
last month.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   At the time, officials said they believed the nine bodies
accounted for the submarine's entire complement of six crewmen and
three espionage agents.
	   In 1996, a shark-class North Korean submarine was found stranded
off South Korea's east coast, touching off a 53-day manhunt for the
craft's 26 occupants who came ashore.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.

Three Catholic children die in sectarian fire in Northern Ireland

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second parade application denied, more detail on
children's death, reaction; edits throughout to trim &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three Catholic children died in
an arson attack early Sunday, and Protestant protesters clashed in
hand-to-hand scuffles with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road.
	   Neighbors reported hearing a loud bang just before a house in
Ballymoney erupted in flames, killing brothers Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn, who ranged in age from 7 to 10. The boys' mother and
her Protestant boyfriend managed to escape, police said.
	   Ballmoney, about 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast, is
predominantly Protestant. It is not uncommon for mixed-religion
couples to be targeted for attacks throughout Northern Ireland.
	   Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy leader of the new Belfast
Assembly, said the boys had been ``sacrificed for the so-called
principles of the people of the north of Ireland, who have been
unable to resolve what is basically a parochial dispute'' over the
Protestant march.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' Mallon asked on BBC-TV.
``Does it take one child, two children, three children?''
	   Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said he
considered the boys' deaths a turning point in the increasingly
violent stalemate over the Orange Order's blocked attempts to march
down the predominantly Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Authorities urged Catholics not to retaliate.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party and the first minister of the Belfast
Assembly.
	   Members of the Orange Order _ stymied since July 5 from parading
down Garvaghy Road from their rural Drumcree church _ started
negotiating through intermediaries Saturday with the road's
Catholic residents.
	   But when the talks adjourned for the day without results, the
Orangemen announced a second application had been submitted to a
government-appointed parades commission requesting an identical
route _ with a departure time of 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) Sunday.
	   The commission announced Sunday morning that the second
application also had been denied.
	   Thousands of Orangemen have remained encamped outside the steel
and barbed-wire barricades in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms)
southwest of Belfast, staging increasingly bold attacks on police
once night falls.
	   Overnight Sunday, riot police fought hand-to-hand with hooded
demonstrators who had ripped away parts of the barricade.
	   Protesters launched fireworks directly at the security forces
and threw bricks and stones. The police answered with plastic
bullets, and arrested at least two people.
	   Twenty protesters were injured by a barrage of plastic bullets
overnight Saturday, including a 26-year-old man who remained
hospitalized in critical condition and a 21-year-old female college
student who lost an eye.
	   Orange Order spokesman David Jones said late Saturday that any
further violence would not be his group's fault if the second
application was denied.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the parades
commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' he said.
	   It was not clear when the indirect talks between the Orangemen
and Catholic residents would resume, but authorities said it would
be after Sunday.
	   Police already had feared tensions would peak this weekend with
the 12th of July holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the
defeat of Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   The streets of normally bustling Belfast began emptying early
Saturday afternoon in anticipation of more trouble, and dozens of
holiday bonfires and fireworks lit the sky as night settled in.
	   On the streets of one Protestant enclave, children toasted
marshmallows over the flames; on the streets of another, they
watched gleefully as the flames from a hijacked car, torched by a
gasoline bomb, leaped higher and higher.

Layoffs reach record level; Singapore minister warns off more to
</HEADLINE>
come &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Caught up in Southeast Asia's slump, Singapore
already has suffered a record number of layoffs, The Sunday Times
reported, and the country's manpower minister warned that more
terminations are expected.
	   About 20,000 workers have lost their jobs so far this year, the
newspaper said, a figure equaling the all-time high during
Singapore's last recession in 1985.
	   Minister for Manpower Lee Boon Yang added Sunday that ``this
year's retrenchment figure is likely to exceed 25,000.''
	   Late last month, Lee said total layoffs could reach 30,000 this
year depending on the regional situation and on global demand for
electronics, a major component in Singapore's vulnerable economy.
	   Speaking at a joint government-union seminar on the country's
labor situation, he said Sunday that regional trade is continuing
to slow while demand for the country's electronic products is still
slackening.
	   ``The regional crisis has led to reduction in external and
internal demands,'' Lee explained. ``Companies have to restructure
and downsize to stay afloat.''
	   At the end of June, the government reduced its growth forecast
for 1998 to between .5 and 1.5 percent. However, many private
economists and analysts have predicted that the resource-poor
city-state of 3.1 million people will not be able to avoid outright
recession this year.
	   Even the prime minister has conceded that recession this year is
a possibility, and he recently added that a recession in 1999 was
now likely.
	   To help businesses cope with the slowdown, Singapore has
unveiled a package of special economic measures worth 2 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.17 billion), including property and other
tariff rebates.
	   Employers have also been advised to restrain wage increases,
though in practice many salaries have already been frozen or even
cut.
	   Lee said Singapore must restructure its economy away from a
low-cost manufacturing base, since competing neighbors like
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia enjoy much lower labor costs.
	   ``The only option available to us is to quickly move up the
value chain to attract and develop knowledge- and skill-intensive
industries'' such as wafer-fabrication, petrochemicals, transport
equipment and precision instruments industries, he said.
	   Lee added, however, that Singapore is suffering from a shortage
of qualified workers. He said the government will continue to
encourage the learning of new skills through the Skills
Redevelopment Program, in which 100 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
58.5 million) has already been allocated.
	   ``Workers must be prepared to tighten their belts,'' he
concluded. ``Those who were retrenched and lack skills for higher
value added jobs must be prepared to accept lower paying jobs. Most
importantly, all workers must accept skills upgrading.''

Computer hackers pose new problem in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is running into problems with hackers,
computer criminals who are using the country's growing passion for
the Internet to steal and cause mischief, an official newspaper
said Sunday.
	   In one case, a hacker posted a pornographic picture on an
Internet page about the southern Chinese province of Guizhou. A
younger hacker from the financial center of Shanghai also illegally
broke into a stock trading center's computer system and stole
information, the Economic Daily said.
	   Hackers have also set up their own free Internet accounts or
stolen regular users' passwords and used their accounts.
	   ``The damage wreaked by hackers does not stop at economic
losses. There are also inestimable political and social effects,''
the newspaper said.
	   While encouraging the growth of the Internet as a high-tech tool
that can contribute to China's economic development, the government
also is anxious to ensure that the Internet is not used to subvert
Communist Party rule.
	   Internet growth, however, has been rapid. The Economic Daily
said China now has more than 1 million Internet users.
	   The newspaper urged Internet managers and users to ``clearly
recognize that hackers are a group of outlaws'' and to quickly
report cases of hacking and to protect any evidence.
	   It also urged people to chose computer passwords that are hard
to break, thus closing doors to hackers.

Democracy activist urges calm, calls for change in Nigeria

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Urging calm, but pushing for the end of
military rule in Nigeria, a leading pro-democracy activist on
Sunday said the death of Moshood Abiola should be a catalyst for
change, not a trigger for violence.
	   Abiola, the country's leading political prisoner and a civilian
politician, was buried Saturday. He died Tuesday of an apparent
heart attack, the preliminary results of an autopsy indicate.
	   ``I'm strangely relieved that the results of the autopsy didn't
show any foul play by the military junta,'' said Olisa Agbakoba,
the national coordinator of the United Action for Democracy.
	   He said the military junta should now step up plans to hand
power over to civilians to help forestall a return to violence that
resulted from Abiola's death.
	   Abiola's death while still in prison triggered days of rioting
and violence that left at least 55 people dead and 400 under
arrest.
	   The unrest dissipated over the weekend and relative calm has
returned to the country's commercial capital, Lagos.
	   Agbakoba said Abiola's death should not be used as an excuse for
violence.
	   Although his family suspected his death was not from natural
causes, a team of visiting pathologists say preliminary findings
show he died of heart attack.
	   ``That he died of medical neglect and not because of the junta
means we can have a little bit of relief,'' Agbakoba said.
	   Abiola died in custody while meeting with a group of visiting
U.S. officials. He had languished in prison for four years,
although his release had been expected soon.
	   Outrage at Abiola's death threatens to fracture the country
along ethnic lines. Abiola, an immensely popular southern
businessman from the Yoruba clan, posed a serious threat to the
ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria, the upper
echelons of power are controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
	   Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from
their Hausa and Fulani compatriots, long have resented what they
consider the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other
minerals _ by northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since the death of Nigeria's ruthless dictator Gen. Sani Abacha
on June 8, the new military junta has been scrambling to gain
public trust. Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has released a group of political prisoners and promised
to free the rest. He also has vowed _ albeit vaguely _ to return
the country to civilian rule.

Oba wins Toyo Suisan Ladies Hokkaido
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITA-HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Michie Oba shot a 6-under-par 66
Sunday and won her first career victory by one stroke in the Toyo
Suisan Ladies Hokkaido.
	   For her best score ever, the 25-year-old local favorite sank six
birdies in a bogey-free final round. That gave her at a 6-under 210
total, one shot ahead of overnight leader Ko Woo-soon of South
Korea, who struggled to a 75 for 211.
	   Oba was eight strokes behind Ko overnight.
	   For her first victory in four years as a pro, Oba earned 9
million yen (dlrs 64,000) from a purse of 50 million yen (dlrs
357,000).
	   Oba's previous best finish was a second-place tie in the Miyagi
TV Cup Ladies in 1996.
	   Ko was seeking her first victory of the season and sixth overall
on the Japan tour.
	   Kumiko Hiyoshi shot a 71 and was alone in third place at 212,
followed by Nayoko Yoshikawa and Yuri Fudo, who fired 74s and
shared fourth at 213.

Voter turnout up as Japan holds key parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls closing, late turnout figures &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters turned out in higher than expected numbers
Sunday for parliamentary elections seen as a referendum on Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's efforts to pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The bigger turnout in the upper house elections could mean
trouble for Hashimoto _ analysts have predicted that more votes
might translate into more ballots cast in protest against
Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   Hashimoto's party is in no danger of losing its hold on power
because of its strong majority in the lower house. Hashimoto
himself was not up for re-election.
	   But the elections, for half the upper house's 252 seats, are an
important test of whether voters hold Hashimoto and his party
responsible for Japan's economic malaise.
	   If the ruling party does poorly, Hashimoto will be under intense
pressure to resign.
	   Polling closed at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT) _ two hours later than usual
due to concerns over falling voter turnout in recent elections. The
results of about 90 percent of the races were expected by 1 a.m.
Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   According to the Home Affairs Ministry, 44.51 percent of Japan's
99.4 million registered voters had cast ballots by early Sunday
evening, assuring a higher turnout than the total 44.52 percent who
voted in the last upper house election three years ago.
	   Sunday's elections were the first for the upper house since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996. With record-high
unemployment, rising bankruptcies, and party members tainted by
bribery scandals, the ruling party had geared up for a rough ride.
	   ``I think I did as much as I can do,'' Hashimoto told reporters
Sunday morning. ``I really hope for a good result.''
	   Opposition parties urged voters to send a message that they are
unhappy with the way Hashimoto has handled the economy, and
stressed that Japan's doldrums have aggravated a financial crisis
throughout Asia.
	   ``As long as the LDP is in power, the economy will only get
worse,'' Akira Nagaoka, 34, said after voting in central Tokyo.
Nagaoka said he supported the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition group.
	   Other voters, however, said they felt the Liberal Democrats were
the safest bet.
	   ``Japan needs steady policies,'' said 78-year-old salesman Kunio
Kanno.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto, who is scheduled to leave for Washington and Paris
next week to explain his economic policies, also embarrassed
himself on the tax issue by repeatedly flip-flopping on the
campaign trail.
	   At one point last week he said he supported ``permanent tax
reforms'' and then backtracked two days later. He now says he
supports cuts.
	   Hashimoto needs to win 61 seats _ the break-even point _ if he
is to claim a victory.
	   Just breaking even, however, would leave the ruling party eight
seats short of a majority, forcing it to seek outside partners to
pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
The LDP's previous partners have distanced themselves from the
ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   The decline of the Socialists, who until a few years ago were
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party held 38 seats in the upper house going
into the election. But Kan's personal popularity has been clouded
by the party's vague stance on major issues.

Pope, on vacation, issues cautions about technological age
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LORENZAGO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II, on vacation amid the
magnificent Alps, on Sunday invited people to make time during the
age of technology to enjoy the beauties of nature.
	   Some 1,500 people -- roughly double the population of this
mountain hamlet -- turned out on a hillside for the pope's first
public appearance since he arrived in the Alps Wednesday night to
begin a 13-day vacation.
	   John Paul took the occasion to draw on his recent admonition to
Catholics to be more respectful of the commandment to keep Sunday a
special day for the faith as well as an occasion for wholesome
relaxation.
	   ``Our life, in the age of technology, risks becoming ever more
anonymous and a function of the productive process,'' the pope
said. ``Man thus becomes incapable of enjoying the beauties of
creation, and, even more, of reading in them the reflection of the
face of God.''
	   The Vatican has scaled down the pope's once active schedule
because of his infirmities and his 78 years, and John Paul has had
to give up his long hikes. Now he is driven to an isolated area
where he can take briefer strolls and pause to enjoy the scenery.

Russian prime minister works to finalize financial bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister entered negotiations over
a financial bailout Sunday, hoping to put the finishing touches on
a loan package to buoy Russia's sinking economy.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko met with a top International
Monetary Fund official, John Odling-Smee, in an effort to reach
agreement before financial markets open Monday.
	   A top aide to lead negotiator Anatoly Chubais said Saturday that
most of an agreement was in place, but talks continued on a few
remaining issues, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russian officials have been saying for days that an agreement on
a dlrs 10-15 billion IMF bailout is imminent.
	   In addition, the World Bank has agreed to speed talks on a dlrs
600-800 million loan that were supposed to be concluded this coming
October. The loan would be used to finance structural economic
reforms.
	   Any loan agreements were likely to be conditional. Before going
forward, both lenders have indicated that key fiscal legislation
must be voted into law by the opposition-led Russian parliament.
	   Lawmakers have resisted many of the measures, especially those
that would raise taxes. They are scheduled to hold a special
session this week to consider the measures again.
	   In May, investors began fleeing Russia's financial markets in
droves, spooked by several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of
Russia's oil exports, a wave of labor protests, and general
skittishness leftover from the Asian financial crisis.
	   All together, the stock market has lost about half its value
since the beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been
spending down its reserves to support the ruble.
	   So far the crisis has not affected ordinary consumers, but a
ruble devaluation would raise prices across the board and could
stir social unrest. The Kremlin insists it will not allow a
devaluation.
	   Much of an IMF loan is expected to go to shore up the Central
Bank's reserves, as well has help meet Russia's short-term loan
payments, which make up about 30 percent of the federal budget.
	   Kiriyenko has developed an austerity program designed to earn
the IMF's approval. Key measures include bills to straighten out
Russia's complex tax system and improve the government's dismal tax
collection.
	   But parliament says common folk have suffered enough from
Russia's economic travails, and are reluctant to introduce sales
taxes and other measures that treat rich and poor alike.

China urges Portugal to take steps against crime in Macau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Portugal Sunday to take tougher
measures against gang-related crime in Macau to ensure the
Portuguese colony's smooth handover to Chinese rule next year.
	   A committee picked by China to prepare for Macau's Dec. 20,
1999, handover said it ``took note'' of Portuguese authorities'
measures ``to benefit the protection of social stability'' in the
enclave, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   But the committee also ``hopes Macau's Portuguese government
will take even more effective steps and clamp down harder on the
criminal activities of evil forces,'' Xinhua said.
	   Portuguese officials are ``entirely responsible'' for social
order in Macau until next year's handover, the committee pointed
out in a statement at the end of a three-day meeting in Beijing.
	   A spate of shooting deaths, arson attacks and other acts of
violence believed by police to be linked to gang wars over Macau's
lucrative gambling industry have shaken the tiny enclave as it
moves toward Chinese rule.
	   In May, Macau's Portuguese governor chided Beijing for its lax
reaction to the troubles and called for a tightening of border
controls. Last week, a Chinese police chief denied claims that
Chinese officers had given support to Macau's criminal underworld.
	   The Chinese committee preparing for Macau's handover also
criticized Portuguese administrators for what it said were sluggish
efforts to replace Portuguese civil servants with locally born
Macanese.
	   The delay ``is not beneficial for Macau's stable transition and
smooth handover of government power,'' the committee said, adding
that it was ``deeply concerned.''

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three Catholic children died in
an arson attack early Sunday, and Protestant protesters clashed in
hand-to-hand scuffles with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road. Neighbors reported hearing a loud bang
just before a house in Ballymoney erupted in flames, killing
brothers Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, who ranged in age from 7 to
10. The boys' mother and her Protestant boyfriend managed to
escape, police said. Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy leader of
the new Northern Ireland Assembly, said the boys had been
``sacrificed for the so-called principles of the people of the
north of Ireland, who have been unable to resolve what is basically
a parochial dispute'' over the march. (Northern Ireland)

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ All military and police forces on
South Korea's rugged east coast went on increased alert Sunday
after the body of a suspected North Korean spy was found washed
ashore. President Kim Dae-jung ordered a thorough search for
possible infiltrators from North Korea, with which South Korea
technically remains in a state of war. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was
imposed in the area to help in the search. The alert was issued
after the body, clad in a wet-suit, was found on a beach two
kilometers (1.2 miles) from a major South Korean naval base on the
east coast. (Koreas-Body Found)

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Urging calm, but pushing for the end of
military rule in Nigeria, a leading pro-democracy activist on
Sunday said the death of Moshood Abiola should be a catalyst for
change, not a trigger for violence. Abiola, the country's leading
political prisoner and a civilian politician, was buried Saturday.
He died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack, the preliminary
results of an autopsy indicate. Olisa Agbakoba, the national
coordinator of the United Action for Democracy, said the military
junta should now step up plans to hand power over to civilians to
help forestall a return to the rioting and violence that resulted
from Abiola's death. (Nigeria)

Leader says softer U.S. tone should not deceive Iranians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Overtures by the United States toward Iran
are only political maneuvers, and Iranians should not be deceived
by them, the country's supreme leader said Sunday.
	   ``The lenient tone you see recently is little more than a
hypocritical political undertaking,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told
an audience that included President Mohammad Khatami, the moderate
cleric who has sought better ties with the United States.
	   Khamenei said Washington had become more conciliatory partly
``because of a wrong understanding of Iran's domestic affairs.''
	   Khamenei, long a vociferous opponent of the United States, leads
a hard-line faction locked in a mounting power struggle with
moderates clustered around the popular Khatami.
	   In the speech, which marked the birthday of Islam's Prophet
Mohammed, Khamenei said the United States would not give up its
``harsh and rude enmity toward Iran'' as long as Iran kept its
Muslim identity and remained committed to Palestinians in their
struggle against Israeli occupation.
	   His comments were broadcast on state-run Tehran radio.
	   Five months after his inauguration in August, Khatami called for
non-official exchanges with the United States as a way of lessening
hostilities since the 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled the
U.S.-supported shah and began an era of tension and recrimination.
	   In recent months, attitudes on both sides have softened.
	   In June, President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright spoke of positive changes in Iran since
Khatami's election that could eventually lead to normal relations.
	   Following those remarks, Khatami said, ``We judge their
sincerity by action and not only words.''
	   The United States has long considered Iran a rogue state that
should be isolated. It says that it sponsors international
terrorism and is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iran denies the charges and blames the United States for trying
to exert its will on the rest of the world by virtue of its power.

Myanmar soccer fans wary of electricity failures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ For many soccer fans in Myanmar, the main
question Sunday was not who would win the World Cup final between
France and Brazil, but where to watch the game on television
without fear of a power failure.
	   Due to frequent blackouts recently in the capital, soccer fans _
and gamblers _ have been gathering at homes of friends with power
generators to watch the late-night broadcasts.
	   The government says the power shortage, noticeable since May, is
due to low levels of water in hydroelectric dams caused by last
year's drought.
	   In one relatively affluent residential neighborhood, electricity
has been supplied on an eight hours-on, eight hours-off basis for
the past few days.
	   In an evident effort to keep people happy, however, the
government has managed to supply most if not all areas with
electricity late at night, enabling them to watch live World Cup
broadcasts on state television.
	   Showing the games is also a special for state television, since
it usually stops broadcasting at 10 p.m.
	   The broadcasts were presumably paid for by the sponsors of the
broadcasts, London cigarettes, a brand belonging to the British
tobacco company Rothmans. The government of Myanmar, also called
Burma, has economic problems and can ill afford to spend the money
needed to secure broadcast rights.
	   Some business-minded people mean run small ``video halls,''
charging 30-60 kyats (dlrs 0.075-0.15 at free market prices) for
each game. Coffee shops near these video halls, normally closed at
such hours, do brisk business before and after the matches.
	   Roadside vendors also have been doing good business selling
posters of soccer stars fetching 100 kyats (dlrs 0.25) apiece.
	   Betting on the games has been popular, especially in Chinatown
and among the Indian business community in downtown Yangon.
	   Most bets are made in cash, but some people bet their cars and
even their cellular phones. The phones _ hard to obtain at the
official price of around dlrs 1,500, or 600,000 kyats _ are sold
for 2 million kyats on the black market.
	   Though there have been no reports of World Cup-related troubles
in Yangon, there have been instances when local authorities
cautioned soccer fans were against making too much noise.

Australian legislator's car attacked in protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Protesters banged placards on a car
carrying right-wing legislator Pauline Hanson on Sunday, yelling
``racist scum'' and slowing her vehicle to a crawl.
	   It was One Nation leader Hanson's first public appearance on a
trip to Western Australia. Two people were arrested in the incident
as Hanson was leaving a meeting, but she was not injured.
	   About 150 protesters were camped outside the High Wycombe
Community Center, waving placards and chanting, ``Justice yes,
racism no,'' as Hanson spoke for an hour to a packed hall.
	   One Nation, in its first test at the ballot box since its
creation about 18 months ago, attracted about 23 percent of the
vote in a June 13 Queensland election, winning 11 seats _ but no
power in government _ in the state's Parliament.
	   Hanson claims Australia is becoming ``Asianized'' and wants to
severely cut immigration and subject applicants to an
English-language test.

Estrada orders talks with Taiwanese authorities on Filipino

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a move that could anger China,
President Joseph Estrada said Sunday he has ordered local officials
to hold talks with Taiwanese authorities on the plight of Filipino
workers in Taiwan.
	   A statement issued by Estrada's office Sunday said talks between
officials of the two sides were under way on what to do about
recruiters who charge excessive fees for Taiwan-based Filipino
workers.
	   ``The president is aware of the problems facing Filipino
contract workers in Taiwan,'' Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said in
the statement. ``Perhaps a government-to-government arrangement is
possible so that Filipinos can get a better deal while working in
Taiwan.''
	   China opposes any official exchanges with Taiwan by countries
with which Beijing has diplomatic relations.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to its
own foreign relations. The Philippines has diplomatic relations
with Beijing, but maintains strong unofficial ties with Taipei.
	   In January, China strongly protested a reported meeting between
former President Fidel Ramos and Taiwan Premier Vincent Siew, who
visited the Manila headquarters of the Asian Development Bank.
	   Before he was inaugurated as president on June 30, Estrada met
with Chan Hsien-chin, a Taiwanese government representative in the
Philippines, to discuss problems of Filipino workers in Taiwan,
Reyes said.
	   Filipino and Thai factory workers demonstrated Friday outside a
Taiwanese government office in charge of foreign labor to seek help
in preventing recruiters from charging exorbitant fees to job
applicants, Reyes said.
	   Estrada, who won the May 11 presidential elections on a pro-poor
platform, has said he could not possibly bring back millions of
Filipinos laboring overseas but has pledged to seek better working
condition for them.

Israel, Palestinians try to arrange meeting at U.S. request
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, efforts are underway to arrange a meeting
between Israel's defense minister and Yasser Arafat's deputy, a top
Palestinian official said Sunday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Albright
had suggested Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
might succeed where American mediators have failed in resolving an
impasse over Israel's overdue West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a top Palestinian security official, confirmed
there were efforts to arrange a meeting ``very soon'' between Abbas
and Mordechai.
	   Albright said Friday that the United States could not resolve
the differences between the two sides unless they talked to each
other.
	   On Sunday, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh accused the
Palestinians of avoiding direct talks.
	   ``They knew that as long as they didn't enter into direct
dialogue with Israel, they could avoid fulfilling their commitments
and hide behind American ideas,'' he told Israel's Army Radio.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi, however, said Israel had not
responded to recent Palestinian attempts to arrange a meeting.
	   ``Later we heard that the Israelis were not interested in
meeting because they didn't have a mandate from the prime minister
to reach agreement,'' he said.
	   ``We have no problem with bilateral talks,'' said chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``But what do we talk about?''
	   Obstacles to agreement include Israel's demand that the
Palestinians extradite suspects accused of terror attacks against
Israel and take further action to revise sections of the PLO
charter that call for the destruction of the Jewish state, the
charter, and continuing disagreement over the extent of the troop
withdrawal.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians would not renegotiate the U.S.
proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, which he said already
represented a significant compromise from the Palestinian position
that they should get 40 percent. Nor would they hand over
Palestinian suspects to Israel, he said.
	   The Palestinian revision of the charter was also not subject to
negotiation, he said. ``When the Palestinians say that it has been
finalized, that means it is final,'' he said.
	   Erekat said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ``knows
very well that the articles have been nullified,'' and that the
Palestinians had worked with the U.S. State Department for three
months to specify which sections of the charter had been annulled.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet said earlier that bilateral negotiations
would resume only when Israel accepted the U.S. initiative.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement on a disputed hilltop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

Lord Rayner, former chairman of Marks and Spencer, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lord Rayner, who oversaw a major expansion of the
retail giant Marks and Spencer and used his business skills to help
streamline government, has died at the age of 72.
	   The company announced that he died on June 26 but gave no cause
of death.
	   Rayner started on the shop floor at Marks and Spencer in 1953
and climbed to the top, serving as chairman from 1984 until his
retirement in 1991.
	   He was the first head of Marks and Spencer to be neither Jewish
nor a member of the founding Sieff and Marks families.
	   The son of a building supply merchant, Derek George Rayner was
born in Norwich and studied theology at Cambridge University's
Selwyn College. He considered entering the ministry but decided he
wasn't suited for it.
	   After commanding a Royal Air Force regiment from 1946-48, he
began his business career, initially managing a small retail
business. After it failed for lack of capital in 1953, he joined
Marks and Spencer.
	   In the early 1970s, he used his retailing experience to
centralize defense procurement as an adviser to former Prime
Minister Edward Heath. He returned to Marks and Spencer in 1973 as
joint managing director, with a knighthood honoring his work.
	   One of Margaret Thatcher's first acts after she became prime
minister in 1979 was to make Rayner her adviser ``on improving
efficiency and eliminating waste in government.'' The 135 studies
that his unit carried out saved millions of pounds (dollars) for
Thatcher's Conservative government. Rayner also served as deputy
chairman of the Civil Service Pay Board from 1978-80.
	   In 1982, he left the government and returned to Marks and
Spencer the following year as chief executive. He received a life
peerage in the House of Lords in 1983 for his government service.
	   When Rayner became chairman in 1984, Marks and Spencer was
beginning to lose its supremacy, with sales of clothing and
household goods in decline.
	   He introduced strict financial controls and embarked on a major
expansion program _ launching a charge card, starting specialist
stores, expanding to suburban shopping sites, introducing new
lines, and developing the company's St. Michael brand overseas.
	   Rayner, a bachelor, left no survivors, the company said.

Ukraine's Communist leader calls for overthrow of Kuchma's regime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Communist leader called for a
non-violent overthrow of an ``anti-people'' regime, saying the
former Soviet republic should return to Soviet ways, a news agency
reported Sunday.
	   ``Sooner or later, Ukraine will return to the socialist
development path,'' Communist Party chief Petro Symonenko told his
followers at a meeting of the party's ruling plenum in Kiev on
Saturday.
	   Symonenko, one of President Leonid Kuchma's most serious foes,
also warned of a ``silent degradation'' awaiting Ukraine unless
Kiev curtails its moves toward market reforms, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Only the ouster of the anti-people regime from power by
constitutional methods can save Ukraine from a catastrophe,''
Symonenko said.
	   Ukraine has experienced numerous difficulties in its economic
development and Communists have tried to capitalize on the
hardships faced by its more than 50 million people.
	   In parliamentary elections in March, Symonenko's party captured
over a quarter of seats in the new Verkhovna Rada, or parliament,
and the Communist leader is looking ahead to presidential elections
in the fall of 1999.

U.N. team arrives in Iraq to take warhead parts for testing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. team of arms monitors arrived Sunday
to transport to European laboratories parts of missile warheads
that may have been loaded with deadly VX gas.
	   An American laboratory last month determined that Iraq loaded
the gas into warheads before the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq disputed the
findings, and the United Nations agreed to send the parts to
laboratories in France and Switzerland for testing.
	   The 15-member team, led by German Horst Reeps, includes three
scientists from France and three from Switzerland, said Janet
Sullivan, the spokeswoman for the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq.
The team is expected to leave Baghdad on Thursday.
	   Some experts on the team will also conduct talks with Iraqi
chemical weapons officials on the scope of Iraq's work with VX, a
gas so deadly a few drops can kill, Sullivan said.
	   Reeps, the top U.N. chemical arms investigator, will report to
chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, on the meetings.
	   Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX but denies that it ever
turned it into a weapon. Butler has said he has no doubt about the
finding of the U.S. laboratory.
	   Iraq's state-run al-Qadissiya newspaper, in a front-page
editorial Sunday, said Butler ``once again exposes his true
identity ... as an obedient tool in the hands of the U.S.
administration.''
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 will
not be lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify that Baghdad has
eliminated all its banned weapons.

Three Catholic children die in sectarian fire in Northern Ireland

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of boys' screaming &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three Catholic children died in
an arson attack early Sunday, and Protestant protesters clashed in
hand-to-hand scuffles with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road.
	   Neighbors reported hearing a loud bang just before a house in
Ballymoney erupted in flames, killing brothers Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn. The boys' mother and her Protestant boyfriend managed
to escape, police said.
	   Ballmoney, about 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast, is
predominantly Protestant. It is not uncommon for mixed-religion
couples to be targeted for attacks throughout Northern Ireland.
	   A distraught neighbor, who asked not to be identified for fear
of reprisals, said she heard 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason screaming as the fire raced through the house.

Colombian delegates meet with rebel group in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombian civic leaders converged in Mainz
before heading to a secret location for talks with the country's
second-largest rebel group Sunday, in another tentative step toward
ending Latin America's longest-running civil war.
	   The four-day meeting with envoys of the 5,000-member National
Liberation Army, or ELN, is to prepare for direct talks between the
rebels and Colombian president-elect Andres Pastrana.
	   The Germany talks have been overshadowed by Pastrana's suprise
meeting at home Thursday with leaders of Colombia's largest rebel
group and his vow to begin negotiations with them within 90 days of
his Aug. 7 inauguration.
	   But both events are adding momentum to peace expectations among
millions of Colombians who want an end to the country's 34-year
war.
	   Still, talks delegates warned against unrealistic hopes that
they will return from Germany with peace in hand.
	   ``We don't want to generate any false expectations,'' said Sabas
Pretelt, head of a leading Colombian industry association and a
member of the peace commission set up the talks.
	   Pretelt gathered in a hotel lobby in Mainz, near Frankfurt, with
other Colombian delegates _ from industry, labor, social agencies
and the Roman Catholic church _ before heading to the undisclosed
talks site.
	   The group is meeting with rebels, already at the site, under an
initiative begun earlier this year by the outgoing government of
President Ernesto Samper. The incoming Pastrana did not send an
official representative.
	   ``The purpose of this meeting is to open the channels for
dialogue,'' said Hernando Hernandez, leader of Colombia's USO labor
union. ``We are urgently seeking peace for Colombia.''
	   No rebel delegates were available for comment.
	   The ELN's main rallying cry has been against foreign
exploitation of Colombia's natural resources, and it often attacks
oil pipelines and kidnaps industry executives. Based mainly in
Colombia's northeast oil-producing regions, the ELN's income is
largely from extortion and kidnapping.
	   The ELN is far less prodigious militarily than the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and is seen as far
more likely to be willing to disarm in return for political
concessions.
	   Germany's Roman Catholic church, coordinating the talks jointly
with Colombian colleagues, has insisted the meeting remain as
closed as possible, saying publicity could hamper their outcome.
	   ``The original intention was to have the talks entirely in
secret, the kind you find out about only afterward, like the Oslo
talks that led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,'' church
spokesman Rudolf Hammerschmidt said.
	   Participants have scheduled a news conference at Wednesday's
close of talks.

Chechen leader demands colleague's release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prominent Chechen leader threatened Sunday to
retaliate against the neighboring republic of Dagestan unless a
colleague is released from jail, a news agency reported.
	   In a news conference, Shamil Basayev said he would give
Dagestani police 48 hours to release Adalo Aliyev, deputy chairman
of the Congress of the Peoples of Chechnya and Dagestan, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Aliyev was detained Saturday when he tried to cross the border
from Dagestan into Chechnya with a gun, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Basayev, a former guerrilla leader and Chechen prime minister,
is chairman of the congress. He told reporters that the gun, a
Makarov handgun, had been presented to him by the Chechen
leadership in honor of his ``active moral support for the Chechen
people during the war.''
	   Aliyev was arrested as he headed to a meeting of the congress'
leadership in Grozny, the Chechen capital. Little is known about
the congress or its goals. When it met in Grozny in April, Dagestan
described it as an ``unfriendly step with regard to Dagestan.''
	   Both Dagestan and Chechnya are nominally Russian republics in
the Caucasus region, although Chechnya describes itself as an
independent state. Both have been plagued by lawlessness and
violence in the years since Chechnya's 1994-96 war of secession
with Russia.

Leader says softer U.S. tone should not deceive Iranians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The United States' overtures toward Iran are
only political maneuvers, and Iranians should not be deceived by
them, the country's supreme leader said Sunday.
	   ``The lenient tone you see recently is little more than a
hypocritical political undertaking,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told
an audience that included President Mohammad Khatami, the moderate
cleric who has sought closer ties with the United States.
	   Khamenei said Washington had become more conciliatory partly
``because of a wrong understanding of Iran's domestic affairs.''
	   Khamenei, long a vociferous opponent of the United States, leads
a hard-line faction locked in a mounting power struggle with
moderates clustered around the popular Khatami.
	   In the speech, which marked the birthday of the Muslim prophet
Mohammed, Khamenei said the United States would not give up its
``harsh and rude enmity toward Iran'' as long as Iran kept its
Muslim identity and remained committed to Palestinians in their
struggle against Israeli occupation.
	   His comments were broadcast on state-run Tehran radio.
	   Five months after his inauguration in August, Khatami called for
cultural exchanges with the United States as a way of lessening
hostilities since the 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled the
U.S.-supported shah and began an era of tension and recrimination.
	   In recent months, attitudes on both sides have softened.
	   In June, U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said positive changes in Iran since Khatami's
election could eventually lead to normal relations.
	   Following those remarks, Khatami said, ``We judge their
sincerity by action and not only words.''
	   The United States has long considered Iran a rogue state that
should be isolated. It says that Iran sponsors international
terrorism and is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iran denies the charges and blames the United States for trying
to exert its will on the rest of the world.

Israel, Palestinians try to arrange meeting at U.S. request
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS scuffles, arrests in last 2 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, efforts are underway to arrange a meeting
between Israel's defense minister and Yasser Arafat's deputy, a top
Palestinian official said Sunday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Albright
had suggested Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
might succeed where American mediators have failed in resolving an
impasse over Israel's overdue West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a top Palestinian security official, confirmed
there were efforts to arrange a meeting ``very soon'' between Abbas
and Mordechai.
	   Albright said Friday that the United States could not resolve
the differences between the two sides unless they talked to each
other.
	   On Sunday, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh accused the
Palestinians of avoiding direct talks.
	   ``They knew that as long as they didn't enter into direct
dialogue with Israel, they could avoid fulfilling their commitments
and hide behind American ideas,'' he told Israel's Army Radio.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi, however, said Israel had not
responded to recent Palestinian attempts to arrange a meeting.
	   ``Later we heard that the Israelis were not interested in
meeting because they didn't have a mandate from the prime minister
to reach agreement,'' he said.
	   ``We have no problem with bilateral talks,'' said chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``But what do we talk about?''
	   Obstacles to agreement include Israel's demand that the
Palestinians extradite suspects accused of terror attacks against
Israel and take further action to revise sections of the PLO
charter that call for the destruction of the Jewish state, the
charter, and continuing disagreement over the extent of the troop
withdrawal.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians would not renegotiate the U.S.
proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, which he said already
represented a significant concession from the Palestinian position
that they should get 40 percent. Nor would they hand over
Palestinian suspects to Israel, he said.
	   The Palestinian revision of the charter was also not subject to
negotiation, he said. ``When the Palestinians say that it has been
finalized, that means it is final,'' he said.
	   Erekat said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ``knows
very well that the articles have been nullified,'' and that the
Palestinians had worked with the U.S. State Department for three
months to specify which sections of the charter had been annulled.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet said earlier that bilateral negotiations
would resume only when Israel accepted the U.S. initiative.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement on a disputed hilltop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   On Sunday, police arrested a minor from a Jewish settlement in
the hills around the West Bank city of Hebron on suspicion of
attacking Arabs in an incident in the city 10 days ago, and an Arab
girl was arrested for throwing a knife toward a border policeman in
Jerusalem's Old City, police said.
	   On Saturday night, three residents of Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox
Sanhedria neighborhood were briefly detained for throwing stones at
Palestinian cars outside Hebron, police said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with exit polls indicating ruling party headed for
defeat &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Exit polls conducted by Japanese media indicated
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his ruling party were on their
way to a major defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday.
	   If the ruling party were to do as poorly as the exit polls
suggested, Hashimoto would be under intense pressure to resign.
	   Voters turned out in higher than expected numbers for the
elections, seen as a referendum on Hashimoto's efforts to pull
Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Hashimoto and other Liberal Democratic Party leaders had said
they wanted to keep their current strength by winning 61 of the 126
seats contested in the elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   But exit polls conducted by major Japanese television networks
indicated the party would fall far short of that goal. The Asahi
television network said the Liberal Democrats were more likely to
win only 40 seats; Nihon TV, another major commercial network,
predicted 46.
	   Hashimoto's party is in no danger of losing its hold on power
because of its strong majority in the lower house. Hashimoto
himself was not up for re-election.

As Mandela helps bury the dead, killings continue in strife-torn

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela went
to a violence-wracked town Sunday to help bury victims of a
massacre, but amid appeals for peace the blood-letting continued.
	   Five people _ four men and a woman _ were gunned down at a home
in the sprawling eastern town of Richmond on Saturday night. Five
other people were killed earlier during the weekend, part of
escalating violence that is apparently politically motivated and
that has South Africa's leaders extremely worried.
	   People wept at the site of the most recent killings, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   ``How long is this going to be happening,'' wailed an elderly
woman, who wore black to mourn a relative who was one of 18 people
killed in the past week.
	   There were more questions than answers.
	   ``What is happening and why can't police stop the violence,''
asked The Sunday Independent, a Johannesburg newspaper, in its lead
editorial Sunday.
	   Part of the reason may be that some police officers are
themselves involved. Witnesses have reportedly seen police vehicles
where killings occurred shortly before the murders happened. One
witness even reported seeing a police car shine a spotlight at a
house so a killer could find his way in the nightime darkness.
	   Richmond Mayor Andrew Ragavaloo said he asked police to keep a
high profile Saturday night to prevent further violence and was
assured they would. It did not stop the killings Saturday night.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, noting residents suspect police of
complicity, said trust must be restored and ``something quite
radical'' must be done to deal with the problem.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi was to meet with
local police commanders. He has reportedly threatened to transfer
them if they don't explain the deteriorating situation.
	   Mandela was to attend the burial of some of the eight people
killed in a tavern on July 3 as they watched World Cup soccer on
TV. Richmond's deputy mayor was among those who died when gunmen
stormed in and opened fire.
	   Richmond is in KwaZulu-Natal province, which was hard-hit by
political violence in the last years of apartheid and the run-up to
the 1994 elections. More than 10,000 people were killed there in
the last decade, many in fighting between supporters of the African
National Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom Party.
Apartheid-era security forces fueled the violence by supplying
Inkatha with weapons.
	   That violence has mostly ended, for now. The ANC and Inkatha
remain rivals, but are not sworn enemies. After the ANC won the
elections, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi was given a Cabinet
seat.
	   The recent violence has been largely restricted to Richmond, a
sprawling dirt-poor town in rolling hills, 450 kilometers (280
miles) southeast of Johannesburg. The violence escalated after
Sifiso Nkabinde was expelled as ANC chairman in Richmond because he
allegedly had informed for the apartheid-era security forces.
	   Nkabine, who earlier this year was acquitted of charges that he
killed 16 people, is now the national secretary of the United
Democratic Movement, a new party that will contest the 1999
elections. He has denied being behind the violence.
	   ``This seems to be an arena of small-time or mid-size
warlordism,'' said Alf Stadler, a professor of political studies at
Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg.
	   Stander said the violence could be linked to the upcoming
elections.
	   ``It's like the Mafia or protection rackets _ you don't come
murder us and we'll support you. This could translate into
political support,'' Stadler said in a telephone interview.
	   The Sunday Independent editorial said unless political tolerance
is promoted, ``the year leading to the elections will be a year of
hell, not only for those in Richmond but for those in South Africa
who want democracy to work.''

Iraq seeking Syria's approval to reopen pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid
left Sunday for neighboring Syria to push for the reopening of a
pipeline Syria shut 16 years ago, Oil Ministry officials said.
	   Iraq announced last week that it had completed repairs on its
part of the pipeline, which can carry up to 650,000 barrels a day.
But Syria has yet to give permission for the oil to pass.
	   Officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said
reopening the pipeline would be on the agenda in Rashid's talks
with his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The pipeline links Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean
terminals of Banias in Syria and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   Syria closed the line in April 1982, dealing a severe blow to
Iraq which was then involved in a war with Iran. Syria sided with
non-Arab Iran in the 1980-1988 war.
	   Iraqi oil exports allowed under U.N. exemptions to sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait are shipped through the
Gulf and Turkey. Exports through Syria would require U.N. approval.

<TEXT>
	   But the elections, for half the upper house's 252 seats, are an
important test of whether voters hold Hashimoto and his party
responsible for Japan's economic malaise.
	   Voting closed at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT) _ two hours later than usual
due to concerns over falling voter turnout in recent elections. The
results of about 90 percent of the races were expected by 1 a.m.
Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   According to the Home Affairs Ministry, 44.51 percent of Japan's
99.4 million registered voters had cast ballots by early Sunday
evening, assuring a higher turnout than the total 44.52 percent who
voted in the last upper house election three years ago.
	   The high turnout may have worked against Hashimoto.
	   Sunday's elections were the first for the upper house since he
came to power in early 1996. With record-high unemployment, rising
bankruptcies, and party members tainted by bribery scandals, the
ruling party had geared up for a rough ride.
	   ``I think I did as much as I can do,'' Hashimoto told reporters
Sunday morning. ``I really hope for a good result.''
	   Opposition parties urged voters to send a message that they are
unhappy with the way Hashimoto has handled the economy, and
stressed that Japan's doldrums have aggravated a financial crisis
throughout Asia.
	   ``As long as the LDP is in power, the economy will only get
worse,'' Akira Nagaoka, 34, said after voting in central Tokyo.
Nagaoka said he supported the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition group.
	   Other voters, however, said they felt the Liberal Democrats were
the safest bet.
	   ``Japan needs steady policies,'' said 78-year-old salesman Kunio
Kanno.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto, who is scheduled to leave for Washington and Paris
next week to explain his economic policies, also embarrassed
himself on the tax issue by repeatedly flip-flopping on the
campaign trail.
	   At one point last week he said he supported ``permanent tax
reforms'' and then backtracked two days later. He now says he
supports cuts.
	   Winning 61 seats _ the break-even point _ would leave the ruling
party eight seats short of a majority, forcing it to seek outside
partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
The LDP's previous partners have distanced themselves from the
ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   The decline of the Socialists, who until a few years ago were
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party held 38 seats in the upper house going
into the election. But Kan's personal popularity has been clouded
by the party's vague stance on major issues.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Parisians prepared Sunday for their biggest street
party since Liberation Day in 1944 to mark the climactic game of
World Cup soccer championships.
	   If France beats Brazil in the finale at the Stade de France, a
million people are expected to take to the streets of the capital
to celebrate the nation's first ever World Cup triumph.
	   Momentum has been building over the past week as France marched
to the final against the defending champions and four-time World
Cup winners.
	   After France qualified by beating Croatia on Wednesday night,
some 350,000 people flocked to the Champs Elysees boulevard for a
wild night of honking horns, waving flags, spraying champagne in an
outpour of good-natured chauvinism.
	   A poll carried out by IPSOS and the daily France Soir indicated
that 72 percent of the nation's 60 million citizens will pour into
the streets, from the capital to the tiniest of villages, if ``Les
Bleus'' beat Brazil.
	   A sizable, but discreet, security operation was in place to
anticipate the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at strategic
points across Paris.
	   Public buses were bedecked with the French tricolor as Parisians
looked forward to a long weekend to remember _ Bastille Day,
France's national day, falls on Tuesday, and many workers also have
Monday as a holiday.
	   France's national car drivers' association urged all motorists
to toot their horns at 7 p.m., two hours before the kickoff, to
support the team.
	   President Jacques Chirac, who will attend the match to hand the
World Cup trophy to the winning team, had a large TV screen
installed at the Elysees Palace so staffers can watch the broadcast
and enjoy a buffet.
	   Whatever the outcome, Les Bleus will parade down the Champs
Elysees on an open-topped bus Monday afternoon, said French
Football Federation president Claude Simonet.
	   Still, not all plans for the party came to fruition.
	   The Ministry of Culture cancelled a proposal to cover the Arc de
Triomphe in huge blue jersey after specialists said it would be too
complicated.
	   Instead, the jersey will be hung from a building near the
monument.
	   The nation's spirits may be overheating but a breeze over the
capital was keeping the weather mild. Scattered clouds hung over
the city, but there was no rain in the forecast.

Cargo operations partially resume at Hong Kong's new airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cargo operations partially resumed Sunday at
Hong Kong's new airport, raising hopes that the costly halt on most
cargo shipments because of computer and mechanical glitches would
end soon.
	   A government statement said two Cathay Pacific Airways planes
carrying 200 tons of cargo left for Frankfurt Sunday. It said
arrangements were being made with the airlines for the departure of
eight cargo flights daily beginning Monday.
	   At the same time, the government said it was providing
assistance for airlines to temporarily use airports in the nearby
Portuguese enclave of Macau and the bordering Chinese city of
Shenzhen for cargo transport.
	   Macau has given approval, and a manager at Shenzhen's airport
said extra staff were deployed to prepare to handle about 500 tons
of cargo from Hong Kong daily, the government-owned Radio Hong Kong
reported.
	   These arrangements were part of government emergency measures
announced late Saturday to clear the cargo glut after a computer
systems breakdown at the cargo terminal at Chek Lap Kok paralyzed
air cargo shipments last Tuesday.
	   The territory's main air cargo handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, announced Friday it was halting almost all cargo
shipments until next Sunday. The company used to handle 5,000 tons
of freight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
217).
	   Government officials said the cargo embargo could cut 0.1
percent off Hong Kong's gross domestic product just as the economy
had shrunk for the first time in 14 years.
	   Fears have been raised that Hong Kong's reputation as the
world's leading cargo hub would be jeopardized by the embargo.
	   Cathay Pacific spokeswoman Jemma Moore said the airline hopes to
resume up to 70 percent of export shipments at Chek Lap Kok as soon
as possible, and may use the Macau airport for incoming cargo.
	   ``Our plans are quite fluid at this point,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, the airport's passenger services have improved
steadily in the past week after early problems with delays in
disembarking and baggage handling.
	   On Sunday, thousands of local tourists jammed the airport,
resulting in long queues at restaurants and restrooms and a
temporary breakdown of escalators, Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   The government ordered a probe to find out what went wrong and
who was responsible for the debacle at the U.S. dlrs 20.1 billion
airport.
	   Chek Lap Kok, built on reclaimed land at the tip of Lautau
Island, opened last Monday to replace the 73-year-old Kai Tak
airport.

Cambodian dissident wants tape of grenade attack aired on TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Posing the government a public
relations challenge, opposition politician Sam Rainsy called Sunday
for state-run television to air footage of a bloody grenade attack
last year on a political rally.
	   The attack, in which 16 people were killed and more than 100
wounded, is widely believed to have been ordered by Hun Sen, then
Cambodia's co-prime minister and now its undisputed strongman.
	   Sam Rainsy and his Sam Rainsy party are among the main
challengers to Hun Sen in general elections scheduled July 26.
	   Each party has been allotted five minutes a day on state-run
television to air their political messages in the month preceding
the poll.
	   Sam Rainsy, who was leading the March 30, 1997, rally, was
generally believed to have been the intended target of the attack,
in which four grenades were thrown into a group of peaceful
protesters. He escaped with minor cuts and bruises when one of his
bodyguards shielded him from the blasts.
	   Sam Rainsy has been one of the severest critics of Hun Sen, and
there is some evidence to suggest that Hun Sen's military bodyguard
unit connived in the attack.
	   Sam Rainsy submitted the videotape to the National Election
Committee last week, but committee president Chheng Phon sent a
handwritten letter to the party president ``begging'' him to
reconsider the request and questioning its appropriateness, party
members said.
	   In a letter to Chheng Phon on Sunday, Sam Rainsy wrote that his
party, ``after considering the matter very thoroughly,'' was
insisting that the committee arrange for state television to
broadcast the video it had supplied without any editing.
	   The tape contains video and still photos taken before and after
the grenade attack, and footage of Sam Rainsy comforting friends
and relatives of the victims at a ceremony marking the first
anniversary of the attack, party members said.
	   Sam Rainsy said he hopes the tape will heighten people's concern
about the political situation, and increase the sense of
responsibility felt by the country's top leaders.
	   In the letter, he told Chheng Phon he hoped showing the
videotape would ``prevent similar violence ... from happening
again.''
	   The grenade attack foreshadowed the violent coup Hun Sen staged
against his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, last July.
Ranariddh is also running in this year's election.
	   Hun Sen called the new elections in an effort to regain
legitimacy and foreign aid lost after his power grab.

As Mandela helps bury the dead, killings continue in strife-torn

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela went
to a violence-wracked town Sunday to help bury victims of a
massacre, but amid appeals for peace the blood-letting continued.
	   Five people _ four men and a woman _ were gunned down at a home
in the sprawling eastern town of Richmond on Saturday night. Five
other people were killed earlier during the weekend, part of
escalating violence that is apparently politically motivated and
that has South Africa's leaders extremely worried.
	   Mandela saw the bodies at the Richmond police station and, with
relatives' permission, described what he saw.
	   ``We want the world to see how gruesome and ruthless the
murderers have been,'' he said, describing bodies with heads blown
apart, others with bullet holes in their stomachs. People wept and
screamed in anguish as he spoke, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   ``How long is this going to be happening,'' wailed an elderly
woman at the site of the most recent killings. She wore black to
mourn a relative who was one of 18 people killed in the past week,
SAPA said.
	   There were no immediate answers for the distraught woman, only
more questions.
	   ``What is happening and why can't police stop the violence,''
asked The Sunday Independent, a Johannesburg newspaper, in its lead
editorial Sunday.
	   Part of the reason may be that some police officers are
themselves involved. Witnesses have reportedly seen police vehicles
where killings occurred shortly before the murders happened. One
witness even reported seeing a police car shine a spotlight at a
house so a killer could find his way in the nightime darkness.
	   Richmond Mayor Andrew Ragavaloo said he asked police to keep a
high profile Saturday night to prevent further violence and was
assured they would. It did not stop the killings Saturday night.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, noting residents suspect police of
complicity, said trust must be restored and ``something quite
radical'' must be done to deal with the problem.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi was to meet with
local police commanders. He has reportedly threatened to transfer
them if they don't explain the deteriorating situation.
	   Mandela was to attend the burial at a sports stadium of some of
eight people killed in a tavern on July 3 as they watched World Cup
soccer on TV. Richmond's deputy mayor was among those who died when
gunmen stormed in and opened fire.
	   Underscoring the raised tensions, a scuffle broke out when
police tried to disarm men armed with spears and sticks who were
trying to enter the stadium.

Sweden's Gustafsson writes clay classic history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
deafeated Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine 6-2, 6-3 to become the first
player to win an unprecedented fourth title in the dlrs 340,000
Swedish Open ATP claycourt classic.
	   It was the second victory for the 31-year-old claycourt
specialist against Medvedev and the twelfth career ATP tour victory
for the Swede. Gustafsson also beat the Ukrainan 6-1, 6-3 in the
1996 final.
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, will not
only improve his current 26th ranking but also top such greats as
Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only others to win three titles
in this seaside tourney.
	   Gustafsson broke the 25-year-old Medvedev twice in the first set
to win 6-2. But Medvedev, 97th in the ATP rakning before this
tournament, bounced back early in the second set. He broke
Gustafsson for a 2-0 lead but the Swede broke back to level at 3-3
and then broke Medvedev again for 5-3 before he closed out the set
on his first match point.
	   In the doubles final South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval
face Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson.

Pope is rooting for goalkeepers

<TEXT>
	   LORENZAGO, Italy (AP) _ With his native Poland out of the
competition, Pope John Paul II will have his heart with the two
goalkeepers in the World Cup final Sunday between Brazil and
France, the papal spokesman said.
	   ``He will be rooting for the sport, but with special sympathy
for the goalkeepers, because he played that position as a youth,''
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters outside the pope's
vacation villa in the Italian Alps.
	   The spokesman said he expected John Paul to watch the game on
television at the villa in this town north of Venice, where he is
spending a 13-day vacation.
	   Poland did not qualify for the final round of the month-long
soccer competition in France.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Emirates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait is considering investments in oil
refineries and gas stations in the United States, Oil Minister
Sheik Saud al-Sabah said in remarks published Sunday.
	   ``In Europe, we have thousands of gas stations in Italy and
Sweden and other countries, and now we are trying to expand to the
United States which has a good and large market,'' the minister
told Al-Qabas daily in an interview.
	   Sheik Saud also said the cost of producing a barrel of Kuwaiti
crude was 80 cents, but he was hoping to reduce it through
``operation contracts'' with foreign companies.
	   He said sharing the advanced technology of foreign companies
would help Kuwait reach its goal of production capacity of 3
million barrels a day within the next six years. It is now around
2.7 million barrels a day, and Kuwait is pumping 1.98 million
barrels.
	   Kuwait was selling its oil at around dlrs 10 a barrel, the
minister told the newspaper, and some Kuwaitis are not ``fully
aware of the economic dangers we are facing'' because of that.
	   The government has estimated a 1.73 billion dinar (dlrs 5.65
billion) in deficit in the fiscal year 1998-99 that started July 1.
All oil-exporting countries have been hit hard by low oil prices.
	   Sheik Saud said said he saw a great need to restructure the
government-owned and run oil sector to improve performance and cut
expenses. Options include privatizing some sections, he said.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Hollandi Bank announced Sunday
that its net profit in the first half of the year increased by 25
percent to 128.2 million riyals (dlrs 34 million) from 102.4
million riyals (dlrs 27.3 million) in the same period last year.
	   The bank, which is 40 percent owned by the Netherlands ABN-Amro
Bank, said income rose 21.5 percent to 114 million riyals (dlrs
30.4 million) from 94 million riyals (dlrs 25 million) last year.
	   It added that assets increased 2 percent to 17.85 billion riyals
(dlrs 4.76 billion) from 17.49 billion riyals (dlrs 4.66 billion)
in the first half of 1997, while shareholders equity increased 11.5
percent to 1.45 billion riyals (dlrs 386 million) from 1.3 billion
riyals (dlrs 346 million) a year earlier.
	   The bank said deposits increased 2.7 percent to 11.77 billion
riyals (dlrs 3.13 billion), up from 11.46 billion riyals (dlrs 3.05
billion) a year earlier.
	   Saudi Hollandi Bank has 38 branches and 68 automated teller
machines in the kingdom. It is listed on the Saudi Stock Market.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi British Bank said Sunday its
net profit in the first half of 1998 jumped 12.2 percent to 302.7
million riyals (dlrs 80.7 million), up from 269.7 million riyals
(dlrs 71.9 million) in the same period last year.
	   The Riyadh-based bank said deposits increased 6.2 percent to
23.6 billion riyals (dlrs 6.29 billion), but it did not give
comparative figure. Loans and advances to customers increased 15.6
percent to 11 billion riyals (dlrs 2.93 billion) from 9.6 billion
riyals (dlrs 2.56 billion) a year earlier.
	   The Saudi British Bank is 40 percent owned by the British Bank
of the Middle East, a subsidiary of U.K. HSBC group, while the
remaining shares are listed on the Saudi Stock Market.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Dubai Aluminum Company Ltd.
announced Sunday that it secured a dlrs 150 million loan from
Barclays Bank to finance a major expansion project.
	   It is part of dlrs 500 million the company is planning to borrow
for the dlrs 725 million Condor expansion project, a company
official said.
	   Talks were also under way with a local bank and four foreign
banks to secure a dlrs 120 million loan. Another dlrs 200 million
will be raised through the issue of 10-year bonds in the
international markets in the last quarter of the year.
	   The Barclays loan was secured at the lowest possible cost, the
company said. It will carry an annual interest margin of 0.25
percent over the London Interbank Offered Rate.
	   In addition, Barclays will provide a dlrs 40 million revolving
credit to the company.
	   The term loan will be paid back by the state-owned smelter in
four six-month installments, starting June 30, 2001.
	   The Condor project, which is expected to be completed by the end
of next year, will raise the company's capacity to 525,000 tons
from the current 400,000 tons.

Lawyers for journalist claim publications law unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Lawyers for a Kuwaiti editor sentenced to prison
for publishing a joke deemed insulting to Islam claimed Sunday that
the 37-year-old law used to convict him was unconstitutional.
	   Mohammad al-Saqar, editor of Al-Qabas independent daily, was
sentenced to six months in jail for publishing the joke on the
newspaper's entertainment page. A freelancer who contributed the
joke from Cairo, Egypt, was handed a similar term in absentia.
	   In the joke, which angered Islamic-oriented legislators, a
teacher asks his students: ``Why did God kick out Adam and Eve from
heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they hadn't paid the rent.''
	   The sentence was the first of its kind in this small oil-rich
state that boasts the freest Arab media in the Gulf.
	   Ali al-Baghli, one of the three attorneys defending al-Saqar,
told an appeals court Sunday that the 1961 publications law used to
convict him contradicted the constitution.
	   The law stipulates that an editor-in-chief is responsible for
everything published in a newspaper, but the 1962 constitution says
individuals cannot be penalized for the wrongdoings of others, said
al-Baghli, a leading human rights lawyer.
	   ``Even the writer of the joke did not mean to insult God, so how
could the editor-in-chief mean to insult God by publishing it?'' he
asked the court.
	   Al-Baghli petitioned the the three-judge panel to refer the case
to the Constitutional Court. The presiding judge, Ahmed al-Ajeel,
adjourned the court until Sept. 15 without ruling on the request.

New clashes in Kosovo despite diplomatic efforts to end fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two Serb policemen killed, quote and suggestion
from Kinkel, trims.
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats called for a new approach
to finding a diplomatic solution for Kosovo, where the latest
clashes between Serb and Albanian forces have claimed the lives of
at least two Serb policemen, Serb sources said Sunday.
	   In Bonn Sunday, Germany's foreign minister telephoned his
counterparts in the six-nation Contact Group searching for a
diplomatic solution to discuss new ideas for resolving the crisis
in Kosovo, his spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   On Saturday, Kinkel and Russia's Yevgeny Primakov met in Moscow
and discussed ``new, creative possibilities'' for Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence
from Serbia _ part of Yugoslavia.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel
Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference like the Dayton peace accord
_ which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``Perhaps we need a process
that resembles the one that took place in Dayton,'' he told the
paper.
	   Following Saturday's talks, Kikel told journalists that previous
attempts at a diplomatic solution had proved unfruitful and it was
time to consider a new method to get both sides to aggree to a
cease-fire and peace talks.
	   But the diplomatic efforts have showed little sign of making
inroads. The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two Serbs
policemen were killed and one seriously wounded in a rash of
attacks by the KLA on police checkpoints in western Kosovo,
following a Serb attack Saturday in the region.
	   Goran Erakovic was killed early Sunday when Albanian militants
attacked a checkpoint along the main Decane-Djakovica road running
across western Kosovo. Late Saturday, Dejan Mihajlovic died when
his checkpoint along the Pec-Decane road was attacked. Goran
Stojanovic was wounded. No independent confirmation was immediately
available.
	   Ethnic Albanian reported nothing new immediately Sunday.
	   Earlier Saturday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on the
village of Lodja, on the outskirts of Kosovo's second-largest city
Pec in western Kosovo, independent sources reported. The Albanians'
Kosovo Information Center said Serbs failed to dislodge rebels from
their positions.
	   However, the Serb Media Center, quoting government sources, said
police regained control of a five-kilometer (three-mile) stretch of
the road during an ``action'' to locate two missing policemen.
	   Police came under fire as soon as they approached Lodja and,
``after two hours of battle, armed Albanians ran away,'' but the
two policemen killed three days ago were not found, the Serb Media
Center said.
	   Albanian sources said a 78-year-old Albanian man was killed and
three others were wounded in Lodja. But the Albanians claimed
police failed to capture the village despite ``one of the biggest
attacks'' by Serb forces.
	   Also Saturday, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in the
Decani area, east of Pec, and near the border town of Djakovica.
	   On Sunday there were independent reports of continued shooting
around Pec, but no claims that the Serbs had captured Lodja, a KLA
stronghold and a reputed center for weapons smuggling from Albania.
There was no independent confirmation of casualty claims.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to stop the
fighting for fear it will spread to other Balkan countries with
large Albanian communities.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   On Wednesday, the Contact Group _ the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ renewed demands for an
immediate cease-fire followed by peace talks.
	   Those calls have gone unheeded because of divisions within the
Albanian community and the refusal of the KLA to accept the Contact
Group's favorite, Ibrahim Rugova, as their leader in future talks.
Rugova has disavowed violence.

Exit polls indicate Hashimoto's ruling party headed toward defeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; ADDS party leader comment &QL; 
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Exit polls conducted by Japanese media indicated
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his ruling party were on their
way to a major defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday.
	   The early predictions put Hashimoto under intense pressure to
resign.
	   Voters turned out in higher than expected numbers for the
elections, seen as a referendum on Hashimoto's efforts to pull
Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Hashimoto and other Liberal Democratic Party leaders had said
they wanted to at least keep their current strength by winning 61
of the 126 seats contested in the elections for Parliament's upper
house.
	   But exit polls conducted by major Japanese television networks
indicated the party would fall far short of that goal. The Asahi
television network said the Liberal Democrats were more likely to
win only 40 seats; Nihon TV, another major commercial network,
predicted 46.
	   Kyodo News quoted unnamed LDP sources as saying Hashimoto was
likely to announce his resignation within the next day or two.
	   Party officials refused to confirm that to The Associated Press.
	   ``It has been a very difficult election,'' said party
secretary-general Koichi Kato. ``We must see the final results
before we consider the leadership matter.''
	   Hashimoto's party is not in danger of losing its hold on power
because of its strong majority in the lower house. Hashimoto
himself was not up for re-election.
	   But the elections, for half the upper house's 252 seats, are an
important test of whether voters hold Hashimoto and his party
responsible for Japan's economic malaise.
	   Voting closed at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT) _ two hours later than usual
due to concerns over falling voter turnout in recent elections. The
results of about 90 percent of the races were expected by 1 a.m.
Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   According to the Home Affairs Ministry, 44.51 percent of Japan's
99.4 million registered voters had cast ballots by early Sunday
evening, assuring a higher turnout than the total 44.52 percent who
voted in the last upper house election three years ago.
	   The high turnout may have worked against Hashimoto.
	   Sunday's elections were the first for the upper house since he
came to power in early 1996. With record-high unemployment, rising
bankruptcies, and party members tainted by bribery scandals, the
ruling party had geared up for a rough ride.
	   ``I think I did as much as I can do,'' Hashimoto told reporters
Sunday morning. ``I really hope for a good result.''
	   Opposition parties urged voters to send a message that they are
unhappy with the way Hashimoto has handled the economy, and
stressed that Japan's doldrums have aggravated a financial crisis
throughout Asia.
	   ``As long as the LDP is in power, the economy will only get
worse,'' Akira Nagaoka, 34, said after voting in central Tokyo.
Nagaoka said he supported the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition group.
	   Other voters, however, said they felt the Liberal Democrats were
the safest bet.
	   ``Japan needs steady policies,'' said 78-year-old salesman Kunio
Kanno.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto, who is scheduled to leave for Washington and Paris
next week to explain his economic policies, also embarrassed
himself on the tax issue by repeatedly flip-flopping on the
campaign trail.
	   At one point last week he said he supported ``permanent tax
reforms'' and then backtracked two days later. He now says he
supports cuts.
	   Winning 61 seats _ the break-even point _ would leave the ruling
party eight seats short of a majority, forcing it to seek outside
partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
The LDP's previous partners have distanced themselves from the
ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   The decline of the Socialists, who until a few years ago were
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party held 38 seats in the upper house going
into the election. But Kan's personal popularity has been clouded
by the party's vague stance on major issues.

Spaniards back policy of no talks with ETA's political wing a year
</HEADLINE>
after councilor's killing &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A majority of Spaniards support the
government's refusal to talk with the political wing of the Basque
separatist group until it condemns the killings carried out by its
guerillas, according to an opinion poll published Sunday.
	   The poll was published in the leading daily El Pais on the first
anniversary of the slaying of a local politician that sparked days
of furious protests by angry Spaniards.
	   Of those polled, 70 percent rejected all contacts with Herri
Batasuna, a political coalition that tacitly supports the Basque
separatist group ETA's campaign of violence. Nineteen percent
favored talks with the group, and 11 percent were undecided or did
not answer.
	   The El Pais poll was carried out July 5-8.The private Demoscopia
firm interviewed 1,200 people for the survey which has a 2.9
percent margin of error, El Pais said.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since it began
campaigning for Basque independence in 1968.
	   The group's killing of Popular Party councilor Miguel Angel
Blanco, 29, infuriated Spaniards.
	   Thousands of people gathered Sunday in Blanco's northern Basque
town of Ermua to commemorate the anniversary of his killing with a
march to the local cemetery, where they placed flowers on his tomb.
	   Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja and other regional leaders
of the Popular Party attended the rally.
	   ETA kidnapped Blanco, a low-ranking town councilman, July 10,
1997 and warned it would execute him two days later unless some 500
ETA convicts were transferred to the Basque region.
	   Blanco was found dumped in a wooded area two days later, tied up
and with two bullets in his head.
	   The killing stunned Spaniards and triggered five days of massive
anti-ETA demonstrations.
	   Since Blanco's killing, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has
ruled out any negotiations with ETA or its political wing unless
ETA renounces violence.
	   Herri Batasuna is the only political party not to condemn ETA's
slayings.

Three Catholic children die in sectarian fire in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs with Orange Order minister saying standoff
should be called off; chief spokesman saying it will continue &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three Catholic children died in
an arson attack early Sunday, and Protestant protesters clashed in
hand-to-hand scuffles with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road.
	   Neighbors reported hearing a loud bang just before a house in
Ballymoney erupted in flames, killing brothers Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn. The boys' mother and her Protestant boyfriend managed
to escape, police said.
	   Ballmoney, about 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast, is
predominantly Protestant. It is not uncommon for mixed-religion
couples to be targeted for attacks throughout Northern Ireland.
	   A distraught neighbor, who asked not to be identified for fear
of reprisals, said she heard 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason screaming as the fire raced through the house.
	   Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy leader of the new Belfast
Assembly, said the boys had been ``sacrificed for the so-called
principles of the people of the north of Ireland, who have been
unable to resolve what is basically a parochial dispute'' over the
Protestant march.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' Mallon asked on BBC-TV.
``Does it take one child, two children, three children?''
	   Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said he
considered the boys' deaths a turning point in the increasingly
violent stalemate over the Orange Order's blocked attempts to march
down the predominantly Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Authorities urged Catholics not to retaliate.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party and the first minister of the Belfast
Assembly.
	   Members of the Orange Order _ stymied since July 5 from parading
down Garvaghy Road from their rural Drumcree church _ started
negotiating through intermediaries Saturday with the road's
Catholic residents.
	   But when the talks adjourned for the day without results, the
Orangemen announced a second application had been submitted to a
government-appointed parades commission requesting an identical
route _ with a departure time of 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) Sunday.
	   The commission announced Sunday morning that the second
application also had been denied.
	   The Rev. William Bingham, chaplain of the Orange Order in County
Armagh, told a church service that the Orangemen should call off
the protests because they have gotten out of control.
	   ``A 15-minute walk would be a hollow victory in the shadow of
the coffins of three children,'' he said.
	   But Orange Order spokesman David Jones, who was encamped with
thousands of Orangemen outside the steel and barbed-wire barricades
in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast, said
Bingham's plea and the deaths of the three boys ``won't make any
difference.''
	   The protesters have been staging increasingly bold attacks on
police once night falls.
	   Overnight Sunday, riot police fought hand-to-hand with hooded
demonstrators who had ripped away parts of the barricade.
	   Protesters launched fireworks directly at the security forces
and threw bricks and stones. The police answered with plastic
bullets, and arrested at least two people.
	   Twenty protesters were injured by a barrage of plastic bullets
overnight Saturday, including a 26-year-old man who remained
hospitalized in critical condition and a 21-year-old female college
student who lost an eye.
	   Orange Order spokesman David Jones said late Saturday that any
further violence would not be his group's fault if the second
application was denied.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the parades
commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' he said.
	   It was not clear when the indirect talks between the Orangemen
and Catholic residents would resume, but authorities said it would
be after Sunday.
	   Police already had feared tensions would peak this weekend with
the 12th of July holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the
defeat of Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   The streets of normally bustling Belfast began emptying early
Saturday afternoon in anticipation of more trouble, and dozens of
holiday bonfires and fireworks lit the sky as night settled in.
	   On the streets of one Protestant enclave, children toasted
marshmallows over the flames; on the streets of another, they
watched gleefully as the flames from a hijacked car, torched by a
gasoline bomb, leaped higher and higher.

Thousands of South Korean workers stage rally to protest layoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ About 70,000 auto, banking and other
workers rallied Sunday, vowing to join in a planned nationwide
strike this week against increasing layoffs.
	   ``Stop unilateral restructuring!'' workers shouted during a
two-hour riverside rally. Many of them wore headbands and carried
placards with similar slogans.
	   The nation's two rival labor groups jointly called the strike in
a rare show of solidarity. Organizers said car assembly workers
will launch the indefinite strike Tuesday, followed by workers in
other industries the next day.
	   They predicted that the strike will draw about 100,000 workers
from auto plants, 37 banks and 11 state-run companies that are
being put up for sale under the government's privatization plan.
	   Thousands of police stood guard against possible violence, but
there were no reports of clashes or arrests.
	   The mainstream Federation of Korea Trade Unions and the militant
Korean Confederation of Trade Unions called the strike, demanding
that the government take action to stop spreading layoffs.
	   The two labor groups said last week that they would boycott
talks with the government and management officials until they
receive guarantees of job security for workers.
	   A flexible labor market is a key condition of a record dlrs 58
billion bailout of the battered South Korean economy by the
International Monetary Fund in December.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have since collapsed as
the government pushed a restructuring of its economy. The
development was shocking to Korean workers, accustomed to lifetime
employment.
	   The number of jobless people has doubled to 1.5 million and will
likely top 2 million by the end of the year.

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Unions considering second general strike &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Labor unions are considering a
sequel to a two-day general strike that snarled traffic, slowed
commerce and shut down government offices across Puerto Rico
earlier this week.
	   The Greater Committee of Labor Organizations, which represents
about 60 unions, said Saturday it might call another work stoppage
within weeks to protest privatization of the Puerto Rico Telephone
Co. About 6,400 telephone workers have been on strike since June
18.
	   Unions will also begin pickets at hotels, factories and shopping
centers, and will send a caravan of cars to protest in cities
across the island, said Jose Juan Hernandez, president of the
Independent Union of Telephone Employees.
	   He announced the plans as labor leaders chanted ``Strike!
Strike!'' during a meeting at a union office in San Juan.
	   ``The state in which the people are in will get worse and the
unfortunate and dismal consequences for the people of Puerto Rico
will escalate,'' Hernandez said.
 &UR; MEXICO: Rights activist urges reduced pressure on Cuban government
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A leading Cuban human rights activist said
Friday the United States should pause in its pressure against Fidel
Castro's Cuba, where the number of political prisoners has fallen
sharply.
	   ``There has not been so low a level of repression in the country
for decades,'' said Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission
of Human Rights and National Reconciliation.
	   Speaking by telephone, he said Cuba should be given ``time to
organize its response'' to calls for reforms by Pope John Paul II
and other world figures, many considered friendly to the communist
government.
	   He suggested that period might extend to the end of the year.
	   Sanchez's organization is considered the most reliable
independent source of information about political prisoners within
Cuba. A former university professor, Sanchez also spent several
years in Cuban prisons for dissent.
	   His suggestion is in line with his long-standing opposition to
the U.S. economic boycott of Cuba
 &UR; CUBA: Island suffering severe drought
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A severe drought in Cuba has forced many
people to leave their homes for other regions, while authorities in
parched eastern communities have been delivering water by truck and
animal, the Cuban government's news agency reported.
	   Rainfall in June was its lowest for the month in the last four
decades, Prensa Latina reported, without giving specific figures.
In the eastern province of Guantanamo, hundreds of acres of crops
have been lost. Coffee and honey production have suffered, as have
fishing and sugar cane harvesting.
	   Many people are temporarily relocating because of the drought,
Prensa Latina said, citing Pedro Miret, the vice president of the
Council of Ministers. In areas where natural wells have run dry,
water is being hauled in for thousands of people and livestock, the
National Information Agency said in the report, monitored in Mexico
City.
 &UR; BAHAMAS: Deputy prime minister still hospitalized after collapse
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The deputy prime minister of the Bahamas
remained hospitalized Saturday, recovering from a collapse during
an Independence Week celebration earlier this week.
	   Minister Frank Watson, 58, was in stable condition at Princess
Margaret Hospital in Nassau, and doctors were running tests to
determine why he fainted during the ceremony Thursday night.
	   ``What we can say is that the deputy prime minister does not
appear to have suffered a heart attack,'' said Ronnie Knowles, a
doctor and the country's minister of health.
	   Watson passed out while Governor General Sir Orville Turnquest
was reviewing police and military forces at Clifford Park in
Nassau.
	   Doctors in the crowd, including opposition parliament member
Bernard Nottage, rushed to help. After a few minutes, Watson
regained conciousness and was able to walk to a car.
 &UR; CURACAO: Colombian ship owner wins lawsuit over search for drugs
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ A Curacao court has awarded a
Colombian ship owner and his crew dlrs 4,800, saying the vessel was
unjustly detained for five days while U.S. and local drug agents
looked for cocaine.
	   The Netherlands Antilles coast guard stopped the cargo ship
Eugenio on June 25 about 18 miles off the coast of Curacao. The
vessel was transporting a new speedboat to Trinidad from the
Colombian port of Cartagena.
	   Informants told the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency the ship was
carrying between 500 and 1,000 kilograms of cocaine.
	   U.S. and local coast guard officials boarded the ship, took it
to Willemstad, jailed the crew and emptied the vessel's water and
fuel tanks to look for drugs. None were found.
	   The ship's owner, Elias Iguaran-Iguaran, had demanded dlrs
110,000 for the delay. The court ordered the Netherlands Antilles
government to pay him dlrs 1,100 and give dlrs 340 to each of the
11 crew members.

Three Catholic children die in sectarian fire in Northern Ireland

UPDATES in grafs 15-17 with Orange Order minister saying standoff

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three Catholic children died in
an arson attack early Sunday, and Protestant protesters clashed in
hand-to-hand scuffles with police blocking their march down a
predominantly Catholic road.
	   Neighbors reported hearing a loud bang just before a house in
Ballymoney erupted in flames, killing brothers Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn. The boys' mother and her Protestant boyfriend managed
to escape, police said.
	   Ballmoney, about 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast, is
predominantly Protestant. It is not uncommon for mixed-religion
couples to be targeted for attacks throughout Northern Ireland.
	   A distraught neighbor, who asked not to be identified for fear
of reprisals, said she heard 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason screaming as the fire raced through the house.
	   Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy leader of the new Belfast
Assembly, said the boys had been ``sacrificed for the so-called
principles of the people of the north of Ireland, who have been
unable to resolve what is basically a parochial dispute'' over the
Protestant march.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' Mallon asked on BBC-TV.
``Does it take one child, two children, three children?''
	   Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said he
considered the boys' deaths a turning point in the increasingly
violent stalemate over the Orange Order's blocked attempts to march
down the predominantly Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Authorities urged Catholics not to retaliate.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party and the first minister of the Belfast
Assembly.
	   Members of the Orange Order _ stymied since July 5 from parading
down Garvaghy Road from their rural Drumcree church _ started
negotiating through intermediaries Saturday with the road's
Catholic residents.
	   But when the talks adjourned for the day without results, the
Orangemen announced a second application had been submitted to a
government-appointed parades commission requesting an identical
route _ with a departure time of 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) Sunday.
	   The commission announced Sunday morning that the second
application also had been denied.
	   The Rev. William Bingham, chaplain of the Orange Order in County
Armagh, told a church service that the Orangemen should call off
the protests because they have gotten out of control.
	   ``A 15-minute walk would be a hollow victory in the shadow of
the coffins of three children,'' he said.
	   But Orange Order spokesman David Jones, who was encamped with
thousands of Orangemen outside the steel and barbed-wire barricades
in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast, said
Bingham's plea and the deaths of the three boys ``won't make any
difference.''
	   The protesters have been staging increasingly bold attacks on
police once night falls.
	   Overnight Sunday, riot police fought hand-to-hand with hooded
demonstrators who had ripped away parts of the barricade.
	   Protesters launched fireworks directly at the security forces
and threw bricks and stones. The police answered with plastic
bullets, and arrested at least two people.
	   Twenty protesters were injured by a barrage of plastic bullets
overnight Saturday, including a 26-year-old man who remained
hospitalized in critical condition and a 21-year-old female college
student who lost an eye.
	   Orange Order spokesman David Jones said late Saturday that any
further violence would not be his group's fault if the second
application was denied.
	   ``If this application is turned down, then the parades
commission must take full responsibility for any violence at
Drumcree,'' he said.
	   It was not clear when the indirect talks between the Orangemen
and Catholic residents would resume, but authorities said it would
be after Sunday.
	   Police already had feared tensions would peak this weekend with
the 12th of July holiday, the annual Protestant celebration of the
defeat of Catholic King James II by King William of Orange at the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   The streets of normally bustling Belfast began emptying early
Saturday afternoon in anticipation of more trouble, and dozens of
holiday bonfires and fireworks lit the sky as night settled in.
	   On the streets of one Protestant enclave, children toasted
marshmallows over the flames; on the streets of another, they
watched gleefully as the flames from a hijacked car, torched by a
gasoline bomb, leaped higher and higher.

Sweden's Gustafsson writes clay classic history

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
defeated Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine 6-2, 6-3 to become the first
player to win an unprecedented fourth title in the dlrs 340,000
Swedish Open ATP claycourt classic Sunday.
	   It was the second victory for the 31-year-old claycourt
specialist against Medvedev and the twelfth career ATP tour victory
for the Swede. Gustafsson also beat the Ukrainian 6-1, 6-3 in the
1996 final.
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, will not
only improve his current 26th ranking but also top such greats as
Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only others to win three titles
in this seaside tourney.
	   Gustafsson broke the 25-year-old Medvedev twice in the first set
to win 6-2. But Medvedev, 97th in the ATP ranking before this
tournament, bounced back early in the second set. He broke
Gustafsson for a 2-0 lead but the Swede broke back to level at 3-3
and then broke Medvedev again for 5-3 before he closed out the set
on his first match point.
	   In the doubles final South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval
face Swedes Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson.

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador's presidential runoff election
Sunday pits a politician promising to clean up government against a
populist pledging to create jobs and build homes.
	   However, politics had to vie with soccer for Ecuadoreans
attention Sunday. Many voters in the small Andean nation went to
the polls early so they could be home for the afternoon's World Cup
soccer final.
	   Some voters wore the yellow and green colors of Brazil,
Ecuadoreans' preferred soccer team, which will play France in the
game.
	   Indian women in the mountain interior, some carrying babies on
their backs, went to vote in brightly colored, multi-layered
skirts.
	   Organizers feared a low voter turnout because of the World Cup,
and voter fatigue. It will be the sixth election or referendum in
Ecuador in the past two years.
	   Polls give an ample lead to Jamil Mahuad, the 48-year-old
centrist mayor of Quito who has promised to end Ecuador's political
chaos with ``serious, just'' government.
	   His opponent is banana magnate Alvaro Noboa, 47, who ran a
populist campaign promising to create a million jobs, build houses
for the poor and punish Ecuador's discredited political elite.
	   Noboa's campaign picked up steam in the final weeks of the
campaign, sharply cutting into Mahuad's lead in the polls.
	   But he has been tarred as the puppet of disgraced former
President Abdala Bucaram, his friend and political ally.
	   Mahuad and Noboa were the top vote getters in a first round of
voting on May 31. The winner will take office Aug. 10.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, who
was named president by Congress in February 1997 after it removed
the eccentric Bucaram from power for ``mental incapacity.''
	   Massive street protests and corruption charges plagued the final
days of Bucaram's six-month government, leading to fears of the
collapse of Ecuador's shaky, 19-year-old democracy.
	   The winner will be expected to close the book on this
embarrassing chapter of Ecuador's history and mend its battered
economy, which has staggered under the double blow of El
Nino-driven floods earlier this year and plummeting prices of its
main export, oil.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, has the support of Ecuador's major political
parties and the business community, which fears his populist rival.

Corretja wins Swiss Open, denies Becker first career clay title

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Third-seed Alex Corretja of Spain
defeated semi-retired Boris Becker in the final of the dlrs 560,000
Swiss Open tennis tournament on Sunday, denying the German a
landmark 50th career singles title and first ever on clay.
	   In his fifth appearance at the tournament, Corretja, a French
Open finalist this year, patiently disposed of the 15-year-veteran
7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 6-3 to collect his sixth career title, and his
second of the season.
	   ``I was very proud to beat him in the final,'' said Corretja,
who lost to compatriot Carlos Moya in the final of Roland Garros.
``He beat a couple of really good players earlier in the
tournament.
	   ``I feel in my heart Boris is one of the greatest tennis players
ever.''
	   Becker, who has not won a tournament since claiming the Grand
Slam Cup two years ago, will have to wait until his next appearance
in Stuttgart on July 20 for another chance at the clay-court title
which has eluded him throughout his illustrious career.
	   ``Obviously time is running out,'' said the 30-year-old Becker,
the winner of six Grand Slams with only the French Open title
missing from his resume. ``I won't be playing another five years.
But as long as I keep playing and practicing I feel I have a chance
at a clay-court title.''
	   Because of his downsized schedule, Becker's ranking dropped to
119 in the world last week, falling from the top 100 for the first
time in 13 years.
	   The German will likely re-enter the top 100 on the strength of
his victory over world No.2 and top-seed Marcelo Rios in the
semifinals Saturday.
	   Becker displayed a gutsy effort, his hunger for a clay-court
title apparent as he doggedly kept up with a calm, dominant
Corretja in the first two sets.
	   But in the pivotal moments Becker proved unable to come through.
	   The German's first major blunder came early in the first set.
Even at 3-3, Becker missed a key chance to take the lead, failing
to convert two break points.
	   Then, at 5-4 in the second set, Becker was once again unable to
capitalize on a golden opportunity, squandering a massive three
set-points.
	   ``It seems to be my story on clay,'' said Becker. ``I wasn't
able to take my chances. Sometimes I was unlucky, sometimes I made
a bad shot, sometimes he just returned too well.
	   ``I felt I deserved to win the second set but I didn't,''
continued Becker. ``Obviously his legs are a bit younger and
fresher than mine. He played incredible tennis and it was too hard
to comeback.''
	   When Corretja broke to go ahead 4-3, the wind appeared to go out
of Becker's sails, the German also losing his next serve to kiss
the match and the title goodbye.
	   ``I'm not too disappointed, there wasn't much I could do
differently,'' said Becker. ``And I didn't expect to be in the
final. I beat players I didn't think I could beat on clay.''
	   On route to the final, the German marched over France's Cedric
Pioline, and the 1997 champion Felix Mantilla of Spain in the
quarterfinals before upsetting Rios on Saturday.

	   A look at the two candidates in Sunday's presidential runoff in
Ecuador:
	   JAMIL MAHUAD, 48, centrist mayor of the capital, Quito, since
1992 and nominee of the Christian Democrat party. Leading the polls
by a wide margin, he holds a master's degree in public
administration from Harvard University and has earned a reputation
as a good administrator during his term as Quito's mayor. He has
promised to improve health services and education and to combat
corruption and rising crime.
	   ALVARO NOBOA, 47, scion of Ecuador's wealthiest family. He was
backed by the populist Rodolsista party of ousted President Abdala
Bucaram until it pulled its support in late June. His only previous
experience in government was as head of the Central Bank during
Bucaram's turbulent six-month government. He surged in the polls
before the first round of voting by promising to create 1 million
jobs and build 200,000 homes for the poor.

20,000 non-Timorese Indonesians leave East Timor amid fears of
</HEADLINE>
attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 20,000 non-Timorese
Indonesians have fled troubled East Timor since late last month,
fearing attack by native Timorese, an official said Sunday.
	   Agitation for independence for East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975, has intensified since the
resignation in May of President Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with
an iron hand for 32 years.
	   ``An estimated 20,000 people have left Dili alone since violent
protests during the visit of European diplomats,'' a provincial
official said, referring to the East Timor capital.
	   ``We have called on them to stay because there have been
guarantees from the military and local government, but they
preferred to leave for safety, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   He could not confirm news reports that at least 65,000 people
have left the province since mid-June.
	   ``They were probably scared by possible mass protests during the
visit of Marker,'' he added.
	   He was referring to Jamshed Marker, a special U.N. envoy on the
East Timor problem, who was scheduled to visit Indonesia this week
for talks.
	   However, because of security concerns, it was unclear whether he
would go ahead with a planned visit to East Timor.
	   During his first visit to the territory in March 1997, troops
fired on pro-independence demonstrators, killing two and wounding
38 others.
	   In recent weeks, two people have been shot to death by troops
quelling pro- and anti-Indonesian demonstrations during visits by
foreign diplomats.
	   The newspaper Kompas said Sunday that data from the local
government in Atambua showed at least 50,000 Indonesian immigrants
fleeing East Timor have crossed through that enclave region to the
neighboring province of East Nusatenggara since June 15.
	   It added that some 15,000 others left on ships of the state-run
PELNI shipping company. Many of the immigrants were Javanese and
Bugis from South Sulawesi.
	   The ethnic Bugis, mostly Muslims, long have been the target of
attacks in predominantly Catholic East Timor.
	   Kompas said one ship carrying 1,000 immigrants arrived Saturday
in Ujung Pandang, the South Sulawesi capital.
	   ``Leaving earlier is better. What should we defend in Dili? A
house and other property can be gained in our hometown, while
safety is everything,'' Kompas quoted Tomas Kalembang, a South
Sulawesi immigrant, as saying.
	   Most of them said they could not stand intimidation and terror
almost every day by pro-independence activists.
	   The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments refuse
to recognize Indonesia's claim over East Timor, which has endured
decades of guerrilla war and human rights abuse.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his ruling
party appeared to be on their way to a major defeat in
parliamentary elections Sunday, putting Hashimoto under intense
pressure to resign.
	   Voters turned out in higher than expected numbers for the
elections, seen as a referendum on Hashimoto's efforts to pull
Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Hashimoto and other Liberal Democratic Party leaders said they
wanted to at least keep their current strength by winning 61 of the
126 seats contested in the elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   But exit polls conducted by major Japanese television networks
indicated the party would fall far short of that goal. The Asahi
television network said the Liberal Democrats were more likely to
win only 40 seats; Nihon TV, another major commercial network,
predicted 46.
	   Kyodo News quoted unnamed LDP sources as saying Hashimoto was
likely to announce his resignation within the next day or two. The
Fuji Television network said Hashimoto would cancel a trip to
France and the United States. He was scheduled to leave next week.
	   Party officials refused to confirm either report to The
Associated Press.
	   They did, however, admit the initial results looked glum.
	   ``It has been a very difficult election,'' conceded party
secretary-general Koichi Kato. ``We must see the final results
before we consider the leadership matter.''
	   Hashimoto's party is not in danger of losing its hold on power
because of its strong majority in the lower house. Hashimoto
himself was not up for re-election.
	   But the elections, for half the upper house's 252 seats, are an
important test of whether voters hold Hashimoto and his party
responsible for Japan's economic malaise.
	   Voting closed at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT) _ two hours later than usual
due to concerns over falling voter turnout in recent elections. The
results of about 90 percent of the races were expected by 1 a.m.
Monday (1600 GMT Sunday).
	   According to the Home Affairs Ministry, 44.51 percent of Japan's
99.4 million registered voters had cast ballots by early Sunday
evening, assuring a higher turnout than the total 44.52 percent who
voted in the last upper house election three years ago.
	   The high turnout may have worked against Hashimoto.
	   Sunday's elections were the first for the upper house since he
came to power in early 1996. With record-high unemployment, rising
bankruptcies, and party members tainted by bribery scandals, the
ruling party had geared up for a rough ride.
	   ``I think I did as much as I can do,'' Hashimoto told reporters
Sunday morning. ``I really hope for a good result.''
	   Opposition parties urged voters to send a message that they are
unhappy with the way Hashimoto has handled the economy, and
stressed that Japan's doldrums have aggravated a financial crisis
throughout Asia.
	   ``As long as the LDP is in power, the economy will only get
worse,'' Akira Nagaoka, 34, said after voting in central Tokyo.
Nagaoka said he supported the Democratic Party, the largest
opposition group.
	   Other voters, however, said they felt the Liberal Democrats were
the safest bet.
	   ``Japan needs steady policies,'' said 78-year-old salesman Kunio
Kanno.
	   Worries about the deepening economic morass have sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows over the past several
weeks.
	   Many voters blame Hashimoto for making the economy worse by
raising the national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year _
just as the economy was showing signs of recovery.
	   Hashimoto also embarrassed himself on the tax issue by
repeatedly flip-flopping on the campaign trail. At one point last
week he said he supported ``permanent tax reforms'' and then
backtracked two days later. He now says he supports cuts.
	   Winning 61 seats _ the break-even point _ would leave the ruling
party eight seats short of a majority, forcing it to seek outside
partners to pass legislation.
	   It had previously worked with two much smaller parties _ the
Socialists and another liberal group _ in a rather precarious
coalition.
	   Finding a willing partner may be more difficult in the future.
The LDP's previous partners have distanced themselves from the
ruling party, and are now fighting to survive.
	   The decline of the Socialists, who until a few years ago were
the LDP's only serious rival, has been met with the rise of a new
opposition group headed by a charismatic liberal, Naoto Kan.
	   Kan's Democratic Party held 38 seats in the upper house going
into the election. But Kan's personal popularity has been clouded
by the party's vague stance on major issues.

U.N. team arrives in Iraq to take warhead parts for testing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. team of arms monitors arrived in
Iraq on Sunday to collect parts of missile warheads that may have
been loaded with deadly VX gas and send them to European
laboratories for testing.
	   An American laboratory last month determined that Iraq loaded
the gas into warheads before the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq disputed the
findings, and the United Nations agreed to send the parts to
laboratories in France and Switzerland for testing.
	   The 15-member team, led by German Horst Reeps, includes three
scientists from France and three from Switzerland, said Janet
Sullivan, spokeswoman for the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq. The
team is expected to leave Baghdad on Thursday.
	   Some experts on the team will also conduct talks with Iraqi
chemical weapons officials on the scope of Iraq's work with VX, a
gas so deadly a few drops can kill, Sullivan said.
	   Reeps, the top U.N. chemical arms investigator, will report to
chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, on the meetings.
	   Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX but denies that it ever
turned it into a weapon. Butler has said he has no doubt about the
finding of the U.S. laboratory.
	   Iraq's state-run al-Qadissiya newspaper, in a front-page
editorial Sunday, said Butler ``once again exposes his true
identity ... as an obedient tool in the hands of the U.S.
administration.''
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 will
not be lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify that Baghdad has
eliminated all its banned weapons.

World Cup: Croatia's excellent run ends in third place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Croatia surprised everyone at France 98, up to the
last weekend.
	   ``I said before we came to France that no one should
underestimate us, that there was no limit on what we could
achieve,'' said coach Miroslav Blazevic after his team defeated the
Netherlands 2-1 Saturday to clinch third place.
	   Contesting its first World Cup, Croatia quietly slipped into the
second before unleashing all its forces. It won against Romania
and, most important of all, it thrashed archrival Germany in the
quarterfinal before falling to France in the semifinal.
	   Croatia's game was based on a well-organized - and often packed
- defense and lightning counterattacks.
	   That strategy was on show Saturday as the Netherlands pounded
Croatia with attack after attack, only to fall to first-half
breakaway goals by Robert Prosinecki and Davor Suker who, with six
goals, stood as the tournament's top scorer with only one match to
play.
	   Despite fielding such players as Real Madrid's Suker and AC
Milan midfielder Zvonimir Boban, many thought the team lacked
experience at the highest level.
	   Croatia was also without injured Lazio striker Alen Boksic, a
regular first team starter.
	   But few other teams could match the Croatians for competitive
spirit and team unity, qualities that lasted through to the third
placed playoff, a match where players often find it hard to get
motivated.
	   ``Croatia had a mentality and will to win that we didn't
possess,'' said Dutch player Phillip Cocu after the match.
	   The team also found new stars like goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   ``If Ladic is not the best in the world then he is in the top
three. If he puts his mind to it, no one is better,'' captain Boban
said.
	   Now, the team is waiting to celebrate its third place.
	   ``It is an honor to come third. Now we are all looking forward
to going back to Zagreb, where there will be 100,000 people and a
big party waiting for us,'' said midfielder Mario Stanic.
	   Croatia's march to third place wasn't without controversy.
	   Embassy officials lodged an official complaint to FIFA after
World Cup organizers used an interpreter that spoke Serbo-Croat
with a Serb accent at a post-match press conference.
	   The team beat Romania in round two thanks to a controversial
penalty, and in the semifinal Slaven Bilic was accused of getting
Laurent Blanc sent off by overacting, putting the French defender
out of the championship match.
	   But the Croats are going home a happy bunch, showing that a
small nation - Croatia has a population of less than five million -
can prosper at the highest level.
	   ``We have been in a war and surrounded by the war. Now we can
show something else to the world,'' said team spokesman Bronko
Miksa. ``We all wear T-shirts that say we are proud to be Croats.''

Monaco tempt England manager with dlrs 6.64 million offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monaco has offered England World Cup soccer
manager Glenn Hoddle 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.64 million) to
replace existing manager Jean Tigana, the News of the World
revealed Sunday.
	   The newspaper said the French soccer team had offered Hoddle a
four-year deal to quit his England contract if, as expected, Tigana
takes over as the French national team's manager.
	   The News of the World said Tigana was favorite to succeed French
coach Aime Jacquet, who confirmed Saturday he would stand down
after the World Cup final between France and Brazil on Sunday.
	   Hoddle, who managed Chelsea in the English premier league before
taking the helm as England boss, played 12 seasons with Tottenham
Hotspur and had a stint at Monaco in the late 1980s.
	   Hoddle has refused to negotiate a new contract binding him to
England until the next World Cup since his English team was
eliminated from France '98 in a penalty shoot-out to Argentina.

Manchester United prepare to match transfer record for Yorke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Manchester, England (AP) _ Manchester United has indicated it
will pay a British record-equalling 15 million-pound (dlrs 24.9
million) transfer fee to Aston Villa for Dwight Yorke.
	   The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported the English premier league
giants told Aston Villa it will match the record transfer fee
Newcastle paid Blackburn to sign England captain Alan Shearer.
	   But Aston Villa has attempted to stave off Manchester United's
approach by offering the Trinidad-born striker 30,000 pounds (dlrs
49,800) a week and a long-term contact.
	   The 26-year-old striker has two years to run on his contract at
Villa Park and is being offered a five-year deal to stay.
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is desperately trying to
sign a high profile striker before the new season and Yorke remains
his No.1 target, the paper said.
	   Ferguson is also reported to be negotiating with two Italian
clubs in an attempt to lure either of Argentina's World Cup stars
Ariel Ortega or Gabriel Batistuta to Old Trafford.

More than 600 suspected drug traffickers arrested in Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine police have arrested more
than 600 suspected drug traffickers, including 21 foreigners, so
far this year, and are targeting syndicate heads in their latest
crackdown, officials say.
	   Three of the suspects, including a Chinese citizen and a
Philippine navy sailor, were shot and killed by anti-narcotics
agents in separate gunfights, said police chief superintendent
Reynaldo Acop.
	   Acop, chief of the National Police's anti-narcotics group, said
in a report obtained Sunday that most of those arrested were caught
with the drug methamphetamine hydrochloride, locally known as
shabu, in quantities that would qualify them for the death penalty
if convicted.
	   He said most of the arrested foreigners were Chinese.
	   Acop said police were targeting leaders of drug syndicates in an
effort to weaken the gangs.
	   ``There is no single approach that could save society from the
cycle of drug use,'' Acop said. ``The strategy of demand reduction
and supply reduction is still our best approach to the drug
problem.''
	   Drug use has risen rapidly in the Philippines despite a law that
provides for the death penalty for possession of more than 200
grams (7 ounces) of shabu or 40 grams (1.4 ounces) of cocaine,
heroin, opium or morphine.
	   There are an estimated 1.7 million drug users in the
Philippines, most of them hooked on shabu, regarded as the ``poor
man's cocaine.'' The yearly trade in drugs is estimated at 300
billion pesos (dlrs 7.5 billion), officials said.
	   Acop said constant police and military action against
traffickers has led to a shortage of shabu in many provincial
areas, causing a rise in the prices of the banned drug.
	   He said more people were cooperating with authorities to break
drug syndicates. He cited the seizure of 243 kilograms (534 pounds)
of illegal drugs worth 500 million pesos (dlrs 12.5 million) in the
northern Philippines in June due to tips provided by fishermen used
as couriers.
	   Police have charged four people, including one Taiwanese, linked
to the foiled smuggling of the drugs, the largest amount to be
seized in the Philippines this year.
	   New President Joseph Estrada has urged authorities to turn in a
``big fish'' among the country's crime groups to prove that a
government drive against drug syndicates and corruption is real.

New clashes in Kosovo despite diplomatic efforts to end fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two Serb policemen killed, quote and suggestion
from Kinkel, trims.
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats worked Sunday to find a
new approach to resolving the crisis in Kosovo, where the latest
clashes have claimed the lives of at least two Serb policemen, Serb
sources said Sunday.
	   In Bonn Sunday, Germany Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel telephoned
his counterparts in the six-nation Contact Group searching for a
diplomatic solution to discuss new ideas for ending the fighting,
his spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   On Saturday, Kinkel and Russia's Yevgeny Primakov met in Moscow
and discussed ``new, creative possibilities'' for Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence
from Serbia _ part of Yugoslavia.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel on
Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference like the Dayton peace accord
_ which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``Perhaps we need a process
that resembles the one that took place in Dayton,'' the paper
quoted him as saying.
	   Following Saturday's talks, Kinkel told journalists it was time
to consider a new method to get both sides to agree to a cease-fire
and peace talks.
	   Meanwhile the fighting continued in Kosovo.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two Serb policemen
were killed and one was seriously wounded in a rash of attacks by
the KLA on police checkpoints in western Kosovo. No independent
confirmation was immediately available.
	   Earlier Saturday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on the
village of Lodja, on the outskirts of Kosovo's second-largest city
Pec in western Kosovo, independent sources reported. Ethnic
Albanian sources said a 78-year-old ethnic Albanian man was killed
and three others were wounded, but police failed to recapture the
village.
	   However, the Serb Media Center, quoting government sources, said
police regained control of a five-kilometer (three-mile) stretch of
the road during the ``action'' to locate two missing police
officers.
	   Police came under fire as soon as they approached Lodja and,
``after two hours of battle, armed Albanians ran away,'' but the
police officers killed three days ago were not found, the Serb
Media Center said.
	   Lodja is a KLA stronghold and a reputed center for weapons
smuggling from Albania
	   Also Saturday, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in the
Decani area, east of Pec, and near the border town of Djakovica.
	   On Sunday there were independent reports of continued shooting
around Pec.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to stop the
fighting for fear it will spread to other Balkan countries with
large ethnic Albanian communities.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists, who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.

Settlers want to restore synagogue in Jerusalem's Muslim Quarter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A city preservation committee has approved
plans to rebuild a synagogue in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's
walled Old City, municipal officials confirmed Sunday.
	   The Kol Hair newspaper said reconstruction of the Ohel Yitzhak
synagogue will be financed by the right-wing American Jewish
millionaire Irving Moskowitz.
	   Moskowitz, who lives in Miami, is a major financial backer of
Ateret Cohanim, a group leading a campaign to settle Jews in the
Muslim Quarter and other Palestinian neighborhoods of east
Jerusalem.
	   Clashes with Palestinian protesters broke out in May when the
group set up seven sheds in an empty lot in the Muslim Quarter,
trying to establish a new enclave there.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state, and fear that
groups such as Ateret Cohanim are trying to seize land before the
city's final status is determined in peace talks.
	   Plans for the restoration of the synagogue were approved by the
city's historic buildings preservation committee, but still must
get approval from the municipal planning and construction
sub-committee and the Interior Ministry's district planning
commission.
	   Ornan Yekutieli, a city council member from the left-wing Meretz
Party, said he would have supported the restoration if it were
being proposed in the context of peace.
	   ``Since it comes at a time of confrontation, when Ateret Cohanim
is moving into Palestinian neighborhoods, I think it will only fan
the flames of hostility and make it more difficult to achieve
Jewish-Arab coexistence in the city,'' he said.
	   The synagogue was damaged by fire during the Arab riots against
the Jews and the British Mandatory authorities in 1929.
	   ``The roof and one of the walls are missing, but the rest of the
shell is intact, including some very fine stonework and even
decorative plaster work,'' said Shimshon Salzman of
Salzman-Deutsch, the architects for the restoration project.

Kuwait intercepts two vessels for violating Iraq embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwaiti coast guard has intercepted two
vessels carrying dates and wool from Iraq in violation of the U.N.
embargo, an Interior Ministry official said Sunday.
	   The coast guard seized the ships two weeks ago after they
entered Kuwaiti waters, the official said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   One of the boats was registered in India. The other was
registered in the United Arab Emirates, the official said.
	   Scores of ships have been intercepted in the Gulf since the
United Nations imposed economic sanctions against Iraq after
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Iraq seeking Syria's approval to reopen pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid
left Sunday for neighboring Syria to push for the reopening of a
pipeline Syria shut 16 years ago, Oil Ministry officials said.
	   Iraq announced last week that it had completed repairs on its
part of the pipeline, which can carry up to 650,000 barrels a day.
But Syria has yet to give permission for the oil to pass.
	   Officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said
reopening the pipeline would be on the agenda in Rashid's talks
with his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Maher Jamal.
	   The pipeline links Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean
terminals of Banias in Syria and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   Syria closed the line in April 1982, dealing a severe blow to
Iraq, which was then involved in a war with Iran. Syria sided with
non-Arab Iran in the 1980-1988 war.
	   Iraqi oil exports allowed under U.N. exemptions to sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait are shipped through the
Gulf and Turkey. Exports through Syria would require U.N. approval.

 &UR; Pope, in Alpine setting, warns of technology &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LORENZAGO, Italy (AP) _ Warning that mankind must not become a
slave to technology, Pope John Paul II looked out Sunday over the
magnificent Alps and urged people to take time to enjoy the
beauties of nature.
	   Some 1,500 people -- roughly double the population of this
mountain hamlet -- turned out on a hillside for the pope's first
public appearance since he arrived in the Alps Wednesday night to
begin a 13-day vacation.
	   John Paul drew on his recent admonition to Roman Catholics to be
more respectful of the commandment to keep Sunday a special day for
the faith as well as an occasion for wholesome relaxation.
	   ``Our life, in the age of technology, risks becoming ever more
anonymous and a function of the productive process,'' the pope
said. ``Man thus becomes incapable of enjoying the beauties of
creation, and, even more, of reading in them the reflection of the
face of God.''
	   He called the natural world a ``vital antidote'' to boredom,
lack of direction, desperation and other ills of modern life.
	   John Paul, his face already reddened from the mountain sun,
spoke from the porch of the white brick and wooden two-story villa
about 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above sea level.
	   At times his words were slurred and his left hand trembled,
possible symptons of Parkinson's disease. The Vatican, however, has
never confirmed he suffers from that ailment.
	   The Vatican has scaled down the pope's once active schedule
because of his infirmities and his 78 years. John Paul has had to
give up his long hikes. Now he is driven to isolated areas where he
can take briefer strolls and pause to enjoy the scenery.
	   ``Time passes for everyone,'' said papal spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, insisting John Paul has fully adjusted to a less
demanding program.
	   John Paul has left on an excursion each day since arriving in
Lorenzago, a two-hour drive north of Venice. He has been driven as
high as 2,400 meters (7,900 feet) above sea level, to take in the
view above Cortina D'Ampezzo, his spokesman said.

General suggests outsiders behind Irian Jaya pro-independence
</HEADLINE>
protests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A regional Indonesian military
commander has suggested that outside parties have encouraged recent
pro-independence protests in the former Dutch colony of western New
Guinea.
	   Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring, chief of the Trikora Military Command,
said reports by foreign agencies on the protests also have raised
antipathy toward Indonesia abroad.
	   ``There is a strong indication of involvement of external
parties in the demonstrations in Irian Jaya,'' the official Antara
news agency quoted Sembiring as saying Sunday.
	   A smoldering sense of injustice under the old regime of Suharto,
who resigned as president in May, has led indigenous people to
demonstrate for independence for Indonesia's easternmost province.
	   At least one protester has been reported killed and dozens of
others wounded as police and soldiers opened fire to break up
protests in the Irian Jaya capital of Jayapura as well as the towns
of Sorong and Wamena, and Biak on Biak Island.
	   One police officer who was beaten by protesters in Jayapura on
July 2 died later in a hospital, and two students who were shot
remain in critical condition.
	   The military called the protesters ``treasonous'' because they
unlawfully raised the flag of the Free Papua Movement, which has
been fighting Indonesian rule in the territory.
	   ``I am not sure if such demonstrations were purely the
initiative of the native Irian Jaya people,'' said Sembiring, who
oversees the eastern provinces of Irian Jaya and Maluku.
	   Copies of letters from the U.S. Congress and John F. Kennedy
Foundation, dated May 22, were found disseminated among the people
in villages in the province, he said without elaborating.
	   Sembiring did not accuse the United States, and promised an
investigation to find out who was disseminating the letters, Antara
said.
	   In Jakarta Sunday, a group of Irian Jaya people urged the
military to halt operations around the cities where the protests
occurred.
	   The Solidarity Committee of Irian (Papua) People also called for
an independent investigation and urged the government to allow the
International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian
agencies to help the victims.
	   Indonesia took over the western half of New Guinea in 1963. Six
years later, in a U.N.-sponsored vote, people in the territory
formally chose integration with Indonesia.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Parisians prepared Sunday for their biggest street
party since Liberation Day in 1944 to mark the climactic game of
World Cup soccer championships.
	   If France beats Brazil in the finale at the Stade de France, a
million people are expected to take to the streets of the capital
to celebrate the nation's first ever World Cup triumph.
	   Momentum has been building over the past week as France marched
to the final against the defending champions and four-time World
Cup winners.
	   After France qualified by beating Croatia on Wednesday night,
some 350,000 people flocked to the Champs Elysees boulevard for a
wild night of honking horns, waving flags, spraying champagne in an
outpour of good-natured chauvinism.
	   A poll carried out by IPSOS and the daily France Soir indicated
that 72 percent of the nation's 60 million citizens will pour into
the streets, from the capital to the tiniest of villages, if ``Les
Bleus'' beat Brazil.
	   A sizable, but discreet, security operation was in place to
anticipate the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at strategic
points across Paris.
	   Public buses were bedecked with the French tricolor as Parisians
looked forward to a long weekend to remember _ Bastille Day,
France's national day, falls on Tuesday, and many workers also have
Monday as a holiday.
	   France's national car drivers' association urged all motorists
to toot their horns at 7 p.m., two hours before the kickoff, to
support the team.
	   President Jacques Chirac, who will attend the match to hand the
World Cup trophy to the winning team, had a large TV screen
installed at the Elysees Palace so staffers can watch the broadcast
and enjoy a buffet.
	   Whatever the outcome, Les Bleus will parade down the Champs
Elysees on an open-topped bus Monday afternoon, said French
Football Federation president Claude Simonet.
	   Still, not all plans for the party came to fruition.
	   The Ministry of Culture cancelled a proposal to cover the Arc de
Triomphe in huge blue jersey after specialists said it would be too
complicated.
	   Instead, the jersey will be hung from a building near the
monument.
	   The nation's spirits may be overheating but a breeze over the
capital was keeping the weather mild. Scattered clouds hung over
the city, but there was no rain in the forecast.

Sister of Australian bridge collapse weeps at accident site

<TEXT>
	   RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) _ Nearly one year after her sister was
killed when a footbridge collapsed at the opening ceremony of
Israel's Maccabiah Games, Jeany Simons stood over the accident site
on Sunday and wept.
	   Her sister, Yetty Bennet, 50, was one of four Australian
athletes who died after the bridge over the polluted Yarkon River
collapsed last July 14. Dozens of other team members were injured.
	   Simons and her husband Andrew came to Israel last week to watch
the trial of five defendants charged in connection with the
collapse, and to ask for compensation and a parliamentary inquiry
into the tragedy.
	   They wrapped up their stay with a visit to the stadium where the
games were held outside of Tel Aviv.
	   Nervously grasping the railing of a wooden footbridge next to
the one which collapsed, the two walked to the middle and look down
into the waters where her sister drowned.
	   There, Jeany wept for several minutes, resting her head on the
high railing as her husband comforted her.
	   Bennet's death was a result of drowning but the poisonous waters
of the river are believed to have been a factor on the deaths of
two other athletes. On Sunday, broken shopping carts and plastic
bottles mixed among floating green waste and other garbage in the
river.
	   An emotional Mrs. Simons, picked up what appeared to be rusted
old wiring from the collapsed bridge and said ``This is what my
sister's life was worth, rubbish - it's unbelievable,'' she said,
wiping tears from her eyes.
	   She said she would not forgive the Maccabiah organizers. ``We
won't forget, we can't forget,'' she said.
	   Dozens of lawsuits are expected to be filed by the victims'
families and Mrs. Simons, who is now taking care of her sister's
three children, said she hoped the Israeli government would provide
compensation.
	   ``The last thing these kids need is to be put on hold while this
drags on and on. They need help now,'' she said.
	   The couple met with Israel's president and several members of
parliament. Knesset speaker Dan Tichon promised to raise the
compensation issue in parliament Wednesday, Mrs. Simons said.
	   Standing in front of a new sign in Hebrew which read ``danger,
polluted waters,'' Mrs. Simons said a week of meetings and the
court sessions left them feeling optimistic that ``justice will be
served.''
	   The couple said they were touched by the efforts of several
Israelis who built a stone memorial at the site graced with flowers
and memorial candles.
	   ``This helps build a stronger bridge, one which we hope will
bridge gaps between Israel and Australia. This has hurt our
relations,'' She said. Mrs. Simons added that there were plans to
build a permanent memorial.
	   Before leaving the site ahead of their flight back to Australia,
Mr. and Mrs. Simons paused for a private moment of silence at the
river's edge.

Reports: Security increased for Thai premier after threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have tightened security outside
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's residence in response to rumors
of threats against him, Bangkok newspapers reported Sunday.
	   Six policemen from a special anti-crime unit have been posted
outside the prime minister's house in a quiet residential
neighborhood since Thursday, the Bangkok Post reported. It said the
street outside his house is normally guarded by two policemen from
the local precinct house.
	   The Post said the police Special Branch division, which handles
political affairs, had intelligence reports of threats against
senior government officials as well as the possibility of sabotage
attempts.
	   Chuan was reported to have downplayed the matter, saying he had
not asked for increased security.
	   Those threatened also included Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart and Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset, the
newspaper said, quoting an unnamed source at the metropolitan
Police Bureau.
	   Both Interior Ministry officials are members of Chuan's Democrat
party.
	   For the past several weeks, Thai newspapers have been
highlighting reports of political tensions involving two outspoken
critics of Chuan.
	   One is a former military officer sacked after taking part in a
failed 1981 coup, and the other is a senior police officer due for
retirement in a few months. His extreme right-wing views have long
put him at odds with Chuan's middle-of-the-road Democrat party.
	   While former army Col. Prachak Sawangchit is politically
insignificant, Deputy Police Chief Salang Bunnag could hold police
information potentially damaging to the government. Salang's feud
with his boss, Interior Minister Sanan, has been especially bitter.
	   Neither has any political following, but the Thai press has been
feverishly speculating over whether their criticisms could be a
wedge for destabilizing action against the government.

Four arrested in Rome after right-wing deputy beaten up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police arrested four Roman youths Sunday following
scuffles in which a right-wing deputy was beaten up, and a clash in
Turin left police officers injured.
	   Teodoro Buontempo, of the formerly neo-fascist National Alliance
party, was strolling with some friends across Campo de' Fiori, one
of Rome's most picturesque squares, late Saturday night when,
according to his account, some 50 youths surrounded him.
	   ``They attacked me with bottles, sticks, fists and kicks,'' said
Buontempo, with a patch over a punched eye after he was treated at
a hospital.
	   Leaders of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance, the
nation's main political opposition group, which includes
Buontempo's party, blamed the violence on leftist extremists.
	   Tension was likely fed by the suicide in Turin earlier in the
day of a young anarchist under house arrest, the second such death
in three months in that northern city.
	   Despite Turin's mayor call for calm Saturday, youths scuffled
with police, leaving four officers injured, RAI state TV said.
Demonstrators also lit a bonfire in a city square.
	   In April, following the suicide of a jailed anarchist, thousands
of youths marched through the streets of Turin.
	   Prosecutors were investigating the suicide of Maria Soledad
Rosas, who was reportedly found dead in a shower stall with a
bedsheet around her neck.
	   The 22-year-old woman, described as the daughter of a wealthy
Argentine family, was put under house arrest after being indicted
in connection with theft and fire at a small town city hall in an
Alpine Valley where a high-speed train project is being studied.
	   The Turin anarchists are against the rich, the government,
private property and the rail project.

Abiola's last appeal: freedom for Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Like a chilling voice from the grave,
Moshood Abiola made one final, eloquent appeal to his compatriots
Sunday, calling for an end to military rule and freedom for his
people.
	   Almost prophetically, he described in a published letter the
isolation and despair of life after four years in prison: ``I was
like a man put in an open grave.''
	   The country's most prominent political prisoner, Abiola died
Tuesday while still in custody.
	   His death set off days of rioting and chaos in Lagos and the
southern Nigerian cities of Ibadan and Abeokuta. At least 55 people
died in the violence; more than 400 were arrested.
	   In the letter to Nigerian human rights leader Gani Fawehinmi he
says it is only a matter of time before the military is forced from
power.
	   ``Time searches out and destroys all things,'' Abiola wrote in
the letter published Sunday in the Lagos-based Tribune newspaper.
	   Vowing to return to politics to reclaim his elected mandate as
president, he said ``there is no statute of limitation on valid
elections.''
	   Abiola was the presumed winner of 1993 presidential elections
that were annulled. He was jailed the following year by then
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and accused of treason.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, according to the
preliminary findings of an independent autopsy. He was buried
Saturday in a garden ceremony at his Lagos residence, where
thousands upon thousands of people turned out to say goodbye.
	   The rioting now quelled, the country is relatively calm once
again, but Abiola is being bitterly remembered.
	   The results of the autopsy may have exonerated Nigeria's ruling
military junta on charges it killed Abiola, but pro-democracy
groups are still saying the army is to blame for the tragedy.
	   ``I'm strangely relieved that the results of the autopsy didn't
show any foul play by the military junta,'' said Olisa Agbakoba,
the national coordinator of the United Action for Democracy.
	   He adds, however, ``It was medical neglect that led to Chief
Abiola's death while in four years of detention under the junta.''
	   Agbakoba and Abiola's family members have been urging for calm,
but pushing for the end of military rule in Nigeria.
	   This death, says Agbakoba, should be a catalyst for change, not
a trigger for violence.
	   He said the military junta should now step up plans to hand
power over to civilians to help forestall a return to the violence
that resulted from Abiola's death.
	   Abiola died in custody while meeting with a group of visiting
U.S. officials. He had languished in prison for four years,
although his release had been expected soon.
	   Anger at Abiola's death underscores existing tensions between
rival ethnic groups in this already fractious country. Abiola, an
immensely popular southern businessman from the Yoruba clan,
challenged the ruling military's stranglehold on power. In Nigeria,
power has long been controlled by conservative northern Muslims
from the Hausa clan.
	   The Hausa-Yoruba enmity was born after Nigeria's 1960
independence from Britain. Through their influence in the military,
Hausa and closely related Fulani northerners have ruled Nigeria.
	   Southerners, both ethnically and religiously different from
their Hausa and Fulani compatriots, long have resented what they
consider the exploitation of their resources _ oil and other
minerals _ by northern rulers.
	   These days, Nigeria's pro-democracy movement is largely led by
southerners, particularly Yorubas.
	   Since the death of Abacha on June 8, the new military junta has
been scrambling to gain public trust. Nigeria's new military
leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has released a group of political
prisoners and promised to free the rest. He also has vowed _ albeit
vaguely _ to return the country to civilian rule.

New clashes in Kosovo despite diplomatic efforts to end fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TRIMS throughout &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats worked Sunday to find a
new approach to resolving the crisis in Kosovo, where the latest
clashes have claimed the lives of at least two Serb policemen, Serb
sources said Sunday.
	   In Bonn on Sunday, Germany Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
telephoned his counterparts in the six-nation Contact Group
searching for a diplomatic solution to discuss new ideas for ending
the fighting, his spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   On Saturday, Kinkel and Russia's Yevgeny Primakov met in Moscow
and discussed ``new, creative possibilities'' for Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence
from Serbia _ part of Yugoslavia.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel on
Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference like the Dayton peace accord
_ which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``Perhaps we need a process
that resembles the one that took place in Dayton,'' the paper
quoted him as saying.
	   Meanwhile the fighting continued in Kosovo.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two Serb police
officers were killed late Saturday and early Sunday and one was
seriously wounded in a rash of attacks by the KLA on police
checkpoints in western Kosovo. No independent confirmation was
immediately available.
	   Earlier Saturday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on the
KLA stronghold of Lodja, on the outskirts of Kosovo's
second-largest city Pec in western Kosovo, independent sources
reported. Ethnic Albanian sources said they held the town, but Serb
sources said they had made inroads.
	   Also Saturday, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in the
Decani area, east of Pec and there were independent reports Sunday
of continued shooting around Pec.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to stop the
fighting for fear it will spread to other Balkan countries with
large ethnic Albanian communities.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists, who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.

Colombian delegates meet with rebel group in Germany

	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombian civic leaders took a tentative
step toward peace in Latin America's longest-running civil war
Sunday, opening talks with representatives of the country's
second-largest rebel group.
	   The closed, four-day meeting in Mainz with envoys of the
5,000-member National Liberation Army, or ELN, is aimed at
preparing for direct talks between the rebels and the incoming
government of president-elect Andres Pastrana.
	   The Mainz talks have been overshadowed by Pastrana's suprise
meeting in Colombia on Thursday with leaders of the country's
largest rebel group and his vow to begin negotiations with them
within 90 days of his Aug. 7 inauguration.
	   Both events are adding momentum to peace expectations among
millions of Colombians who want an end to the country's 34-year
war. Still, talks delegates warned against unrealistic hopes that
they will return from Germany with peace in hand.
	   ``We don't want to generate any false expectations,'' said Sabas
Pretelt, head of a leading industry association and a member of the
Colombian peace commission that set up the talks.
	   Pretelt gathered in a Mainz hotel lobby with Colombian delegates
from industry, labor, social agencies and the Roman Catholic church
before heading into the talks in Catholic bishops' offices near the
Mainz cathedral. Rebels already were inside the compound when civic
delegates arrived.
	   Pastrana did not send an official representative.
	   ``The purpose of this meeting is to open the channels for
dialogue,'' said Hernando Hernandez, leader of Colombia's USO labor
union. ``We are urgently seeking peace for Colombia.''
	   No rebel delegates were immediately available for comment.
	   The ELN's main rallying cry has been against foreign
exploitation of Colombia's natural resources, and it often attacks
oil pipelines and kidnaps industry executives. Based mainly in
Colombia's northeast oil-producing regions, the ELN's income is
largely from extortion and kidnapping.
	   The ELN is far less prodigious militarily than the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and is seen as far
more likely to agree to disarm in return for political concessions.
	   Germany's Roman Catholic church, coordinating the talks jointly
with Colombian colleagues, has insisted the meeting remain as
closed as possible, saying publicity could hamper its outcome. The
exact site originally was kept secret, but reporters followed
delegates' cars to the bishops' offices.
	   ``The original intention was to have the talks entirely in
secret, the kind you find out about only afterward, like the Oslo
talks that led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,'' church
spokesman Rudolf Hammerschmidt said.
	   Hammerschmidt said there would be no statements from the meeting
before a news conference scheduled at the close of talks Wednesday.

Novotna wins Skoda Czech Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Top-seeded Jana Novotna of the
Czech Republic beat France's Sandrine Testud in two straight sets
Sunday to win the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech Open ladies clay court
tournament.
	   In the first set, the Wimbledon Champion and world No. 2
Novotna, broke Testud's serve in the first game, only to loose her
own in the second. Novotna then broke Testud's serve in the 7th and
9th games, to win the first set 6-3.
	   On the windy and rain-soaked court in Prague, Novotna prevented
Testud, ranked 13th on the WTA, from winning a single game in the
second set, winning it 6-0.
	   ``Sandrine was playing very well, but the wind was causing
problems,'' Novotna said after the match. ``But I felt fine and
that's perhaps why I did not mind the strong wind.''
	   Novotna victory earned her dlrs 26,000 and 80 points in the WTA
rating.

Fighters beat Marines 4-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson singled home a run in the two-run
first inning and Yoshinori Ueda hit a two-run double in the third
as the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters beat the
Chiba Lotte Marines 4-2 at Chiba Sunday.
	   That ended a three-game winning streak for the Marines, who were
rebounding from a Japanese professional record 18 consecutive
defeats.
	   Wilson formerly played for the Cleveland Indians.
	   The Fighters are six games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who
suffered a 13-0 drubbing by the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks at Osaka Dome.
	   The Hawks' Koichiro Yoshinaga went 3-for-3 and drove in six runs
with two home runs. He has nine homers for the season.
	   At Sapporo, Harvey Jerome Pulliam hit a two-run home run in the
three-run first inning and Yasuo Fujii added home runs in the first
and sixth innings as the Orix BlueWave beat the Seibu Lions 5-3.
	   Pulliam, formerly with the Colorado Rockies, has 12 homers and
Fujii 15.
	   In the Central League, the front-running Yokohama BayStars
scored six runs in the bottom of the ninth inning on six hits, a
walk and an error, saving a 9-9 tie with the Chunichi Dragons.
	   The game was halted after 12 innings because of failing light in
Obihiro, where the stadium has no lights for night play. It now
will be replayed.
	   In the top of the ninth, the Dragons went ahead 9-3 on Takeshi
Yamasaki's three-run home run, his 11th homer of the season.
	   But in the bottom of the ninth, Norihiro Komada ignited a
six-run rally with a single and drove in the tying run with a
grounder against reliever Sun Dong-yol in his second at-bat in the
inning.
	   Sun, who formerly played for south Korea's Hai Tai Tigers, gave
up four hits and one walk over two innings.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Tsuyoshi Shinjo drove in the tie-breaking run
with a grounder and pinch hitter Katsuhiko Yamada drove in another
run in the eighth as the Hanshin Tigers beat the Yomiuri Giants
6-4.
	   Reliever Ben Rivera, formerly with the Philadelphia Phillies,
held the Giants hitless in the last two innings for his second
victory against one defeat this season.
	   At Hiroshima, Katsuyuki Dobashi hit a two-run home run in the
top of the ninth and the Yakult Swallows beat the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp 5-3.

	   Almost prophetically, he described in a published letter the
isolation and despair of life after four years in prison: ``I was
like a man put in an open grave.''
	   The country's most prominent political prisoner, Abiola died
Tuesday while still in custody.
	   His death set off days of rioting and chaos in Lagos and the
southern Nigerian cities of Ibadan and Abeokuta. At least 55 people
died in the violence; more than 400 were arrested.
	   In the letter to Nigerian human rights leader Gani Fawehinmi he
says it is only a matter of time before the military is forced from
power.
	   ``Time searches out and destroys all things,'' Abiola wrote in
the letter published Sunday in the Lagos-based Tribune newspaper.
	   Vowing to return to politics to reclaim his elected mandate as
president, he said ``there is no statute of limitation on valid
elections.''
	   Abiola was the presumed winner of 1993 presidential elections
that were annulled. He was jailed the following year by then
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and accused of treason.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, according to the
preliminary findings of an independent autopsy. He was buried
Saturday in a garden ceremony at his Lagos residence, where
thousands upon thousands of people turned out to say goodbye.
	   The rioting now quelled, the country is relatively calm, but
Abiola and the tragic circumstances of his death are being
remembered.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Top-seeded Jana Novotna of the
Czech Republic beat France's Sandrine Testud in two straight sets
Sunday to win the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech Open ladies clay court
tournament.
	   In the first set, Wimbledon champion and world No. 2 Novotna
broke Testud's serve in the first game, only to loose her own in
the second. Novotna then broke Testud's serve in the 7th and 9th
games to win the first set 6-3.
	   On a windy and rain-soaked court in Prague, Novotna prevented
Testud, ranked 13th on the WTA, from winning a single game in the
second set, winning it 6-0.
	   ``Sandrine was playing very well, but the wind was causing
problems,'' Novotna said after the match. ``But I felt fine and
that's perhaps why I did not mind the strong wind.''
	   Novotna victory earned her dlrs 26,000 and 80 points in the WTA
rating.

Boys' deaths mark `turning point' in Northern Ireland dispute
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three young brothers who had
been asleep in their beds burned to death early Sunday in a
sectarian attack marking what shaken Northern Ireland leaders
termed a ``turning point'' in a violent stalemate over a blocked
Protestant march.
	   A neighbor reported hearing 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason Quinn screaming as fire gutted their residence
in Ballymoney, about 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother escaped with her Protestant boyfriend, who
was beaten back by flames when he returned to try to rescue the
brothers, police said. There were reports the boys were being
raised as Protestants.
	   A photograph released by the family showed three impish little
boys in sweatshirts, Richard's grin revealing a wide gap in the
middle of his teeth.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' Seamus Mallon, the Catholic
deputy leader of the new Belfast Assembly, asked protesters on both
sides of the marching barricades. ``Does it take one child, two
children, three children?''
	   A hollow-eyed Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said he considered the boys' deaths a ``turning
point'' in the increasingly fractious standoff over the Orange
Order's stymied attempts to march down the predominantly Catholic
Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Authorities counseled Catholics, who mostly had remained out of
the fray since the July 5 stalemate began, not to retaliate for the
boys' deaths.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant party and the first minister of the Belfast
Assembly.
	   Many Protestant church leaders, who had remained on the
sidelines as the violence escalated, said it was time for the
standoff to end.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, urged everyone
_ ``mothers, fathers, sons and daughters'' _ to stay home Monday,
one of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant marching days, for the
sake of the province's fragile peace.
	   All Protestants and Catholics should ``think twice before they
exit their front doors,'' she said.
	   Belfast had turned into a ghost town and armored vehicles moved
in Sunday in anticipation of the Orangemen's Lower Ormeau Road
parade, second only to Portadown in its capacity to fuel sectarian
emotions.
	   The march _ and hundreds of others like it across the province _
commemorates the defeat of Catholic King James II by King William
of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   In North Belfast, authorities said an 18-year-old man was beaten
to death early Sunday. A motive had not been established, but
police said the area had experienced some of the worst sectarian
tension during this season's marching crisis.
	   In Ballymoney, which had escaped most of the violence this year,
griefstricken residents laid bouquets outside the blackened
residence where Chrissy Quinn, the three boys' mother, and
boyfriend Raymond Craig had lived for only one week.
	   The couple had moved to the housing estate from another
residence in this overwhelmingly Protestant town. It is not
uncommon for mixed-religion families to be targeted for attacks.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the uncompromising hard-line Protestant
leader, toured the boys' neighborhood and spoke of the
``diabolical, hellish deed'' that took their lives with brimming
emotion.
	   But most members of the Protestant Orange Order, while
expressing their deepest sympathies for the brothers' deaths,
disavowed any responsibility.
	   ``Our society is responsible,'' Orange Order spokesman David
Jones said.
	   A 35-year-old Protestant in Portadown who would give his name
only as Stevie typified the resolute stance of some of the
protesters.
	   ``Nothing has been achieved through peaceful protests,'' he told
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency. ``Three innocent
children have been killed, but it is just casualties of war.''
	   Members of the Orange Order started negotiating through
intermediaries Saturday with the Catholic residents of Garvaghy
Road, but no progress was reported when the talks adjourned after
six hours.
	   Sunday, the government-appointed parades commission turned down
a second application from the Orangemen to march down the road and
it was not clear when the indirect talks between the opposing sides
would continue.
	   Robin Eames, archbishop of the Church of Ireland, the local
Anglican-affiliated denomination, said the thousands of Protestant
protesters encamped outside the Portadown barricades and engaging
in increasingly violent attacks on police should go home now.
	   ``I want to see space given for the talks to succeed,'' he said.
``Nothing is worth the lives of three little children.''

Diplomats call for new approach as fighting continues in Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA statement, ethnic Albanian reports of seven
killed, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats called for a new approach
to negotiating a solution for Kosovo, where the latest clashes
between Serb and Albanian forces claimed the lives of at least nine
people.
	   Two Serb policemen were killed when Albanian militants attacked
checkpoints along the province's main roads, the Serb Media Center
reported Sunday. The Kosovo Information Center reported seven
Albanians were wounded in a Serb attack on a village in western
Kosovo.
	   In a statement released Sunday, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army said seven fighters were killed in weekend clashes
in Kosovo, where where they are fighting for independence from
Serbia _ part of Yugoslavia.
	   The KLA also called for unity of the Albanian people and
denounced the ``shameful bickering'' of the politicians, which has
also frustrated international officials trying to organize talks
between the Albanians and the Yugoslav government.
	   In Bonn Sunday, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel telephoned
his counterparts Western counterparts to discuss the previous day's
meeting with Russia's Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, Kinkel's
spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   On Saturday, Kinkel said ``new, creative possibilities'' were
needed to find a solution for Kosovo. In an interview published in
the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference
like the Dayton peace accord _ which ended the Bosnian war in 1995.
	   ``Perhaps we need a process that resembles the one that took
place in Dayton,'' he told the paper.
	   Following Saturday's talks, Kinkel told journalists that
previous attempts at a diplomatic solution had proved unfruitful
and it was time to consider a new method to get both sides to agree
to a cease-fire and peace talks.
	   In Kosovo Sunday, both sides reported fresh clashes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said seven Albanians were wounded
in a ``strong attack by Serb forces'' on the village of Streoc, 75
kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Pristina, Sunday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said one policeman had been
killed and another wounded when Albania militants attacked the Serb
checkpoint at Streoc, along the Pec-Decane road. Another policeman
was killed in a separate attack on another checkpoint in western
Kosovo, the center said. No independent confirmation for any of the
reports was immediately available.
	   Earlier Saturday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on the
village of Lodja, on the outskirts of Kosovo's second-largest city
Pec in western Kosovo, independent sources reported. Albanian
sources said a 78-year-old Albanian man was killed and three others
were wounded in Lodja, but police failed to recapture the village.
	   Lodja is a KLA stronghold and a reputed center for weapons
smuggling from Albania
	   Also Saturday, Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in the
Decani area, east of Pec, and near the border town of Djakovica.
	   On Sunday there were independent reports of continued shooting
around Pec.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   The Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy _ trying to negotiate an immediate cease-fire
followed by peace talks to end the fighting and prevent the
violence from spilling into neighboring regions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Six Thai fishermen have been
detained for allegedly fishing in Malaysian waters, the national
news agency said Sunday.
	   The six were detained Saturday by a Malaysian navy patrol boat
about 85 nautical miles (98 miles, 156 kilometers) off the coast of
the northeastern state of Trengganu, Bernama said.
	   It said the captain, identified only as Den, 30, and his five
crew members, aged between 18 and 30, would be charged Monday in
magistrate's court.
	   Their trawler and fishing gear were also seized, it said.
	   The state fisheries director, Abdul Rahman Mohamed, said that
since June 16, five trawlers had been detained and 27 foreign
fishermen fined a total of 4.64 million ringgit (dlrs 1.16 million)
for illegally fishing in Malaysian waters.

Malaysia chides Singapore media for remarks on new airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik
sees signs of envy in the Singapore media's negative remarks about
Malaysia's new Kuala Lumpur International Airport, a news report
said Sunday.
	   Speaking to reporters after visiting the dlrs 2.2 billion
airport, Ling said, ``It is to be expected. It is the behavior of a
competitor who likes to run down the airport, so that fewer
passengers will be using our airport.''
	   The national news agency Bernama quoted Ling as saying the
Singapore media were envious of the new airport's advantages,
including outstanding architecture and beautiful landscaping.
	   ``They also see the airport has the potential to be the hub of
regional air transportation,'' he said in comments on the
prominence given by some Singapore media to glitches at the new
airport in its first week of operations.
	   The airport is now operating normally after a week of chaos,
flight delays, missing luggage and a backlog of cargo.
	   Ling said a special team of local and foreign experts had been
set to work on the cargo backlog left from the first and second day
of operations.

Sweden's Gustafsson writes clay classic history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATING with doubles result

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
defeated Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine 6-2, 6-3 to become the first
player to win an unprecedented fourth title in the dlrs 340,000
Swedish Open ATP claycourt classic Sunday.
	   It was the second victory for the 31-year-old claycourt
specialist against Medvedev and the twelfth career ATP tour victory
for the Swede. Gustafsson also beat the Ukrainian 6-1, 6-3 in the
1996 final.
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, will not
only improve his current 26th ranking but also top such greats as
Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only others to win three titles
in this seaside tourney.
	   Gustafsson broke the 25-year-old Medvedev twice in the first set
to win 6-2. But Medvedev, 97th in the ATP ranking before this
tournament, bounced back early in the second set. He broke
Gustafsson for a 2-0 lead but the Swede broke back to level at 3-3
and then broke Medvedev again for 5-3 before he closed out the set
on his first match point.
	   In the doubles final Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson of
Sweden beat South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval 6-4, 6-2.

	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombian civic leaders converged in Mainz
for secretive talks with the country's second-largest rebel group
Sunday, another tentative step toward ending Latin America's
longest-running civil war.
	   The four-day meeting with envoys of the 5,000-member National
Liberation Army, or ELN, is to prepare for direct talks between the
rebels and Colombian president-elect Andres Pastrana.
	   The Germany talks have been overshadowed by Pastrana's suprise
meeting at home Thursday with leaders of Colombia's largest rebel
group and his vow to begin negotiations with them within 90 days of
his Aug. 7 inauguration. Pastrana did not send a representative to
Mainz.
	   Both events have increased hopes among millions of Colombians
who want an end to the country's 34-year war. But delegates warned
against assumptions that they will return from Germany with peace
in hand.
	   ``We don't want to generate any false expectations,'' said Sabas
Pretelt, head of a leading Colombian industry association and a
member of the peace commission set up the talks.
	   Pretelt gathered in a hotel lobby in Mainz, near Frankfurt, with
other Colombian delegates _ from industry, labor, social agencies
and the Roman Catholic church _ before meeting in the Catholic
bishops' offices near the Mainz cathedral.
	   `The purpose of this meeting is to open the channels for
dialogue,'' said Hernando Hernandez, leader of Colombia's USO labor
union. ``We are urgently seeking peace for Colombia.''
	   No rebels representatives were at the hotel in Mainz.
	   Initially, it appeared that the rebels were waiting for the
delegates inside the bishops' offices. But after a couple of hours,
the delegates left the offices alone and drove to an undisclosed
site -- most likely to meet the rebels.
	   Germany's Roman Catholic church, coordinating the talks jointly
with Colombian colleagues, has insisted the meeting remain as
closed as possible, saying publicity could hamper their outcome.
	   ``The original intention was to have the talks entirely in
secret, the kind you find out about only afterward, like the Oslo
talks that led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,'' church
spokesman Rudolf Hammerschmidt said.
	   The ELN's main rallying cry has been against foreign
exploitation of Colombia's natural resources, and it often attacks
oil pipelines and kidnaps industry executives. Based mainly in
Colombia's northeast oil-producing regions, the ELN's income is
largely from extortion and kidnapping.
	   The ELN is far less prodigious militarily than the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and is seen as far
more likely to be willing to disarm in return for political
concessions.
	   Participants have scheduled a news conference at Wednesday's
close of talks.

Egypt releases two North Korean diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police on Sunday released two men carrying
North Korean diplomatic passports who had been arrested on charges
of smuggling into Egypt half a million pills popularly known as the
``date-rape drug,'' officials said.
	   The men had arrived in Egypt on Friday from Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. Egyptian officials said the men were accredited to the
North Korean Embassy in Damascus.
	   The two were released because of their diplomatic immunity and
were allowed to leave for Damascus, police officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Egypt's Foreign Ministry and the North Korean Embassy in Cairo
refused to comment on the case.
	   Earlier, a diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Damascus, who
refused to give his name or rank, denied any knowledge of the pair,
and their names _ Kim Hak Jon and Kim Sal Jo _ do not appear on the
Syrian diplomatic list.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
	   Police said the two men had been carrying six bags filled with
504,000 tablets of Rohypnol, a hypnotic and muscle relaxant that is
used by youth as a pleasure-giving agent. The drugs have a street
value of some 5 million pounds (dlrs 1.47 million).
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the men were responsible
for security at the North Korean Embassy in Damascus.
	   An Egyptian government-controlled newspaper Sunday said the
incident wasn't the first involving North Korean diplomats.
	   In another incident, North Korean diplomats were found using
their diplomatic immunity to try to smuggle heroin into Egypt, the
Egyptian Gazette reported.

Schumacher wins British GP; third straight victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Michael Schumacher of Ferrari,
taking advantage when Mika Hakkinen's McLaren spun off a wet track
on the 51st of 60 laps, won Sunday's British Grand Prix to once
again show his mastery on a wet track.
	   Hakkinen finished second with third for Ferrari's Eddie Irvine.
	   It was Schumacher's third consecutive victory and his fourth
this season and moved him to within two points of series leader
Hakkinen in the points chase.
	   Hakkinen has 56 to 54 for Schumacher.
	   Schumacher won with a curious finish when he drove into the pit
lane as he finished his final lap. He came in to take a 10-second
penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag but still had a large
enough lead to claim the win, 22.4 seconds ahead of Hakkinen.
	   Hakkinen took the lead off his pole position and survived a
dramatic moment on the 42nd lap when his car hit standing water,
spun twice and flew off into a gravel area used to slow wayward
cars.
	   Hakkinen kept the engine running, swept across the grass and
gravel, and jumped back on to the track still in the lead and still
looking for a victory.
	   The Schumacher win, with near-torrential rain falling between
the 30th and 45th laps, increased the pressure on McLaren, which
has been the dominant team all season.
	   With the rain pouring down, the safety car came out on the 44th
lap _ with Hakkinen leading by 38 seconds over Schumacher _ and
went off as the race resumed on the 50th.
	   Hakkinen spin off the track on the 51st was less spectacular
than his first, but this time he drove back on in second place.
	   Coulthard had his dream of winning his home-country Grand Prix
and season championship broken when _ in second place on the 38th
lap _ he spun several times in standing water entering a turn and
ran off the course.

Sweden's Gustafsson writes clay classic history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATING with doubles result &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
defeated Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine 6-2, 6-3 to become the first
player to win an unprecedented fourth title in the dlrs 340,000
Swedish Open ATP claycourt classic Sunday.
	   It was the second victory for the 31-year-old claycourt
specialist against Medvedev and the twelfth career ATP tour victory
for the Swede. Gustafsson also beat the Ukrainian 6-1, 6-3 in the
1996 final.
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, will not
only improve his current 26th ranking but also top such greats as
Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only others to win three titles
in this seaside tourney.
	   Gustafsson broke the 25-year-old Medvedev twice in the first set
to win 6-2. But Medvedev, 97th in the ATP ranking before this
tournament, bounced back early in the second set. He broke
Gustafsson for a 2-0 lead but the Swede broke back to level at 3-3
and then broke Medvedev again for 5-3 before he closed out the set
on his first match point.
	   In the doubles final Magnus Gustafsson and Magnus Larsson of
Sweden beat South Africans Lan Bale and Piet Norval 6-4, 6-2.

Finns flock to tango capital for festival of passionate dance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEINAJOKI, Finland (AP) _ The insinuating music and sweeping
moves of the tango, so redolent of warm South American nights, has
found an anomalous home amid Finland's cool and endless birch
forests.
	   This year's tango festival in Seinajoki, which ended Sunday,
attracted a record 100,000 people _ about one of every 50 people in
the country known more for reserve than romance.
	   ``It's like a spell,'' said Pirjo Saari, among the crowd on one
of the outdoor dance floors in Seinajoki, 360 kilometers (220
miles) north of Helsinki.
	   ``Once the tango grabs you there's no letting go; you're
hooked,'' she said.
	   ``It's very difficult to put into words what dancing the tango
is all about,'' said her partner Tuomo Piippolainen. ``It's just
such a strong feeling, a feeling deep inside.''
	   Inside is where Finns tend to keep their feelings, but the tango
calls them out of their shells.
	   ``The tango gives Finnish men, who generally are unable to
express their feelings, a chance to say with their bodies what they
would like to say with their tongues but can't,'' said M. A.
Numminen, a musician who has studied the tango for 35 years.
	   But Finns don't go totally florid when they hear a tango. Their
version of the dance is slower than the Argentine original, the
sweeps are more measured and the music is always in a minor key.
	   ``Finnish men, like myself, don't know how to dance, and that's
why this slow, sad tango suits them _ they just shuffle across the
floor in a melancholy way,'' Numminen said.
	   This year, there was a lot of shuffling in the streets, schools,
halls and outdoor dance floors in Seinajoki, where the festival has
grown into the largest summer event in Finland.
	   Tango aficianados weaved the night away until 3 a.m. along the
town's main drag, closed to traffic. More than 2,000 enthusiasts
packed out the sports hall to watch the tango song contest that
ended with the crowning of the annual Tango Prince and Princess.
Those who couldn't cram in watch the competition on huge screens in
nearby schoolhouses.
	   With a budget of 15 million markkaa (dlrs 2.8 million), the
tango festival generates at least 40 million markkaa (dlrs 7.5
million) for the town of 30,000.
	   There were also talks and discussion sessions on the tango, and
lessons by top instructors for those who hadn't quite mastered the
technique of the melancholy movement.
	   ``Although the tango originates in Argentina, we Finns, just
like with the tomato and potato, have sown the tango seed here and
produced our very own delicious brand,'' said Ake Blomqvist, a
dance instructor who has taught the tango for 50 years.
	   The tango was introduced to Finland in the 1910s. With its
relief and entertainment, it became a hit in the 1950s during a
tough reconstruction period after the Finns suffered heavy losses
in a war against the Soviet Union.
	   ``It started out as entertainment, but now it has become
something much more _ it's a way of life,'' said Jaakko Salo, a
music producer.

3 hours, 22 minutes, 44.00 seconds. Malaysian rider Noor Asrina
Sulaiman was third in 3:23:02.00.
	   Compu also has won the women's individual time trial on

Kuala Lumpur in September, attracted 32 riders from Malaysia,
Brunei, Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

	   It was Schumacher's first win in the British Grand Prix and the
first time a Ferrari driver has won here since 1990 when Alain
Prost did it.
	   Only nine of the 22 cars managed to finish the race, which was
run under treacherous conditions.
	   Soaked by an overnight rain, the race began on a damp track as
light rain began to fall after just a few laps. It got heavier
halfway through the race and played havoc with teams gambling on
whether to run on dry- or wet-weather tires.
	   Damon Hill, the '96 series champion, went out on the 15th lap in
a spin, leaving him still without a point this season for Jordan.
Williams also lot Heinz-Harald Frentzen on the 17th.

Scottish cricketers increase campaign for international status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ A Scottish campaign for full
international limited-overs cricket status has been bolstered by
the national team's 2-0 series win over Bangladesh.
	   Scotland was undefeated against Bangladesh _ ranked 10th in the
world _ in the three-match series, which was shortened Sunday when
the final game was abandoned due to rain.
	   Scotland clinched the series Saturday with a seven-wicket win
after dismissing the visitors for 97.
	   Scottish Cricket Union chairman John Everett said the series win
would boost his campaign to the sport's world governing body for
international status equal to Bangladesh and Kenya.
	   He said the win would be good for the cause but he conceded
Scottish cricket still had a long way to go before it could compete
against the top teams in the world.
	   Scotland and Bangladesh will meet at the Grange ground in
Edinburgh during the cricket World Cup next year.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan met Sunday
with an Israeli opposition leader to discuss the stalled Middle
East peace process.
	   The talks between Hassan and Yossi Beilin are part of ``ongoing
consultations on the Middle East peace process between Jordan and
all parts of the Israeli political spectrum,'' said Victor Nahmias
of the Israeli Embassy.
	   Beilin, a member of Israel's left-leaning Labor Party, often
visits King Hussein. Two other Israeli Labor Party officials are
expected in Amman in the next two days, including former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
eager to see progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks to help ease
opposition by its predominantly Palestinian population to Jordan's
own peace accord with Israel.
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks have been stalemated since March 1997.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Belgian cyclist Tom Steels overcame stiff
Irish winds, a crash involving a half-dozen other riders and his
own turbulent past to win Sunday's first stage of the Tour de
France.
	   Steels _ disqualified from last year's Tour for throwing a water
bottle at another competitor during a race _ survived the
concluding circuit of Dublin's vast Phoenix Park to cross the
finish line of the 111.9-mile (180.5 km) course in a time of 4
hours, 29 minutes, 58 seconds.
	   ``I'm always relieved to win the first stage. I did what I had
to do,'' Steels said at the finishing line.
	   Germany's super-sprinter Erik Zabel was edged out for second
place.

	   Almost prophetically, he described in a published letter the
isolation and despair of life after four years in prison: ``I was
like a man put in an open grave.''
	   The country's most prominent political prisoner, Abiola died
Tuesday while still in custody.
	   His death set off days of rioting and chaos in Lagos and the
southern Nigerian cities of Ibadan and Abeokuta. At least 55 people
died in the violence; more than 400 were arrested.
	   In the letter to Nigerian human rights leader Gani Fawehinmi he
says it is only a matter of time before the military is forced from
power.
	   ``Time searches out and destroys all things,'' Abiola wrote in
the letter published Sunday in the Lagos-based Tribune newspaper.
	   Although not dated, references in Abiola's letter indicate it
was written sometime after he met with United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on June 30.

World Cup: Disappointed Dutch return and look to the future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Despite dejection after their
defeat by Croatia in the World Cup's third placed match, the Dutch
returned home Sunday proud of belonging to the world's top four
soccer nations and optimistic about the future.
	   Hundreds of fans braved windy and wet weather at Amsterdam's
Schiphol airport to welcome home the team.
	   ``We played very well,'' said midfielder Edgar Davids, one of
the Netherlands' stand out players of the tournament. ``I think we
can go to the top in two or three years.''
	   In two years, the Netherlands co-hosts the 2000 European
Championships with neighbor Belgium and will be among the hot
favorites for the title.
	   For the players, Saturday's playoff in Paris was one match too
many. For two years, coach Guus Hiddink worked to build a team
capable of winning soccer's greatest prize but his players' dreams
were shattered in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Brazil in the
semifinal on Tuesday.
	   The Dutch could not motivate themselves for a match they would
rather not have been involved in. ``The Croats had a greater will
to win,'' Phillip Cocu admitted.
	   ``I always want to win everything there is to win but playing
against Croatia was just not the same as playing Argentina and
Brazil,'' he added.
	   Reserve goalkeeper Ed de Goey agreed. ``After the Brazil game we
all wanted to go home,'' he said.
	   Hiddink added that the Dutch should have beaten Croatia. The
Orangemen had the lion's share of possession but squandered a
handful of golden chances in front of goal.
	   ``It is a shame we could not win third place in a match we
totally dominated,'' coach Guus Hiddink said. ``But if you see how
we played against higher countries, we must be satisfied.''
	   Croatia won 2-1 with two breakaway goals by Robert Prosinecki
and Davor Suker. Boudewijn Zenden, playing out of position on the
right wing, cut inside to score the Netherlands' goal between the
two Croat strikes.
	   Earlier in the tournament, the Dutch drew with Belgium and
Mexico and thrashed South Korea to qualify top of Group E, before
beating Yugoslavia and Argentina to reach the final four. Defeat by
Brazil sent the Dutch to the anticlimactic third placed match.
	   ``You always want more so I am disappointed we lost,'' Ronald de
Boer said.
	   Despite the defeat, Hiddink pledged not to change the trademark
attacking style of the Dutch _ which leaves them vulnerable to
counterattacking teams like Croatia.
	   ``Our philosophy has impressed the world,'' Hiddink said. ``We
are a small country and we have a philosophy that we cannot change.
We can't play on the counterattack _ that wouldn't be accepted in
our country.''

Doubters protest against burial of czar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ About 150 people gathered outside
the Peter and Paul Cathedral Sunday to protest against next week's
burial of Czar Nicholas II and his family.
	   The burial Friday is intended to put to rest one of the most
painful episodes in Russian history, the execution of the czar and
his family by Bolsheviks on July 17, 1918.
	   A crowd of mostly elderly women, who doubt the remains to be
buried are actually those of the czar, prayed and sang in front of
the cathedral.
	   ``It is not the burial of the czar, but of unknown remains,''
said pensioner Lydia Medvedeva. ``They need to be buried, but not
in a czar's grave.''
	   The remains of the czar and his family were found in a pit near
Yekaterinburg in 1991. Repeated DNA testing has confirmed their
identities as Nicholas, his wife, three of their children and four
servants.
	   Sunday's demonstration was in support of the Russian Orthodox
Church's position that some doubt remains whether the remains are
authentic.

DUBLIN: For second place.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Australia's Robbie McEwen, Italy's Gian Matteo Fagnini and
Nicola Minali, and France's Frederic Moncassin and Philippe Gaumont
took the third through seventh spots _ all in the same time as
Steels.
	   Italy's flamboyant Mario Cipollini, well positioned as the
sprinting peloton passed through the park's gates, fell sideways
onto the road in a pileup that also claimed France's Stephane
Barthe.
	   Italian sprinter Stefano Zanini had been first past screaming
Irish fans at the rain-flecked summit of the Wicklow Mountains
course. But once the sport's top sprinters, huddled in the peloton
about a minute behind, cleared the pass they gradually powered past
Zanini and a half-dozen other pretenders who had shared the lead
midway.
	   The Wicklow range south of Dublin provided no real opportunity
for the sport's expert mountaineers to show off. The course's
steepest stretch was 1,137 feet (346 meters) over 5.3 miles (8.5
kms) from the village of Laragh to the treeless Wicklow Gap summit.
	   France's Laurent Brochard finished 18th to put in the best
performance for the top-rated Festina team, which seemed to put in
a deliberately low-key performance after starting the Tour under
its own cloud of doping allegations.
	   Before the race Richard Verinque _ four times winner of the
Tour's polka-dot jersey in recognition of the best mountain climber
_ said Festina's cyclists would ``stand united'' and ``confront''
allegations that they were benefitting from illegal muscle-building
steroids or EPO, a drug that boosts the blood's ability to absorb
oxygen.
	   ``The people trying to sink us should have good lawyers,''
Verinque told France's Channel 2 television.
	   One of Festina's support staff, Belgian masseur Willy Voet,
remained in a French prison near Lille on Sunday after customs
agents on the French-Belgian border allegedly found more than 400
vials of steroids and EPO in his Festina company car.
	   One of Festina's supporting riders, Christophe Moreau, is
competing while appealing his positive test for steroids use in
June. He came in 49th Sunday after finishing fifth in Saturday's
opening prologue through central Dublin.
	   Another Festina rider, Australian Neil Stephens, questioned how
Voet's predicament could cast doubt on the team: ``If your best
mate is caught stealing cars, does that make you a car thief as
well?''
	   ``If it's true he had these illegal drugs with him, the team
certainly doesn't know why. It has nothing to do with us,''
Stephens told Australian Associated Press.
	   After traversing the Wicklow Gap it was all rapidly downhill for
the more than 180 riders from 21 teams. The race was preplanned to
end before 5 p.m. (1600GMT), providing riders plenty of time to
watch France play Brazil in Paris for the championship of soccer's
World Cup.
	   Tour officials, who have started the competition outside France
13 times previously, brought the first three days of this year's
22-day event to Ireland partly to avoid a sporting overload in
World Cup-dominated France.
	   The Tour continues Monday with a straightforward 128-mile (205.5
km) run along Ireland's flat southern coast, from the village of
Enniscorthy to the southwest port of Cork.
	   From there the competitors and more than 4,000 Tour
administrators, team staff and journalists will either fly or sail
by overnight ferry to the Breton port of Roscoff, where the Tour
continues Tuesday. The competition concludes Aug. 2 in Paris after
grueling visits to both the Pyrennes and Alps mountain ranges.

Car thieves in Thai capital favor Hondas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Car thieves in the Thai capital favor
Honda sedans by a wide margin, statistics announced by the city
police showed.
	   Of 223 passenger cars stolen in the first six months of the
year, 102 _ or 45.7 percent _ were Hondas, the Bangkok Post on
Sunday quoted police Maj. Gen. Pitthaya Charoenpanich as saying.
	   Nissans were the second most stolen passenger cars, with 38
reported missing, followed by Toyotas and Mercedes Benzes, with 27
of each reported stolen.
	   Among pickup trucks, Isuzu was the most stolen brand, with 57
taken. The number of stolen pickup trucks was just over half the
number of passenger cars.
	   Pitthaya said the number of motor vehicle thefts had decreased
from the same period last year because of a police crackdown and
more widespread use of anti-theft equipment.

New clashes in Kosovo despite diplomatic efforts to end fighting

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats worked Sunday to find a
new approach to resolving the crisis in Kosovo, where weekend
clashes claimed the lives of at least nine people.
	   Two Serb police officers were killed when Albanian militants
attacked checkpoints along the province's main roads, the Serb
Media Center reported Sunday. The Kosovo Information Center
reported seven ethnic Albanians were wounded in a Serb attack on a
village in western Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army released a statement
Sunday saying seven of its fighters were killed in weekend clashes
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
fighting for the province's independence from Serbia, the dominant
state in the Yugoslav federation.
	   In Bonn on Sunday, Germany Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
telephoned his counterparts in the six-nation Contact Group
searching for a diplomatic solution to discuss new ideas for ending
the fighting, his spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   On Saturday, Kinkel and Russia's Yevgeny Primakov met in Moscow
and discussed ``new, creative possibilities'' for Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence
from Serbia _ part of Yugoslavia.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel on
Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference like the Dayton peace accord
_ which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``Perhaps we need a process
that resembles the one that took place in Dayton,'' the paper
quoted him as saying.
	   The KLA called Sunday for unity of the Albanian people and
denounced the ``shameful bickering'' of the politicians, which has
also frustrated international officials trying to organize talks
between the ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   The Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy _ is trying to negotiate an immediate cease-fire
followed by peace talks to prevent the violence from spilling into
neighboring countries.
	   Both sides reported fresh clashes Sunday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said seven ethnic Albanians were
wounded in a ``strong attack by Serb forces'' on the village of
Streoc, 75 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Pristina, Sunday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center also reported one police
officer had been killed and another wounded when ethnic Albanian
militants attacked the Serb checkpoint at Streoc. Another police
officer was killed in a separate attack on another checkpoint in
western Kosovo, the center said. No independent confirmation for
any of the reports was immediately available.
	   Earlier Saturday, Serb forces launched a strong attack on the
KLA stronghold of Lodja, on the outskirts of Kosovo's
second-largest city Pec in western Kosovo, independent sources
reported. Ethnic Albanian sources said they held the town, but Serb
sources said they had made inroads.
	   Also Saturday, ethnic Albanian sources reported fresh fighting
in the Decani area, east of Pec and there were independent reports
Sunday of continued shooting around Pec.

Havel says he wants to name Zeman premier, but anything can happen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel said Sunday
he has no personal reason not to name the winner of the June
elections new Czech premier, but warned that ``anything can
happen.''
	   Havel said earlier he would ``most probably'' appoint Milos
Zeman, whose Social Democrats won early parliamentary elections in
June, as new prime minister on Friday, when the current caretaker
government resigns.
	   Last week, Havel had said the nomination of the premier depends
on whether an agreement signed by Zeman and former Premier Vaclav
Klaus violated the constitution.
	   In an interview with private Prima television Sunday, Havel said
although he is ``disturbed by the wording of the agreement and its
content,'' his personal feelings will have no influence on Zeman's
appointment. He also said he wants to appoint the new cabinet
before July 22, when he is to enter hospital for surgery.
	   The agreement, signed last Thursday states that former Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party will allow the
Social Democrats to form a single-party minority government by
leaving the chamber during the initial confidence vote.
	   In exchange, Klaus' party will be allowed to appoint the
speakers of both chambers of Parliament and the chairmen of key
parliamentary committees.
	   Both parties also agreed not to initiate a non-confidence vote
during the lower chamber's four-year term or dissolve the chamber
before the term's end. Each side also promised not to form a
coalition or an alliance with a third party to the detriment of
each other's party.
	   Following a complicated case of ruptured colon earlier this
year, Havel is scheduled to undergo further abdominal surgery on
July 27. Despite previous reports the president may appoint new
cabinet members only after he recovers, Havel said Sunday he wants
the cabinet appointed before he goes into hospital.
	   Havel has repeatedly indicated he does not like the idea of a
minority government. Some analysts also fear the agreement between
Zeman and Klaus could limit the president's political influence.

Finns flock to tango capital for festival of passionate dance

	   SEINAJOKI, Finland (AP) _ The insinuating music and sweeping
moves of the tango, so redolent of warm South American nights, has
found an anomalous home amid Finland's cool and endless birch
forests.
	   This year's tango festival in Seinajoki, which ended Sunday,
attracted a record 100,000 people _ about one of every 50 people in
the country known more for reserve than romance.
	   ``It's like a spell,'' said Pirjo Saari, among the crowd on one
of the outdoor dance floors in Seinajoki, 360 kilometers (220
miles) north of Helsinki.
	   ``Once the tango grabs you there's no letting go; you're
hooked,'' she said.
	   ``It's very difficult to put into words what dancing the tango
is all about,'' said her partner Tuomo Piippolainen. ``It's just
such a strong feeling, a feeling deep inside.''
	   Inside is where Finns tend to keep their feelings, but the tango
calls them out of their shells.
	   ``The tango gives Finnish men, who generally are unable to
express their feelings, a chance to say with their bodies what they
would like to say with their tongues but can't,'' said M. A.
Numminen, a musician who has studied the tango for 35 years.
	   But Finns don't go totally florid when they hear a tango. Their
version of the dance is slower than the Argentine original, the
sweeps are more measured and the music is always in a minor key.
	   ``Finnish men, like myself, don't know how to dance, and that's
why this slow, sad tango suits them _ they just shuffle across the
floor in a melancholy way,'' Numminen said.
	   This year, there was a lot of shuffling in the streets, schools,
halls and outdoor dance floors in Seinajoki, where the festival has
grown into the largest summer event in Finland.
	   Tango aficionados weaved the night away until 3 a.m. along the
town's main drag, closed to traffic. More than 2,000 enthusiasts
packed out the sports hall to watch the tango song contest that
ended with the crowning of the annual Tango Prince and Princess.
Those who couldn't cram in watch the competition on huge screens in
nearby schoolhouses.
	   With a budget of 15 million markkaa (dlrs 2.8 million), the
tango festival generates at least 40 million markkaa (dlrs 7.5
million) for the town of 30,000.
	   There were also talks and discussion sessions on the tango, and
lessons by top instructors for those who hadn't quite mastered the
technique of the melancholy movement.
	   ``Although the tango originates in Argentina, we Finns, just
like with the tomato and potato, have sown the tango seed here and
produced our very own delicious brand,'' said Ake Blomqvist, a
dance instructor who has taught the tango for 50 years.
	   The tango was introduced to Finland in the 1910s. With its
relief and entertainment, it became a hit in the 1950s during a
tough reconstruction period after the Finns suffered heavy losses
in a war against the Soviet Union.
	   ``It started out as entertainment, but now it has become
something much more _ it's a way of life,'' said Jaakko Salo, a
music producer.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ With the grueling World Cup behind
them, the Netherlands' De Boer twins are preparing for another
tough battle _ this time to force Ajax Amsterdam to let them move
to new clubs.
	   Spanish giant Barcelona has put in a bid for Dutch captain Frank
while England's Premiership champion and FA Cup holder Arsenal has
already had one offer for Ronald rejected by the Amsterdam
powerhouse, which insists neither brother is for sale.
	   Both De Boer twins are still under contract at Ajax, but both
want to move abroad where salaries are higher and opponents tougher
than in the Netherlands.
	   ``I'm not going back to Ajax,'' Ronald said Sunday after
arriving back in the Netherlands following Saturday's 2-1 defeat by
Croatia in the World Cup third placed match.
	   Both De Boer twins are expected to take their transfer requests
to a Dutch Soccer Association (KNVB) arbitration panel on Monday.
The panel has the power to rule whether or not they can leave Ajax.
	   ``I have been reasonable for six or seven months,'' Ronald said.
``It is a shame to have to go like this because I owe everything to
Ajax, but I think they can get a good price for me and Frank.''
	   Central defender Frank had said in the past he was willing to
stay at Ajax if the club let Ronald go, but now Ajax is stalling
Ronald's transfer, Frank has also said that he wants out.
	   Asked Sunday if he believed he would move to Barcelona, which is
coached by ex-Ajax boss Louis van Gaal, Frank said: ``I hope so.''
	   Also possibly heading to Spain is Dutch coach Guus Hiddink who
reportedly has been offered the vacant manager's position at
European Champion Real Madrid. Hiddink's contract to manage the
Dutch expired at the end of the World Cup.
	   Hiddink refused to speculate about his future Sunday but he said
there had been ``no contact'' between him and Real Madrid.

Audi to pay dlrs 182 million for British engine-maker Cosworth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- Luxury automaker Audi, a subsidiary of
Volkswagen, has said it plans to pay 117 million pounds (dlrs 182
million) for British engine maker Cosworth when the deal goes
through next month.
	   Cosworth is a unit of British engineering group Vickers, which
sold Rolls Royce to Volkswagen on July 3. The Cosworth purchase,
announced June 4, was contingent on the Rolls Royce sale.
Completion of the Cosworth sale isn't expected until August, Audi
said late Saturday.
	   The purchase is seen as vital for Volkswagen after Bayerische
Motoren Werke -- BMW -- said it would no longer supply engines to
Rolls Royce when its contract runs out July 9, 1999. Volkswagen
beat out its German rival BMW with a 479 million pound (dlrs 780
million) bid for Rolls-Royce.
	   Analysts believe Volkswagen may use the high-tech engine maker
to supply 12-cylinder engines to Rolls Royce.
	   Volkswagen does not currently make 12-cylinder engines, but
Cosworth already supplies such motors for Rolls Royce's latest
Bentley models.
	   Cosworth, which has an international reputation for advanced
automotive engine and power train technology, is involved in
racing, engineering, castings and manufacturing.

Postal workers' strike continues in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Mail delivery was badly hit in India for
the fourth straight day Sunday as fresh talks between the
government and postal workers were deadlocked over payment of
pensions to 300,000 temporary workers, a domestic news agency said.
	   Heaps of mail bags piled up as short-term workers, retired
postal department employees and home guards hired by the
government, failed to clear the huge backlog of unsorted mail.
	   ``The strike will not be called off until all our demands are
met,'' the Press Trust of India news agency quoted G.K.
Padmanabhan, secretary-general of the Federation of National Postal
Organizations, as saying.
	   An estimated 650,000 workers in India's postal department went
on strike Thursday, demanding higher wages and bonuses. They
included 300,000 temporary workers who don't get benefits like
their colleagues.
	   Leaders of postal workers' unions said the government agreed to
most of their demands, including revised salaries for permanent
employees and employment benefits for the temporary workers.
	   But the government has refused to grant lifelong pensions to the
temporary workers, Padmanabhan said.
	   The strikers demand that their wages be increased to 3,050
rupees (dlrs 72) a month from the 2,750 rupees (dlrs 65) that most
postal employees get. The average annual per capita income in
India, one of the world's poorest countries, is dlrs 450.

Opposition leaders leave to meet with NATO and EU officials

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Opposition leaders from
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat half will meet with Western officials to
discuss the country's political and economic future, media said
Sunday.
	   With less than two months until general elections, that Western
officials have said they hope will remove former war-time leaders
and stabilize Bonsia's delicate peace, opposition leaders from six
parties and two organizations were to meet NATO and European Union
officials in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.
	   ``This trip will be a first opportunity for us to pay a visit to

leader of the Republican Party, told Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avaz
Sunday. ``We will try to see there what West side expecting in
Bosnia in the next few years.''
	   Under the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia was divided into
the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation. Since then, some
35,000 NATO-led troops have been stationed in Bosnia enforcing the
peace. The EU has also donated millions in reconstruction funds.

Request for indictment of U.S. Marines goes before Italian court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ An Italian prosecutor's request for the
indictment of the crew of a Marine jet that severed a ski gondola
cable in the Alps, killing 20, goes before an Italian court Monday.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero has pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy even though the Italian government
itself has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen.
	   An Italian judge must rule on Granero's indictment request.
	   The hearing is scheduled to take place just three days after a
U.S. general ordered two of the crewmen tried for manslaughter in
the Feb. 3 tragedy.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   The United States insists it has sole jurisdiction in the case
because of a NATO treaty. Washington maintains the EA-6B Prowler
was flying under the auspices of NATO when it sent the ski gondola
crashing to the ground, killing 19 skiers and the gondola operator.
	   Granero argued that the plane violated the NATO treaty's
mandated flight patterns, and therefore the flight should be
considered a U.S. mission _ which would give Italy jurisdiction.
Granero also is challenging the constitutionality of the NATO
treaty.
	   Even if indicted, the crew is unlikely to come to Italy to face
justice.
	   Italian law allows defendants to be tried in absentia.
	   Seeking the indictment, on charges of multiple manslaughter and
endangering the safety of transport, was well within Granero's
powers; Italian prosecutors have a large measure of independence.
	   The crew's Italian lawyers say the Americans are victims of a
``conflict of power'' between the government and the Italian
courts.
	   The pilots are in the ``paradoxical situation of a double trial
and of a possible double conviction for the same deeds,'' said the
lawyers, Bruno and Antonio Malattia, in a fax to news media
Saturday.
	   Granero also requested the indictment of three top U.S. military
officials at the Aviano base in northern Italy, where the jet was
stationed.
	   The accident set off a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and
calls by some Italians for the removal of U.S. troops from their
country.

Boys' deaths mark `turning point' in Northern Ireland dispute

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three young brothers who had
been asleep in their beds burned to death early Sunday in a
sectarian attack marking what shaken Northern Ireland leaders
termed a ``turning point'' in a violent stalemate over a blocked
Protestant march.
	   A neighbor reported hearing 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason Quinn screaming as fire gutted their residence
in Ballymoney, about 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother escaped with her Protestant boyfriend, who
was beaten back by flames when he returned to try to rescue the
brothers, police said. There were reports the boys were being
raised as Protestants.
	   A photograph released by the family showed three impish little
boys in sweatshirts, Richard's grin revealing a wide gap in the
middle of his teeth.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' Seamus Mallon, the Catholic
deputy leader of the new Belfast Assembly, asked protesters on both
sides of the marching barricades. ``Does it take one child, two
children, three children?''
	   A hollow-eyed Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said he considered the boys' deaths a ``turning
point'' in the increasingly fractious standoff over the Orange
Order's stymied attempts to march down the predominantly Catholic
Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Mallon and David Trimble, the Belfast Assembly's first minister,
issued an appeal Sunday afternoon for the Orangemen at Portadown to
``immediately end their protest and to return to their homes.
Should this happen, we ask ... the people of Garvaghy to positively
recognize the significance of such a move. Nothing can be gained
from continuing this standoff; as the Rev. William Bingham has
said, `no road is worth a life,' and we echo that sentiment.''
	   Authorities counseled Catholics, who mostly had remained out of
the fray since the July 5 stalemate began, not to retaliate for the
boys' deaths.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant party.

Norway seizes Russian trawler for illegal fishing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian coast guard on Sunday seized a
Russia trawler on charges of fishing illegally north of the Arctic
Svalbard islands, and was keeping tabs on another 30 Russian
fishing vessels in the same area.
	   The Svalbard archipelago, about 640 kilometers (500 miles) north
of the mainland, is Norwegian territory under a 1920 treaty, and
last month Norway closed the waters around the islands to trawlers
due to fears of over fishing.
	   The trawler Novokuibyshevsk, registered in the Russian city of
Murmansk, was being escorted to the Norwegian mainland by the coast
guard. The ship and crew will be turned over to the police to face
charges and possible fines.
	   According to the coast guard, the Novokuibyshevsk was the first
Russian trawler ever detained in the Svalbard fisheries zone. The
coast guard also said it did not have the capacity to immediately
arrest other trawlers in the area.

Witch doctor shoots two after `spell' fails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ After casting a ``bulletproof'' spell
over two men, a traditional Liberian doctor shot and killed his two
patients while testing to see if the incantation worked, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   James Numeni, an herbalist ``witch doctor'' from the central
Liberian town Gbarnga was arrested and charged with murder shortly
after the incident on Friday.
	   The two victims, who were not identified, were shot several
times in the face and chest, the Inquirer newspaper reported.
	   Numeni had promised to make them bulletproof with the use of
traditional herbal medicine and a charm.
	   After casting the spell he insisted on proving the power of his
magic by telling the two men to stand at close range while he shot
them, the newspaper reported.
	   Soldiers and rebels during Liberia's brutal 7-year civil came to
believe in the magic and spells of traditional doctors that
promised to offer protection against their enemies.
	   Numeni was reportedly one of the best-known herbalists in
Liberia.

Prime Minister Vajpayee says India will not bow to economic
</HEADLINE>
sanctions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said
Sunday that India would not give in to the pressure of economic
sanctions imposed by developed countries, Press Trust of India news
agency reported.
	   These countries were rethinking the usefulness of their actions,
Vajpayee told a conference of the National Union of Journalists in
Gobindgarh, a town in the northern Indian state of Punjab.
	   The United States, Germany and Japan announced economic
sanctions after India and Pakistan tested nuclear devices two
months ago. They demand that India and Pakistan unconditionally
sign a nuclear test ban treaty.
	   Vajpayee's reference to rethinking the sanctions appeared to
refer to the U.S. Senate's action exempting agriculture credits
from the sanctions. The move will help American farmers with
surplus wheat sell to India and Pakistan.
	   India is committed to working for dismantling global nuclear
arsenals and making peaceful uses of atomic power, Vajpayee was
quoted as saying.

Egypt releases two North Korean diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on drug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police on Sunday released two men carrying
North Korean diplomatic passports who had been arrested on charges
of smuggling into Egypt half a million pills popularly known as the
``date-rape drug,'' officials said.
	   The men had arrived in Egypt on Friday from Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. Egyptian officials said the men were accredited to the
North Korean Embassy in Damascus.
	   The two were released because of their diplomatic immunity and
were allowed to leave for Damascus, police officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Egypt's Foreign Ministry and the North Korean Embassy in Cairo
refused to comment on the case.
	   Earlier, a diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Damascus, who
refused to give his name or rank, denied any knowledge of the pair,
and their names _ Kim Hak Jon and Kim Sal Jo _ do not appear on the
Syrian diplomatic list.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
	   Police said the two men had been carrying six bags filled with
504,000 tablets of Rohypnol. The drugs have a street value of some
5 million pounds (dlrs 1.47 million).
	   Rohypnol, which is illegal in Egypt, is used legally in many
countries to treat sleeplessness, anxiety, convulsions and muscle
tension. It has come to be called the ``date rape'' drug in the
United States because it has been used to render unsuspecting
victims unconscious and vulnerable to assault.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Outraged that police may be
involved in political violence which has killed 23 people in the
past week, President Nelson Mandela vowed at a funeral Sunday to
combat ``sinister'' elements in the security forces.
	   Mandela, shaken after having seen the bodies of some of the 10
people killed this weekend alone in Richmond, told a crowd in the
eastern town's stadium that the murderers would be caught. Tensions
were high _ a scuffle broke out moments earlier when police tried
to disarm men armed with spears and sticks outside the stadium.
	   Although apartheid ended with the nation's first all-race
elections in 1994 and the police and army are being integrated, a
minority of whites, including some members of the security forces,
long for the days of white rule. A recent military intelligence
report alleging former black guerrillas were plotting a coup was
branded as bogus by a judicial panel, and is suspected of having
been cooked up by disaffected whites.
	   ``We have been patient in trying to deal with such sinister
forces which are attempting to take us back to the apartheid days.
We will no longer treat such forces with kid gloves,'' Mandela
warned, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Amid appeals for peace, there was no sign that the blood-letting
in the sprawling dirt-poor town, set in rolling green hills 450
kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Johannesburg, would stop.
	   Five people _ four men and a woman _ were gunned down at a home
on Saturday night. Five other people were killed earlier during the
weekend.
	   Mandela described seeing the bodies with heads blown apart,
others with bullet holes in their stomachs, at the Richmond police
station.
	   ``We want the world to see how gruesome and ruthless the
murderers have been,'' Mandela said. People wept and screamed in
anguish as he spoke, SAPA reported.
	   ``How long is this going to be happening,'' wailed an elderly
woman wearing black mourning clothes.
	   There were no immediate answers, only more questions.
	   ``What is happening and why can't police stop the violence,''
asked The Sunday Independent, a Johannesburg newspaper, in an
editorial Sunday.
	   Part of the reason may be that police are possibly involved.
Witnesses have reported seeing police vehicles where killings
occurred when the murders happened. One witness said he saw a
police car shine a spotlight at a house so a killer could find his
way in the nightime darkness.
	   Saturday's funeral was for three of eight people, including
Richmond's deputy mayor, who were gunned down in a tavern on July 3
as they watched World Cup soccer on TV.
	   Richmond Mayor Andrew Ragavaloo said he had asked police to keep
a high profile Saturday night to prevent further violence, and was
assured they would. It did not stop Saturday night's killings.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi met with the local
police commander Sunday. No details were released. Mufamadi has
reportedly threatened to transfer local police leaders if they
don't explain the deteriorating situation.
	   Richmond is in KwaZulu-Natal province, which was hard-hit by
political violence in the last years of apartheid and the run-up to
the elections. More than 10,000 people were killed in the last
decade, many in fighting between supporters of the African National
Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom Party. Apartheid-era
security forces fueled the violence by supplying Inkatha with
weapons.
	   That violence has mostly ended, for now. The ANC and Inkatha
remain rivals but are not blood enemies. After the ANC won the
elections, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi was given a Cabinet
seat.
	   The new round of violence came after Sifiso Nkabinde was
expelled as local ANC chairman because he allegedly had informed
for the apartheid-era security forces. Nkabinde earlier this year
was acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people.
	   Mandela did not specifically blame Nkabinde, but noted that
violence had returned to Richmond when he was released from jail in
April.
	   Nkabinde is now the national secretary of the United Democratic
Movement, a new party that will contest the 1999 elections. He has
denied being behind the killings, which one observer said appeared
to be a local power struggle.
	   ``This seems to be an arena of small-time or mid-size
warlordism,'' said Alf Stadler, a professor of political studies at
Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg.
	   Stander said the violence could be linked to the upcoming
elections.
	   ``It's like the Mafia or protection rackets _ you don't come
murder us and we'll support you. This could translate into
political support,'' Stadler said in a telephone interview.
	   Unless political tolerance is promoted, The Sunday Independent
warned that ``the year leading to the elections will be a year of
hell, not only for those in Richmond but for those in South Africa
who want democracy to work.''

 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Schumacher, Hakkinen; details on situation at
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Michael Schumacher of Ferrari,
taking advantage when Mika Hakkinen's McLaren spun off a wet track
on the 51st of 60 laps, won Sunday's British Grand Prix to once
again show his mastery on a wet track.
	   Only nine of the 22 starters finished as heavy rain fell
throughout most of the race with six laps run behind a safety car
as standing water filled the circuit.
	   Hakkinen finished second with third for Ferrari's Eddie Irvine
followed by Alexander Wurz and Giancarlo Fisichella, both in
Benetton's.
	   It was Schumacher's third consecutive victory and his fourth
this season and moved him to within two points of series leader
Hakkinen in the points chase after nine races with seven to go.
	   Hakkinen has 56 to 54 for Schumacher.
	   Schumacher won in a curious, confused finish when he drove into
the pit lane _ instead of crossing the finish line on the track _
on his final lap.
	   He came in to take a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a
yellow flag but still had a large enough lead to claim the win,
12.4 seconds ahead of Hakkinen.
	   In reality, he crossed the finish line while driving down the
pit lane, and end never seen before by many long time Grand Prix
observers.
	   Under FIA rules, if a time penalty is imposed with fewer than 12
laps to finish, stewards may add the ``time penalty to the elapsed
time'' of the driver.
	   Schumacher, like most who were watching, didn't know immediately
if he'd won or not. After a delay of a few seconds _ enough time
for him to climb from the car and search for clues _ he was
announced the winner in 1 hour 47 minutes 12.450 seconds with an
average speed of 172.541 kph (107.217 mph).
	   ``I still don't know the reason for my penalty. The radio in the
car went about halfway through the race,'' Schumacher said.
	   ``This was not the result we expected,'' he added. ``But,
obviously, it is very satisfactory to be only two points down going
to the next race in Austria.''
	   For Hakkinen, it was only dispair.
	   ``It is extremely disappointing. We were looking good until the
heavy rain came,'' he said.
	   Hakkinen took the lead off his pole position and survived a
dramatic moment on the 42nd lap when his car hit standing water,
spun twice and flew off into a gravel area used to slow wayward
cars.
	   Hakkinen kept the engine running, swept across the grass and
gravel, and jumped back on to the track still in the lead and still
looking for a victory.
	   The Schumacher win, with near-torrential rain falling between
the 30th and 45th laps, increased the pressure on McLaren, which
has been the dominant team all season.
	   With the rain pouring down, the safety car came out on the 44th
lap _ with Hakkinen leading by 38 seconds over Schumacher _ and
went off as the race resumed on the 50th.
	   Hakkinen's spin off the track on the 51st was less spectacular
than his first, but this time he drove back behind Schumacher and
into second place.
	   Coulthard had his dream of winning his home-country Grand Prix
and season championship broken when _ in second place on the 38th
lap _ he spun several times in standing water entering a turn and
ran off the course.
	   It was Schumacher's first win in the British Grand Prix and the
first time a Ferrari driver has won here since 1990 when Alain
Prost did it.
	   Soaked by an overnight rain, the race began on a damp track as

halfway through the race and played havoc with teams gambling on

British man gored in festival of small bulls in Pamplona
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ A British man who jumped into a bull ring
was gored Sunday by a small bull at the San Fermin festival in
northern Spain.
	   Pablo Hagger, 21, of London, suffered a serious back wound when
he was gored during a festival of small bulls at Pamplona's
bullring after the morning bull run.
	   Hagger was taken to a city hospital for surgery and listed in
serious condition, the local government said in a statement.
	   The injury brings to three the number of people gored during the
festival that began on Monday. The other injuries came during the
traditional bull run.
	   Several thousand people raced early in the morning along the
850-meter (930-yard) run through the city's old cobblestone
streets.
	   The running of the bulls originated in 1591, when daredevils
began running alongside the animals being driven through town to
the bullfight. The bulls are fought and invariably killed in
bullfights later in the day.
	   Tens of thousands of tourists from several continents now
converge on the weeklong celebration of Pamplona's patron saint,
made familiar to many English-speakers by Ernest Hemingway's novel
``The Sun Also Rises.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters sent a strong protest message over the
handling of Japan's economic woes Sunday, handing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats an embarrassing setback in
parliamentary elections.
	   Hashimoto hinted he was ready to step down as head of the party,
and thus as prime minister, to take responsibility for the poor
showing in the balloting for 126 seats, or half of Parliament's
upper house.
	   ``The results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto
said. ``Everyone has handed down their judgment, and we must accept
that with sincerity.''
	   With Japan in its worst recession since World War II, many
clearly had had enough. Unemployment is at a record high, consumer
spending is plummeting and Japan's financial system is on the verge
of a meltdown, with major banks saddled with massive bad loans.
	   The Liberal Democrats needed 69 seats to regain a majority in
the upper house, which they lost in 1989. They needed at least 61
seats _ the number they held before Sunday's vote _ to come close
to saving face.
	   But based on exit polls, Japanese media predicted late Sunday
that the party was likely to win about 50 seats at most. With 21
seats still undecided, public broadcaster NHK TV said the Liberal
Democrats had 39 seats. Official electoral results were not
expected until about 5 a.m. Monday (2000 GMT).
	   Hashimoto said he would announce his decision at a meeting of
party leaders, set for 12:30 p.m. Monday (0330 GMT). He refused to
say what his decision might be, but his comments suggested that he
wanted to resign.
	   Despite the election results, the conservative, pro-business
Liberal Democrats will continue to rule because they have firm
control over the more powerful lower house, which can pass the
national budget and choose the prime minister without the approval
of the upper house. If he steps down, Hashimoto would be replaced
as prime minister by another Liberal Democratic legislator.
	   But without control over the upper house, his party will need
the cooperation of other parties to pass key legislation.
	   With politics in turmoil in the short term as the Liberal
Democrats try to select Hashimoto's successor and a new Cabinet,
efforts to implement economic reforms may stall and send an already
skeptical market falling further.
	   But John Neuffer, a senior research fellow who follows Japanese
politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a Tokyo think tank,
said the opposition was too fragmented to pose a real threat to the
Liberal Democrats.
	   ``The LDP remains the only show in town when it comes to running
the government,'' he said.
	   If anything, in the long run, the electoral humiliation may
prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the economy
back on track, Neuffer said.
	   Toward the end of the campaign, the Liberal Democrats
flip-flopped on cutting income taxes, which many voters, as well
the United States, considered a key factor for economic recovery.
	   The Democrats _ a liberal, relatively new party that has
recently emerged as the main opposition threat to the LDP _
promised such a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   The Democrats were poised to gain seats. With 21 seats still
undecided, they had won 21, up from the current 18.
	   ``Voters have clearly said `No' to the Hashimoto
administration,'' said Democratic Party head Naoto Kan, a former
health minister. ``The people have lent an ear to what we said and
they are giving us a chance.''
	   ``Many people wanted a change in politics,'' said newly elected
Democrat lawmaker Akira Gunji on nationally broadcast election
news.
	   The Japan Communist Party, which strongly pushed for tax cuts,
also was likely to gain seats, media reports said. The left-leaning
Social Democrats, who lost a lot of their credibility when they
joined the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democrats, were likely
to lose seats, the reports said.

Girl spends 20 minutes under water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Vienna (AP) _ Doctors fought for the life of a six-year-old
German girl Sunday who was found floating at the bottom of a pool
while on vacation in southern Austria.
	   The girl, identified only as Sabrina disappeared while swimming
in a crowded pool at a resort in southern Austria late Saturday.
Tourists found her after she had been underwater some 20 minutes,
the Austrian Press Agency reported.
	   Sabrina's parents, from Bochum, Germany said they had been
searching for their daughter, but found her only after the other
tourists picked her out. The girl was transported by helicopter to
hospital in the city of Klagenfurt.
	   On Sunday afternoon the girl was still unconscious and breathing
with the aid of a respirator, doctors said.

International conference aims to control flood of illegal weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In bid to control the spread of military
small arms, 21 countries open a meeting in Oslo Monday to draft a
strategy for keeping the weapons out of the hands of terrorists,
criminals and countries on the brink of war.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Aaslaug Haga said light military weapons
kill more people a year than tanks and bombs.
	   ``The large number of such weapons is destabilizing, complicate
peace settlements, and hamper social and economic development,''
she was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB. ``This is
a complicated and controversial problem.''
	   No one is sure how many light weapons, such as machine guns and
automatic rifles, there are in the world. The United States alone
has an estimated 250 million handguns.
	   Inspired by its success in drafting a global ban on land mines,
Norway last year began a drive to control small arms. Last
September, three weeks of negotiations in Oslo resulted in a treaty
banning anti-personnel mines.
	   In April, 13 West African nations, many recovering from civil
wars, met in Oslo, and called for a three-year moratorium on small
arms trade in their own countries.
	   Haga said this week's meeting is to define a strategy, not to
seek a total ban on small arms, since many are sold and used
legally. But the spread of illegal weapons, sometimes left over
from civil wars or kept by demobilized soldiers, contributes to
violence and crime all over the world.
	   Among the countries expected at the two-day session are the
United States, Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Brazil, Mali,
South Africa, Indonesia and Zimbabwe.

Schumacher wins British GP; third straight victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Schumacher ties Mansell for third on all-time win list &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Michael Schumacher of Ferrari,
taking advantage when Mika Hakkinen's McLaren spun off a wet track
on the 51st of 60 laps, won Sunday's British Grand Prix to once
again show his mastery on a wet track.
	   Only nine of the 22 starters finished as heavy rain fell
throughout most of the race with six laps run behind a safety car
as standing water filled the circuit.
	   Hakkinen finished second with third for Ferrari's Eddie Irvine
followed by Alexander Wurz and Giancarlo Fisichella, both in
Benetton's.
	   It was Schumacher's third consecutive victory and his fourth
this season and moved him to within two points of series leader
Hakkinen in the points chase after nine races with seven to go.
	   Hakkinen has 56 to 54 for Schumacher.
	   The victory was also Schumacher's 31st, moving the 29-year-old
German into a third-place tie on the all-time F1 win list with
Nigel Mansell. Alain Prost has 51 and Ayrton Senna 41.
	   Schumacher won in a curious, confused finish when he drove into
the pit lane _ instead of crossing the finish line on the track _
on his final lap.
	   He came in to take a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a
yellow flag but still had a large enough lead to claim the win,
12.4 seconds ahead of Hakkinen.
	   In reality, he crossed the finish line while driving down the
pit lane, and end never seen before by many long time Grand Prix
observers.
	   Under FIA rules, if a time penalty is imposed with fewer than 12
laps to finish, stewards may add the ``time penalty to the elapsed
time'' of the driver.
	   Schumacher, like most who were watching, didn't know immediately
if he'd won or not. After a delay of a few seconds _ enough time
for him to climb from the car and search for clues _ he was
announced the winner in 1 hour 47 minutes 12.450 seconds with an
average speed of 172.541 kph (107.217 mph).
	   ``I still don't know the reason for my penalty. The radio in the
car went about halfway through the race,'' Schumacher said.
	   ``This was not the result we expected,'' he added. ``But,
obviously, it is very satisfactory to be only two points down going
to the next race in Austria.''
	   For Hakkinen, it was only dispair.
	   ``It is extremely disappointing. We were looking good until the
heavy rain came,'' he said.
	   Hakkinen took the lead off his pole position and survived a
dramatic moment on the 42nd lap when his car hit standing water,
spun twice and flew off into a gravel area used to slow wayward
cars.
	   Hakkinen kept the engine running, swept across the grass and
gravel, and jumped back on to the track still in the lead and still
looking for a victory.
	   The Schumacher win, with near-torrential rain falling between
the 30th and 45th laps, increased the pressure on McLaren, which
has been the dominant team all season.
	   With the rain pouring down, the safety car came out on the 44th
lap _ with Hakkinen leading by 38 seconds over Schumacher _ and
went off as the race resumed on the 50th.
	   Hakkinen's spin off the track on the 51st was less spectacular
than his first, but this time he drove back behind Schumacher and
into second place.
	   Coulthard had his dream of winning his home-country Grand Prix
and season championship broken when _ in second place on the 38th
lap _ he spun several times in standing water entering a turn and
ran off the course.
	   It was Schumacher's first win in the British Grand Prix and the
first time a Ferrari driver has won here since 1990 when Alain
Prost did it.
	   Soaked by an overnight rain, the race began on a damp track as
light rain began to fall after just a few laps. It got heavier
halfway through the race and played havoc with teams gambling on
whether to run on dry- or wet-weather tires.
	   Damon Hill, the '96 series champion, went out on the 14th lap in
a spin, leaving him still without a point this season for Jordan.
Williams also lot Heinz-Harald Frentzen on the 17th and the rain
began to take its toll.

Ecuadoreans vote for president to end political circus

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Their fledgling democracy shaken by
corruption and a political circus, Ecuadoreans voted for a new
president Sunday, choosing between a Harvard-trained mayor and a
populist banana tycoon.
	   Many Ecuadoreans stayed home, weary of voting and eager to watch
the World Cup finals.
	   The election was the sixth time in the past two years that
Ecuadoreans have been asked to go to the polls.
	   Interim President Fabian Alarcon urged Ecuadoreans to vote
responsibly to end the nation's deep economic and political crisis
and to end the 17 months of transitional government that followed
the removal of the last elected president by Congress for ``mental
incapacity.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the next president inherits decades of
underdevelopment and backwardness. This is a historic moment for
national unity,'' Alarcon told reporters Sunday morning as he cast
his ballot.
	   Mahuad, 48, the centrist mayor of the capital, Quito, and Noboa,
47, Ecuador's richest man, were the top vote-getters in the first
round of voting on May 31.
	   The winner of the runoff will replace Alarcon on Aug. 10.
	   Mahuad entered election day with a hefty lead in the polls,
buoyed by the reputation as an honest, effective politician he
earned during his six-year stint as Quito's mayor.
	   The major political parties and business community backed
Mahuad, who they see as the best chance to solidify Ecuador's
19-year-old democracy.
	   ``We think the lead will hold and we will win,'' Mahuad told
reporters.
	   But Mahuad's lead in the polls shrank in the final days of the
campaign as Noboa promised to create a million jobs, build homes
for the poor and dish out ``the beating of the century'' to
Ecuador's traditional politicians.
	   ``The country's destiny is in the hands of God,'' said Noboa, as
he voted with a Bible in his hand. Despite his wealth, he has
called himself the candidate of the poor.
	   The winner must rescue Ecuador's tattered democratic reputation
and an economy staggered by El Nino-driven floods earlier this
year, deepening poverty and plummeting prices of its main export,
oil.
	   Ecuador's political carnival hit a low point in February 1997,
when Congress removed eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram,
nicknamed ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One,'' from office for
``mental incapacity.''
	   Massive street protests, strikes and charges of corruption
rocked the final days of Bucaram's six-month government, as some
Ecuadoreans called for a military coup to restore order.
	   ``Given the depth of this crisis, Ecuador doesn't need a
president _ we've had many _ we need a leader who will give us back
our faith,'' said columnist Jorge Ortiz of the national newspaper
Hoy.
	   Noboa ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's government and is
the disgraced former president's friend and political ally. Many
Ecuadoreans feared a Noboa win would mark a return to the Bucaram
administration.
	   ``If the new president is another populist, we are going to
continue being Latin America's political oddity,'' said political
analyst Fabian Corrales.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Belgian cyclist Tom Steels overcame stiff
Irish winds, a crash involving a half-dozen other riders and his
own turbulent past to win Sunday's first stage of the Tour de
France.
	   Steels _ disqualified from last year's Tour for throwing a water
bottle at fellow sprinter Frederic Moncassin _ survived the
concluding circuit of Dublin's vast Phoenix Park to win the
111.9-mile (180.5 km) course in 4 hours, 29 minutes, 58 seconds.
	   ``I'm always relieved to win the first stage. I did what I had
to do,'' Steels said at the finishing line.
	   Germany's Erik Zabel was edged out for second place in a mass
finish with split-seconds dividing first from 175th place.
Afterward Telekom's super-sprinter said he was left ``heartbroken''
at having missed his chance to win his first yellow jersey.
	   Australia's Robbie McEwen finished third, Italy's Gian Matteo
Fagnini and Nicola Minali fourth and fifth, and France's Moncassin
and Philippe Gaumont took the sixth and seventh spots.
	   Italy's flamboyant Mario Cipollini, well positioned as the
peloton broke into a sprint as it passed through the park's gates,
fell sideways onto the road in a pileup that also claimed France's
Stephane Barthe.
	   A downcast Cipollini said another unidentified rider fell down
in front of him as the pack pressed too closely together in the
final mile (2 kms) of the race. But he said that his injuries were
only superficial and ``with some luck and a good night's sleep''
would remain fit for competition.
	   Chris Boardman, the time-trial specialist from Britain who won
Saturday's opening prologue through downtown Dublin, retained the
leader's yellow jersey for a second day, finishing 39th.
	   ``I am hoping to stay in yellow at least until we reach
France,'' Boardman said.
	   Last year's Tour winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany, finished in
62nd place.
	   The Wicklow Mountains south of Dublin provided no real
opportunity for the sport's expert mountaineers to show off. The
course's steepest stretch was 1,137 feet (346 meters) over 5.3
miles (8.5 kms) from the village of Laragh to the treeless Wicklow
Gap summit.
	   France's Laurent Brochard finished 18th to put in the best
performance for the top-rated Festina team, which seemed to put in
a deliberately low-key performance after starting the Tour under
its own cloud of doping allegations.
	   Before the race Richard Verinque _ four times winner of the
Tour's polka-dot jersey in recognition of the best mountain climber
_ said Festina's cyclists would ``stand united'' and ``confront''
allegations that they were benefitting from illegal muscle-building
steroids or EPO, a drug that boosts the blood's ability to absorb
oxygen.
	   ``The people trying to sink us (will need) good lawyers,'' said
Verinque, who finished 70th.
	   One of Festina's support staff, Belgian masseur Willy Voet,
remained in a French prison near Lille on Sunday after customs
agents on the French-Belgian border allegedly found more than 400
vials of steroids and EPO in his Festina company car.
	   One of Festina's supporting riders, Christophe Moreau, is
competing while appealing his positive test for steroids use in
June. He came in 49th Sunday after finishing fifth in Saturday's
prologue.
	   After traversing the Wicklow Gap it was all rapidly downhill for
the 189 riders from 21 teams. The race was preplanned to end before
5 p.m. (1600GMT), providing riders plenty of time to watch France
play Brazil in Paris for the championship of soccer's World Cup.
	   Tour officials, who have started the competition outside France
12 times previously, brought the first three days of this year's
22-day event to Ireland partly to avoid a sporting overload in
World Cup-dominated France.
	   The Tour continues Monday with a straightforward 128-mile (205.5
km) run along Ireland's flat southern coast, from the village of
Enniscorthy to the southwest port of Cork.
	   From there the competitors and more than 4,000 Tour
administrators, team staff and journalists will either fly or sail
by overnight ferry to the Breton port of Roscoff, where the Tour
continues Tuesday. The competition concludes Aug. 2 in Paris after
grueling visits to both the Pyrenees and Alps mountain ranges.

Russian prime minister works to finalize financial bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR;  &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russia and IMF said to agree on all key issues. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and the International Monetary Fund Sunday
reached agreement on all the key issues of a loan package to
bailout the sinking Russian economy, news agencies reported.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko met with top IMF official John
Odling-Smee and the two reached an agreement on all principle
questions, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The Russian government and Central Bank, on one side, and the
IMF and World Bank on the other successfully negotiated all the
principle issues, a government spokesman told Interfax.
	   ``The sides agreed on all key issues,'' the spokesman said,
without providing details of the agreement.
	   Russian officials have been saying for days that an agreement on
a dlrs 10-15 billion IMF bailout was imminent.
	   In addition, the World Bank has agreed to speed talks on a dlrs
600-800 million loan that were supposed to be concluded this coming
October. The loan would be used to finance structural economic
reforms.
	   Any loan agreements were likely to be conditional. Before going
forward, both lenders have indicated that key fiscal legislation
must be voted into law by the opposition-led Russian parliament.
	   Lawmakers have resisted many of the measures, especially those
that would raise taxes. They are scheduled to hold a special
session this week to consider the measures again.
	   In May, investors began fleeing Russia's financial markets in
droves, spooked by several factors: a sharp drop in the prices of
Russia's oil exports, a wave of labor protests, and general
skittishness leftover from the Asian financial crisis.
	   All together, the stock market has lost about half its value
since the beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been
spending down its reserves to support the ruble.
	   So far the crisis has not affected ordinary consumers, but a
ruble devaluation would raise prices across the board and could
stir social unrest. The Kremlin insists it will not allow a
devaluation.
	   Much of an IMF loan is expected to go to shore up the Central
Bank's reserves, as well has help meet Russia's short-term loan
payments, which make up about 30 percent of the federal budget.
	   Kiriyenko has developed an austerity program designed to earn
the IMF's approval. Key measures include bills to straighten out
Russia's complex tax system and improve the government's dismal tax
collection.
	   But parliament says common folk have suffered enough from
Russia's economic travails, and are reluctant to introduce sales
taxes and other measures that treat rich and poor alike.

Sudan, Bahrain to establish diplomatic ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Sudan and Bahrain agreed Sunday to
exchange diplomatic missions, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Othman Ismael said.
	   He gave no date for the opening of the missions, which would
mark the first time Sudan has had diplomatic representation in
Bahrain. The Sudanese Embassy in Qatar has been handling relations
with Bahrain.
	   Bahrain and Sudan also agreed to strengthen economic ties,
Ismael said.
	   Sudan, one of the poorest countries in Africa, has been pushing
to develop its mineral wealth, including oil, to boost its economy.
	   Ismael said one of the goals of his visit was to attract
Bahraini investments to Sudan.
	   Sudan's relations with Gulf Arab countries deteriorated sharply
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when Khartoum was seen as
supporting Baghdad. Relations recently have been thawing.
	   Ismael arrived in Bahrain on Saturday from Saudi Arabia.

Parisians start their partying early

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Parisians got an early start Sunday for what could
be their biggest street parties since the Liberation, singing,
chanting and honking joyfully in anticipation of France's dream
World Cup final against Brazil.
	   Pulsing car horns echoed throughout the city all day. Strangers
shouted encouragement to each other across busy streets. The chants
were heard everywhere: ``We're gonna win!'' ``Where are they, those
Brazilians?'' And of course: ``Allez la France!''
	   At the ornate City Hall in downtown Paris, a crowd of hundreds
had gathered at least eight hours before the match, just to get a
good seat in front of the giant screen set up in the plaza.
	   About a dozen youngsters began singing the Marseillaise,
France's national anthem, and everyone joined in.
	   ``This is the most exciting day, no matter what happens,'' said
Patrice DeCary, who came in from the northeastern town of Reims to
imbibe the Parisian atmosphere.
	   ``May the best team win,'' he said, although one could be
forgiven for thinking he felt otherwise: his face was painted the
blue, white and red stripes of the French flag, and his entire body
was draped in one. For extra emphasis, his T-shirt listed all the
names of the French players.
	   The patriotic spirit was infectious. ``If you are proud to be
French, clap your hands!'' yelled the youths. Vincent Aigret, 20, a
student from Orleans, obliged. ``All of us together, all of us
together!'' he yelled back.
	   Young girls were also out in full force. Gwendoline Noblecourt,
10, said the French team was going to win 2-1. ``The French have
more spirit,'' she explained. ``Not just the men but the women,
too.''
	   Everybody said that after the game, they were going to one
place: the Champs-Elysees, already the scene of wild partying by
some 350,000 after France's semifinal win over Croatia Wednesday
night.
	   Hours before Sunday's final, thousands had already thronged the
huge avenue. With traffic partially blocked, city buses were
dumping passengers rather than try to get through.
	   A sizable, but discreet, security operation was in place to
police the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at strategic points
across Paris.
	   At the Place de la Concorde, a golden labrador awaited the game
with his back painted _ what else _ like a French flag.
	   France's national car drivers' association urged all motorists
to toot their horns at 7 p.m., two hours before the kickoff, to
support the team. But fans couldn't wait until then.
	   And, France being France, why not a fashion show? A pre-game
extravaganza by Yves Saint Laurent was set at the Stade de France
for 7:30 p.m. (1930 GMT), with 300 high-fashion models parading the
soccer field on which France hopes to make history.
	   President Jacques Chirac, who will hand the World Cup trophy to
the winning team, had a large TV screen installed at the Elysees
Palace so staffers could watch the broadcast and enjoy a buffet.
	   Whatever the outcome, ``Les Bleus'' _ the Blues _ will parade
down the Champs-Elysees on an open-topped bus Monday afternoon,
said French Football Federation president Claude Simonet.
	   Still, not all plans for the party came to fruition.
	   The Ministry of Culture canceled a proposal to cover the Arc de
Triomphe in a huge blue jersey after specialists said it would be
too complicated. Instead, the jersey will be hung from a nearby
building.

Taliban army captures northern Faryab province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army Sunday
claimed to have captured northern Faryab province, dealing its
northern-based enemies their most serious setback in more than a
year.
	   After two days of heavy fighting, the Taliban said it overran
Maimana, the capital of Faryab, sending enemy troops fleeing to
neighboring Balkh province, the headquarters of opposition leader
Rashid Dostum.
	   However, opposition sources, who said their soldiers lost a key
district of Qayzar in Faryab province, claimed to still be in
control of Maimana.
	   There was no way to independently confirm the claims by either
side.
	   A Taliban spokesman in Kabul said its soldiers captured 800
prisoners, 100 tanks and an arsenal of ammunition and machine guns.
	   The Taliban's supreme commander, Mullah Mohammed Omar,
apparently sent instructions to his soldiers on the front line to
treat prisoners with care and warned against using heavy handed
tactics against civilians in the area.
	   Fighting has been raging in the region for the last two days
after Taliban troops launched its biggest offensive this year in
the region.
	   ``God willing we will take all of the north soon,'' said a
Taliban official in Kabul, who asked that his name not be used.
	   Both sides in the protracted conflict in Afghanistan routinely
make battlefield claims that are difficult to confirm.
	   The Taliban, which controls the majority of Afghanistan, is
trying to drive its opponents out of the estimated 15 percent of
the country under their control.
	   If the Taliban's reports are true, the capture of Faryab would
be the most significant development in northern Afghanistan since
the Taliban were thrown out of the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif in May 1997.
	   There were reports then that thousands of Taliban prisoners were
massacred by opposition forces. There also were reports of attacks
by Taliban on civilians once loyal to the northern-based opposition
alliance.
	   Shamsul-Haq Arianfar, a spokesman for the opposition, told The
Associated Press that former President Burhanuddin Rabbani and
Dostum both were in Mazar-e-Sharif. The members of the opposition
alliance, which has been troubled by internal squabbling, have set
aside their difference to try to stop the Taliban's advances,
Arianfar said.
	   He said the opposition ran into trouble in Faryab province after
several commanders deserted to join the Taliban.
	   There also were reports of sporadic fighting in northern Kunduz
province, where the opposition is trying to drive the Taliban out
of the provincial capital.
	   The Taliban espouse a strict brand of Islamic law that forbids
women from working and girls from going to school.

Winona gives Oxx second successive Irish Oaks victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE CURRAGH, Ireland (AP) _ Winona beat Kitza and Bahr _ a 5-4
favorite _ by seven lengths at The Curragh on Sunday, giving
trainer John Oxx his second successive Irish Oaks victory.
	   Johnny Murtagh rode Winona (12-1) to the front at the
two-furlong post and she strode away from the field for a
comfortable win in the 200,000-pound (dlrs 332,000) Group One
event.
	   Murtagh, who rode three winners on Sunday, had also teamed up
with Oxx last year to win the Irish Oaks on Ebadiyla.
	   Winona went into the race fresh from a third place in the
Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot, but was not considered a strong
chance among the field of three-year-old fillies to win the
mile-and-a-half Oaks.
	   The Godolphin trained Bahr failed to race up to expectations and
was beaten on the line for second place by Kitza (10-1).

Six elephants killed by railroad train in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Six wild elephants were run over by a
railroad train in India's remote northeast, police said Sunday.
	   The six, including four baby elephants, died instantly on
Saturday night near Daldali, a town 220 kilometers (140 miles)
south of Gauhati, the capital of Assam state.
	   The elephants had ventured out of the Karbi Anglong reserve
forest, Mukesh Aggarwal, the superintendent of police, said in a
telephone interview.
	   The railroad track running through the dense forest connects the
northeastern states of Assam and Nagaland with the rest of India.
	   Nearly 5,500 Asiatic wild elephants inhabit Assam state. This
was the first incident of elephants being killed by a train in the
state.
	   The accident disrupted train services for nearly 12 hours.
Forest officials waited for the daybreak to clear the railroad
track of the remains.

Israel, Palestinians try to arrange meeting at U.S. request

Netanyahu advisor &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, efforts are underway to arrange a meeting
between Israel's defense minister and Yasser Arafat's deputy, a top
Palestinian official said Sunday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Albright
had suggested Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
might succeed where American mediators have failed in resolving an
impasse over Israel's overdue West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a top Palestinian security official, confirmed
there were efforts to arrange a meeting ``very soon'' between Abbas
and Mordechai.
	   Albright said Friday that the United States could not resolve
the differences between the two sides unless they talked to each
other.
	   Meanwhile, Israel radio reported that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would ask his inner-Cabinet Monday to approve details of
an American plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank. Netanyahu's top aide David Bar-Illan could not confirm the
report but said that ``remaining gaps are narrow and imminently
bridgeable.''
	   On Sunday, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh accused the
Palestinians of avoiding direct talks.
	   ``They knew that as long as they didn't enter into direct
dialogue with Israel, they could avoid fulfilling their commitments
and hide behind American ideas,'' he told Israel's Army Radio.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi, however, said Israel had not
responded to recent Palestinian attempts to arrange a meeting.
	   ``Later we heard that the Israelis were not interested in
meeting because they didn't have a mandate from the prime minister
to reach agreement,'' he said.
	   ``We have no problem with bilateral talks,'' said chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``But what do we talk about?''
	   Obstacles to agreement include Israel's demand that the
Palestinians extradite suspects accused of terror attacks against
Israel and take further action to revise sections of the PLO
charter that call for the destruction of the Jewish state, the
charter, and continuing disagreement over the extent of the troop
withdrawal.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians would not renegotiate the U.S.
proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, which he said already
represented a significant concession from the Palestinian position
that they should get 40 percent. Nor would they hand over
Palestinian suspects to Israel, he said.
	   The Palestinian revision of the charter was also not subject to
	   negotiation, he said. ``When the Palestinians say that it has
been finalized, that means it is final,'' he said.
	   Erekat said Netanyahu ``knows very well that the articles have
been nullified,'' and that the Palestinians had worked with the
U.S. State Department for three months to specify which sections of
	   the charter had been annulled.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet said earlier that bilateral negotiations
would resume only when Israel accepted the U.S. initiative.
	   Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been frozen since
March 1997, when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement on a disputed hilltop between Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
	   On Sunday, police arrested a minor from a Jewish settlement in
the hills around the West Bank city of Hebron on suspicion of
attacking Arabs in an incident in the city 10 days ago, and an Arab
girl was arrested for throwing a knife toward a border policeman in
Jerusalem's Old City, police said.
	   On Saturday night, three residents of Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox
Sanhedria neighborhood were briefly detained for throwing stones at
Palestinian cars outside Hebron, police said.

International conference aims to control flood of illegal weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ In bid to control the spread of military
small arms, 21 countries are scheduled to meet Monday in Oslo to
develop a plan for keeping the weapons out of the hands of
terrorists, criminals and countries on the brink of war.
	   Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Aaslaug Haga said light
military weapons kill more people a year than tanks and bombs.
	   ``The large number of such weapons is destabilizing, complicates
peace settlements, and hampers social and economic development,''
she was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB. ``This is
a complicated and controversial problem.''
	   No one is sure how many light weapons, such as machine guns and
automatic rifles, there are in the world. The United States alone
has an estimated 250 million handguns.
	   Inspired by its success in drafting a global ban on land mines,
Norway last year began a drive to control small arms. Three weeks
of negotiations in Oslo in September resulted in a treaty banning
anti-personnel mines.
	   In April, 13 West African nations, many recovering from civil
wars, met in Oslo and called for a three-year moratorium on small
arms trade in their own countries.
	   Haga said this week's meeting is to define a strategy, not to
seek a total ban on small arms, since many are sold and used
legally. But the spread of illegal weapons, sometimes left over
from civil wars or kept by demobilized soldiers, contributes to
violence and crime all over the world.

Mexico-EU free trade negotiations to begin this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Long-awaited formal free trade negotiations
between Mexico and the European Union will get under way this week
in Brussels, the Department of Commerce said Sunday.
	   A news release said Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco and
Foreign Secretary Rosario Green will lead the delegation that will
meet Tuesday with members of the European Commission.
	   ``Mexico and the European Union have the chance to strengthen
their trade relationship through the negotiation of a wide-reaching
accord that deepens exchange of goods and services,'' the
department said.
	   Mexico, a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and
the European Union signed an interim economic and political
cooperation agreement Dec. 8. It was ratified by the Mexican Senate
on April 23 and by the European Parliament on May 13.
	   Among concerns that officials will be addressing are the
unfavorable tariff conditions for trade between Mexico and the EU.
	   The European Union is Mexico's second-largest trading partner
after the United States, and Mexico's second largest source of
direct foreign investment.
	   Bilateral trade in 1997 totaled dlrs 14 billion, although
Mexico's trade with the EU dropped to 6 percent of total trade in
1997 from 11 percent in 1990.
	   The department attributed the drop to free trade agreements that
Mexico has signed with other countries this decade, including
accords with Canada, the United States, Chile, Bolivia, Costa Rica,
Colombia and Venezuela.
	   Manufactured goods accounted for 62 percent of Mexican exports
to the E.U in 1997, compared to 86 percent of Mexican exports to
the rest of the world.
	   Mexican exports totaled dlrs 110 billion in 1997, and dlrs 47.76
billion in the first five months of 1998. Imports in the first five
months of this year totaled dlrs 50.21 billion.
	   The EU is also a major investor in Mexico, accounting for 21.5
percent of total foreign direct investment between 1994 and 1997.

Ecuadoreans vote for president to end political circus

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Their fledgling democracy shaken by
corruption and a political circus, Ecuadoreans voted for a new
president Sunday, choosing between a Harvard-trained mayor and a
populist banana tycoon.
	   Many Ecuadoreans stayed home, weary of voting and eager to watch
the World Cup finals.
	   The election was the sixth time in the past two years that
Ecuadoreans have been asked to go to the polls.
	   Interim President Fabian Alarcon urged Ecuadoreans to vote
responsibly to end the nation's deep economic and political crisis
and to end the 17 months of transitional government that followed
the removal of the last elected president by Congress for ``mental
incapacity.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the next president inherits decades of
underdevelopment and backwardness. This is a historic moment for
national unity,'' Alarcon told reporters Sunday morning as he cast
his ballot.
	   Mahuad, 48, the centrist mayor of the capital, Quito, and Noboa,
47, Ecuador's richest man, were the top vote-getters in the first
round of voting on May 31.
	   The winner of the runoff will replace Alarcon on Aug. 10.
	   Mahuad entered election day with a hefty lead in the polls,
buoyed by the reputation as an honest, effective politician he
earned during his six-year stint as Quito's mayor.
	   The major political parties and business community backed
Mahuad, who they see as the best chance to solidify Ecuador's
19-year-old democracy.
	   ``We think the lead will hold and we will win,'' Mahuad told
reporters.
	   But Mahuad's lead in the polls shrank in the final days of the
campaign as Noboa promised to create a million jobs, build homes
for the poor and dish out ``the beating of the century'' to
Ecuador's traditional politicians.
	   ``The country's destiny is in the hands of God,'' said Noboa, as
he voted with a Bible in his hand. Despite his wealth, he has
called himself the candidate of the poor.
	   In a television interview, Noboa accused Mahuad's supporters of
carrying out electoral fraud. He did not provide details.
International observers are monitoring the vote.

Israel, Palestinians try to arrange meeting at U.S. request

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, efforts are underway to arrange a meeting
between Israel's defense minister and Yasser Arafat's deputy, a top
Palestinian official said Sunday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Albright
had suggested Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
might succeed where American mediators have failed in resolving an
impasse over Israel's overdue West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a top Palestinian security official, confirmed
there were efforts to arrange a meeting ``very soon'' between Abbas
and Mordechai.
	   Albright said Friday that the United States could not resolve
the differences between the two sides unless they talked to each
other.
	   Meanwhile, Israel radio reported that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would ask his inner-Cabinet Monday to approve details of
an American plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank. Netanyahu's top aide David Bar-Illan could not confirm the
report but said that ``remaining gaps are narrow and imminently
bridgeable.''

Ruling party suffers major upset in parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese media final vote count in 6th graf, 16th
graf and final graf; final official results expected by 2000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Voters sent a strong protest message over the
handling of Japan's economic woes Sunday, handing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democrats an embarrassing setback in
parliamentary elections.
	   Hashimoto hinted he was ready to step down as head of the party,
and thus as prime minister, to take responsibility for the poor
showing in the balloting for 126 seats, or half of Parliament's
upper house.
	   ``The results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto
said. ``Everyone has handed down their judgment, and we must accept
that with sincerity.''
	   With Japan in its worst recession since World War II, many
clearly had had enough. Unemployment is at a record high, consumer
spending is plummeting and Japan's financial system is on the verge
of a meltdown, with major banks saddled with massive bad loans.
	   The Liberal Democrats needed 69 seats to regain a majority in
the upper house, which they lost in 1989. They needed at least 61
seats _ the number they held before Sunday's vote _ to come close
to saving face.
	   Public broadcaster NHK-TV said the Liberal Democrats won 44
seats. Official electoral results were not expected until about 5
a.m. Monday (2000 GMT).
	   With the seats that were not up for election, the Liberal
Democrats now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house, although they
may add more by wooing independent legislators.
	   Hashimoto said he would announce his decision at a meeting of
party leaders, set for 12:30 p.m. Monday (0330 GMT). He refused to
say what his decision might be, but his comments suggested that he
wanted to resign.
	   Despite the election results, the conservative, pro-business
Liberal Democrats will continue to rule because they have firm
control over the more powerful lower house, which can pass the
national budget and choose the prime minister without the approval
of the upper house. If he steps down, Hashimoto would be replaced
as prime minister by another Liberal Democratic legislator.
	   But without control over the upper house, his party will need
the cooperation of other parties to pass key legislation.
	   With politics in turmoil in the short term as the Liberal
Democrats try to select Hashimoto's successor and a new Cabinet,
efforts to implement economic reforms may stall and send an already
skeptical market falling further.
	   But John Neuffer, a senior research fellow who follows Japanese
politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a Tokyo think tank,
said the opposition was too fragmented to pose a real threat to the
Liberal Democrats.
	   ``The LDP remains the only show in town when it comes to running
the government,'' he said.
	   If anything, in the long run, the electoral humiliation may
prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the economy
back on track, Neuffer said.
	   Toward the end of the campaign, the Liberal Democrats
flip-flopped on cutting income taxes, which many voters, as well
the United States, considered a key factor for economic recovery.
	   The Democrats _ a liberal, relatively new party that has
recently emerged as the main opposition threat to the LDP _
promised such a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   The Democrats won 27 seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in
the entire upper house house.
	   ``Voters have clearly said `No' to the Hashimoto
administration,'' said Democratic Party head Naoto Kan, a former
health minister. ``The people have lent an ear to what we said and
they are giving us a chance.''
	   ``Many people wanted a change in politics,'' said newly elected
Democrat lawmaker Akira Gunji on nationally broadcast election
news.
	   The Japan Communist Party, which strongly pushed for tax cuts,
won 15 seats, also a gain of nine, according to NHK, and now holds
23 seats in the house. The left-leaning Social Democrats, who lost
much of their credibility when they joined the ruling coalition
with the Liberal Democrats, won five seats, a loss of seven, and
now have 13 in all.

	   THE CURRAGH, Ireland (AP) _ Winona beat Kitza and Bahr _ a 5-4
favorite _ by seven lengths at The Curragh on Sunday, giving
trainer John Oxx his second successive Irish Oaks victory.
	   Johnny Murtagh rode Winona (12-1) to the front at the
two-furlong post and she strode away from the field for a
comfortable win in the 200,000-pound (dlrs 332,000) Group One
event.
	   Murtagh, who rode three winners on Sunday, had also teamed up
with Oxx last year to win the Irish Oaks on Ebadiyla.
	   Winona went into the race fresh from a third place in the
Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot, but was not considered a strong
chance among the field of three-year-old fillies to win the
mile-and-a-half Oaks.
	   The Godolphin trained Bahr failed to race up to expectations and
was beaten on the line for second place by Kitza (10-1).

Police: Peace opponents masterminded foiled London bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Irish republican splinter groups opposed to the
Northern Ireland peace agreement have joined forces and are likely
to have masterminded the recent foiled bombing campaign in London,
Northern Ireland's police chief said Sunday.
	   This alliance and some individual dissidents ``have been
responsible for quite a number of attacks and attempted attacks,''
Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said on Sky
Television.
	   And he vowed that security forces on both sides of the Irish
border and in mainland Britain, whose joint operation foiled
Friday's attempted bombings in London, would do everything possible
to thwart ``these evil people.''
	   Scotland Yard said anti-terrorist police seized six fully primed
firebombs when they arrested six people at four sites in London
during the evening rush-hour. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John
Grieve, head of the anti-terrorist branch, said Friday night that
the devices were intended to be used ``within minutes,'' but did
not disclose the number.
	   Scotland Yard has refused to identify the intended targets. The
British media said the firebombs were thought to have been destined
for London stores.
	   The four men and two women arrested in London were questioned
again Sunday, and one woman was released. The others can be held
without charge for seven days under the Prevention of Terrorism
Act.
	   Two of the four people arrested in the Irish Republic were
released without charge on Sunday. But a police spokesman said
files on a woman detained in Dublin and a man detained in Dundalk
would be sent to the prosecutor's department, which could charge
them.
	   Irish police continued to question two people _ one arrested in
Dublin and the other in Wexford.
	   None of those arrested has been identified by police. But The
Sunday Times said three men arrested in London were students _ two
at University College in Dublin and one at Queen's College in
Belfast.
	   ``Of the six people arrested in London and four in Ireland, only
one has a history of republican involvement,'' the newspaper said.
	   Republican splinter groups vehemently oppose the Irish
Republican Army cease-fire which enabled its allied Sinn Fein party
to participate in the peace process and take seats in the new
Belfast Assembly.
	   These breakaway groups say they will settle for nothing short of
a union between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic _ and they
have been responsible for a number of bombings in the province and
several attempts to attack mainland Britain.
	   By combining intelligence and weapons, The Sunday Times said the
maverick groups were attempting to fill ``the terrorist vacuum''
created when the IRA and Sinn Fein decided to back the peace
process.
	   ``There has been a drift of people from mainstream republican
organizations toward them,'' Flanagan said. ``I think that drift
has stabilized. They're not numerous, but they're dangerous in
terms of the expertise that some people amongst their numbers
have.''
	   Flanagan identified the dissident groups who are acting together
as the relatively new Continuity IRA and the established Irish
National Liberation Army, both anti-British rivals of the IRA, and
``those close to those who call themselves the 32 County
Sovereignty Committee.''
	   The ``Committee'' is a relatively new group critical of the
IRA's decision to stop bombing and shooting. Its spokeswoman is
Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, sister of Bobby Sands who starved
himself to death in the Maze Prison in 1981. She is married to
Michael McKevitt, believed to be the IRA's former chief
quartermaster who now leads another breakaway group, the Real IRA.
	   Last month, the Observer newspaper said the INLA and the
Continuity IRA had held a ``rejectionist terror summit'' in Dundalk
with the Real IRA.
	   The newspaper on Sunday quoted an Irish police source as saying
the attempted bombings in London were ``the fruits of that
summit.''

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dancing, singing and drinking, thousands
of Croatian soccer fans toasted their team's return Sunday in a
continuation of wild celebrations that followed their 2-1 victory
over the Netherlands to clinch the World Cup bronze.
	   The win sent the country into delirium Saturday. Fans covered in
strips of the national red-white-and-blue set off fireworks, took
dips in prominent city fountains and danced on hoods of cars
honking their horns throughout the country's major towns.
	   It was the first time a debutante country had reached heights in
the World Cup since Portugal took the bronze in 1966, and a perhaps
the biggest sporting success of the young nation.
	   Davor Suker, who scored the winning goal against the Dutch, gave
his compatriots additional reason to cheer. His goal also vaulted
the Real Madrid striker atop the tournament's list for top scorer,
with six goals and a likely chance at snapping the Golden Boot.
	   The closest contender still in the chase is Brazilian ace
Ronaldo. He needs to put away three goals in Sunday's final against
hosts France if he is to deny Suker the award.
	   Still giddy from the previous night's festivities, thousands
were on hand to greet their heroes at the capital's airport in
Zagreb Sunday.
	   When the players mounted a stage sporting medals around their
necks and smiles stretched from ear to ear, a wild roar swept
through the crowd.
	   Bands played triumphant tunes, a giant screen kept spinning
highlights of the World Cup and a chanting, whistling and
flag-waving mania raved on into the night, shouting ``Davor
Suker!'' ``Croatia, Croatia,'' and ``We are the Champions.''
	   The celebrations almost slipped into mayhem as emotions peaked
and fans wanted to get closer to their stars. Captain Zvonimir
Boban had to appeal to the audience to settle.
	   Paramedics had their hands full tending to squashed or fainted
people in the crowd. Even players on stage had to help pluck out
fans caught a pinch.
	   ``Bronze has the same shine as gold for us,'' said Damir
Bagovic, a surgeon who joined in on the fray with his two daughters
clad in the trademark red-and-white checks.
	   President Franjo Tudjman was to receive the team, to present
them with medals of honor.
	   Croatia's World Cup exploit ranks high up in the nations'
sporting history, perhaps even at the pinnacle itself. Since
winning independence in 1993, the young nation has, however
produced winners in tennis, basketball and now soccer.
	   ``We're a small country but we've got big sporting stars,'' said
Kristian, an unusually tall 13 year-old fan _ with hopes to be a
top athlete in the making.

Britain apologizes for hooligans but won't pay compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain was ``unlikely'' to compensate France for
the costs of policing English fans at the soccer World Cup, Sports
Minister Tony Banks told BBC radio on Sunday.
	   Banks _ who went to France on Friday to formally apologize for
the actions of English soccer hooligans during the tournament _
said it was not customary for one government to pay the policing
costs incurred in another country.
	   ``We don't do it, and it's most unlikely that we will,'' he
said.
	   However, Banks did say ``we have some way to go to atone for
what happened.''
	   English soccer hooligans were universally condemned for their
their involvement in rioting before and after England's World Cup
opening match against Tunisia at Marseille.
	   Three days of violence and rioting by English fans around the
match at the Stade Velodrome resulted in almost 100 arrests and
left more than 50 people with injuries.
	   English fans were also involved in violence at England's other
World Cup venues in Toulouse, Lens and Saint Etienne.
	   However, tighter security measures including alcohol bans
prevented a repeat of the large-scale riots in Marseille in early
June.

Finns flock to tango capital for festival of passionate dance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEINAJOKI, Finland (AP) _ The insinuating music and sweeping
moves of the tango, so redolent of warm South American nights, has
found a home amid Finland's cool and endless birch forests.
	   This year's tango festival in Seinajoki, which ended Sunday,
attracted a record 100,000 people _ about one of every 50 people in
a country known more for reserve than romance.
	   ``It's like a spell,'' said Pirjo Saari, who was among the crowd
on one of the outdoor dance floors.
	   ``Once the tango grabs you, there's no letting go: You're
hooked,'' she said.
	   ``It's very difficult to put into words what dancing the tango
is all about,'' said her partner, Tuomo Piippolainen. ``It's just
such a strong feeling, a feeling deep inside.''
	   The dance gives normally reserved Finns an outlet for their
emotions.
	   ``The tango gives Finnish men, who generally are unable to
express their feelings, a chance to say with their bodies what they
would like to say with their tongues but can't,'' said M. A.
Numminen, a musician who has studied the tango for 35 years.
	   Finns version of the dance is slower than the Argentine
original, the sweeps are more measured and the music is always in a
minor key.
	   This year, there was a lot of shuffling in the streets, schools,
halls and outdoor dance floors in Seinajoki, 360 kilometers (220
miles) north of Helsinki. The festival has grown into the largest
summer event in Finland.
	   The tango was introduced to Finland in the 1910s. With its
relief and entertainment, it became a hit in the 1950s during a
tough reconstruction period after the Finns suffered heavy losses
in a war against the Soviet Union.
	   ``It started out as entertainment, but now it has become
something much more _ it's a way of life,'' said Jaakko Salo, a
music producer.

Twelve students killed by rebels in Burundi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 12 high school students
in a school in southern Burundi, the state-run Burundi news agency
said Sunday.
	   The students were studying at their high school when a group of
rebels killed them with guns, clubs and knives in Mabanda, Makamba
province, 90 kilometers (55 miles) southeast of Bujumbura, the
report said.
	   The news agency said the rebels belonged to the National Council
for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), the main rebel group in
Burundi.
	   The CNDD was represented in at the recent all-party peace talks
on Burundi last month, but, like the government has raised doubts
about their commitment to a cease-fire agreed upon in the talks.
	   The cease-fire is set to take effect no later than July 20, when
the second round of talks is supposed to begin.
	   The army said it was not bound by the cease-fire because its job
was to maintain peace. The CNDD said the person who signed the
accord in the group's name had no mandate to do so.
	   No other details about the latest attack were immediately
available.

Essex score record finals win over Leicestershire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Faced with the task of scoring runs quickly,
Leicestershire did exactly the opposite in losing the rain-affected
Benson and Hedges Cup final to Essex by a record margin at Lord's
on Sunday.
	   Essex set Leicestershire a target of 269 on Saturday before the
limited-overs final was postponed due to heavy rain.
	   When play finally resumed 24 hours later, it took Essex less
than two hours to bowl Leicestershire out for 76 _ the lowest cup
final total in the competition's 27 years.
	   The 192-run winning margin was the biggest on record in a
domestic final at Lord's.
	   Essex bowlers Ashley Cowan took three for 24 and Mark Ilott
three for 10 respectively, while Australian Stuart Law contributed
by holding three catches and taking two wickets.
	   Paul Nixon, 21 not out, was one of two Leicestershire batsmen to
reach double figures _ a stark contrast to a dominating batting
dispay by Essex captain Paul Pritchard and test batsman Nasser
Hussain on Saturday.

	   Ronaldo, however, was listed among the the 11 substitutes
available to enter the game as a replacement.
	   The move was a total surprise. The 21-year-old forward practiced
without any indication of a problem Saturday night at the team's
hotel at Lesigny.
	   On Thursday, Ronaldo did not take part in the regular training
session, opting instead for light laps around the field. Brazilian
team officials had earlier said Ronaldo was suffering from a case
of tendonitis in his left knee.
	   However, on Friday, Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said the
injury was not a problem.
	   Brazil took the field Sunday in its quest for a fifth World Cup
title.

Germany retains title in three-day regatta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defending champion Germany put
together three victories on the Rotsee lake Sunday to win the
Lucerne regatta and the overall World Cup in rowing.
	   Germany, which came to Lucerne with a slim five-point advantage
over Britain, pushed its season point total to 137, ahead of
Britain at 112 and Denmark at 93.
	   Germany's victories were in the lightweight men's double sculls,
the men's eight and the women's quadruple sculls. Denmark and Italy
won two boat classes with the other seven divided among Australia,
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia and Switzerland.
	   The British coxless four of quadruple Olympic gold medalist
Steve Redgrave, double gold medalist Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster
and James Cracknell returned to the top of the World Cup podium.
	   The world champion boat lost their unbeaten record at the first
World Cup regatta of the season in Munich six weeks ago when Foster
was ruled out of the crew after severing tendons in his right hand.
	   A strong challenge was expected from the new fast young
Australian four, which won the second regatta of the series and was
unbeaten this season. Also in the race was the Romanian crew that
defeated the British in Munich
	   Tension grew as the race was delayed for 90 minutes after the
Norwegian crew broke their rudder line while lining up for the
start.
	   When the race eventually got underway, the British four stormed
off the start, opening up an immediate lead and were nearly three
seconds clear of Romania by half way.
	   The expected Australian challenge never materialized and the
British put in a powerful final burst to come home more than a
length clear in 6 minutes 26.40 seconds.
	   ``It's nice to be back in the boat,'' said Foster. ``It was hard
to watch these guys in Munich, probably as bad as it was racing
it.''
	   The Danish Olympic world champion lightweight coxless four of
Thomas Ebert, Thomas Poulsen, Eskild Ebbsen and Victor Feddersen
extended their unique unbeaten World Cup winning run. Their victory
in Lucerne made them the first crew to achieve a clean sweep of the
three event series for two successive years.
	   ``Mentally it gets more difficult for us with every victory,''
said Feddersen. ``We were very nervous, and it is wonderful to
win.''
	   Russia's new sculling sensation Irina Fedotova was the only
other to score maximum points in this year's World Cup. She led
from the start to complete her hat trick of World Cup victories in
her first season racing in the single scull.
	   Olympic champion Xeno Mueller of Switzerland powered through
from a slow start, which left him in fourth place, to win the men's
single sculls.
	   But he was pushed all the way to the line by New Zealand's Rob
Waddell, racing in his first international regatta of the year, who
finished just inches behind in one of the closest races of the day.
	   Prize money, in the form of travel reimbursement grants, was
awarded for the first time this season and the German team took
home a total of 20,550 Swiss francs (dlrs 13,700).

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dancing, singing and drinking, thousands
of Croatian soccer fans toasted their team's return Sunday in a
continuation of wild celebrations that followed their 2-1 victory
over the Netherlands to clinch the World Cup bronze.
	   The win sent the country into delirium Saturday. Fans covered in
strips of the national red-white-and-blue set off fireworks, took
dips in prominent city fountains and danced on hoods of cars
honking their horns throughout the country's major towns.
	   It was the first time a debutante country had reached heights in
the World Cup since Portugal took the bronze in 1966, and a perhaps
the biggest sporting success of the young nation.
	   Davor Suker, who scored the winning goal against the Dutch, gave
his compatriots additional reason to cheer. His goal also vaulted
the Real Madrid striker atop the tournament's list for top scorer,
with six goals and a likely chance at snapping the Golden Boot.
	   The closest contender still in the chase is Brazilian ace
Ronaldo. He needs to put away three goals in Sunday's final against
hosts France if he is to deny Suker the award.
	   Still giddy from the previous night's festivities, thousands
were on hand to greet their heroes at the capital's airport in
Zagreb Sunday.
	   When the players mounted a stage sporting medals around their
necks and smiles stretched from ear to ear, a wild roar swept
through the crowd.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dancing, singing and drinking, thousands
of Croatian soccer fans toasted their team's return Sunday in a
continuation of wild celebrations that followed their 2-1 victory
over the Netherlands to clinch the World Cup bronze.
	   The win sent the country into delirium Saturday. Fans covered in
strips of the national red-white-and-blue set off fireworks, took
dips in prominent city fountains and danced on hoods of cars
honking their horns throughout the country's major towns.
	   It was the first time a debutante country had reached such
heights in the World Cup since Portugal took the bronze in 1966,
and a perhaps the biggest sporting success of the young nation.
	   Davor Suker, who scored the winning goal against the Dutch, gave
his compatriots additional reason to cheer. His goal also vaulted
the Real Madrid striker atop the tournament's list for top scorer,
with six goals and a likely chance at snapping the Golden Boot.
	   The closest contender still in the chase is Brazilian ace
Ronaldo. He needs to put away three goals in Sunday's final against
hosts France if he is to deny Suker the award.
	   Still giddy from the previous night's festivities, thousands
were on hand to greet their heroes at the capital's airport in
Zagreb Sunday.
	   When the players mounted a stage sporting medals around their
necks and smiles stretched from ear to ear, a wild roar swept
through the crowd.
	   Bands played triumphant tunes, a giant screen kept spinning
highlights of the World Cup and a chanting, whistling and
flag-waving mania raved on into the night, shouting ``Davor
Suker!'' ``Croatia, Croatia,'' and ``We are the Champions.''
	   The celebrations almost slipped into mayhem as emotions peaked
and fans wanted to get closer to their stars. Captain Zvonimir
Boban had to appeal to the audience to settle.
	   Paramedics had their hands full tending to squashed or fainted
people in the crowd and even players on stage had to help pluck out
swooning fans.
	   ``Bronze has the same shine as gold for us,'' said Damir
Bagovic, a surgeon who joined in on the fray with his two daughters
clad in the trademark red-and-white checks.
	   After greeting their fans, President Franjo Tudjman received the
team, presenting them with medals of honor.
	   ``Your magnificent success is a great boon for the country's
image in the eyes of the world,'' Tudjman, an ardent soccer fan,
told the team.
	   Croatia's World Cup exploit ranks high up in the nations'
sporting history, perhaps even at the pinnacle itself. Since
winning independence in 1991, the young nation has, however,
produced winners in tennis, basketball and now soccer.
	   ``We're a small country but we've got big sporting stars,'' said

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Belgian cyclist Tom Steels overcame stiff
Irish winds, a crash involving a half-dozen other riders and his
own turbulent past to win Sunday's first stage of the Tour de
France.
	   Steels _ disqualified from last year's Tour for throwing a water
bottle at fellow sprinter Frederic Moncassin _ survived the
concluding circuit of Dublin's vast Phoenix Park to win the
111.9-mile (180.5 km) course in 4 hours, 29 minutes, 58 seconds.
	   ``It's a great relief to win the first stage, because last year
I grew more nervous each day without a win. ... That's why I blew a
fuse last year,'' Steels said at the finishing line.
	   ``The Tour sprints are always difficult, because the best
sprinters are here,'' he said. ``And there are some other guys who
try their luck _ and they're dangerous.''

Background facts on Japan's parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NHK TV final tally of votes &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Japan-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese voters went to the polls Sunday to elect
126 of the 252 lawmakers in the upper house of Parliament. The
elections are seen as among the most important Japan has held in
years for several reasons:
	   SINKING ECONOMY: Japan's economy is deep in its worst recession
since World War II. Its banks are foundering under a mountain of
bad debt and unemployment is at a record high of 4.1 percent.
Japan's economic morass has already aggravated a financial crisis
throughout Asia, and economists believe that a continuation could
threaten world markets as well.
	   SHAKY PRIME MINISTER: Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
assumed office in early 1996, suggested he would step down as early
as Monday to take responsibility for the poor showing at the polls.
His Liberal Democratic Party lost 17 seats in the balloting, widely
viewed as a referendum on Hashimoto's handling of Japan's economic
problems. In the short run, a leadership change could further slow
efforts for an economic turnaround.
	   REALIGNED OPPOSITION: The new Democratic Party was a major
gainer in the elections, adding nine seats by winning 27 seats
Sunday. The Democrats, representing a more liberal stance than
Hashimoto's conservatives, have a popular leader in Naoto Kan and
have emerged as the biggest challenge to the Liberal Democrats. The
Communists also made advances, but the farther-to-the-left
Socialists, who for decades were the LDP's main rival, lost their
appeal by making an about-face and aligning with the LDP in 1994.
	   POLITICAL APATHY: Voter turnout was better than expected, thanks
to a major campaign to bring out the vote with extended polling
hours and looser restrictions on absentee voting. The final voter
turnout was 58.8 percent, up from the record low of 44.5 percent in
upper house elections three years ago. Surveys show more voters
than ever before support no particular political party, and are
increasingly pessimistic about the effectiveness of politicians in
general. But voters may have wanted to send a strong protest
message to the Liberal Democrats.

Colombian delegates meet with rebel group in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with delegates apparently meeting at cloister &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos FRA106 &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombian civic leaders converged in Mainz
for secretive talks with the country's second-largest rebel group
Sunday, another tentative step toward ending Latin America's
longest-running civil war.
	   The four-day meeting with envoys of the 5,000-member National
Liberation Army, or ELN, is to prepare for direct talks between the
rebels and Colombian president-elect Andres Pastrana.
	   The Germany talks have been overshadowed by Pastrana's suprise
meeting at home Thursday with leaders of Colombia's largest rebel
group and his vow to begin negotiations with them within 90 days of
his Aug. 7 inauguration. Pastrana did not send a representative to
Mainz.
	   Both events have increased hopes among millions of Colombians
who want an end to the country's 34-year war. But delegates warned
against assumptions that they will return from Germany with peace
in hand.
	   ``We don't want to generate any false expectations,'' said Sabas
Pretelt, head of a leading Colombian industry association and a
member of the peace commission set up the talks.
	   Pretelt gathered in a hotel lobby in Mainz, near Frankfurt, with
other Colombian delegates _ from industry, labor, social agencies
and the Roman Catholic church _ before meeting in the Catholic
bishops' offices near the Mainz cathedral.
	   `The purpose of this meeting is to open the channels for
dialogue,'' said Hernando Hernandez, leader of Colombia's USO labor
union. ``We are urgently seeking peace for Colombia.''
	   No rebels representatives were at the hotel in Mainz.
	   Initially, it appeared that the rebels were waiting for the
delegates inside the bishops' offices. But after a couple of hours,
the delegates, some of whom carried luggage, left the offices in a
convoy of minibuses. Reporters followed, but were stopped at police
barricades.
	   The empty minibuses later were seen leaving Himmelspforten
cloister in Wuerzburg in northwestern Bavaria. The rebels were
believed to have been there waiting for the delegates.
	   The participants were believed to be staying at the walled
compound until Wednesday, when they planned to hold a news
conference. No earlier public statements were scheduled.
	   Germany's Roman Catholic church, coordinating the talks jointly
with Colombian colleagues, has insisted the meeting remain as
closed as possible, saying publicity could hamper their outcome.
	   ``The original intention was to have the talks entirely in
secret, the kind you find out about only afterward, like the Oslo
talks that led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,'' church
spokesman Rudolf Hammerschmidt said.
	   The ELN's main rallying cry has been against foreign
exploitation of Colombia's natural resources, and it often attacks
oil pipelines and kidnaps industry executives. Based mainly in
Colombia's northeast oil-producing regions, the ELN's income is
largely from extortion and kidnapping.
	   The ELN is far less prodigious militarily than the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and is seen as far
more likely to be willing to disarm in return for political
concessions.

Boys' deaths mark `turning point' in Northern Ireland dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with authorities saying demonstration was broken up in
area just before attack on boys, that funeral will be Catholic,
stuffed animals being left outside burned residence, quote from
priest; edits throughout to trim &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three young brothers who had
been asleep in their beds burned to death early Sunday in a
sectarian attack marking what shaken Northern Ireland leaders
termed a ``turning point'' in a violent stalemate over a blocked
Protestant march.
	   A neighbor reported hearing 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason Quinn screaming as fire gutted their residence
in Ballymoney, about 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother escaped with her Protestant boyfriend, who
was beaten back by flames when he returned to try to rescue the
brothers, police said. There were reports the boys were being
raised as Protestants.
	   A photograph released by the family showed three impish little
boys in sweatshirts, Richard's grin revealing a wide gap in the
middle of his teeth.
	   Police said a demonstration was broken up shortly before the
attack outside the housing estate where the boys lived, and issued
an urgent appeal to anyone who might be able to identify individual
protesters.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' said Seamus Mallon, the
Catholic deputy first minister of the new Belfast Assembly. ``Does
it take one child, two children, three children?''
	   A hollow-eyed Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said he considered the boys' deaths a ``turning
point'' in the increasingly fractious standoff over the Orange
Order's stymied attempts to march down the predominantly Catholic
Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Mallon and David Trimble, the Belfast Assembly's first minister,
echoed a number of Protestant clergymen in calling for the
Orangemen at Portadown to ``immediately end their protest and to
return to their homes.''
	   And authorities counseled Catholics, who mostly had remained out
of the fray since the July 5 stalemate began, not to retaliate for
the boys' deaths.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said Trimble, head of the largest Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, urged
``mothers, fathers, sons and daughters'' to stay home Monday, one
of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant marching days, for the
sake of the province's fragile peace.
	   All Protestants and Catholics should ``think twice before they
exit their front doors,'' she said.
	   Belfast had turned into a ghost town and armored vehicles moved
in Sunday in anticipation of the Orangemen's Lower Ormeau Road
parade, second only to Portadown in its capacity to fuel sectarian
emotions.
	   The march _ and hundreds of others like it across the province _
commemorates the defeat of Catholic King James II by King William
of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   In North Belfast, authorities said an 18-year-old man was beaten
to death early Sunday. A motive had not been established, but
police said the area had experienced some of the worst sectarian
tension during this season's marching crisis.
	   In Ballymoney, which had escaped most of the violence this year,
griefstricken residents laid bouquets and stuffed animals outside
the blackened residence where Chrissy Quinn, the three boys'
mother, and boyfriend Raymond Craig had lived for only one week.
	   The couple had moved to the housing estate from another home in
this overwhelmingly Protestant town. It is not uncommon for
mixed-religion families to be targeted for attacks.
	   A Catholic funeral Mass was planned Tuesday morning for the
boys, parish priest Peter Forde said.
	   Forde said he twice visited the boys' mother, who was treated
for minor injuries received in the fire, and found her in a state
of deep shock.
	   ``She discharged herself,'' he said. ``The hospital didn't want
her to leave, but that wasn't their choice.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the uncompromising hard-line Protestant
leader, spoke with brimming emotion of the ``diabolical, hellish
deed'' that took the boys' lives. But most members of the
Protestant Orange Order disavowed any responsibility.
	   ``All the citizens of Northern Ireland are responsible because
of the situation we have found ourselves in over the years,''
Orange Order spokesman David Jones said.
	   Members of the Orange Order started negotiating through
intermediaries Saturday with the Catholic residents of Garvaghy
Road, but no progress was reported when the talks adjourned after
six hours.
	   Sunday, the government-appointed parades commission turned down
a second application from the Orangemen to march down the road and
it was not clear when the indirect talks between the opposing sides
would continue.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A quick look at Sunday's first stage of
the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: A first stage of 111.9 miles (180.5 kms) from Dublin's
suburb of Dundrum south along the Irish Sea coastline, inland
through the scenic Wicklow Mountains and back into Dublin's Phoenix
Park, home to Irish President Mary McAleese.
	   WINNER: Tom Steels of Belgium, riding for the No. 2-ranked
Italian Mapei-Bricobi team. He was expelled from the 1997 Tour
after throwing his water bottle at a competitor in the sixth stage.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Stays with British speed specialist Chris
Boardman of the French Gan team. He easily won Saturday's prologue
through downtown Dublin and finished 39th Sunday.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: In a sprinting 175-member pack credited
with the identical finishing time, Germany's Erik Zabel finished
second while his Telekom teammates _ last year's Tour champ Jan
Ullrich and 1996 winner Bjarne Riis _ finished 62nd and 48th,
respectively.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: The race started in Dundrum because that's the
hometown of Stephen Roche, who became Ireland's only Tour winner in
1987 and helped recruit this year's tour off the European
continent.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``It's a great relief to win the first stage,
because last year I grew more nervous each day without a win. ...
That's why I blew a fuse.'' Steels, explaining his bottle-throwing
outburst.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: Monday's stage two of 128 miles (205.5 kms) runs
along mostly flat, main roads from the southeast town of
Enniscorthy to the southwest port of Cork.

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Brazilian fans were given a momentary
scare before Sunday night's World Cup final when the official
lineups handed out one hour before kickoff initially did not
include two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo.
	   Edmundo and Bebeto were initially listed as the starting
strikers for Brazil, but within 15 minutes, World Cup officials
informed the media that the lineup was innacurate and Ronaldo would
be starting the game.
	   Ronaldo took part in Friday's training session without incident.
	   On Thursday, however, Ronaldo did not particpate in the regular
training session, opting instead for light laps around the field.
Brazilian team officials had earlier said Ronaldo was suffering
from a case of tendonitis in his left knee.

Twelve students killed by rebels in Burundi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 12 high school students
in a southern Burundi school, the state-run Burundi news agency
said Sunday.
	   The students were studying when a group of rebels armed with
guns, clubs and knives attack them in the school in Mabanda,
Makamba province, 90 kilometers (55 miles) southeast of Bujumbura,
the report said.
	   The news agency said the rebels belonged to the National Council
for the Defense of Democracy, the main rebel group in Burundi.
	   No other details about the latest attack were immediately
available.
	   The rebel group was represented at the recent all-party peace
talks on Burundi last month, but, like the government, has raised
doubts about its commitment to the cease-fire agreed to at the
talks.
	   The cease-fire is set to take effect no later than July 20, when
the second round of talks is supposed to begin.
	   The army said it was not bound by the cease-fire because its job
is to maintain peace. The rebel group said the person who signed
the accord in the group's name had no mandate to do so.

	   Scarborough, England (AP) _ Australia won the rain-affected
limited overs womens cricket international against England at
Scarborough on Sunday due to its superior run-rate.
	   Australia won the toss and elected to bat before rain restricted
each innings to 29 overs.
	   Australia scored 166 runs for the loss of five wickets and
England was 104 for seven in reply when the match was abandoned due
to rain.

	   PARIS (AP) _ They were singing the Marseillaise on the subway,
and perfect strangers were shouting joyful cheers and chants to
each other across crowded streets. And that was before the game.
	   Parisians got an early start Sunday for what could be their
biggest street parties since the Liberation, packing plazas,
avenues and boulevards by the thousands in anticipation of France's
dream World Cup final against Brazil.
	   Pulsing car horns echoed throughout the city all day. Strangers
shouted to each other on the Metro. The chants were heard
everywhere:
	   ``We're gonna win!''
	   ``Where are they, those Brazilians?''
	   And of course: ``Allez la France!''
	   At the ornate City Hall in downtown Paris, crowds already had
gathered at least eight hours before the match, just to get a good
seat in front of the giant screen set up in the plaza.
	   About a dozen youngsters began singing the Marseillaise,
France's national anthem, and everyone joined in.
	   ``This is the most exciting day, no matter what happens,'' said
Patrice DeCary, who came in from the northeastern town of Reims to
imbibe the Parisian atmosphere.
	   ``May the best team win,'' he said, although one could be
forgiven for thinking he felt otherwise: his face was painted the
red, white and blue stripes of French flag, and his entire body was
draped in one. For extra emphasis, his T-shirt listed all the names
of the French players.
	   The patriotic spirit was infectious. ``If you are proud to be
French, clap your hands!'' yelled the youths. Vincent Aigret, 20, a
student from Orleans, obliged. ``All of us together, all of us
together!'' he yelled back.
	   Young girls were also out in full force. Gwendoline Noblecourt,
10, said the French team was going to win 2-1. ``The French have
more spirit,'' she explained. ``Not just the men but the women,
too.''
	   Everybody said that after the game, they were going to one
place: the Champs-Elysees, already the scene of wild partying by
some 350,000 after France's semifinal win over Croatia Wednesday
night.
	   Hours before Sunday's final, thousands had already thronged the
huge avenue. With traffic partially blocked, city buses were
dumping passengers rather than try to get through.
	   Even the Foreign Legion was in a party mood, with one
Legionnaire dancing the samba on the sidewalk.
	   A sizable but discreet security operation was in place to police
the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at strategic points across
Paris.
	   At the Place de la Concorde, a golden labrador awaited the game
with his back painted _ what else _ like a French flag.
	   In the huge Chatelet subway station, a set of moving walkways
became the stage for a chanting contest between joyful gangs of
fans. Outside, cars with flags hanging outside their windows drew
cheers from cafe patrons sipping early-evening drinks.
	   The Brazilian fans were just as ebullient.
	   ``It's a great atmosphere, really fantastic,'' said Carlos
Souza, 30. ``The French have really learned how to make a party _
because we taught them!''
	   ``If the French win, we'll be guests at the party,'' he said.
``If we do, we'll throw the party and invite all the French people
to come.''
	   Outside the Stade de France, Brazilian and French fans argued
good-naturedly about their teams and star players.
	   ``Zidane is good but Ronaldo is better,'' Brazilian fan Eduardo
Souto told a group of French fans.
	   ``You're right,'' said French fan Marc Atahias. ``But we're
still gonna win.''
	   Whatever the outcome, ``Les Bleus'' _ the Blues _ were to parade
down the Champs-Elysees on an open-topped bus Monday afternoon.
	   But not all plans for the party came to fruition.
	   The Ministry of Culture canceled a proposal to cover the Arc de
Triomphe in a huge blue jersey after specialists said it would be
too complicated. Instead, the jersey will be hung from a nearby
building.

Schumacher wins confused British GP; third straight victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS throughout; adds new details; McLaren protest
turned down &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Not even Michael Schumacher was sure
if he'd won the British Grand Prix, which ended Sunday in a
confused mess when he veered into the pit lane at the end of the
final lap instead of taking the checkered flag.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari was leading by more than 20 seconds as he
roared around on the 60th and last lap. Just seconds from taking
the flag, he shockingly drove into the pits.
	   Mika Hakkinen, pursuing in his McLaren Mercedes, flashed across
the finish line. Television monitors showed Hakkinen had won. Then
they showed Schumacher had won.
	   In the pit, Schumacher climbed out of his car, gazed around for
a knowing clue, shrugged _ and then hugged team members signaling
he thought he'd won.
	   Schumacher did win, but he did it driving down the pit lane _
parallel to the track as he crossed the finish line _ a first for
even long-time F1 observers.
	   The mayhem took over three hours to sort out as McLaren
protested _ and lost _ and Formula One officials were silent about
explaining the bizarre finish.
	   Schumacher, under orders from his garage, came into the pit on
the final lap to take a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a
yellow caution flag.
	   But his lead of 22.4 seconds over Hakkinen was still large
enough to claim the win, 12.4 seconds ahead even after the penalty.
	   McLaren protested, saying that he should have taken the
10-second stop-go penalty during the final few laps _ not at the
end.
	   Under FIA rules, if a time penalty is imposed with fewer than 12
laps to finish, stewards may add the ``time penalty to the elapsed
time'' of the driver.
	   It wasn't immediately clear on what lap the penalty for passing
occurred.
	   Schumacher's average speed was 172.541 kph (107.217 mph) in a
time of 1 hour 47 minutes 12.450 seconds. Only nine of the 22 cars
finished in the deluge with third place for Ferrari's Eddie Irvine
followed by Alexander Wurz and Giancarlo Fisichella, both in
Benetton's.
	   ``I haven't seen yellow, but it wasn't easy to see anything at
certain stages,'' Schumacher said, describing a race run in
near-constant rain _ conditions where he always excels.
	   ``Maybe it was while I was following someone, I don't know. I
would like to know what was going on. I can't say anything about
this.''
	   ``This was not the result we expected,'' he added. ``But,
obviously, it is very satisfactory to be only two points down going
to the next race in Austria.''
	   The confusion was also historic.
	   The victory was Schumacher's third straight and moved him to
within two points of Hakkinen in the series standings _ 56 points
to 54. It was also his 31st career win, putting the 29-year-old
German into a third-place tie on the all-time F1 win list with
Nigel Mansell. Alain Prost has 51 and Ayrton Senna 41.
	   Hakkinen, who once had a 20-point lead in the series standings,
survived a spin that sent him pin-wheeling off the water-logged
track on the 42nd lap.
	   But he drove back on to hold the lead _ a spot he'd held from
the start off the pole position _ and was ahead 38 seconds when the
safety car pulled on to the track during the 44th lap.
	   After six laps behind the safety car, Hakkinen held his lead for
the 50th. But on the 51st, he went off a second time and when he
got back on the track again, Schumacher was ahead for good.
	   ``I'm never going to forget that one,'' Hakkinen said,
describing the first spin.
	   ``I was coming around the corner, it was probably one of the
worst moments on the track (for rain) and I wasn't going that
quick. I went around there and I just lost the back end and there
was nothing I could do about it.''
	   The second spin spelled doom, as he explained that the first had
left him driving a car with a damaged front end.
	   ``The second was caused because I had no aerodynamics in the
front end of the car,'' Hakkinen said. ``It (the car) just went
straight in the turn, absolutely straight.''
	   ``It is extremely disappointing. We were looking good until the
heavy rain came,'' he said.

Princess Diana's mother visits Prince Charles, Harry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's mother visited Prince Charles and
Prince Harry at their country home this weekend, Press Association
reported Sunday.
	   Prince Charles invited Frances Shand Kydd to visit when they met
recently in London, the national news agency said, adding that the
visit ``was said to have been a relaxed time'' and that Charles was
happy to see 13-year-old Harry getting on well with his
grandmother.
	   She went to Highgrove, the princes' estate in rural
Gloucestershire, early Friday and flew back to her home in Scotland
on Saturday.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd is an executor of the princess's will, in which
Diana expressed the wish that ``should I predecease my husband he
will consult with my mother with regard to the education and
welfare of our children.''
	   Charles is said to have consulted with his former mother-in-law
about the decision to send Prince Harry to Eton, where his older
brother, Prince William, 16, is at school.
	   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said last night: ``This is a
private matter, and we have nothing to say about it.''

Arafat invites Gadhafi to Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has invited
his Libyan counterpart, Moammar Gadhafi, to Jerusalem to head
Muslim prayers, Libyan television reported Sunday.
	   Jerusalem is home to al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest
shrine.
	   Gadhafi has accepted the invitation, Arafat said.
	   Arafat set no date for the visit. He has invited many Arab
leaders to pray in the mosque once Jerusalem becomes the capital of
a Palestinian state.
	   Arafat had vowed to declare a Palestinian state by 1999.
	   Arafat was in Libya to wish Gadhafi well after his surgery
Monday on a fractured bone near his hip.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited Libya on Thursday.
	   Mubarak flew to Libya after receiving U.N. approval to override
the air embargo imposed on the North African country in 1992.
	   The U.N. Security Council ordered the embargo to try and
pressure Gadhafi to turn over two Libyans wanted for the 1988
bombing of an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie
in which 270 people were killed.
	   Arafat crossed into Libya by car from Tunisia.

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Brazilian fans were given a momentary
scare before Sunday night's World Cup final when the official
lineups handed out one hour before kickoff initially did not
include two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo.
	   Edmundo and Bebeto were initially listed as the starting

informed the media that the lineup was inaccurate and Ronaldo would

	   The change, according to FIFA, had to do with Ronaldo having
experienced tendonitis in his left ankle and was taken to a
hospital earlier Sunday for X-rays.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo initially did not list Ronaldo
among his first 11, but apparently after receiving assurances from
doctors, placed him among his starting team.
	   Ronaldo took part in Friday's training session without incident.
	   On Thursday, however, Ronaldo did not participate in the regular

Brazilian team officials had earlier said Ronaldo was suffering

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats called for a new approach
to negotiating a solution for Kosovo, where the latest clashes
between Serb and Albanian forces claimed the lives of at least nine
people.
	   Two Serb policemen were killed when Albanian militants attacked
checkpoints along the province's main roads, the Serb Media Center
reported Sunday. The Kosovo Information Center reported seven
Albanians were wounded in a Serb attack on a village in the west of
the province.
	   In a statement released Sunday, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army said seven fighters were killed in weekend clashes
in Kosovo, where they are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   The KLA also called for the Albanians to unite and denounced the
``shameful bickering'' of politicians, which has also frustrated
international officials trying to organize talks between them and
the Yugoslav government.
	   In Bonn Sunday, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel telephoned
his Western counterparts to discuss the previous day's meeting with
Russia's Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, Kinkel's spokesman Martin
Erdmann said.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel
Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference like the Dayton peace accord
_ which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``Perhaps we need a process
that resembles the one that took place in Dayton,'' he told the
paper.
	   International officials are trying to prevent the violence from
spilling over into nieghboring countries with Albanian populations.
	   In Kosovo Sunday, both sides reported fresh clashes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said seven Albanians were wounded
in a ``strong attack by Serb forces'' on the village of Streoc, 75
kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Pristina, Sunday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said one policeman had been
killed and another wounded when Albania militants attacked the Serb
checkpoint at Streoc, along the Pec-Decane road. Another policeman
was killed in a separate attack on another checkpoint in western
Kosovo, the center said. No independent confirmation for any of the
reports was available.
	   Earlier Saturday, Serb forces launched an attack on the village
of Lodja, outside of Kosovo's second-largest city Pec in western
Kosovo, independent sources reported. Albanian sources said a
78-year-old Albanian man was killed and three others were wounded
in Lodja, but police failed to recapture the village.
	   Lodja is a KLA stronghold and a reputed center for weapons
smuggling from Albania.
	   On Sunday there were independent reports of sporadic shooting
and a reinforcement of both sides' barricades near Pec.
	   Also Sunday, the Kosovo Information Center said the KLA had
handed over three Yugoslav army deserters to an international
humanitarian organization. The report, which could not be
independently confirmed, did not say which humanitarian
organization was involved or where the handover took place.
	   The three were handed over late Saturday and were all from
Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. The KLA
still holds more deserters, most are believed to be Muslims, the
center said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.

Brazil faces France for World Cup title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France kicked off the 16th World Cup against Brazil
on Sunday, creating a chance after only 34 seconds when Stephane
Guivarc'h sent a scissors kick over the bar.
	   Unlike most of the tournament, the game started under clear
skies and pleasantly warm temperatures before a capacity crowd of
80,000 at the Stade de France.
	   Brazil was seeking an unprecedented fifth World Cup title while
France was looking for its first.
	   The only alteration in either team's starting lineups was the
insertion of defender Frank Leboeuf for France. Leboeuf was playing
for the suspended Laurent Blanc, who was ejected from France's
semifinal for a tackle on Croatia's Slaven Bilic.

Five Russian peacekeepers killed in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Five Russian peacekeepers were killed
and five injured Sunday night when their military transport set off
a land mine in the separatist region of Abkhazia, officials said.
	   A spokesman at the government press center said the mine was
probably planted by Abkhazian separatists in the Ghali region of
Abkhazia, where the Russian peacekeepers are stationed.
	   Russia deployed peacekeepers in 1994 to separate Georgian
government troops and Abkhazian separatist forces following a
13-month war.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dancing, singing and drinking, thousands
of Croatian soccer fans toasted their team's return Sunday in a
continuation of wild celebrations that followed their 2-1 victory
over the Netherlands to clinch the World Cup bronze.
	   The win sent the country into delirium Saturday. Fans covered in
strips of the national red-white-and-blue set off fireworks, took
dips in prominent city fountains and danced on hoods of cars
honking their horns throughout the country's major towns.
	   It was the first time a debutante country had reached such
heights in the World Cup since Portugal took the bronze in 1966,
and a perhaps the biggest sporting success of the young nation.
	   Davor Suker, who scored the winning goal against the Dutch, gave
his compatriots additional reason to cheer. His goal also vaulted
the Real Madrid striker atop the tournament's list for top scorer,
with six goals and a likely chance at snapping the Golden Boot.
	   The closest contender still in the chase is Brazilian ace
Ronaldo. He needs to put away three goals in Sunday's final against
hosts France if he is to deny Suker the award.
	   Still giddy from the previous night's festivities, thousands
were on hand to greet their heroes at the capital's airport in
Zagreb Sunday.
	   When the players mounted a stage sporting medals around their
necks and smiles stretched from ear to ear, a wild roar swept
through the crowd.
	   Bands played triumphant tunes, a giant screen kept spinning
highlights of the World Cup and a chanting, whistling and
flag-waving mania raved on into the night, shouting ``Davor
Suker!'' ``Croatia, Croatia,'' and ``We are the Champions.''
	   The celebrations almost slipped into mayhem as emotions peaked
and fans wanted to get closer to their stars. Captain Zvonimir
Boban had to appeal to the audience to settle.
	   Paramedics had their hands full tending to squashed or fainted
people in the crowd and even players on stage had to help pluck out
swooning fans.
	   ``Bronze has the same shine as gold for us,'' said Damir
Bagovic, a surgeon who joined in on the fray with his two daughters
clad in the trademark red-and-white checks.
	   After greeting their fans, President Franjo Tudjman received the
team, presenting them with medals of honor.
	   ``Your magnificent success is a great boon for the country's
image in the eyes of the world,'' Tudjman, an ardent soccer fan,
told the team.
	   Croatia's World Cup exploit ranks high up in the nations'
sporting history, perhaps even at the pinnacle itself. Since
winning independence in 1991, the young nation has, however,
produced winners in tennis, basketball and now soccer.
	   ``We're a small country but we've got big sporting stars,'' said
Kristian, an unusually tall 13 year-old fan _ with hopes to be a
top athlete in the making.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has invited
Moammar Gadhafi to Jerusalem to head Muslim prayers, Libyan
television reported Sunday.
	   The Libyan leader has accepted the invitation, Arafat said.
	   The possibility that Gadhafi could visit any time soon is,
however, remote.
	   Arafat has invited many Arab leaders to pray in the al-Aqsa
mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, once Jerusalem becomes the
capital of a Palestinian state.
	   Arafat had vowed to declare a Palestinian state by 1999, but
Israel, which seized predominantly Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war, has said it will never relinquish sovereignty over
the entire city.

Schumacher wins confused British GP; third straight victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; UPDATES with McLaren to appeal; changes Schumacher's
winning time, average speed and margin of victory &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Not even Michael Schumacher was sure
he'd won the British Grand Prix.
	   It ended Sunday in a confused mess before 90,000 fans, which
took more than three hours to decipher when Schumacher veered into
the pit in the final seconds of the last lap instead of taking the
checkered flag.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari was leading by more than 20 seconds as he
roared around on the 60th and final lap. Just moments from taking
the flag, he shockingly drove into the pits.
	   Mika Hakkinen, pursuing in his McLaren Mercedes, flashed across
the finish line. Television monitors showed Hakkinen had won. Then
they showed Schumacher had won.
	   In the pit, Schumacher climbed out of his car, gazed around for
a knowing clue, shrugged _ and then hugged team members signaling
victory.
	   Schumacher did win, but he did it driving down the pit lane _
parallel to the track as he crossed the finish line _ a first for
even long-time F1 observers.
	   During the ensuing mayhem, McLaren protested _ and lost _ as
Formula One officials were virtualy silent about explaining the
bizarre finish.
	   McLaren later appealed the decision and has seven days to
confirm it with the sport's governing body, the FIA.
	   Schumacher, under orders from his garage, came into the pit on
the final lap to take a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a
yellow caution flag.
	   McLaren protested, saying that he should have taken the
10-second stop-go penalty during the final few laps _ not at the
end.
	   Formula One officials _ eventually admitting an error by race
stewards _ threw out the protest on a technicality, saying Ferrari
wasn't notified about the penalty for 30 minutes and, therefore,
couldn't impose it until the end.
	   ``Under the circumstances, the time penalty imposed cannot apply
and is therefore rescinded,'' a statement said.
	   Schumacher's average speed was 172.810 kph (107.384 mph) in a
time of 1 hour 47 minutes 02.450 seconds _ 22.465 ahead of
Hakkinen.
	   Only nine of the 22 cars finished in the deluge with third place
for Ferrari's Eddie Irvine followed by Alexander Wurz and Giancarlo
Fisichella, both in Benetton's.
	   ``I haven't seen yellow, but it wasn't easy to see anything at
certain stages,'' Schumacher said, describing a race run in
near-constant rain _ conditions where he always excels.
	   ``Maybe it was while I was following someone, I don't know. I
would like to know what was going on. I can't say anything about
this.''
	   ``This was not the result we expected,'' he added. ``But,
obviously, it is very satisfactory to be only two points down going
to the next race in Austria.''
	   The confusion was also historic.
	   The victory was Schumacher's third straight and moved him to
within two points of Hakkinen in the series standings _ 56 points
to 54. It was also his 31st career win, putting the 29-year-old
German into a third-place tie on the all-time F1 win list with
Nigel Mansell. Alain Prost has 51 and Ayrton Senna 41.
	   Hakkinen, who once had a 20-point lead in the series standings,
survived a spin that sent him pin-wheeling off the water-logged
track on the 42nd lap.
	   But he drove back on to hold the lead _ a spot he'd held from
the start off the pole position _ and was ahead 38 seconds when the
safety car pulled on to the track during the 44th lap.
	   After six laps behind the safety car, Hakkinen held his lead for
the 50th. But on the 51st, he went off a second time and when he
got back on the track again, Schumacher was ahead for good.
	   ``I'm never going to forget that one,'' Hakkinen said,
describing the first spin.
	   ``I was coming around the corner, it was probably one of the
worst moments on the track (for rain) and I wasn't going that
quick. I went around there and I just lost the back end and there
was nothing I could do about it.''
	   The second spin spelled doom, as he explained that the first had
left him driving a car with a damaged front end.
	   ``The second was caused because I had no aerodynamics in the
front end of the car,'' Hakkinen said. ``It (the car) just went
straight in the turn, absolutely straight.''
	   ``It is extremely disappointing. We were looking good until the
heavy rain came,'' he said.

Rubin signs incentive agreement between U.S. and Ivory Coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
signed an investment incentive pact with the Ivory Coast on Sunday,
a move that follows with the Clinton administration's push for
greater U.S. involvement in Africa.
	   The agreement signed also by Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel
Kablan Duncan aims to simplify investment procedures in the Ivory
Coast for potential U.S. investors.
	   ``We will do our best to improve the situation in Cote d'Ivoire
in order to attract more U.S. companies,'' said Duncan, who used
the French name for his country.
	   The United States is trying to encourage more private sector
investment in the Ivory Coast, but this West African country's
developing justice system often creates barriers to free and fair
investment.
	   Investors in the past have complained they have little
protection from arbitrary regulation and corrupt government
officials.
	   Rubin lauded the agreement, saying it would help encourage
investment.
	   ``It represents the commitment by the government of Cote
d'Ivoire to a market economy,'' he said.
	   The Ivory Coast is the first leg of a four-country visit to
Africa by Rubin. After the Ivory Coast the treasury secretary will
head to South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique and Kenya.
	   Looking ahead to his week-long Africa trip, Rubin said he plans
to focus on economic conditions, developing financial markets,
attracting private capital, and promoting greater regionalization.

Germany retains title in three-day regatta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defending champion Germany put
together three victories on the Rotsee lake Sunday to win the
Lucerne regatta and the overall World Cup in rowing.
	   Germany, which came to Lucerne with a slim five-point advantage
over Britain, pushed its season point total to 137, ahead of
Britain at 112 and Denmark at 93.
	   Germany's victories were in the lightweight men's double sculls,
the men's eight and the women's quadruple sculls. Denmark and Italy
won two boat classes with the other seven divided among Australia,
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia and Switzerland.
	   The British coxless four of quadruple Olympic gold medalist
Steve Redgrave, double gold medalist Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster
and James Cracknell returned to the top of the World Cup podium.
	   The world champion boat lost their unbeaten record at the first
World Cup regatta of the season in Munich six weeks ago when Foster
was ruled out of the crew after severing tendons in his right hand.
	   A strong challenge was expected from the new fast young
Australian four, which won the second regatta of the series and was
unbeaten this season. Also in the race was the Romanian crew that
defeated the British in Munich
	   Tension grew as the race was delayed for 90 minutes after the
Norwegian crew broke their rudder line while lining up for the
start.
	   When the race eventually got underway, the British four stormed
off the start, opening up an immediate lead and were nearly three
seconds clear of Romania by half way.
	   The expected Australian challenge never materialized and the
British put in a powerful final burst to come home more than a
length clear in 6 minutes 26.40 seconds.
	   ``It's nice to be back in the boat,'' said Foster. ``It was hard
to watch these guys in Munich, probably as bad as it was racing
it.''
	   The Danish Olympic world champion lightweight coxless four of
Thomas Ebert, Thomas Poulsen, Eskild Ebbsen and Victor Feddersen
extended their unique unbeaten World Cup winning run. Their victory
in Lucerne made them the first crew to achieve a clean sweep of the
three event series for two successive years.
	   ``Mentally it gets more difficult for us with every victory,''
said Feddersen. ``We were very nervous, and it is wonderful to
win.''
	   Russia's new sculling sensation Irina Fedotova was the only
other to score maximum points in this year's World Cup. She led
from the start to complete her hat trick of World Cup victories in
her first season racing in the single scull.
	   Olympic champion Xeno Mueller of Switzerland powered through
from a slow start, which left him in fourth place, to win the men's
single sculls.
	   But he was pushed all the way to the line by New Zealand's Rob
Waddell, racing in his first international regatta of the year, who
finished just inches behind in one of the closest races of the day.
	   Prize money, in the form of travel reimbursement grants, was
awarded for the first time this season and the German team took
home a total of 20,550 Swiss francs (dlrs 13,700).

World Cup: Zidane headers give France 2-0 halftime lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Zinedine Zidane headed host France
into a 2-0 halftime lead over defending champion and four-time
titlist Brazil in the World Cup final Sunday.
	   The Juventus star, who also tormented the Brazilian defense with
his imaginative moves and passes, headed home Emmanuel Petit's 27th
minute corner as the French were rewarded for some enterprising and
skilful first half play.
	   And, in the final minute of the first half, he met a rightwing
corner from Youri Djorkaeff to duck and head the second at the near
post.
	   The French almost made a sensational start to the final when
Didier Deschamps fired a long ball forwards from deep in his own
half and Stephane Guivarc'h held off a challenge from Junior Baiano
before trying an audacious overhead shot over the top.
	   In the fourth minute, Youri Djorkaeff slipped a neat ball
through to Zidane who did well to lay it off to Guivarc'h in front
of the Brazilian goal. Guivarc'h only had 'keeper Taffarel to beat
from 12 meters (yards) but lost control and Junior Baiano's
challenge ensure his shot was both weak and inaccurate.
	   The French had another chance in the seventh minute when Zidane
swung in a free kick from the left. Djorkaeff and Guivarc'h were
both unchallenged as they went for the ball at the near post but
the Djorkaeff got his shoulder rather than his head to the ball and
the Brazilians were relieved to see the effort go tamely wide.
	   Brazil's first attempt at goal was an ambitious 30-meter angled
shot from Roberto Carlos which landed on the top of the French goal
with 'keeper Fabien Barthez scrambling back.
	   Ronaldo, who was pulled from the initial Brazilian starting
lineup because of tendonitis trouble but reinstated only 45 minutes
before kickoff, had few moments to shine in the opening 20 minutes.
	   But he sprang into life in the 22nd minute by dribbling past
Lilian Thuram down the left and sending over a teasing cross which
Barthez struggled to hold underneath the crossbar.
	   But the French came back to take the lead in the 27th minute
after Roberto Carlos needlessly conceded a corner.
	   Emmanuel Petit curled in the flag kick from the right hand side
and Zidane climbed above Leonardo at the near post to head
powerfully downwards and past Taffarel.
	   Three minutes before halftime, the French went close to
increasing the lead when the the ball broke to Petit in front of
goal but hit shot was deflected into the sidenetting.
	   Taffarel made a stunning reflex save from the unmarked Guivarc'h
and then came Zidane's second to put the Brazilians under huge
pressure for the second half.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Aldair, Junior Baiano, Roberto Carlos;
Leonardo, Cesar Sampaio, Dunga, Rivaldo; Ronaldo, Bebeto.
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram; Frank Leboeuf, Marcel
Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu, Didier Deschamps,
Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Youri Djorkaeff, Stephane
Guivarc'h.

Arafat invites Gadhafi to Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has invited
Moammar Gadhafi to Jerusalem to head Muslim prayers, Libyan
television reported Sunday.
	   The Libyan leader has accepted the invitation, Arafat said.
However, the possibility of Gadhafi visiting any time soon is
remote.
	   Arafat has invited many Arab leaders to pray in the al-Aqsa
mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, once Jerusalem becomes the
capital of a Palestinian state.
	   Arafat has vowed to declare a Palestinian state by 1999. But
Israel, which seized predominantly Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war, has said it will never relinquish sovereignty over
any part of the holy city.
	   Arafat was in Libya to wish Gadhafi well after his surgery
Monday on a fractured bone near his hip.

Diplomats call for new approach as fighting continues in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA handing over Serb deserters. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats worked Sunday to find a
new approach to resolving the crisis in Kosovo, where weekend
clashes claimed the lives of at least nine people.
	   Two Serb policemen were killed when ethnic Albanian militants
attacked checkpoints along the province's main roads, the Serb
Media Center reported Sunday. The Kosovo Information Center, which
is close to moderate ethnic Albanian leaders, reported seven
Albanians were wounded in a Serb attack on a western village.
	   In a statement released Sunday, the militant Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army said seven fighters were killed in weekend clashes.
	   The KLA, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, also
called for the Albanians to unite and denounced the ``shameful
bickering'' of politicians, which has also frustrated international
officials trying to organize talks between them and the Yugoslav
government.
	   In Bonn Sunday, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel telephoned
his Western counterparts to discuss the previous day's meeting with
Russia's Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, a spokesman said.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel
Sunday, Kinkel hinted at a conference similar to the one that
resulted in the Dayton peace accord, which ended the Bosnian war in
1995. ``Perhaps we need a process that resembles the one that took
place in Dayton,'' he told the paper.
	   International officials are trying to prevent the violence from
spilling over into neighboring countries with Albanian populations,
including Albania and Macedonia.
	   In Kosovo Sunday, both sides reported new clashes.
	   On Sunday there were independent reports of sporadic shooting
and a reinforcement of both sides' barricades near Pec, the
second-largest city in western Kosovo. Serb forces on Saturday had
tried to take the nearby village of Lodga, a KLA stronghold and
reputed center for weapons smuggling from Albania. But the Serbs
failed to recapture the village.
	   A 78-year-old Albanian man was killed in the fighting at Lodga,
Albanian sources said.
	   Also Sunday, the Kosovo Information Center said the KLA had
handed over three Yugoslav army deserters to an international
humanitarian organization. The report, which could not be
independently confirmed, did not say which humanitarian
organization was involved or where the handover took place.
	   The three were handed over late Saturday and were all from
Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. The KLA
still holds more deserters, the center said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.

Orange Order rejects pleas to stand back after boys' deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Orange Order saying confrontation will continue

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three young brothers who had
been asleep in their beds burned to death early Sunday in a
sectarian attack marking what shaken Northern Ireland leaders
termed a ``turning point'' in a violent stalemate over a blocked
Protestant march.
	   The marchers, however, rejected calls _ some from within their
own ranks _ to back off from their confrontation with police and
soldiers near a rural church.
	   A neighbor reported hearing 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason Quinn screaming as fire gutted their residence
in Ballymoney, about 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother escaped with her Protestant boyfriend, who
was beaten back by flames when he returned to try to rescue the
brothers, police said. There were reports the boys were being
raised as Protestants.
	   A photograph released by the family showed three impish little
boys in sweatshirts, Richard's grin revealing a wide gap in the
middle of his teeth.
	   Police said a demonstration was broken up shortly before the
attack outside the housing estate where the boys lived, and issued
an urgent appeal to anyone who might be able to identify individual
protesters.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' said Seamus Mallon, the
Catholic deputy first minister of the new Belfast Assembly. ``Does
it take one child, two children, three children?''
	   Following a meeting of Orange leaders, the Orangemen whose
parade was stopped a week ago said they would continue the standoff
outside Portadown ``indefinitely.''
	   Earlier, a hollow-eyed Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, had said he considered the boys' deaths a ``turning
point'' in the increasingly fractious standoff over the Orange
Order's stymied attempts to march down the predominantly Catholic
Garvaghy Road in Portadown.

Only in France: super models kick off World Cup final

<TEXT>
	   Paris (AP) _ Only in France, and Yves Saint Laurent did it. The
couturier warmed up the Stade de France Sunday night with 300
models strutting his best stuff across the field less than two
hours before France and Brazil tangled in the World Cup final.
	   There was Carla Bruni in her white winged ``Peace Dove'' outfit
from a 1988 collection, and Mounia, a favorite YSL model, in a
full-skirted satin gown from the designer's 1976 Ballets Russes
period.
	   To the tune of Ravel's Bolero, the super models, walking on a
blue tarpaulin spread over the pitch, celebrated the supermen who
were to follow, as well as the 40 years as a couturier for Saint
Laurent, 61.
	   The 20-minute show gave a touch of glamor, French-style, to the
high-tech stadium in Saint Denis built especially for the World
Cup.
	   It was French Soccer Federation President Michel Platini who
suggested mixing fashion and soccer for the final match, according
to Pierre Berge, who directs the Saint Laurent fashion house.
	   Spectators were treated to glimpses of Saint Laurent's past
creations -- clothes whose inspirations came from the world's five
continents.
	   Part of the fun was seeing girls like Adriana, fiancee of French
soccer player Christian Karembeu, parading in a black two-piece
navel-revealing Scheherezade-style outfit from the 1990 summer
collection.
	   Former models also were present: Katoucha in a cubist,
Picasso-inspired silk dress, Laetitia Casta in a bird of paradise
dress.
	   Others wore Sahara-jacket outfits, some famous tuxedo looks as
only Saint Laurent can make them. There were bare-breasted outfits
with feathers, slinky dresses with sculptural details and pure
romance.

<TEXT>
	   ANSE BERTRAND, Guadeloupe (AP) _ Marie-Anna Thuram wanted the
best for her children. So she left behind the back-breaking job
cutting sugar cane on an idyllic-looking Caribbean island to seek
her fortune in France.
	   Today, many of France's hopes for a World Cup championship
depend on one of her sons, Lilian Thuram.
	   A banner hanging from a telephone pole in their native village _
in a seaside area of modest homes and palm and breadfruit trees set
along the azure Caribbean Sea _ urges: ``Allez (Go) Thuram! Vive la
France!''
	   The gap between the black citizens of France's far-flung
Caribbean provinces and the residents of Paris has been temporarily
bridged by the heady possibility of France winning its first World
Cup finals victory.
	   Three of the team's players are of Guadeloupian descent _
Thierry Henry, Leonard Diomede and Lilian Thuram, who scored the
two goals that took France into the finals.
	   The star player's cousin, Joel Thuram, is quick to point out
that there are only ``three real Frenchmen'' on the team, though he
is adamant that even as an islander he is ``as French as any
metropolitan (person).'' The contradiction perhaps best describes
the sometimes difficult relationship between the mainland and the
former colonies.
	   ``The metropole'' here means mainland France. Metropolitans
tends to mean white French people. Negropolitans is the word used,
not without some negative connotations, to describe islanders who
have lived in mainland France most of their lives.
	   After World War II, the French government made a number of
islands French territory, granting the residents all the privileges
of people born in France. These areas included Guadeloupe and
Martinique in the Caribbean, Reunion off the east coast of Africa
and Guiana in South America.
	   A small and once-fiery independence movement has made no headway
here. Some bombings in the 1980s drew some attention to the cause,
which now plays a small part in island politics.
	   ``We all dream of going to the metropole, at least once. But
those who are there dream of coming back home,'' said Joel Thuram.
	   But not Lilian Thuram's mother, who is happy to be on the
mainland, according to her sister-in-law Charlotte Thurman.
	   Maria-Anna and Charlotte began working in the cane fields after
they both bore their eldest children in the 1960s, Charlotte said.
After nearly 20 years, struggling to work and raise five children
as a single mother, Maria-Anna went to Paris on what is considered
a domestic flight.
	   Despite the many differences that separate them, on Sunday
French citizens on both sides of the Atlantic cheered as her son
took the field, and French soccer fans were united, if only for a
little while.

Despite new hopes, long and bumpy road seen to peace in Colombia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Colombia-Rebels &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ When President-elect Andres Pastrana
ducked his sleeping bodyguards to make a historic mountain
rendezvous with Colombia's top guerrilla leader, he made peace look
easy.
	   The dashing move last week, just days before talks began Sunday
in Mainz, Germany, with the country's No. 2 rebel faction, inspired
Colombians hoping for an end to the nation's 34-year civil war.
	   But that's the very expectation some political leaders are
warning against.
	   Peace may finally be in the works, they agree, but the road will
be long and bumpy, and will test the nation's resolve.
	   ``It will require enormous discipline on the part of Colombian
society ... to speak with caution, to work with reserve and
discretion and to accept that negotiations will be lengthy and
include moments of crisis and fragility,'' said Javeriana
University political analyst Ernesto Borda.
	   Many observers believe war-fatigue and mounting pressure from
the international community will draw the parties together.
	   At the talks Sunday in Germany, Colombian civic leaders met with
envoys from the second-largest rebel group, the 5,000-member
National Liberation Army, known by its Spanish initials ELN.
	   The talks are in preparation for direct talks between Pastrana
and the rebels. Neither side has made any statements.
	   The key question mark for peace, however, is the nation's
largest rebel faction, which is not present in Germany _ the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   Pastrana's early-morning meeting with FARC chief Manuel
Marulanda, in which the two agreed to begin peace talks within 90
days of Pastrana's August 7 inauguration, was a sudden and
startling step.
	   Still, many wonder why the rebels would call it quits.
	   Under outgoing President Ernesto Samper, they shunned talks
while taking the upper hand against a dispirited army, gaining
political influence over the nearly half the national territory
they control.
	   And while the end of the Cold War helped drive other Latin
American guerrillas towards peace by drying up their external
funding, the Colombian rebels grew richer by increasing their
involvement in lucrative kidnappings and the drug trade.
	   ``Peace is not just around the corner,'' said political analyst
Alfredo Rangel, an expert on the guerrillas who expects both sides
to intensify fighting even as they talk of reconciliation.
	   Rangel believes FARC may be using negotiations to gain political
legitimacy, while still harboring hopes of taking power by force.
	   Once formal peace talks get under way, observers say, they will
tackle rebel demands for land reform and a crackdown on what the
guerrillas see as foreign exploitation of Colombia's oil reserves.
	   Another contentious issue will be the fate of the right-wing
paramilitary groups who have risen to combat the rebels, killing
civilians they suspect are guerrilla supporters.
	   Rebels demand the militia members be jailed, but the
paramilitary leaders refuse to disarm before the guerrillas and may
also demand a seat at the peace table.

PARIS: Patrick Vieira.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Vieira's insertion appeared to work, as Brazil continued to
struggle to create chances. As Brazil pushed forward, France also
was able to occasionally spring free in midfield. Dugarry got
behind the defense in the 83rd and closed on Taffarel alone but
shot wide.

Zanardi wins third straight CART race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Alex Zanardi, trying to decide if he will race
on the CART or Formula One circuits next year, strengthened his
bargaining position Sunday by easily winning the Medic Drug Grand
Prix of Cleveland.
	   The Italian driver enjoyed his third straight CART victory and
won for the fifth time in 10 races.
	   The outcome on the 2.106-mile (3.39-kilometer), 10-turn
temporary road course at the downtown Burke Lakefront Airport
allowed the defending series champion to revel again in his
post-victory ``donuts'' celebration _ spinning his car round and
round in one place, with smoke boiling off the tires.
	   Asked if he was making ``donuts'' because he was excited or
because the crowd expects it, Zanardi said: ``It may look a little
over the line to some people when I do these donuts, but I still do
it because it's fun and people still ask me to do it.''
	   Zinardi, who led 68 of 100 laps, is in the midst of negotiations
that will determine if he remains in the CART FedEx Champion Series
or returns to Formula One in 1999.
	   Dario Franchitti finished third, followed by Scott Pruett,
Adrian Fernandez, Gil de Ferran and Jimmy Vasser.
	   The victory raised Zanardi's lead over second-place Greg Moore
from 38 to 59 points in the season standings.
	   Last year, Zanardi was penalized twice during the Cleveland race
_ once for running over an air hose and the other for entering a
closed pit _ and came charging back from 22nd to win.
	   He started third on the 28-car grid and was up to second before
the cars hit the first turn of the race. Zanardi then put the
pressure on the pole-winner _ Vasser, his Target Chip-Ganassi
Racing teammate who never led by as much as a full second.
	   Unfortunately for Vasser, his gearbox broke before he had
completed a lap in the morning warmup, and the team had to change
his engine.
	   In doing so, an electrical connection was missed and Vasser was
forced to use the clutch on the floorboard instead of shifting with
an electronic button on the steering wheel _ a disadvantage,
particularly in traffic.
	   The first of three full-course caution flags came out on lap 12
when Moore spun and stopped in the middle of the track. His car was
struck by Michel Jourdain, Helio Castro-Neves and J.J. Lehto,
eliminating all four from the race.
	   On the ensuing restart, Zanardi slipped past Vasser to take the
lead on lap 12. While Vasser fell back into the field, Zanardi, who
now has 13 career victories, built his lead to more than nine
seconds before another caution flew on lap 27 after Mauricio
Gugelmin spun and Dennis Vitolo stopped on course in separate
incidents.
	   All of the leaders took advantage of the caution to make their
first schedule pit stop. Paul Tracy, who had been running second,
tagged the rear of Al Unser Jr.'s car as they left the pits,
sending Unser, who had been fourth, spinning. He came out of the
pits 20th.

	   Again the crowd broke into a chorus of La Marseillaise as the
seconds ticked down.
	   Petit started the celebration just over two minutes into injury
time, breaking in on Taffarel and scoring from 10 meters.
	   Belqola blew his whistle, and France had won its first World Cup
3-0.

SAINT-DENIS: beaten team.

<TEXT>
	   Zidane's first came when Petit curled in the flag kick from the
right hand side after a blunder by Roberto Carlos and Zidane
climbed above Leonardo at the near post to head powerfully
downwards and past Taffarel.
	   The second was in first half injury time when Djorkaeff drove a
leftwing corner towards the near post and the Juventus midfielder
darted in to head between Taffarel and the near post once again.
	   The French had to defend its two-goal lead without star defender
Marcel Desailly for the last 22 minutes. The center-back, who had
superbly kept the Brazilian strikeforce quiet, was expelled for his
second yellow card.
	   But Aime Jacquet's team still created the best chances of the
game and Stephane Guivarc'h squandered three opportunities with
goalkeeper Taffarel to beat.
	   Ronaldo, who was pulled from the initial Brazilian starting
lineup because of tendonitis trouble but reinstated only 45 minutes
before kickoff, should have scored for Brazil in the 56th when he
had only French 'keeper Fabien Barthez to beat from close range but
shot straight at him.
	   Although Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo sent on strikers Denilson
and Edmundo to make it a four-man attack in the last 16 minutes of
the game, the French held on to become the first host to clinch the
title since Argentina in 1978.
	   With Brazil attacking non-stop, the French broke away again in
injury time and Petit took a ball out left and fired low past
Taffarel for the third.

France wins World Cup with 3-0 victory over Brazil

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Two first half headers by Zinedine
Zidane and a late strike by Emmanuel Petit gave France its first
World Cup win Sunday on a 3-0 upset victory over defending champion
and four-time titlist Brazil.
	   Zidane headed the first in the 27th minute from Petit's leftwing
corner and his second came in the final minute of the first half
this time from a rightwing corner from Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Petit added the third on a breakaway in second half injury time
with Brazil already a beaten team.
	   The French, playing their first ever final, had to defend its
two-goal lead without star defender Marcel Desailly for the last 22
minutes. The center-back, who had superbly kept the Brazilian
strikeforce quiet, was expelled for his second yellow card.
	   But Aime Jacquet's team still created the best chances of the
game and Stephane Guivarc'h squandered three opportunities with
goalkeeper Taffarel to beat.
	   The French almost made a sensational start to the final when
Didier Deschamps fired a long ball forwards from deep in his own
half and Stephane Guivarc'h held off a challenge from Junior Baiano
before trying an audacious overhead shot over the top.
	   In the fourth minute, Djorkaeff slipped a neat ball through to
Zidane who did well to lay it off to Guivarc'h in front of the
Brazilian goal. Guivarc'h only had 'keeper Taffarel to beat from 12
meters (yards) but lost control and Junior Baiano's challenge
ensured his shot was both weak and inaccurate.
	   The French had another chance in the seventh minute when Zidane
swung in a free kick from the left. Djorkaeff and Guivarc'h were
both unchallenged as they went for the ball at the near post but
Djorkaeff got his shoulder rather than his head to the ball and the
Brazilians were relieved to see the effort go tamely wide.
	   Ronaldo, who was pulled from the initial Brazilian starting
lineup because of tendonitis trouble but reinstated only 45 minutes
before kickoff, sprang into life in the 22nd minute. He dribbled
past Lilian Thuram down the left and sent over a teasing cross
which Barthez struggled to hold underneath the crossbar.
	   But the French came back to take the lead in the 27th minute
after Roberto Carlos needlessly conceded a corner and got a telling
off from Moroccan referee Said Belqola for angrily kicking the
corner flag in frustration.
	   Petit curled in the flag kick from the right hand side and
Zidane climbed above Leonardo at the near post to head powerfully
downwards and past Taffarel.
	   Three minutes before halftime, the French went close to
increasing the lead when the the ball broke to Petit in front of
goal but hit shot was deflected into the sidenetting.
	   Taffarel made a stunning reflex save from the unmarked Guivarc'h
and Djorkaeff drove another corner towards the near post where
Zidane ducked to head inside the post and put the Brazilians under
huge pressure for the second half.
	   Wily Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo sent on Denilson for Leonardo
for the second half but it was Ronaldo who had a great chance to
pull a goal back 11 minutes into the second half.
	   A leftwing cross from Roberto Carlos dropped to the Inter star
at the far post and, although he got clear of a defender, his
well-struck, close-range shot was held by Barthez.
	   A blunder by the French 'keeper set up another chance in the
60th minute when he ran to almost the edge of his area and flapped
at a long throw from Roberto Carlos. The ball dropped to Bebeto
whose shot was on target but Desailly was back to clear with
Barthez nowhere near his goal.
	   Guivarc'h should have scored a third for France in the 63rd when
he pounced on Cafu's weak back header but shot over the top with
only Taffarel to beat.
	   France replaced Christian Karembeu with Alain Boghossian and
sent on Christophe Dugarry for Guivarc'h.
	   But the host was down to 10 players in the 67th minute when
Desailly, its best defender in the game, was shown the red card for
his second caution of the match when he scythed down Cafu. Desailly
received his first early in the second half for dissent.
	   Zagallo's last throw was to send on striker Edmundo for
midfielder Cesar Sampaio with 16 minutes to go and Aime Jacquet
responded by taking off striker Djorkaeff and replacing him with
midfielder Patrick Vieira.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Aldair, Junior Baiano, Roberto Carlos;
Leonardo (Denilson, 46th), Cesar Sampaio (Edmundo, 74th), Dunga,
Rivaldo; Ronaldo, Bebeto.
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram; Frank Leboeuf, Marcel
Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu (Alain Boghossian,
57th), Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Youri
Djorkaeff (Patrick Vieira, 76th), Stephane Guivarc'h (Christophe
Dugarry, 65th).
	   Referee _ Said Belqola, Morocco.

World Cup: France's finest Glory Day arrives with Zidane as
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: WILL BE UPDATED with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac had
the right premonition. Coach Aime Jacquet had the right analysis.
	   The result sounded like a dream to an elated nation of 60
million: France 3, Brazil 0 _ La France Champion du Monde. With
panace to spare.
	   Chirac has predicted all along he would hand the World Cup to
captain Didier Deschamps. Jacquet said all along France would only
win if it was powered by the genius of Zinedine Zidane.
	   Playmaker Zidane scored on two headers in the first half, ran
the Brazilians ragged in midfield with Brazilian skills and left it
to France's standout defense to close out the defending champions
in the second half.
	   And with 10 men for the last 22 minutes against the overwhelming
favorites, this bunch did not crack, not after all they had been
through. They simply wanted their first World Cup more than Brazil
wanted its fifth.
	   And after France had shown so much flair yet so little lethal
finishing throughout the tournament, France killed off Brazil with
two opportunistic headers on mundane corners.
	   In the final minute, a fast break put the icing on the cake,
playing Brazil out of position and standout midfielder Emmanuel
Petit scored with an 18 meter drive.
	   The 80,000 crowd at the Stade de France was shouting ``Zizou,''
turning him in France's greatest World Cup hero. He took over that
mantle from Michel Platini, the World Cup organizer who was
cheering from the honorary box.
	   On a day when nothing would go wrong against many of the
greatest players in the world, Ronaldo was reduced to a shadow of
his reputation by the smothering defense.
	   His best chance, in the 57th minute, also drew the best save
from Fabien Barthez.
	   And even when Barthez was beaten, Marcel Desailly, the symbol of
France's unyielding last line, kicked it off the line.
	   When Desailly was sent off with 22 minutes to go for a second
yellow card, France was without its whole central defensive axis
since Laurent Blanc was already sitting the final because of a red
card in the semifinal.
	   When the team needed it, even the often blase crowd at the Stade
did its work, cheering its heart when in possession and blaring out
the Marseillaise when the going got tough. ``Le Jour de Gloire,''
the Day of Glory had truly arrived.
	   After the players complained they saw far too many suits and
ties in the stands, the message got through to the stands and many
of the fanciest were dressed in all blue. Chirac wore a huge blue
scarf and World Cup organizer Michel Platini even wore a blue
jersey under his suits.
	   Few samba beats were heard on this most French night.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Irish republican splinter groups opposed to the
Northern Ireland peace agreement have joined forces and are likely
to have masterminded the recent foiled bombing campaign in London,
Northern Ireland police said Sunday.
	   This alliance and some individual dissidents ``have been
responsible for quite a number of attacks and attempted attacks,''
Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said on Sky
Television. RUC headquarters said he was referring to Friday's
bombing attempt in the capital.
	   And Flanagan vowed that security forces on both sides of the
Irish border and in mainland Britain, whose joint operation foiled
Friday's attempted bombings in London, would do everything possible
to thwart ``these evil people.''
	   Scotland Yard said anti-terrorist police seized six fully primed
firebombs when they arrested six people at four sites in London
during the evening rush-hour. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John
Grieve, head of the anti-terrorist branch, said Friday night that
the devices were intended to be used ``within minutes,'' but did
not disclose the number.
	   Scotland Yard has refused to identify the intended targets. The
British media said the firebombs were thought to have been destined
for London stores.
	   The four men and two women arrested in London were questioned
again Sunday, and one woman was released. The others can be held
without charge for seven days under the Prevention of Terrorism
Act.
	   All four people arrested in the Irish Republic were released
without charge on Sunday. But a police spokesman said files on a
woman and a man detained in Dublin and a man detained in Dundalk
would be sent to the proseecutor's department, which could charge
them. A man arrested in Wexford was allowed to go without any
further action.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A light earthquake rocked southern and
central Mexico before dawn on Sunday. Authorities said they had no
reports of damage or injuries.
	   The National Seismological Service said the quake at 3:11 a.m.
had an intensity of 5.4, with the epicenter located in the Pacific
Ocean, a few miles (kilometers) offshore from the beach resort of
Acapulco.
	   The Red Cross, police and state disaster control agencies all
said they had no reports of injuries.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso popularity has surged ahead of his leading rival, according
to a nationwide opinion poll published Sunday.
	   Cardoso would receive 40 percent of all votes if the October
elections were held immediately, compared with 28 percent for his
top contender, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, according to the poll
published by the Datafolha polling firm.
	   Just one month ago, a Datafolha poll put the two in a
statistical tie, with 33 percent of those responding said they
would vote for Cardoso and 30 percent responding they would vote
for Lula.
	   The polling company surveyed 4,380 Brazilians of voting age in
226 separate cities throughout the country for its latest survey.
The margin of error was 2 percentage points.

France does it __ A World Cup win and giant jolt of glory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Les Bleus did it. Two goals by their
beloved Zinedine Zidane beat defending champion Brazil on Sunday,
giving France its first World Cup and a jolt of glory so potent it
propelled millions into the streets from Paris to the tiniest of
villages.
	   ``Zizou,'' the son of an Algerian night watchman in Marseille,
far outshined Brazil's Ronaldo, who nearly missed the game with an
injured ankle. France dominated the ball, played a beautiful
defense, and bulled through Brazil's backfield for a 3-0 victory.
	   Both Zidane's goals for Les Bleus _ the Blues _ came in the
first half, the second only minutes before the whistle. And then
Emmanuel Petit scored a third on a breakaway with less than a
minute to go.
	   It was the first time a host team won the World Cup since
Argentina's victory in 1978. Brazil won the trophy in 1994, its
fourth time.
	   The cup itself is only a hunk of 18-carat gold that resembles an
outsized ice cream cone and stays in a Zurich bank vault. But it
symbolizes mastery of a sport, and a spirit, revered in 200 nations
around the world.
	   In France, badly in need of grandeur and troubled by racial
strife, found itself unified by a multicolored team. Lilian Thuram,
a black from the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe, scored two goals
against Croatia to win the semifinal.
	   France had triumphed just by reaching the final. Despite outrage
over ticket distribution and police street battles with hooligans,
the tournament was a clear success.
	   It all ended with a French flourish: 300 top models paraded in
Yves Saint Laurent gowns to Ravel's Bolero played on steel drums
before the game. And after, Yves Pepin choreographed a pageant of
sound and lights, and a dazzling burst of fireworks.
	   Since Friday, a two-day party threaded through Paris, with
pockets of nonstop gaiety. French flags fluttered from car windows
and above bicycles. Crowds chanted, ``We're in the finals,'' but
hardly anyone risked the traditional, ``We're going to win.''
	   On Sunday, a crowd gathered early by a big screen near the
ornate Hotel de Ville, city hall, and yelled themselves hoarse.
Strangers smiled and high-fived. Repeatedly, they chanted, ``If
you're proud to be French, clap your hands.'' Everyone clapped.
	   Brazilians were everywhere. At least 30,000 who came from home
were joined by Brazilian residents in Europe and unofficial
Brazilians at heart. They ate fancy meals wearing yellow jerseys
and waved flags all over town.
	   Five hours before the match, the open areas around spaceship
Stade de France were alive with noise and color.
	   Dabibo Daniel and his friend, Tilo Batilo, both wearing yellow
shirts, spread a Brazilian flag on the ground and performed a
voodoo rite. ``Ronaldo, Ronaldo,'' they intoned.
	   Nearby, under a blur waving blue-white-red flags, a young women
in abbreviated crimson sequined cancan outfits toasted bare
shoulders in the sun. A group of painted French fans brandished a
confused and angry rooster, clearly no soccer lover.
	   If a potential for terrorism hung in the air, it spoiled
nothing. Policemen putted by on scooters. Riot troops strolled
among fans, with only soft caps and sidearms instead of their usual
combat gear.
	   Although heavily outnumbered, the Brazilians won the pregame
fans' World Cup.
	   Some Frenchmen came in full warpaint and elaborate costumes,
with floppy tricolor hats. But most wore fashionable black or
ordinary street clothes, with only blue-red streaks on their
cheeks. They yelled, a little self-consciously.
	   The Brazilians, however, ablaze in their colors, shouted and
undulated to tamborines or drums.
	   Several defectors left the French side when Karina Ramos of Rio
de Janeiro sambaed past wearing only skimpy shorts and dabs of
yellow and green where her top should be.
	   A carnival group from Recife in fanciful costumes danced through
the crowds under a colorful feathered canopy. Brazilians and
Frenchmen alike partied in the wake of music trailing behind.
Another French fans watched glumly off to the side.
	   Walter and Antonio Artioli, brothers from near Sao Paolo in huge
_ but huge _ blue hats, agreed that Brazil would win.
	   ``If we do, we'll celebrate all night, and then some,'' said
Walter, a lawyer.
	   ``And if we lose,'' added Antonio, an industrialist, ``the same.
It's not so terrible. France has a good team. We've won four times.
We'll win next time. More than anything, the World Cup is about
nations getting along. And having fun.''

Zanardi wins third straight CART race

 &UR; EDS: SUBS 13th graf to CORRECT lap. &QL;

 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Alex Zanardi, trying to decide if he will race
on the CART or Formula One circuits next year, strengthened his
bargaining position Sunday by easily winning the Medic Drug Grand
Prix of Cleveland.
	   The Italian driver enjoyed his third straight CART victory and
won for the fifth time in 10 races.
	   The outcome on the 2.106-mile (3.39-kilometer), 10-turn
temporary road course at the downtown Burke Lakefront Airport
allowed the defending series champion to revel again in his
post-victory ``donuts'' celebration _ spinning his car round and
round in one place, with smoke boiling off the tires.
	   Asked if he was making ``donuts'' because he was excited or
because the crowd expects it, Zanardi said: ``It may look a little
over the line to some people when I do these donuts, but I still do
it because it's fun and people still ask me to do it.''
	   Zinardi, who led 68 of 100 laps, is in the midst of negotiations
that will determine if he remains in the CART FedEx Champion Series
or returns to Formula One in 1999.
	   Dario Franchitti finished third, followed by Scott Pruett,
Adrian Fernandez, Gil de Ferran and Jimmy Vasser.
	   The victory raised Zanardi's lead over second-place Greg Moore
from 38 to 59 points in the season standings.
	   Last year, Zanardi was penalized twice during the Cleveland race
_ once for running over an air hose and the other for entering a
closed pit _ and came charging back from 22nd to win.
	   He started third on the 28-car grid and was up to second before
the cars hit the first turn of the race. Zanardi then put the
pressure on the pole-winner _ Vasser, his Target Chip-Ganassi
Racing teammate who never led by as much as a full second.
	   Unfortunately for Vasser, his gearbox broke before he had
completed a lap in the morning warmup, and the team had to change
his engine.
	   In doing so, an electrical connection was missed and Vasser was
forced to use the clutch on the floorboard instead of shifting with
an electronic button on the steering wheel _ a disadvantage,
particularly in traffic.
	   The first of three full-course caution flags came out on lap
four when Moore spun and stopped in the middle of the track. His
car was struck by Michel Jourdain, Helio Castro-Neves and J.J.
Lehto, eliminating all four from the race.

Orange Order rejects pleas to stand back after boys' deaths

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three young brothers who had
been asleep in their beds burned to death early Sunday in a
sectarian attack marking what shaken Northern Ireland leaders
termed a ``turning point'' in a violent stalemate over a blocked
Protestant march.
	   The marchers, however, rejected calls _ some from within their
own ranks _ to back off from their confrontation with police and
soldiers near a rural church.
	   A neighbor reported hearing 10-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark
and 7-year-old Jason Quinn screaming as fire gutted their residence
in Ballymoney, about 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother escaped with her Protestant boyfriend, who
was beaten back by flames when he returned to try to rescue the
brothers, police said. There were reports the boys were being
raised as Protestants.
	   A photograph released by the family showed three impish little
boys in sweatshirts, Richard's grin revealing a wide gap in the
middle of his teeth.
	   Police said a demonstration was broken up shortly before the
attack outside the housing estate where the boys lived, and issued
an urgent appeal to anyone who might be able to identify individual
protesters.
	   ``What price your principles now?'' said Seamus Mallon, the
Catholic deputy first minister of the new Belfast Assembly. ``Does
it take one child, two children, three children?''
	   Following a meeting of Orange leaders, the Orangemen whose
parade was stopped a week ago said they would continue the standoff
outside Portadown ``indefinitely.''
	   Earlier, a hollow-eyed Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, had said he considered the boys' deaths a ``turning
point'' in the increasingly fractious standoff over the Orange
Order's stymied attempts to march down the predominantly Catholic
Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
	   ``These are the real victims of our troubles, murdered while
they slept in their beds,'' Flanagan said. ``For me, this changes
everything. There are things clearly much, much more important than
marches or opposing marches.''
	   ``We owe these youngsters more,'' he said. ``We owe all our
youngsters more.''
	   Mallon and David Trimble, the Belfast Assembly's first minister,
echoed a number of Protestant clergymen in calling for the
Orangemen at Portadown to ``immediately end their protest and to
return to their homes.''
	   And authorities counseled Catholics, who mostly had remained out
of the fray since the July 5 stalemate began, not to retaliate for
the boys' deaths.
	   ``All elements must ask themselves what they can do to defuse
the situation,'' said Trimble, head of the largest Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists.
	   The White House expressed hope that the brothers' deaths would
underscore the human costs of confrontation and violence.
	   Describing President Clinton as ``deeply saddened'' by the
attack White House press secretary Mike McCurry said, ``The promise
of peace is best achieved through dialogue and reconciliation.''
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, urged
``mothers, fathers, sons and daughters'' to stay home Monday, one
of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant marching days, for the
sake of the province's fragile peace.
	   All Protestants and Catholics should ``think twice before they
exit their front doors,'' she said.
	   Belfast had turned into a ghost town and armored vehicles moved
in Sunday in anticipation of the Orangemen's Lower Ormeau Road
parade, second only to Portadown in its capacity to fuel sectarian
emotions.
	   The march _ and hundreds of others like it across the province _
commemorates the defeat of Catholic King James II by King William
of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   In North Belfast, authorities said an 18-year-old man was beaten
to death early Sunday. A motive had not been established, but
police said the area had experienced some of the worst sectarian
tension during this season's marching crisis.
	   In Ballymoney, which had escaped most of the violence this year,
griefstricken residents laid bouquets and stuffed animals outside
the blackened residence where Chrissy Quinn, the three boys'
mother, and boyfriend Raymond Craig had lived for only one week.
	   The couple had moved to the housing estate from another home in
this overwhelmingly Protestant town. It is not uncommon for
mixed-religion families to be targeted for attacks.
	   A London businessman offered a 100,000 pounds (dlrs 164,000)
reward to find the boys' killers. Ken Bates, chairman of a leading
London soccer club, said he had been ``seething'' all day after
hearing the news about the deaths.

Pak finishes far in front of everybody

 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ Cheered by huge galleries lining the
fairway ropes on every hole, rookie Se Ri Pak broke the LPGA
scoring record with a nine-stroke victory in the Jamie Farr Kroger
Classic on Sunday.
	   Her final-round 5-under-par 66, on the heels of record rounds of
61 and 63, left her at 23-under 261. The victory, less than a week
after winning the U.S. Women's Open in a 20-hole playoff on Monday,
was worth dlrs 120,000.
	   The 261 total is the lowest in a 72-hole LPGA tournament, four
better than the previous record set by Wendy Ward at the 1997
Fieldcrest Classic on a par-72 course and matched by Lisa Walters
in this year's Oldsmobile Classic on a par-72 course and Kelly
Robbins in last year's Farr on the 6,319-yard (5,776-meters),
par-71 Highland Meadows Golf Club.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean's 23-under score in relation to par
matched the lowest in LPGA history, set by Ward last year and tied
by Walters.
	   Pak's 61 in the second round was the lowest score ever in an
LPGA event. Her 63 in the second round gave her the lowest
consecutive rounds in tour history.
	   She also became only the third player, following Louise Suggs in
1952 and Jane Geddes in 1986, to win the U.S. Women's Open and then
win her next start.
	   She also set tournament records for best round (61), best
third-round score, best 72-hole score (261) and margin of victory.
	   Pak took a while to get in gear. She made the turn at five under
on her 61 and one under while shooting the 63. This time she had
three birdies and a bogey on the front side _ three-putting at the
par-4 4th. The birdies came on putts of 14 feet (4 meters) at No.
3, 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) at 7 and 10 feet (3 meters) above the
hole at No. 8.
	   She started the back side by rolling in two long birdie putts
and then at No. 16 rammed in a 25-footer (7-meter shot) to get to
23 under.
	   She encountered her only real difficulty of the day when she
pulled her second shot to the par-5 17th into a stand of fir trees
left of the green. She punched out to the front fringe and left her
lengthy first putt eight feet short. But she rolled in the par putt
while the gallery went wild.
	   At the par-5 closing hole, with the outright record on the line,
she left her approach 20 feet (6 meters) short and her birdie try
slid right of the hole. She tapped in to thunderous applause.
	   Her lead never dropped below seven shots all day.
	   Lisa Hackney, who shot a closing 65, finished second at 14
under. Pak's final-round playing partner, Karrie Webb, had a 67 and
was third at 13-under 271.
	   Pak was tied for 63rd in the 144-player field after shooting and
even-par 71 in the opening round.
	   She finished with 29 birdies and six bogeys along with 37 pars.
She played the par-4s in 14 under, the par-5s in six under and the
par-3s in three under.

France wins World Cup with 3-0 victory over Brazil

 &UR; Eds: ADDs Jacquet, Zagallo quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Two first half headers by Zinedine
Zidane and a late strike by Emmanuel Petit gave France its first
World Cup win Sunday on a 3-0 upset victory over defending champion
and four-time titlist Brazil.
	   Zidane headed the first in the 27th minute from Petit's leftwing
corner and his second came in the final minute of the first half
this time from a rightwing corner from Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Petit added the third on a breakaway in second half injury time
with Brazil already a beaten team.
	   The French, playing their first ever final, had to defend its
two-goal lead without star defender Marcel Desailly for the last 22
minutes. The center-back, who had superbly kept the Brazilian
strikeforce quiet, was expelled for his second yellow card.
	   But Aime Jacquet's team still created the best chances of the
game and Stephane Guivarc'h squandered three opportunities with
goalkeeper Taffarel to beat.
	   ``We won the final because we wanted it the most,'' Jacquet
said. ``It was the result of hard work. We really worked as a team.
There was good will and friendship between all of us.
	   ``We played better and better because we had confidence and we
proved we had great players.''
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said his team never recovered from
a slow start and never looked like winning a fifth championship.
	   ``Brazil lost the final in the first half,'' he said. ``In the
second half we did everything we could but we were not able to make
up the difference.
	   ``The whole nation was behind France,'' Zagallo said. ``The
fifth title will have to be some other time. This wasn't our day.
France was better.''
	   The French almost made a sensational start to the final when
Didier Deschamps fired a long ball forwards from deep in his own
half and Stephane Guivarc'h held off a challenge from Junior Baiano
before trying an audacious overhead shot over the top.
	   In the fourth minute, Djorkaeff slipped a neat ball through to
Zidane who did well to lay it off to Guivarc'h in front of the
Brazilian goal. Guivarc'h only had 'keeper Taffarel to beat from 12
meters (yards) but lost control and Junior Baiano's challenge
ensured his shot was both weak and inaccurate.
	   The French had another chance in the seventh minute when Zidane
swung in a free kick from the left. Djorkaeff and Guivarc'h were
both unchallenged as they went for the ball at the near post but
Djorkaeff got his shoulder rather than his head to the ball and the
Brazilians were relieved to see the effort go tamely wide.
	   Ronaldo, who was pulled from the initial Brazilian starting
lineup because of tendonitis trouble but reinstated only 45 minutes
before kickoff, sprang into life in the 22nd minute. He dribbled
past Lilian Thuram down the left and sent over a teasing cross
which Barthez struggled to hold underneath the crossbar.
	   But the French came back to take the lead in the 27th minute
after Roberto Carlos needlessly conceded a corner and got a telling
off from Moroccan referee Said Belqola for angrily kicking the
corner flag in frustration.
	   Petit curled in the flag kick from the right hand side and
Zidane climbed above Leonardo at the near post to head powerfully
downwards and past Taffarel.
	   Three minutes before halftime, the French went close to
increasing the lead when the the ball broke to Petit in front of
goal but hit shot was deflected into the sidenetting.
	   Taffarel made a stunning reflex save from the unmarked Guivarc'h
and Djorkaeff drove another corner towards the near post where
Zidane ducked to head inside the post and put the Brazilians under
huge pressure for the second half.
	   Wily Brazilian coach Zagallo sent on Denilson for Leonardo for
the second half but it was Ronaldo who had a great chance to pull a
goal back 11 minutes into the second half.
	   A leftwing cross from Roberto Carlos dropped to the Inter star
at the far post and, although he got clear of a defender, his
well-struck, close-range shot was held by Barthez.
	   A blunder by the French 'keeper set up another chance in the
60th minute when he ran to almost the edge of his area and flapped
at a long throw from Roberto Carlos. The ball dropped to Bebeto
whose shot was on target but Desailly was back to clear with
Barthez nowhere near his goal.
	   Guivarc'h should have scored a third for France in the 63rd when
he pounced on Cafu's weak back header but shot over the top with
only Taffarel to beat.
	   France replaced Christian Karembeu with Alain Boghossian and
sent on Christophe Dugarry for Guivarc'h.
	   But the host was down to 10 players in the 67th minute when
Desailly, its best defender in the game, was shown the red card for
his second caution of the match when he scythed down Cafu. Desailly
received his first early in the second half for dissent.
	   Zagallo's last throw was to send on striker Edmundo for
midfielder Cesar Sampaio with 16 minutes to go and Aime Jacquet
responded by taking off striker Djorkaeff and replacing him with
midfielder Patrick Vieira.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Aldair, Junior Baiano, Roberto Carlos;
Leonardo (Denilson, 46th), Cesar Sampaio (Edmundo, 74th), Dunga,
Rivaldo; Ronaldo, Bebeto.
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram; Frank Leboeuf, Marcel
Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu (Alain Boghossian,
57th), Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Youri
Djorkaeff (Patrick Vieira, 76th), Stephane Guivarc'h (Christophe
Dugarry, 65th).
	   Referee _ Said Belqola, Morocco.

Jacquet's men outshine Brazil's superstars

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France didn't just take the World Cup
from Brazil. Zinedine Zidane and his team left Ronaldo and his
Brazilian superstars look mere mortals.
	   Only one team at the Stade de France looked like the aristocrats
of soccer and it wasn't Brazil.
	   The French team not only out-tackled them, won almost every ball
in the air and hit the target three times, it left the brilliant
Brazilians, the odds on favorites, looking humiliated as Didier
Deschamps lifted the trophy Brazil had collected four years ago.
	   Brazil effectively lost the game in the opening few minutes.
	   The French, whose strikers had failed to score in their last
three World Cup games, could have hit three in the opening seven
minutes only for poor finishing by Stephane Guivarc'h and Youri
Djorkaeff.
	   With the French looking dangerous at every set piece, it was no
surprise that Zidane headed his team in front from Emmanuel Petit's
corner.
	   Brazil's defenders looked for Marcel Desailly and Guivarc'h as
likely targets for the free kick but were fooled by Zidane's run to
the near post.
	   They didn't learn.
	   With the game in first half injury time, Djorkaeff launched a
corner from the left. Again the Brazilians had Desailly tightly
marked but Zidane raced in and ducked to head between Taffarel and
the near post.
	   The damage was done and, although Brazil's wily coach Mario
Zagallo sent on strikers Denilson and Edmundo to team up with
Ronaldo and Bebeto in attack, French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez
wasn't beaten.
	   The feared Brazilian foursome couldn't even exploit the absence
of Desailly for the last 22 minutes after the powerfully built
defender was expelled for his second yellow card.
	   Ronaldo, originally pulled from the starting lineup because of
tendonitis but then reinstated, had one real chance in the game
soon after halftime but fired straight at Barthez from six meters
(yards).
	   Denilson flattered with his attempts to dribble round the entire
French defense. He rarely got round one and his colleagues were
left frustrated as the title slipped away.
	   The lesson for Brazil is that, even with a coach as experienced
as Zagallo, who has four World Cup titles either as player or
coach, it's possible to have too much talent to deal with.
	   If they can't play as a unit, then a lineup like France can
teach them a lesson in teamwork.
	   French coach Aime Jacquet got the tactics right by striking
early at the weak spot on the Brazilian team, its defense.
	   Zidane, Youri Djorkaeff and Emmanuel Petit didn't allow the
Brazilians to settle into their smooth-passing style and made sure
that the ball rarely reached the dangerous Ronaldo in attack.
	   Ronaldo sat out the 1994 World Cup win although he was on the
squad as a 17-year-old. Now he still hasn't played on a winning
World Cup team.

World Cup: France's Glory Day arrives with Zidane as creator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, FIXES typos &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac had
the right premonition. Coach Aime Jacquet had the right analysis.
	   The result sounded like a dream to an elated nation of 60
million: France 3, Brazil 0 _ La France Champion du Monde. With
panache to spare.
	   Chirac had predicted all along he would hand the World Cup to
captain Didier Deschamps. Jacquet said all along France would only
win if it was powered by the genius of Zinedine Zidane.
	   ``We proved we had great players,'' said French coach Aime
Jacquet.
	   Playmaker Zidane scored on two headers in the first half, ran
the Brazilians ragged in midfield with Brazilian skills and left it
to France's standout defense to close out the defending champions
in the second half.
	   And with 10 men for the last 22 minutes against the overwhelming
favorites, this bunch did not crack, not after all they had been
through. They simply wanted their first World Cup more than Brazil
wanted its fifth.
	   ``We won this title because we wanted it the most,'' said
Jacquet.
	   And after France had shown so much flair yet so little lethal
finishing throughout the tournament, France killed off Brazil with
two opportunistic headers on mundane corners.
	   In the final minute, a fast break put the icing on the cake,
playing Brazil out of position and standout midfielder Emmanuel
Petit scored with an 18 meter drive.
	   The 80,000 crowd at the Stade de France was shouting ``Zizou,''
turning him in France's greatest World Cup hero. He took over that
mantle from Michel Platini, the World Cup organizer who was
cheering from the honorary box.
	   On a day when nothing would go wrong against many of the
greatest players in the world, Ronaldo was reduced to a shadow of
his reputation by the smothering defense.
	   His best chance, in the 57th minute, also drew the best save
from Fabien Barthez.
	   And even when Barthez was beaten, Marcel Desailly, the symbol of
France's unyielding last line, kicked it off the line.
	   When Desailly was sent off with 22 minutes to go for a second
yellow card, France was without its whole central defensive axis
since Laurent Blanc was already sitting the final because of a red
card in the semifinal.
	   Physically, emotionally, France remained an impregnable bastion.
``It was the result of hard work and we proved it on the field,''
said Jacquet.
	   When the team needed it, even the often blase crowd at the Stade
did its work, cheering its heart when in possession and blaring out
the Marseillaise when the going got tough. ``Le Jour de Gloire,''
the Day of Glory had truly arrived.
	   After the players complained they saw far too many suits and
ties in the stands, the message got through to the stands and many
of the fanciest were dressed in all blue. Chirac wore a huge blue
scarf and World Cup organizer Michel Platini even wore a blue
jersey under his suits.
	   Few samba beats were heard on this most French night.

	   ANSE BERTRAND, Guadeloupe (AP) _ Marie-Anna Thuram wanted the
best for her children. So she left behind the back-breaking job
cutting sugar cane on an idyllic-looking Caribbean island to seek
her fortune in France.
	   On Sunday, her son Lilian played on France's first-ever World
Cup championship team.
	   A banner hanging from a telephone pole in their native village _
in a seaside area of modest homes and palm and breadfruit trees set
along the azure Caribbean Sea _ urges: ``Allez (Go) Thuram! Vive la
France!''
	   When the match started, Thuram's cousins in Anse Bertrande
belted out the French anthem. When France scored the first of three
winning goals, the room erupted with family and friends jumping up
and down, throwing a plastic dining table into the air and
screaming their joy.
	   ``Where are you now, Brazil?'' they chanted, along with their
mascot for the game _ 8-year-old Keven. His face painted red and
blue, Keven waived a French flag and wore a gift from Lilian: an
old French soccer team shirt that trailed around his knees.
	   The gap between the black citizens of France's far-flung
Caribbean provinces and the residents of Paris has been temporarily
bridged by the heady possibility of France winning its first World
Cup finals victory.
	   Three of the team's players are of Guadeloupian descent _
Thierry Henry, Leonard Diomede and Lilian Thuram, who scored the
two goals that took France into the finals.
	   The star player's cousin, Joel Thuram, is quick to point out
that there are only ``three real Frenchmen'' on the team, though he
is adamant that even as an islander he is ``as French as any
metropolitan (person).'' The contradiction perhaps best describes
the sometimes difficult relationship between the mainland and the
former colonies.
	   ``The metropole'' here means mainland France. Metropolitans
tends to mean white French people. Negropolitans is the word used,
not without some negative connotations, to describe islanders who
have lived in mainland France most of their lives.
	   After World War II, the French government made a number of
islands French territory, granting the residents all the privileges
of people born in France. These areas included Guadeloupe and
Martinique in the Caribbean, Reunion off the east coast of Africa
and Guiana in South America.
	   A small and once-fiery independence movement has made no headway
here. Some bombings in the 1980s drew some attention to the cause,
which now plays a small part in island politics.
	   ``We all dream of going to the metropole, at least once. But
those who are there dream of coming back home,'' said Joel Thuram.
	   But not Lilian Thuram's mother, who is happy to be on the
mainland, according to her sister-in-law Charlotte Thurman.
	   Maria-Anna and Charlotte began working in the cane fields after
they both bore their eldest children in the 1960s, Charlotte said.
After nearly 20 years, struggling to work and raise five children
as a single mother, Maria-Anna went to Paris on what is considered
a domestic flight.
	   Despite the many differences that separate them, on Sunday
French citizens from across the globe were united by the victory.
	   ``France is great. Long live France. Together we are strong,''
Guadeloupian fans chanted after the game, noting that the first two
goals were scored by a player of Algerian descent.
	   At the Creole Beach Hotel, a tourist from the mainland with the
French colors painted on his chest, embraced a black barman and
screamed: ``We have won my brother.''

Gunmen wound Greek shipowner

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ Gunmen wounded a prominent shipowner
Monday in an attack on a street in Greece's main port, police said.
	   The motive for the shooting of Contantinos Agapitos was not
clear. Greek terrorists have targeted shipowners in the past, but
there was no immediate claim of responsibility from any group.
	   Agapitos, 40, who was wounded in his legs and shoulder, was able
to identify the two gunmen, police sources said. The assailants
drove past Agapitos' car on a motorbike and shot at him through the
passenger window on a street in Pireaus, about 10 kilometers (six
miles) south of Athens.
	   Doctors said his condition was not life-threatening.
	   Police speculated the attack, which occurred at 12:15 a.m. (2115
GMT), could be a warning rather than a murder attempt.
	   In May 1997, shipowner Constantinos Peratikos was shot to death
as he left his office in Piraeus. That attack was claimed by
November 17, Greece's deadliest terrorist group, which has killed
21 people since 1975.

Balance tilts further towards Europe after Brazil final flop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe took the World Cup back from Brazil with a
host nation victory for France Sunday and the 3-0 triumph made
Mario Zagallo's team of superstars look very beatable.
	   Ronaldo and company, the defending titlists and four-time
winners, were expected to carry off the title yet again.
	   They were soundly beaten by the French at the Stade de France
and the balance of soccer power tilted further towards Europe,
which had three of the four semifinalists and six of the last
eight.
	   In World Cup '94, it was seven out of eight but still Brazil won
the title.
	   Croatia, the surprise team of this World Cup, wound up third at
its first ever attempt. Formerly part of Yugoslavia, the Croatians
entered the World Cup for the first time, getting into the finals
through the runners up playoffs and upsetting three-time titlist
Germany on the way to the semifinal, where they lost 2-1 to France.
	   The Croatians clinched third by beating the Netherlands 2-1 on
Saturday.
	   ``I said before we came to France that no one should
underestimate us, that there was no limit on what we could
achieve,'' said coach Miroslav Blazevic.
	   The Dutch looked almost as talented as the two finalists and
went out to the Brazilians after a semifinal shootout following a
1-1 tie.
	   Dennis Bergkamp, Edgar Davids and Frank de Boer made standout
contributions and, if Patrick Kluivert had taken a few more of the
many chances he had, the Dutch might have made their final
appearance in the final.
	   Italy looked a candidate to win its fourth title until it ran
into France in the quarterfinal.
	   With Alessandro Del Piero well short of top form after
struggling to recover from injury, the Italians had to rely on the
scoring of five-goal Christian Vieri. But the goals dried up
against the French who scrambled through after a penalty shootout
with Blanc scoring the deciding spot kick.
	   Argentina and England were unfortunate to meet even earlier.
Michael Owen scored a memorable solo goal but David Beckham's
expulsion meant England had to defend for 75 minutes with only 10
men before losing, after a thrilling 2-2 tie, on penalties.
	   Argentina then went out to the Dutch thanks to a spectacular
late clincher by Bergkamp.
	   The Yugoslavs, returning to the World Cup after being banned
because of the nation's involvement in the wars in Croatia and
Bosnia, showed signs they could be contenders but then faded.
	   They squandered a two-goal lead to the Germans and were held 2-2
in group games and surrendered 2-1 in the final minute to the
Netherlands in the second round.
	   Paraguay, Chile and Mexico did well to make it to the last 16
but never looked likely to get any further. Paraguayan 'keeper Jose
Luis Chilavert excelled, yielding only one goal in four games and
almost became the first 'keeper to score in the World Cup only for
Bulgaria's Zdravko Zdravkov to tip his 30-meter free kick over the
top.
	   Marcelo Salas scored four goals and teamed up well with Ivan
Zamorano but the Chileans were crushed 4-1 in the second round by
Brazil while Mexico tossed away a chance to beat the Germans.
	   Luis Hernandez hit his fourth goal of the championship to put
the Mexicans ahead but missed a golden chance of a fifth and a
two-goal lead and the Germans came back to win 2-1.
	   But it all went wrong for the Germans in the quarterfinal. After
defender Christian Woerns was expelled, Berti Vogts' aging team
tumbled 3-0 to Croatia, a result that marked the end of standout
World Cup careers of Juergen Klinsmann, Lothar Matthaeus, Juergen
Kohler, Thomas Haessler and several more big name German stars.
	   Romania and Norway came into the World Cup with impressive
records in qualifiying but made few friends on the way to losing in
the second round.
	   Nigeria started with a thrilling, come-from-behind 3-2 victory
over Spain but couldn't maintain that form. The Olympic champions
went out in the second round after being totally outplayed 4-1 by
the Danes, who went on to lose 3-2 to Brazil in the quarterfinals.
	   Iran went out in the first round but had the huge satisfaction
of beating its political foe, the United States, 2-1 and
eliminating the Americans from the championship.
	   After beating Scotland 3-0, Morocco looked on course for the
second round only to hear that Norway had upset Brazil 2-1 with two
late goals to put the North Africans out.
	   Of the other first-round losers, Belgium went home unbeaten but
without a win either while Japan, Tunisia and Colombia scored only
one goal each before taking an early plane home.
	   Saudi Arabia, South Korea, South Africa, Jamaica, Scotland and
Austria always looked like going out in the first round. But at
least the Reggae Boyz rookies from Jamaica won their first ever
World Cup game, edging Japan 2-1.
	   The real disasters were Spain, Bulgaria and the United States.
	   Spain was hailed as a likely contender but went out despite
crushing Bulgaria 6-1 in its final match. The Bulgarians,
semifinalists four years ago, showed their age and scored only one
goal in three games before going tamely out.
	   After advancing to the second round in 1994, the Americans hoped
to show that the arrival of Major League Soccer had improved their
credibility even further. Squandered chances meant that the team
lost all three games and coach Steve Sampson quit to become one of
six World Cup managerial casualties.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French capital exploded in joy Sunday after the
hometown boys _ ``Les Bleus'' _ capped an amazing World Cup run
with France's first championship.
	   Horns resounded like a chorus across the city, announcing what a
month ago seemed like a faraway dream: a 3-0 win against Brazil.
Immediately, thousands filled the streets and began surging toward
the Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de
Triomphe.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, tearing out of the stadium at Saint-Denis.
	   Junker and two friends had traveled from the Lorraine region and
had slept the night before on the grass, near the Eiffel Tower. But
were they tired? ``NO!'' they screeched. ``We're going to the
Champs-Elysees!''
	   ``This victory brings everyone together,'' said his friend,
Cedric Trunzler, 21. ``There are many races and religions here. But
we are all French. We all won.''
	   Already on the Champs-Elysees, Alexandra Forest, 15, declared
her passion for Zinedine Zidane, the French star who scored two
goals. ``He's my love for life. He's the best player in the
world,'' she said.
	   At least a million people were expected to pour onto the
Champs-Elysees, which already drew 350,000 people after France's
semifinal win against Croatia Wednesday.
	   Shouts of ``We are the champions'' echoed from crowds moving
toward the avenue from Paris' Left Bank.
	   The sidewalks around the Louvre museum and the Tuileries gardens
were filled with thousands, some carrying flags, some dancing or
jumping on cars.
	   Youths used beer cans for soccer balls, or anything else they
could find.
	   ``We have shown the world we're the best at football. Now we'll
show them we're the best at partying,'' said Simone Perchais, who
feted the win in the Latin Quarter.
	   But actually, the partying begin hours before the match.
	   Beginning Sunday morning, Parisians sang the Marseillaise on the
subway, and perfect strangers shouted joyful cheers and chants to
each other across crowded streets.
	   Thousands of fans packed the square in front of Paris' ornate
City Hall, some perched on lampposts, bus stops, telephone booths
and even in trees to watch the game on the big screen there. Crowds
had gathered there at least eight hours before the match, just to
get a good seat.
	   ``This is the most exciting day, no matter what happens,'' said
Patrice DeCary, who came in from the northeastern town of Reims to
imbibe the Parisian atmosphere.
	   ``May the best team win,'' he said, although one could be
forgiven for thinking he felt otherwise: his face was painted the
red, white and blue stripes of French flag, and his entire body was
draped in one. For extra emphasis, his T-shirt listed all the names
of the French players.
	   The patriotic spirit was infectious. ``If you are proud to be
French, clap your hands!'' yelled the youths. Vincent Aigret, 20, a
student from Orleans, obliged. ``All of us together, all of us
together!'' he yelled back.
	   Even the Foreign Legion was in a party mood, with one
Legionnaire dancing the samba on the sidewalk.
	   A sizable but discreet security operation was in place Sunday
night to police the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at
strategic points across Paris.

dejected to stay outside.
	   ``I'm going back to my hotel,'' said Jose Luiz Pascoal, 38, who
came from Rio de Janeiro to support the Brazilian team.
	   ``I just don't know what happened,'' he said outside the
stadium. ``I'm very, very sad. Won't be able to work for a week.''
	   Another, Irineu Siminetti, 17, said he was going to McDonalds to
try to forget the loss.
	   For the French, the partying began early in Paris' sleepy
suburbs, too.
	   ``We`ve won. We`ve won. Wake up! Wake up!'' a group of young
people shouted in the western suburb of Maisons-Laffitte, dancing
down the street.
	   Small children raced around balconies in their pyjamas, and
firecrackers lit up the night sky.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The pictures from Stade de France hadn't gone black
before commentators from around the world chimed in on France's
World Cup victory Sunday night _ or more like it Brazil's loss.
	   The general feeling was not that France had achieved a
remarkable victory, rather Brazil _ and a hobbled Ronaldo _ blew
it.
	   ``It is a shame we have not seen much of (Ronaldo),'' said
former Dutch forward Wim Kieft, a member of the 1988 European
championship team. ``Today especially because of the injury, but
there was also so much pressure on him.''
	   Ronaldo initially was listed among the substitutes in the
starting lineups distributed an hour before the start of the match.
The 21-year-old two-time FIFA Player of the Year had been taken to
a hospital earlier in the day for X-rays and was diagnosed with
tendonitis in his left ankle. But team doctors approved him 45
minutes before kickoff.
	   ``The Brazilians were disappointing,'' Kieft said. ``France has
a great midfield, a strong defense but poor attackers.''
	   Former Scottish international and BBC analyst Alan Hansen also
seemed disappointed.
	   ``France won the World Cup without recognized strikers,'' he
said. ``It seems you can win by being very strong defensively and
having a very good midfielder.''
	   One congratulatory comment came from Italy.
	   ``A very well-deserved victory, a victory that doesn't leave a
shade of doubt,'' commentator Bruno Pizzul said on RAI state TV.
	   Egyptian commentator Mimi el-Shirbini also offered praise to the
French.
	   ``Congratulations (Didier) Deschamps for the five kilograms of
gold,'' el-Shirbini said on state-run television as the French
midfielder carried the World Cup Trophy. ``May God give us long
life to witness the coming World Cup.''
	   But most everybody else kept pointing the finger at Brazil _ and
Ronaldo.
	   ``This Ronaldo story will not end,'' former Dutch great Ruud
Gullit. ``If he was fit he would have come out for the warmup but
they didn't even come out. Something was going on in the locker
room. Everyone wants to find out what really happened there.''
	   ``Ronaldo wasn't fit on the day,'' Leicester City manager Martin
O'Niell said on the BBC. ``It was massive blow.

Brazilians call off planned celebrations after loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians reacted with shock and
disbelief as they watched their national soccer team lose 3-0 to
the French in the World Cup final on Sunday.
	   For many Brazilians, a fifth World Cup victory was a foregone
conclusion taken as another excuse to party and dance into the
night. But the unexpected defeat forced Brazilians to put off their
victory marches at least until 2002.
	   Brazilians had tears in their eyes and stared in shock at a
large public television screen mounted on Copacabana beach as the
game ended. It rained intermittently in Rio throughout the game,
discouraging many Brazilians from coming out and watching the game
in public.
	   Marinede da Costa, a 28-year-old secretary who watched the game
on the beach, maintained her composure after Brazil's defeat.
	   ``I think Brazil fought a lot. It just wasn't our day. We lost,
but second is still great,'' she said.
	   In Sao Paulo, Micheline Lagnado, a graphic designer, said she
was already looking forward to the World Cup competition to begin
in 2002.
	   ``The French deserved to win because they played better. ...
Hopefully we will get our fifth World Cup victory in 2002,'' she
said.
	   Despite the loss, Brazilians still let off a few fireworks
during the game, if only because they didn't want them to go to
waste. But after the game, the country was quiet and the mood
subdued.
	   The biggest post-game victory celebrations were abruptly called
off. Many streets near the beaches were blocked off to traffic on
Sunday in preparation for the celebrations.
	   The city of Rio called on more than 3,000 policemen to keep the
peace among what city officials expected to be hundreds of
thousands of crazed revelers. Those parties did not take place as
planned.
	   But not all parties came to a halt as a result of the game.
Edrizio Rodrigues, an unemployed 23-year-old Rio resident, said he
still intended to go out after the game.
	   ``I'm going to celebrate anyway. Brazilians are like that. It
wasn't our day, but at least we made it to the finals,'' he said.
	   A handful of Brazilian soccer fans went ahead with their
celebrations at a bar in Rio's fashionable Ipanema suburb, although
their samba was not quite as festive as it was after previous
games.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The French capital exploded in joy Sunday after the
hometown boys _ ``Les Bleus'' _ capped an amazing World Cup run
with France's first championship.
	   Horns resounded like a chorus across the city, announcing what a
month ago seemed like a faraway dream: a 3-0 win against Brazil.
Immediately, thousands filled the streets and began surging toward
the Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de
Triomphe.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, tearing out of the stadium at Saint-Denis.
	   Junker and two friends had traveled from the Lorraine region and
had slept the night before on the grass, near the Eiffel Tower. But
were they tired? ``NO!'' they screeched. ``We're going to the
Champs-Elysees!''
	   ``This victory brings everyone together,'' said his friend,
Cedric Trunzler, 21. ``There are many races and religions here. But
we are all French. We all won.''
	   Already on the Champs-Elysees, Alexandra Forest, 15, declared
her passion for Zinedine Zidane, the French star who scored two
goals. ``He's my love for life. He's the best player in the
world,'' she said.
	   At least a million people were expected to pour onto the
Champs-Elysees, which already drew 350,000 people after France's
semifinal win against Croatia Wednesday.
	   Shouts of ``We are the champions'' echoed from crowds moving
toward the avenue from Paris' Left Bank.
	   The sidewalks around the Louvre museum and the Tuileries gardens
were filled with thousands, some carrying flags, some dancing or
jumping on cars.
	   Youths used beer cans for soccer balls, or anything else they
could find.
	   ``We have shown the world we're the best at football. Now we'll
show them we're the best at partying,'' said Simone Perchais, who
feted the win in the Latin Quarter.
	   But actually, the partying begin hours before the match.
	   Beginning Sunday morning, Parisians sang the Marseillaise on the
subway, and perfect strangers shouted joyful cheers and chants to
each other across crowded streets.
	   Thousands of fans packed the square in front of Paris' ornate
City Hall, some perched on lampposts, bus stops, telephone booths
and even in trees to watch the game on the big screen there. Crowds
had gathered there at least eight hours before the match, just to
get a good seat.
	   ``This is the most exciting day, no matter what happens,'' said
Patrice DeCary, who came in from the northeastern town of Reims to
imbibe the Parisian atmosphere.
	   ``May the best team win,'' he said, although one could be
forgiven for thinking he felt otherwise: his face was painted the
red, white and blue stripes of French flag, and his entire body was
draped in one. For extra emphasis, his T-shirt listed all the names
of the French players.
	   The patriotic spirit was infectious. ``If you are proud to be
French, clap your hands!'' yelled the youths. Vincent Aigret, 20, a
student from Orleans, obliged. ``All of us together, all of us
together!'' he yelled back.
	   Even the Foreign Legion was in a party mood, with one
Legionnaire dancing the samba on the sidewalk.
	   A sizable but discreet security operation was in place Sunday
night to police the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at
strategic points across Paris.
	   They didn't need to worry about the Brazilians _ most were too
dejected to stay outside.
	   ``I'm going back to my hotel,'' said Jose Luiz Pascoal, 38, who
came from Rio de Janeiro to support the Brazilian team.
	   ``I just don't know what happened,'' he said outside the
stadium. ``I'm very, very sad. Won't be able: &QC; I-for a week.''
	   Another, Irineu Siminetti, 17, said he was going to McDonalds to
try to forget the loss.
	   For the French, the partying began early in Paris' sleepy
suburbs, too.
	   ``We`ve won. We`ve won. Wake up! Wake up!'' a group of young
people shouted in the western suburb of Maisons-Laffitte, dancing
down the street.
	   Small children raced around balconies in their pyjamas, and
firecrackers lit up the night sky.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Jamil Mahuad, the Harvard-trained mayor of
Quito, was elected Sunday as Ecuador's next president on promises
to end rampant corruption and political chaos in this Andean
country, an exit poll showed.
	   Mahuad, of the centrist Christian Democrat party, received 53.6
percent of the vote, compared to 46.4 percent for banana tycoon
Alvaro Naboa, according to the poll sponsored by seven television
stations. In past elections, the exit poll has been accurate.
	   Final results from Ecuador's elections board will be released on
Wednesday.
	   Mahuad will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending a
17-month transitional government that took office when Congress
removed eccentric President Abdala Bucaram from power for ``mental
incapacity'' amid street protests.
	   Naboa, Ecuador's richest man, had been backed by Bucaram.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians reacted with shock and
disbelief as they watched their national soccer team lose 3-0 to
the French in the World Cup final on Sunday.
	   For many Brazilians, a fifth World Cup victory was a foregone
conclusion taken as another excuse to party and dance into the
night. But the unexpected defeat forced Brazilians to put off their
victory marches at least until 2002.
	   Brazilians had tears in their eyes and stared in shock at a
large public television screen mounted on Copacabana beach as the
game ended. It rained intermittently in Rio throughout the game,
discouraging many Brazilians from coming out and watching the game
in public.
	   Marinede da Costa, a 28-year-old secretary who watched the game
on the beach, maintained her composure after Brazil's defeat.
	   ``I think Brazil fought a lot. It just wasn't our day. We lost,
but second is still great,'' she said.
	   In Sao Paulo, Micheline Lagnado, a graphic designer, said she
was already looking forward to the World Cup competition to begin
in 2002.
	   ``The French deserved to win because they played better. ...
Hopefully we will get our fifth World Cup victory in 2002,'' she
said.
	   Despite the loss, Brazilians still let off a few fireworks
during the game, if only because they didn't want them to go to
waste. But after the game, the country was quiet and the mood
subdued.
	   The biggest post-game victory celebrations were abruptly called
off. Many streets near the beaches were blocked off to traffic on
Sunday in preparation for the celebrations.
	   The city of Rio called on more than 3,000 policemen to keep the
peace among what city officials expected to be hundreds of
thousands of crazed revelers. Those parties did not take place as
planned.
	   But not all parties came to a halt as a result of the game.
Edrizio Rodrigues, an unemployed 23-year-old Rio resident, said he
still intended to go out after the game.
	   ``I'm going to celebrate anyway. Brazilians are like that. It
wasn't our day, but at least we made it to the finals,'' he said.
	   A handful of Brazilian soccer fans went ahead with their
celebrations at a bar in Rio's fashionable Ipanema suburb, although
their samba was not quite as festive as it was after previous
games.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The French capital exploded in joy Sunday after the
hometown boys _ ``Les Bleus'' _ capp 9amazing World Cup run with
France's first championship.
	   Horns resounded like a chorus across the city, announcing what a
month ago seemed like a faraway dream: a 3-0 win against Brazil.
Immediately, thousands filled the streets and began surging toward
the Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de

	   By midnight, there were 800,000 on the avenue, police said, and
the crowd was quickly growing. Revelers were so tightly packed it
was hard to walk.
	   French fans screeching for joy poured out of the stadium at
Saint-Denis, leaping past stunned, dejected Brazilians.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, carrying one end of a giant French flag. He
and two friends _ all with faces painted red, white and blue _ had
traveled from the Lorraine region and slept the previous night on

	   A sizable but discreet security operation was in place Sunday
night to police the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at
strategic points across Paris.
	   They didn't need to worry about the Brazilians _ most were too
depressed to stay outside.
	   ``I'm going back to my hotel,'' said Jose Luiz Pascoal, 38, who
came from Rio de Janeiro to support the Brazilian team.
	   ``I just don't know what happened,'' he said outside the
stadium. ``I'm very, very sad. Won't be able to work for a week.''
	   Another, IUSiminetti, 17, said he was going to McDonalds to try
to forget the loss.
	   At a hotel bar on the Left Bank, 10 Brazilian fans drank
champagne and reflected on the loss.
	   ``Brazil was comatose,'' said Cesar Lapaglia, 27. ``We just
didn't play. And France deserved everything they got.''
	   For the French, the partying began early in Paris' sleepy
suburbs, too.
	   ``We`ve won. We`ve won. Wake up! Wake up!'' a group of young
people shouted in the western suburb of Maisons-Laffitte, dancing
down the street.
	   Small children raced around balconies in their pyjamas, and
firecrackers lit up the night sky.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ After a long pause for him, Mark McGwire is
right back on track.
	   The St. Louis slugger, who ended a 21 at-bat homerless slump
with a game-winning shot on Saturday, hit his major league-leading
39th and 40th homers in Sunday's 6-4 victory over the Houston
Astros.
	   In the first inning, McGwire hit the first pitch he saw from
Sean Bergman (8-5) off the wall beyond the visitor's bullpen in
left field.
	   He struck out in the third and drew his major league-leading
19th intentional walk in the fourth before hitting No. 40 on a 2-1
pitch from Scott Elarton to lead off the seventh, a 415-foot
(126.49 meters) drive.
	   McGwire broke his own record for reaching 40 homers the fastest,
getting there in 281 at-bats. He did it in 294 at-bats in 1996,
when he finished with 52 homers.
	   McGwire has 427 career homers, passing Billy Williams for 23rd
on the list. He's only three away from the team homer record of 43
set by Johnny Mize in 1939.
	   McGwire had no homers or RBIs in July and was homerless in 21
at-bats before his two-run, upper-deck shot in the 11th won
Saturday's game 4-3.
	   Juan Acevedo (4-2) and three relievers combined on a
nine-hitter.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Brewers 0 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Mark Clark pitched a three-hitter for his first
shutout in more than four years and Scott Servais drove in all
three Chicago runs.
	   Clark (5-8) retired 16 of the last 18, walked two and struck out
five in the third three-hitter and shutout of his career. The
right-hander's last shutout came against Detroit on May 13, 1994.
	   A crowd of 50,735 pushed the weekend attendance to 184,432,
making it the second largest four-game set in Brewers history.
	   Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa went 0-for-3 with a walk.
	   Brad Woodall (4-4) allowed six hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Mets 5, Expos 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, Brian McRae hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning
and reliever Jeff Tam got his first major league win.
	   Butch Huskey, benched on Saturday for Todd Hundley's return,
started in right field and went 4-for-4. Hundley started in left
for the second straight game and was 0-for-2 with a walk before
leaving for a pinch-hitter in the seventh.
	   Trailing 2-1, Huskey singled with one out and McRae followed by
driving Javier Vazquez's (3-7) first pitch over the right-field
wall. It was his 12th homer this season and second in two days.
	   Tam (1-0) pitched 1 2-3 perfect innings in relief of Hideo Nomo,
who surrendered only two hits in 5 1-3 innings but walked seven.
	   Dennis Cook struck out the side in the ninth for his first
save.
 &UR; Phillies 10, Pirates 4 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Mark Lewis, Doug Glanville and Gregg Jefferies
hit two-run homers and Philadelphia finished off its second
consecutive three-game sweep of Pittsburgh.
	   The Phillies' 27th comeback victory of the season was their
sixth win in a row and moved them four games over .500 at 46-42 _ a
21-game turnaround from a year ago, when they were 25-63.
	   The Pirates, winless since the All-Star break, have lost six in
a row and eight of nine, plus 10 of their last 12 at home.
	   Carlton Loewer (4-1) withstood Desi Relaford's three-base
throwing error in a two-run Pirates' first inning to allow three
runs _ only one earned _ and five hits over six innings.
	   Pirates starter Esteban Loaiza (6-5) took the loss.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mahuad's victory claim, edits throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSE VELAZQUEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Jamil Mahuad, the Harvard-trained mayor of
Quito, was elected Sunday as Ecuador's next president on promises
to end rampant corruption and political chaos in this Andean
country, an exit poll showed.
	   Mahuad, of the centrist Christian Democrat party, received 53.6
percent of the vote, compared to 46.4 percent for banana tycoon
Alvaro Naboa, according to the poll sponsored by seven television
stations.
	   The poll had a margin of error of 1.6 percentage points and has
been reliable in past elections. Ecuador's elections board was to
release official results on Wednesday.
	   ``We've been the victims of a dirty campaign, but the people
knew how they should vote and, thank God, we have won!'' said
Mahuad, 48, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University.
	   Mahuad will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending a
17-month transitional government that took office when Congress
removed eccentric President Abdala Bucaram, nicknamed ``The Crazy
One,'' from power for ``mental incapacity'' amid street protests in
February 1997.
	   Naboa, Ecuador's richest man, had been backed by Bucaram.
	   Public anger and embarrassment over Bucaram's chaotic six-month
tenure helped Mahuad, who charged that Noboa was the former
president's puppet. Noboa ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's
government and was his close political ally.
	   For two days following Bucaram's ouster, Ecuador had three
people claiming to be president. Congress named Alarcon to replace
Bucaram, who fled to Panama.
	   Seeking to stabilize Ecuador's 19-year-old democracy, Mahuad
capitalized on the reputation as an honest, effective politician he
built up during his stint as Quito's mayor.
	   Voting was light as many soccer-mad Ecuadoreans chose to watch
the World Cup Final instead, disgusted by the nation's ongoing
political carousel. Ecuadoreans almost unanimously supported Brazil
to beat France.
	   Ecuadoreans have been called on to vote six times in elections
and referendums in the past two years.
	   ``We are all united, hoping for victory. Brazil's victory, of
course,'' said unemployed electrician Jose Caiza as he waited in
line to vote.
	   Noboa called himself the candidate of the poor despite his
wealth. He offered to create 1 million jobs and dish out the
``beating of the century'' to Ecuador's discredited political
elite.
	   Noboa's populist message narrowed Mahuad's wide lead in the
polls in the final days of the campaign. But fearful of a return to
chaos, voters ultimately supported Mahuad's promises of a
``serious, just'' government.
	   ``If the new president is another populist, we are going to
continue being Latin America's political oddity,'' said political
analyst Fabian Corrales.
	   Mahuad will inherit a country in economic crisis, staggered by
El Nino-driven floods and mudslides earlier this year, deepening
poverty and falling prices for its main export, oil.
	   His first task will be to rebuild much of the roads, bridges and
schools on the Pacific coast, which were washed away by El Nino's
rains.
	   Ecuador's state coffers are empty and the new president will
have to introduce tough austerity measures, economists say.
	   He must also decide the future of ongoing peace talks with
neighboring Peru. The two countries have fought three wars in the
past 57 years, and the sides are close to reaching an agreement to
end the dispute, diplomats say.
	   Mudslinging added to popular disgust during the campaign.
	   Mahuad was forced to admit he had a 10-year-old son from an
extramarital affair. Noboa also charged that drug money had entered
Mahuad's campaign. Mahuad denied that charge, and U.S. Ambassador
Leslie Alexander said there was no evidence of drug money in his
campaign.
	   ``Given the depth of this crisis, Ecuador doesn't need a
president _ we've had many _ we need a leader who will give us back
our faith,'' said columnist Jorge Ortiz of the national newspaper
Hoy.

World Cup: EcFrench launch into long night of partying

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 800,000 on Champs-Elysees; more quotes; TRIMS.
Version also moving with ``i'' category code. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French capital exploded in joy Sunday after the
hometown boys _ ``Les Bleus'' _ capped an amazing World Cup run
with France's first championship.
	   Horns resounded like a chorus across the city, announcing what a
month ago seemed like a faraway dream: a 3-0 win against Brazil.
Immediately, thousands filled the streets and began surging toward
the Champs-Elysees, the grand avenue crowned by the Arc de
Triomphe.
	   By midnight, there were 800,000 on the avenue, police said, and
the crowd was quickly growing. Revelers were so tightly packed it
was hard to walk.
	   French fans screeching for joy poured out of the stadium at
Saint-Denis, leaping past stunned, dejected Brazilians.
	   ``Amazing! World champions for the first time!'' shouted
Christian Junker, 19, carrying one end of a giant French flag. He
and two friends _ all with faces painted red, white and blue _ had
traveled from the Lorraine region and slept the previous night on
the grass, near the Eiffel Tower.
	   But were they tired? ``NO!'' they screeched. ``We're going to
the Champs-Elysees!''
	   ``This victory brings everyone together,'' said Cedric Trunzler,
21. ``There are many races and religions here. But we are all
French. We all won.''
	   Already on the Champs-Elysees, Alexandr &QC; IMQ 15, declared
her passion for Zinedine Zidane, the French star who scored two
goals. ``He's my love for life. He's the best player in the
world,'' she said.	   Shouts of ``We are the champions'' echoed from crowds moving
toward the avenue from Paris' Left Bank.
	   The sidewalks around the Louvre museum and the Tuileries gardens
were filled with thousands, some carrying flags, some dancing or
jumping on cars.
	   Youths used beer cans for soccer balls, or anything else they
could find.
	   ``We have shown the world we're the best at football. Now we'll
show them we're the best at partying,'' said Simone Perchais, who
feted the win in the Latin Quarter.
	   But actually, the partying begin hours before the match.
	   Beginning Sunday morning, Parisians sang the Marseillaise on the
subway, and perfect strangers shouted joyful cheers and chants to
each other across crowded streets.
	   Thousands of fans packed the square in front of Paris' ornate
City Hall, some perched on lampposts, bus stops, telephone booths
and even in trees to watch the game on the big screen there. Crowds
had gathered there at least eight hours before the match, just to
get a good seat.
	   The patriotic spirit was infectious. ``If you are proud to be
French, clap your hands!'' yelled the youths. Vincent Aigret, 20, a
student from Orleans, obliged. ``All of us together, all of us
together!'' he yelled back.
	   Even the Foreign Legion was in a party mood, with one
Legionnaire dancing the samba on the sidewalk.
	   A sizable but discreet security operation was in place Sunday
night to police the huge crowds, with riot troops camped at
strategic points across Paris.
	   They didn't need to worry about the Brazilians _ most were too
depressed to stay outside.
	   ``I'm going back to my hotel,'' said Jose Luiz Pascoal, 38, who
came from Rio de Janeiro to support the Brazilian team.
	   ``I just don't know what happened,'' he said outside the
stadium. ``I'm very, very sad. Won't be able to work for a week.''
	   Another, Irineu Siminetti, 17, said he was going to McDonalds to
try to forget the loss.
	   At a hotel bar on the Left Bank, 10 Brazilian fans drank
champagne and reflected on the loss.
	   ``Brazil was comatose,'' said Cesar Lapaglia, 27. ``We just
didn't play. And France deserved everything they got.''
	   For the French, the partying began early in Paris' sleepy
suburbs, too.
	   ``We`ve won. We`ve won. Wake up! Wake up!'' a group of young
people shouted in the western suburb of Maisons-Laffitte, dancing
down the street.
	   Small children raced around balconies in their pyjamas, and
firecrackers lit up the night sky.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Roger Clemens struck out 10 in the first five
innings for his fifth straight win and Ed Sprague homered twice
Sunday, leading Toronto to a 7-2 win over Detroit.
	   Jose Canseco hit a tie-breaking two-run double in the eighth
inning, and Shannon Stewart and Shawn Green added homers for the
Blue Jays.
	   Tony Clark homered as the Tigers lost for the third time in 10
games.
	   Clemens (10-6) gave up two runs and five hits in 7 1-3 innings.
It was his 86th career double-digit strikeout game and third this
year.
	   Detroit rookie Brian Powell allowed two runs and three hits with
no walks and three strikeouts, leaving after Sprague's leadoff
homer in the eighth. Reliever Doug Brocail (4-2) took the loss.
 &UR; Twins 11, Indians 6 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Rookie Eric Milton took a perfect game into the
sixth inning and David Ortiz drove in a career-high four runs for
Minnesota.
	   Milton (5-7) didn't allow a hit or baserunner until David Bell
hit his seventh homer with two outs in the sixth.
	   By then, the Twins had built a 10-0 lead on 13 hits off Charles
Nagy (7-6) and Jose Mesa.
	   Milton allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings, with
four strikeouts and no walks.
	   Nagy yielded six runs and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings, his
shortest outing in 19 starts this season. He allowed his major
league-high 26th homer.
	   Cleveland's Travis Fryman hit his 17th home run in the ninth,
his third homer in three days.
 &UR; Royals 4, White Sox 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Jeff Conine blooped an RBI single for his fourth hit
of the game as Kansas City scored twice in the ninth inning.
	   Shane Mack singled off Matt Karchner (2-3) and Dean Palmer
doubled off the top of the right-field wall before Jeff King hit a
game-tying sacrifice fly to right. Conine then dropped a single
into shallow right to score Palmer.
	   Scott Service (3-1) pitched 1 2-3 innings of hitless relief for
the win. Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 20th save,
striking out Chad Kreuter with the tying run at second to end it.
	   Magglio Ordonez and Wil Cordero hit back-to-back homers in the
second for Chicago.
	   Sal Fasano's fourth homer tied it 2-2 in the fourth.
 &UR; Yankees 9, Devil Rays 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburgh, Florida, the Yankees won their 10th straight
game for their longest winning streak in four years after scoring
seven ninth-inning runs.
	   The Yankees' 14th victory in 15 games enabled them to keep pace
with the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for baseball's best start this
century at 65-20.
	   The expansion Devil Rays have lost a season-high 10 straight.
	   New York loaded the bases with no outs against Roberto Hernandez
(0-4) without getting the ball past the mound, then took a 3-2 lead
when the Devil Rays closer hit Chuck Knoblauch with a pitch.
	   Derek Jeter followed with a two-run single and Tino Martinez
doubled off Scott Aldred to drive in three more runs and break the
game open.
	   David Wells pitched five innings for the Yankees before leaving
with a bruised right toe. Mike Stanton (4-0) pitched the final 1
1-3 innings for the victory.
 &UR; Orioles 11, Red Sox 7 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Eric Davis hit his 10th career grand slam and
drove in a season-high five runs as the Orioles completed their
first four-game sweep of Boston in 18 years.
	   Boston got a homer from Mo Vaughn in a six-run fifth before the
Orioles scored four runs in their half and held on.
	   Doug Johns (3-2) pitched 2 2-3 innings for his first major
league victory as a reliever and Alan Mills got four outs for his
first save.
	   It was Baltimore's first four-game winning streak since a
seven-game run in early April, and first at home against Boston
since July 25-27, 1961.
	   Vaughn went 3-for-4 with three RBIs for the Red Sox, whose
four-game losing streak is their longest since a six-game skid from
May 23-29.
	   Jin Ho Cho (0-2) lost his second major league start.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ After a long pause for him, Mark McGwire is
right back on track.
	   The St. Louis slugger, who ended a 21 at-bat homerless slump
with a game-winning shot on Saturday, hit his major league-leading
39th and 40th homers in Sunday's 6-4 victory over the Houston
Astros.
	   In the first inning, McGwire hit the first pitch he saw from
Sean Bergman (8-5) off the wall beyond the visitor's bullpen in
left field.
	   He struck out in the third and drew his major league-leading
19th intentional walk in the fourth before hitting No. 40 on a 2-1

Jones wins Quad City tournament

<TEXT>
	   COAL VALLEY, Illinois (AP) _ Steve Jones won his eighth PGA Tour
title and prevented another first-time winner with a one-stroke
victory over Scott Gump on Sunday in the dlrs 1.1 million Quad City
Classic.
	   Jones' 4-under-par 66 gave him a 17-under 263 total for his
first tournament win since the Bell Canadian Open last September.
The 1996 U.S. Open champion earned dlrs 279,000 with the victory.
	   Gump, who was trying to become the seventh first-time winner on
tour this year and the third in as many weeks, finished with a 68
for a 264 total, one stroke better than Kenny Perry, who closed
with a 68.
	   Gump was tied with Jones until he bogeyed No. 15 after driving
into the rough.
	   Defending champion David Toms had a final-round 71 and was
fourth at 266. His tee shot on No. 16 left him an unplayable lie
under a tree and he double-bogeyed to drop from one stroke behind
Jones to three.
	   ``I had a chance to win but didn't capitalize on it,'' Toms
said.
	   Brad Fabel, Fred Funk, Scott McCarron and D.A. Weibring all tied
for fifth at 13 under.
	   Jones eagled No. 6 when he drained a 25-foot (8-meter) putt and
he salvaged par on No. 12 with a long putt after his tee shot
rolled off the green, forcing him to chip up.
	   ``I had the putter going my way,'' Jones said. ``It's a big
boost for me because I have not been putting well all year.''
	   His other birdies came on a 25-foot (8-meter) putt at No. 1, a
six-foot (2-meter) putt after a sand wedge to three feet on No. 3
and a 15-foot (5-meter) putt on No. 11.
	   Casey Martin shot a final-round 69 and finished at 4-under 276.
It was enough for him to earn his first PGA check _ dlrs 3,178 _
since his landmark lawsuit for the right to ride carts in PGA
tournaments.
	   ``I played well the last few days. I just didn't score well,''
said Martin, whose bogeys for the weekend included a 30-yard
(27-meter) drive off the 18th tee Saturday. ``I know I can play
with these guys. I just didn't show what I've got.''
	   He said is returning to the Nike Tour, where he hopes to finish
within the top 15 to earn a 1999 PGA playing card.
	   Sunday's best round was a 6-under 64 by Scott Verplank, who
finished at 12-under 268.

Ronaldo not listed, then placed in Brazilian starting lineup

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Two-time FIFA Player of the Year
Ronaldo was kept off, then placed in Brazil's starting lineup for
Sunday night's World Cup final against France, and now the question
is whether the first decision was the correct one.
	   FIFA issued a statement saying the highly touted forward had his
left ankle examined earlier Sunday and was diagnosed with
tendonitis. He was given clearance by team doctors only 45 minutes
before kickoff.
	   But press officer Nelson Borges acknowledged after the 3-0 loss
that Ronaldo vomited after lunch and team doctors said he felt
dizzy.
	   The news that Ronaldo wouldn't play apparently sent shock waves
through the Brazilian team.
	   ``Ronaldo shouldn't have played,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo
said. ``The trauma was very great. It was a tough problem for me.
We gave the lineup without Ronaldo and that rattled the team
psychologically.
	   ``They were inhibited because Ronaldo wasn't going to play. I
said it was a strategy that Ronaldo would stay on the bench. I was
hiding the real situation.''
	   Edmundo and Bebeto were initially listed as the starting
strikers for Brazil, but within 15 minutes, World Cup officials
informed the media that the lineup was inaccurate and Ronaldo would
be starting the game.
	   Ronaldo was innefective throughout the match, getting only one
clear chance and that from a sharp angle that French goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez had covered.

World Cup: Brazilians call off planned celebrations after loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Sports-Soccer-Brazil-Celebrations?

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians reacted with shock and
disbelief as they watched their national soccer team lose 3-0 to
the French in the World Cup final on Sunday.
	   For many Brazilians, a fifth World Cup victory was a foregone
conclusion taken as another excuse to party and dance into the
night. But the unexpected defeat forced Brazilians to put off their
victory marches at least until 2002.
	   Brazilians had tears in their eyes and stared in shock at a
large public television screen mounted on Copacabana beach as the
game ended. It rained intermittently in Rio throughout the game,
discouraging many Brazilians from coming out and watching the game
in public.
	   Marinede da Costa, a 28-year-old secretary who watched the game
on the beach, maintained her composure after Brazil's defeat.
	   ``I think Brazil fought a lot. It just wasn't our day. We lost,
but second is still great,'' she said.
	   In Sao Paulo, Micheline Lagnado, a graphic designer, said she
was already looking forward to the World Cup competition to begin
in 2002.
	   ``The French deserved to win because they played better. ...
Hopefully we will get our fifth World Cup victory in 2002,'' she
said.
	   Despite the loss, Brazilians still let off a few fireworks
during the game, if only because they didn't want them to go to
waste. But after the game, the country was quiet and the mood
subdued.
	   The biggest post-game victory celebrations were abruptly called
off. Many streets near the beaches were blocked off to traffic on
Sunday in preparation for the celebrations.
	   The city of Rio called on more than 3,000 policemen to keep the
peace among what city officials expected to be hundreds of
thousands of crazed revelers. Those parties did not take place as
planned.
	   But not all parties came to a halt as a result of the game.
Edrizio Rodrigues, an unemployed 23-year-old Rio resident, said he
still intended to go out after the game.
	   ``I'm going to celebrate anyway. Brazilians are like that. It
wasn't our day, but at least we made it to the finals,'' he said.
	   A handful of Brazilian soccer fans went ahead with their
celebrations at a bar in Rio's fashionable Ipanema suburb, although
their samba was not quite as festive as it was after previous
games.

Commentators decry Brazil, Ronaldo, rather than praise Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INSERTS new fifth graf to update Ronaldo ill after lunch. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The pictures from Stade de France hadn't gone black
before commentators from around the world chimed in on France's
World Cup victory Sunday night _ or more like it Brazil's loss.
	   The general feeling was not that France had achieved a
remarkable victory, rather Brazil _ and a hobbled Ronaldo _ blew
it.
	   ``It is a shame we have not seen much of (Ronaldo),'' said
former Dutch forward Wim Kieft, a member of the 1988 European
championship team. ``Today especially because of the injury, but
there was also so much pressure on him.''
	   Ronaldo initially was listed among the substitutes in the
starting lineups distributed an hour before the start of the match.
The 21-year-old two-time FIFA Player of the Year had been taken to
a hospital earlier in the day for X-rays and was diagnosed with
tendonitis in his left ankle. But team doctors approved him 45
minutes before kickoff.
	   After the game, Brazilian team press officer Nelson Borges
acknowleged Ronaldo had vomited after lunch and team doctors said
he felt dizzy for a period.
	   ``The Brazilians were disappointing,'' Kieft said. ``France has
a great midfield, a strong defense but poor attackers.''
	   Former Scottish international and BBC analyst Alan Hansen also
seemed disappointed.
	   ``France won the World Cup without recognized strikers,'' he
said. ``It seems you can win by being very strong defensively and
having a very good midfielder.''
	   One congratulatory comment came from Italy.
	   ``A very well-deserved victory, a victory that doesn't leave a
shade of doubt,'' commentator Bruno Pizzul said on RAI state TV.
	   Egyptian commentator Mimi el-Shirbini also offered praise to the
French.
	   ``Congratulations (Didier) Deschamps for the five kilograms of
gold,'' el-Shirbini said on state-run television as the French
midfielder carried the World Cup Trophy. ``May God give us long
life to witness the coming World Cup.''
	   But most everybody else kept pointing the finger at Brazil _ and
Ronaldo.
	   ``This Ronaldo story will not end,'' former Dutch great Ruud
Gullit. ``If he was fit he would have come out for the warmup but
they didn't even come out. Something was going on in the locker
room. Everyone wants to find out what really happened there.''
	   ``Ronaldo wasn't fit on the day,'' Leicester City manager Martin
O'Niell said on the BBC. ``It was massive blow.

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The Harvard-educated mayor of Quito was
elected Sunday as Ecuador's next president on promises to end
rampant corruption and political chaos in this Andean country, an
exit poll showed.
	   Jamil Mahuad of the centrist Christian Democrat party received
53.6 percent of the vote, compared to 46.4 percent for banana
tycoon Alvaro Noboa, according to the poll sponsored by seven
television stations.
	   The poll had a margin of error of 1.6 percentage points and has
been reliable in past elections. Ecuador's elections board was to
release official results on Wednesday.
	   A second exit poll by the private company Cedatos gave Mahuad a
7 point lead, as well.
	   ``We've been the victims of a dirty campaign, but the people
knew how they should vote and, thank God, we have won!'' said
Mahuad, 48, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University.
	   But Noboa refused to concede defeat, saying his private exit
poll showed him narrowly ahead and accusing Mahuad's camp of fraud.
More than 70 foreign observers monitored the vote.
	   If the polls prove accurate, Mahuad will replace interim
President Fabian Alarcon, ending a 17-month transitional government
that took office when Congress removed eccentric President Abdala
Bucaram, nicknamed ``The Crazy One,'' from power for ``mental
incapacity'' amid street protests in February 1997.
	   Noboa, Ecuador's richest man, had been backed by Bucaram.

Ruling party suffers major upset in parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to update with Hashimoto's expected resignation;
latest election results, possible successors; RAISES details of
parliamentary situation; ADDS opposition calls for parliament's
dissolution &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was expected to
resign Monday following his ruling party's dismal performance in
parliamentary elections in which management of Japan's slumping
economy was the major issue.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of
the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ in Sunday's
elections, according to national broadcaster NHK television.
	   The number is far short of the 69 seats the LDP needed to regain
a majority in the chamber, which it lost in 1989, and fell far
short of matching its current strength of 61.
	   Counting seats that were not up for election, the Liberal
Democrats now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house, although they
may add more by wooing independent legislators.
	   Despite the election results, the conservative, pro-business
Liberal Democrats will continue to rule because they have firm
control over the more powerful lower house, which can pass the
national budget and choose the prime minister without the approval
of the upper house.
	   But without control over the smaller body, his party will need
the cooperation of other parties to pass key legislation.
	   Also, the LDP's embarrassing performance has led emboldened
opposition parties to begin calling for the dissolution of the
lower house and for general elections to be held soon.
	   ``The results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto
said. ``Everyone has handed down their judgment, and we must accept
that with sincerity.''
	   Hashimoto, who has been Japan's leader since January of 1996,
said he would announce his decision at a meeting of party leaders,
set for 12:30 p.m. Monday (0330 GMT). He refused to say what his
decision might be, but his comments suggested that he wanted to
resign.
	   Japanese newspapers listed LDP stalwarts Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, and former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as possible successors to Hashimoto.
	   With Japan in its worst recession since World War II, many
clearly voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to
get the economy back on track.
	   Unemployment is at a record high, consumer spending is
plummeting and Japan's financial system is on the verge of a
meltdown, with major banks saddled with massive bad loans.
	   Hashimoto's scheduled official visits to the United States and
France later this month are expected to be canceled, a national
newspaper Asahi reported.
	   ``Major setback for Liberal Democrats, Prime Minister to
resign,'' splashed the front-page headline in the nation's largest
newspaper Yomiuri in its morning edition.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama, and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa were
said to be possible successors.
	   With politics in turmoil in the short term as the Liberal
Democrats try to select Hashimoto's successor and a new Cabinet,
efforts to implement economic reforms may stall and send an already
skeptical market falling further.
	   But John Neuffer, a senior research fellow who follows Japanese
politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a Tokyo think tank,
said the opposition was too fragmented to pose a real threat to the
Liberal Democrats.
	   ``The LDP remains the only show in town when it comes to running
the government,'' he said.
	   If anything, in the long run, the electoral humiliation may
prompt the LDP and the government to work harder to get the economy
back on track, Neuffer said.
	   Toward the end of the campaign, the Liberal Democrats
flip-flopped on cutting income taxes, which many voters, as well
the United States, considered a key factor for economic recovery.
	   The Democrats _ a liberal, relatively new party that has
recently emerged as the main opposition threat to the LDP _
promised such a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   The Democrats won 27 seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in
the entire upper house house.
	   ``Voters have clearly said `No' to the Hashimoto
administration,'' said Democratic Party head Naoto Kan, a former
health minister. ``The people have lent an ear to what we said and
they are giving us a chance.''
	   ``Many people wanted a change in politics,'' said newly elected
Democrat lawmaker Akira Gunji on nationally broadcast election
news.
	   The Japan Communist Party, which strongly pushed for tax cuts,
won 15 seats, also a gain of nine, according to NHK, and now holds
23 seats in the house. The left-leaning Social Democrats, who lost
much of their credibility when they joined the ruling coalition
with the Liberal Democrats, won five seats, a loss of seven, and
now have 13 in all.

Morgan outduels Irwin in Senior Players Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ Gil Morgan opened a huge lead with
birdies on six of the first 10 holes and made it hold up for a
three-stroke victory over Hale Irwin in the Senior Players
Championship on Sunday.
	   Morgan shot 66 for a 21-under-par 267, breaking Dave Stockton's
1994 record of 17-under at the TPC of Michigan. Irwin, the Senior
PGA Tour's leading money-winner, closed with a 68 for 270.
	   It was the fourth win this season for Morgan, who collected dlrs
300,000 to increase his 1998 earnings to dlrs 1.3 million.
	   Irwin, the Senior circuit's leading money-winner with about dlrs
300,000 more than Morgan, started the round one shot down. He was
four feet (1.3 meters) from a birdie at No. 4 but ended up
three-putting to slip two strokes behind Morgan, who birdied two of
the first three holes.
	   Morgan turned up the heat with three straight birdies at Nos.
6-8 to get to 20-under and made the turn in 31.
	   Irwin recovered from his mistake at the fourth with birdies on
the next three holes, but couldn't make up any ground. He was at 33
at the turn, but three strokes behind Morgan.
	   Morgan made it a four-shot lead with a birdie on No. 10 and the
pair matched pars for the next several holes.
	   Irwin missed a six-foot (2-meter) birdie putt at the 15th that
left Morgan 4-up with three holes to play.
	   But Irwin pressed on, banging in a 10-foot (3-meter) birdie on
No. 16 to narrow the gap to three strokes. His sand shot from a
greenside bunker at the 17th stopped about two feet (65 cms) past
the pin and that birdie putt left him just two back of Morgan.
	   But the charge ran out of steam on the 18th when Irwin drove
into the wetland grass guarding the left side of the fairway. He
had to drop and wound up with bogey on the home hole, restoring
Morgan's three-stroke edge.
	   Despite an eagle at the par-5 third, sentimental favorite Jack
Nicklaus never made a serious charge. Nicklaus, whose streak of 154
majors will end when he skips the British Open this week, shot 70
for 279.
	   Isao Aoki finished third, shooting 69 for 275. Bob Murphy,
playing in the final threesome with Morgan and Irwin, shot 75 for
278. Jim Colbert, who won the tournament sponsored by Ford Motor
Co. in 1993, shot 67 for 278. Jose Maria Canizares finished with 69
for 280, one better than Lee Trevino had closed with 70.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Following an embarrassing setback in parliamentary
elections, embattled Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto hinted Sunday
that he would step down as head of the Liberal Democrats. Although
official results weren't expected until Monday morning, exit polls
showed the party capturing just 44 seats in the upper house of
Parliament, a loss of 17 seats from its current standing. ``The
results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto said.
``Everyone has handed down their judgment, and we must accept that
with sincerity.'' Japan is in its worst recession since World War
II. Unemployment is at a record high, consumer spending is
plummeting and Japan's financial system is on the verge of a
meltdown, with major banks saddled with massive bad loans.
(JAPAN-ELECTION)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Three young brothers who had
been asleep in their beds burned to death early Sunday in a
sectarian attack marking what shaken Northern Ireland leaders
termed a ``turning point'' in a violent stalemate over a blocked
Protestant march. The marchers, however, rejected calls _ some from
within their own ranks _ to back off from their confrontation with
police and soldiers near a rural church. The Orange Order, a
Protestant brotherhood, has been in a standoff with authorities
over plans to march through a Catholic neighborhood. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The Harvard-trained mayor of Quito was
elected Sunday as Ecuador's next president on promises to end
rampant corruption and political chaos in this Andean country, an
exit poll showed. Jamil Mahuad, of the centrist Christian Democrat
party, received 53.6 percent of the vote, compared to 46.4 percent
for banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa, according to the poll sponsored by
seven television stations. The poll had a margin of error of 1.6
percentage points and has been reliable in past elections.
Ecuador's elections board was to release official results on
Wednesday. (ECUADOR-ELECTION)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomats worked Sunday to find a
new approach to resolving the crisis in Kosovo, where weekend
clashes claimed the lives of at least nine people. In Bonn Sunday,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel telephoned his Western
counterparts to discuss the previous day's meeting with Russia's
Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow, a spokesman said. In an interview
published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel Sunday, Kinkel hinted at
a conference similar to the one that resulted in the Dayton peace
accord, which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``Perhaps we need a
process that resembles the one that took place in Dayton,'' he told
the paper. International officials are trying to prevent the
violence from spilling over into neighboring countries with
Albanian populations, including Albania and Macedonia.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Les Bleus did it. Two goals by their
beloved Zinedine Zidane beat champion Brazil on Sunday, giving
France its first World Cup and a jolt of glory so potent it
propelled millions into the streets from Paris to the tiniest of
villages. ``Zizou,'' the son of an Algerian night watchman in
Marseille, far outshined Brazil's Ronaldo, who nearly missed the
game with an injured ankle. France dominated the ball, played a
beautiful defense, and bulled through Brazil's backfield for a 3-0
victory. (SPORTS-SOCCER-BRAZIL-FRANCE)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's mother visited Prince Charles and
Prince Harry at their country home this weekend, Press Association
reported Sunday.
	   Charles was happy to see 13-year-old Harry get along well with
his grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd, the national news agency said.
Prince Charles invited her to visit when they met recently in
London.
	   The visit ``was said to have been a relaxed time,'' the agency
reported.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd went to Highgrove, the princes' estate in rural
Gloucestershire, on Friday and flew back to her home in Scotland on
Saturday.
	   Charles is said to have consulted with his former mother-in-law
about the decision to send Prince Harry to Eton, where his older
brother, Prince William, 16, is at school.
	   A Buckingham Palace spokesman refused to comment on the visit,
saying it was a private matter.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Woody Allen denies hiring young superstar
Leonardo DiCaprio for his new film ``Celebrity'' as a conscious
move to corner a more youthful, mainstream market for his movies.
	   ``I cast DiCaprio before `Titanic' came out,'' Allen says in the
issue of Newsweek magazine that hits newsstands Monday. ``He has 12
minutes in the film.''
	   Still, Allen's studio says having the teen heartthrob on board
can't hurt the mass marketability of the film due this fall.
	   ``If there's a chance for Woody to break through, this is it,''
said Miramax studio head Harvey Weinstein. ``Leo could open the
door.''
	   Allen, whose films have netted only modest earnings, remains
skeptical about his traditionally mature audience base changing any
time soon.
	   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' Allen said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   HOBOKEN, New Jersey (AP) _ Hoboken is honoring hometown hero
Frank Sinatra _ again _ by naming a waterfront park for the late
crooner.
	   How do you get there? Just take Frank Sinatra Drive.
	   Sinatra, who died in May, grew up in Hoboken, just across the
Hudson River from New York City.
	   His daughter, Nancy, and New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman
were scheduled to christen the park at a ceremony Tuesday.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ROANOKE, Virginia (AP) _ For years Annie Glenn, wife of
pioneering astronaut John Glenn, kept her mouth shut to avoid being
embarrassed by her stuttering. Then she got professional help.
	   Now she's helping others do the same.
	   Mrs. Glenn and her husband dedicated Hollins University's
expanded stuttering treatment facility on Saturday.
	   ``Unless you've lived with someone who has the problem, you
can't imagine how it can affect almost every aspect of their
life,'' said Glenn, the 76-year-old U.S. senator from Ohio who is
headed back into space this fall to research the effects of space
on aging.
	   Mrs. Glenn avoided telephones and wouldn't take a taxi because
she feared fumbling with directions to her destination. She was
afraid to go to parent-teacher conferences. When her husband became
a national hero in 1962 by being the first American to orbit the
Earth, she stayed in the background.
	   ``After John's flight, our children answered questions when the
media would set up at our house,'' Mrs. Glenn said. ``I didn't want
to be interviewed because of my stuttering.''
	   That changed in 1973 when became one of the first 100 people to
enter a Hollins Communications Research Institute program that
trains stutterers to better control the muscles used in speaking.
	   The new facility will enable the institute to treat more people
and help reduce the waiting list of those who want to enroll in the
three-week treatment program.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Sharon Stone helped raise dlrs 150,000 for
housing for the homeless, throwing in one of her Valentino gowns, a
kiss on the cheek and a ring off her finger to raise the bids.
	   With a gospel choir punctuating her calls with ``Hallelujah!''
Stone made a surprise offer by auctioning off an 18-carat jewel she
was wearing. It brought dlrs 3,600.
	   While selling Robin Williams' bathrobe, Stone goosed the bidding
Friday night by offering to throw in a peck on the cheek. The robe
fetched dlrs 650.
	   A Hollywood VIP premiere for two started at dlrs 400. When
bidding reached dlrs 5,000 Stone promised the loan of a Valentino
gown. ``You can keep the dress!'' she called out as bidding topped
dlrs 7,000.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After a weekend of more fighting in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, diplomats are searching for new ways
to stop the violence.
	   In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel called his Western
counterparts on Sunday to share ideas he had discussed a day
earlier with Russia's Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow the previous day,
a German spokesman said.
	   His diplomatic efforts came amid reports that nine people had
died in weekend fighting in Kosovo.
	   France and Britain have said they would introduce a resolution
in the U.N. Security Council threatening new measures against the
warring sides if they do not halt the fighting. Moscow opposes
using NATO military force in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
militants are fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   In an interview published in the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel
Sunday, Kinkel hinted that an effort similar to the 1995 Dayton
talks, which ended the Bosnian war, might be needed to end the
bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, are seeking
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have been killed since Febrary when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Albanian
separatists who had been attacking Serb police and military
facilities.
	   Both sides reported fresh causalities Sunday. According to Serb
sources, two Serb policemen were killed when Albanian militants
attacked checkpoints along the province's main roads. Meanwhile,
the militant ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army said seven
fighters were killed in clashes over the weekend.
	   Fighting was reported near the village of Lodga, a KLA
stronghold and a reputed center for weapons smuggling from Albania.
	   On Sunday there were independent reports of sporadic shooting
and a reinforcement of both sides' barricades around Pec. Lodga is
located just outside of Pec.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to moderate ethnic
Albanian leaders, said Sunday the KLA had handed over three
Yugoslav army deserters to an international humanitarian group. The
report, which could not be independently confirmed, did not say
which group was involved.
	   The deserters, handed over late Saturday, were all from
Montenegro, the smaller republic of Yugoslavia, the center said. It
said the militant KLA still holds more deserters.

Request for indictment of US Marines goes before Italian court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after start of closed hearing, scheduled about
0900 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ Already facing a court-martial in the
United States, two crew members of a Marine jet that severed a ski
gondola cable in the Alps risk further legal action in Italy.
	   An Italian prosecutor was scheduled to request the indictment of
the crew in an Italian court on Monday.
	   Twenty people were killed in the Feb. 3 accident, which set off
a crisis in U.S.-Italian relations and demands by some for a
closing of U.S. bases in Italy.
	   Trento Prosecutor Francantonio Granero has pushed for
manslaughter charges in Italy, even though the Italian government
has acquiesced in American prosecution of the four crewmen.
	   Monday's hearing, which was being closed to the public, was
scheduled to take place just three days after a U.S. general
ordered two of the crewmen tried for manslaughter.
	   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Corps Forces Atlantic,
ruled Friday that there is enough evidence for a court-martial for
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, the pilot, and Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer,
the navigator.
	   The general dismissed charges against the two back-seat officers
on the jet.
	   An Italian judge must rule on Granero's indictment request.
	   The United States insists it has sole jurisdiction in the case
because of a NATO treaty. Washington maintains the EA-6B Prowler
was flying under the auspices of NATO when it sent the ski gondola
crashing to the ground, killing 19 skiers and the gondola operator.
	   Granero argued that the plane violated the NATO treaty's
mandated flight patterns, and therefore the flight should be
considered a U.S. mission _ which would give Italy jurisdiction.
Granero also is challenging the constitutionality of the NATO
treaty.
	   Even if indicted, the crew is unlikely to come to Italy to face
justice.
	   Italian law allows defendants to be tried in absentia.
	   Seeking the indictment, on charges of multiple manslaughter and
endangering the safety of transport, was well within Granero's
powers; Italian prosecutors have a large measure of independence.
	   The crew's Italian lawyers say the Americans are victims of a
``conflict of power'' between the government and the Italian
courts.
	   They are in the ``paradoxical situation of a double trial and of
a possible double conviction for the same deeds,'' the lawyers,
Bruno and Antonio Malattia, said in a statement Saturday.
	   Granero has also requested the indictment of three top U.S.
military officials at the Aviano base in northern Italy, where the
jet was stationed.

Yen plunges after Japan's ruling party suffers election setback

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen plunged against the U.S. dollar Monday
after Japan's ruling party suffered a stunning defeat in
parliamentary elections.
	   In early trading, the dollar bought 144.06 yen, up 2.73 yen from
its level of 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading, also on Friday.
	   The dollar began its surge in early Asian trading as investors
dumped the yen following the surprisingly poor showing of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's election for Japan's
upper house of Parliament.
	   Also contributing to the yen's weakness was the expectation that
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will resign later Monday to take
responsibility for the setback.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of
the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ according to
national broadcaster NHK television.
	   The number is far short of the 69 seats the LDP needed to regain
a majority in the chamber, which it lost in 1989, and fell far
short of matching its current strength of 61.
	   Counting seats that were not up for election, the Liberal
Democrats now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house, although they
may add more by wooing independent legislators.
	   Despite the election results, the conservative, pro-business
Liberal Democrats will continue to rule because they have firm
control over the more powerful lower house, which can pass the
national budget and choose the prime minister without the approval
of the upper house.
	   But the Sunday result suggests widespread frustration in Japan
with the LDP's inability to come up with the right policies to get
Japan's recession-plagued economy back on the track toward
recovery.
	   ``The results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto
said. ``Everyone has handed down their judgment, and we must accept
that with sincerity.''
	   Hashimoto, who has been Japan's leader since January of 1996,
said he would announce his decision at a meeting of party leaders,
set for 12:30 p.m. Monday (0330 GMT). He refused to say what his
decision might be, but his comments suggested that he wanted to
resign.

Taliban edict bans television as entertainment options fade

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A shattered satellite dish hangs from
the steel door of a Kabul police station. Strung like streamers on
either side are coils of tape ripped from videocassettes, banned as
offensive to Islam by the Taliban.
	   The religious army has stepped up its campaign to rid
Afghanistan of influences it considers contrary to Islam, last week
adding television sets, videocassette recorders and satellite
dishes to the cassettes already outlawed.
	   Afghans have 15 days to get rid of some of the last bits of
entertainment left to them since the Taliban army took over Kabul
in 1996 and consolidated its authority over the majority of the
country.
	   The Taliban says its latest ban will give people more time to
pray.
	   ``They should spend their time going to the mosque and learning
about prayer,'' said Haji Mullah Qalamuddin, a Taliban government
official. ``We want to reform society and make it 100 percent
Islamic.''
	   There was no television just before the Taliban takeover, but
that was because there was no electricity _ a four-year civil war
between the government and opposing Islamic groups had destroyed
power lines and hydroelectric stations.
	   The relentless fighting destroyed entire neighborhoods of Kabul
and left up to 50,000 people _ mostly civilians _ dead.
	   After the Taliban threw out President Burhanuddin Rabbani and
took control of the capital, they brought relative peace, returned
electricity to the shattered city and began their campaign to
impose their harsh version of Islamic law.
	   Music was one of the first casualties.
	   Within days, everything except religious songs were banned.
Taliban soldiers gouged open audio cassettes and ripped out the
tape, hanging kilometers (miles) of it on fence posts.
Afghanistan's only radio station was ransacked and its library of
music destroyed.
	   Religious policemen stopped vehicles and searched for hidden
tapes, warning owners to spend their time in the mosque.
	   Taliban edicts, which critics say are rooted more in tribal
traditions than in the Koran, or Muslim holy book, also put severe
restrictions on women.
	   They were driven indoors, forced off the job, ordered to wear
the all-enveloping burqa. Schools for girls were closed. Women were
beaten for stepping outdoors without a male relative.
	   The Taliban also suggested that people paint their first-floor
windows black to stop prying eyes from seeing women inside.
	   Television and videos eased women's boredom and were a reminder
of a time before the streets of Kabul were patrolled by the Taliban
police, who publicly beat anyone who defies Taliban rules.
	   ``It was like having a little part of our life from the past,''
said Ashia Jamila, who was a teacher before the Taliban arrived.
	   The only movie theater in Kabul, which usually showed Indian
movies featuring dancing girls and romantic love stories, was shut
down. The Taliban also outlawed any books and other publications
published outside Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban banned videocassettes without explanation last year,
but did not expand that edict to the recorders and other appliances
until last week.
	   ``Televisions and these dishes are corrupting the morals of the
young people in Kabul,'' Qalamuddin said.
	   Many of Afghanistan's poor had homemade television antennas,
made of bicycle chains, metal pots and wire. The makeshift antennae
picked up Russian, Iranian and Pakistani channels, but the
reception was poor.
	   ``You can't really see the picture but you can hear a little of
what is being said,'' said a woman who gave her name only as Haila.
	   The latest Taliban edict has infuriated the estimated 200 shop
owners who fix and sell television sets and dishes. They have
signed a petition asking Taliban authorities for more time.
	   ``What are we supposed to do with all our television sets?''
asked shopkeeper Ghulam Mohammed. ``I am not going to throw them
out on the street and smash them.''
	   Since the announcement, some residents have been scrambling to
find buyers for their television sets. Mohammed sent away a woman
who brought her 18-inch set, telling her to throw it away.
	   But most people say they won't destroy their television sets.
They will hide them, and dismantle their satellite dishes.
	   One resident, Abdullah Jan, bought a dish just to watch the
World Cup soccer competition in France.
	   ``When it's finished I will pack everything away and just keep
it hidden,'' he said. ``Maybe things will change again and we will
be able to use it. Who knows?''

Massive manhunt under way for possible communist intruders

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Army soldiers and police, assisted by
helicopter gunships, scoured rocky mountains on South Korea's east
coast Monday for possible communist intruders, a day after the body
of a suspected North Korean spy was found.
	   The search was launched after the military discovered, along
with the diving suit-clad body, a self-propelled, semi-submersible
craft capable of helping infiltrate up to five agents.
	   The 157 centimeter (4.75-foot)-long device, powered by
batteries, was similar to ones used by North Korean infiltrators in
the past.
	   ``We must be prepared for a possibility that some armed agents
could have come ashore,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Kang Jun-kwon
said.
	   After imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew, thousands of soldiers and
police laid ambushes overnight along strategic inland access routes
on the east coast but failed to detect any traces of intruders.
	   The man's body was found washed ashore about 2 kilometers (1.25
miles) from a major naval base at Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul.
	   Quoting military doctors, the Defense Ministry said earlier that
the body was believed to have been dead ``less than 24 hours.''
	   The body had no visible signs of injuries or wounds, indicating
that the death was a result of heart failure, it said.
	   Found with the body were a Czech-made machine gun, a hand
grenade, a portable oxygen tank, a dagger, a radio set and a sea
map showing underwater features along South Korea's east coast.
	   ``The types of weapons found indicate that the dead spy was from
the operations department under the direct control of (North
Korea's ruling) Workers' Party,'' the chief Defense Ministry
investigator said.
	   The department is notorious for its aggressive intelligence and
infiltration operations against South Korea. The two Koreas remain
technically in a state of war, with no peace treaty signed at the
end of their 1950-53 Korean war.
	   It was the third North Korean infiltration reported along the
east coast, coming less than three weeks after a Northern submarine
was found tangled in a fishing net on June 22.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   Military officials ruled out the possibility that the body found
Sunday was that of an agent from the sub.
	   On Sept. 18, 1996, a shark-class North Korean submarine was
found stranded in the general area off the east coast, touching off
a 53-day manhunt for the craft's 26 occupants who came ashore.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.
	   The latest sign of North Korean infiltration attempts prompted
South Korea's Defense Ministry to warn Sunday night that it would
not tolerate further provocations.
	   ``It's a clear armistice violation and military provocation,''
Kang Jun-kwon, a ministry spokesman, said in a statement.
	   The case occurred when South Korea, assisted by the U.N.
Command, was still trying to obtain an apology from North Korea for
the alleged June infiltration.
	   ``We once again urge North Korea to stop reckless armed
provocations and warn sternly that we would not tolerate this kind
of action any more,'' Kang said.
	   Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek, cutting short his trip to the
United States, was to fly back to Seoul on Monday. Chun, who met
Defense Secretary William Cohen in Washington last week, had
planned to return home Wednesday after visiting Hawaii.
	   The Koreas, divided into the communist North and the capitalist
South in 1945, are still technically at war, since their 1950-53
Korean war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

parliamentary elections.

	   MERU NATIONAL PARK, Kenya (AP) _ Flying high above the treetops,
a bush pilot taps on a laptop computer to activate a beacon mounted
on a collar around an elephant's neck.
	   Instantly, the laptop screen lights up with a series of squares
that track the great bull's wanderings at one-hour intervals for
the past month.
	   By recording elephants' movements with Global Positioning System
satellites 17,600 kilometers (11,000 miles) above the Earth, Iain
Douglas-Hamilton and the Kenya Wildlife Service are learning about
elephants' needs and how better to protect them.
	   ``We still think the ivory trade is the greatest short-term
threat to elephants,'' Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the
Elephants, said. ``But we also are very aware that the future of
elephants lies in resolving conflicts with local people.''
	   The Global Positioning System can help rangers deploy better to
prevent poaching, and to help elephants be better neighbors, he
said.
	   Touted as the biggest navigational advance since mariners
learned to read their position by the stars with sextants, GPS
relies on a galaxy of 26 U.S. Air Force satellites traveling in six
orbits.
	   The satellites transmit signals on a schedule precisely
controlled by atomic clocks. A receiver automatically selects the
three satellites most favorably located and relays their signals to
a computer, which calculates the position of the receiver by
solving three simultaneous algebraic equations. Use of a fourth
satellite adds altitude.
	   The system Douglas-Hamilton uses is accurate to within 43 meters
or 47 yards. (The U.S. military can pinpoint a location within 30
feet (9 meters), but only American forces are equipped to get that
much accuracy from the satellites.)
	   The GPS-linked system has huge advantages over conventional
radio tracking, which requires a new flyover each time researchers
want to know where an elephant is. The GPS system stores up a
month's worth of precise location data, then transmits it to an
airplane in a single burst.
	   On a recent sun-drenched day, Douglas-Hamilton led with military
precision an operation to install a GPS collar on a 10th Kenyan
elephant.
	   Before nearby Mount Kenya had shed its morning cloak of clouds,
an air search began for one of two herds of 200 elephants in Meru
National Park, among Kenya's least visited, most unspoiled parks _
and a target of ivory poachers.
	   When a healthy, 27-year-old bull was spotted, a helicopter
zoomed in and a veterinarian fired a tranquilizing dart with a
needle the size of a nail into the animal's rump.
	   Within minutes, the behemoth fell with a dusty thump, his thick
legs splayed front and back, feather-duster eyelashes flapping
placidly.
	   The bull's treasure and curse, polished ivory tusks, measured
nearly 88 centimeters (3 feet) long. Already this year, seven of
his brethren were slain by poachers. Their tusks sell for dlrs 43
per kilogram (dlrs 20 per pound) to black market carvers in
Khartoum, Sudan, and elsewhere.
	   Ivory poachers slaughtered an estimated 147,000 Kenyan elephants
in the 1970s and 1980s. There are 27,000 alive in this East African
country today.
	   Douglas-Hamilton climbed atop the dozing elephant's shoulder to
haul around the 5-kilogram (11-pound) collar crafted from thick
machine belting. With a battery-powered screwdriver, he added an
extension so the collar would hang loosely _ even at 27 an elephant
needs plenty of growing room.
	   Dangling like a pendant at the bottom of the collar was a
lithium battery, expected to last 1 1-2 years. Bolted to the top
like a clasp was the GPS antenna, plus a standard VHF transmitter.
	   The elephant's tattered ears were doused with water to keep him
cool. The vet held his hand to the trunk to be sure the beast was
breathing normally. A dozen armed rangers provided protection.
	   Operation over in less than 15 minutes, the bull was given a
reviving injection. He toppled twice in his struggle to regain
consciousness, then wandered off into the scrub brush, the collar
recording his movements.
	   The tracking collars cost dlrs 6,800 each, and were designed by
Lotek Engineering of Ontario, Canada, to track caribou in Quebec.
The collars had to be strengthened for elephants _ a German-made
prototype lasted for just 10 days.
	   Although initially irritating to the elephant, the collar does
not harm the animal, Douglas-Hamilton said.
	   Meru's warden, Maurice Barasa, is optimistic the sophisticated
tracking system will enable him to crack down on the lingering
poachers in the park, where Joy and George Adamson once raised
orphaned lion cubs until they were old enough to be returned to the
wild.
	   A decade ago, poachers ruled here. Two French tourists were shot
dead when they unwittingly drove into a poacher hideout. The late
George Adamson and the Kenyan government made a largely successful
effort to rout them, but some remain.
	   Barasa has 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles) to
protect, and when the animals leave the park and reserve, he
remains responsible for them. He has just 60 rangers, plus one
pilot, to patrol.
	   ``Being able locate the elephants with GPS will make us faster
on the ground,'' he said.
	   Poachers usually stick to routes where they know they can find
water and food. ``If we know the herd is in the general area where
there is a potential threat, we could surround it and cut off the
bandits' routes,'' Barasa said.
	   Douglas-Hamilton said the GPS collars already have helped save
elephants.
	   By putting GPS beacons on two bulls in Amboseli National Park
300 kilometers (185 miles) to the south, he was able to document
what researcher Cynthia Moss previously had reported _ that Kenya's
protected animals spend much of their time across the border in
Tanzania.
	   The data helped persuade Tanzanian authorities to formally ban
all hunting near the border after four Amboseli bulls were killed
in Tanzania in 1994. Kenya does not permit hunting, but Tanzania
does.

In remote China, Tibetans reclaim lives from communist ruins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY309-312 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZHONGDIAN, China (AP) _ With saws, chisels and thick beams of
pine, Tibetans on a windswept plateau are engaged in a communal act
of faith.
	   Half-built Buddhist temples two and three stories high and
clusters of monks' dormitories _ the labor of 14 years _ are rising
from a hillock where radical communists once reduced the
300-year-old Gedan Songzan monastery to ruins.
	   Like the monastery, which a Buddhist emperor dubbed the ``Temple
of Transformation,'' the Tibetans of the Diqing region are
reclaiming their lives from the harshest intrusions of communist
Chinese rule.
	   They practice their Buddhism and adore the Dalai Lama, hanging
his picture in temples and on home altars. Local Communist Party
politicians, many of them ethnic Tibetans, profess sympathy with
Buddhism and some even admire the exiled Dalai Lama.
	   But Diqing is part of China proper, not Tibet, and its people
appear reconciled to Chinese rule. A mountain pass away, inside
Chinese-controlled Tibet, photos of the Dalai Lama are banned.
Monks and nuns are forced to denounce their spiritual leader as a
separatist and charlatan. Officials seen as favoring the Dalai Lama
are purged.
	   Diqing demonstrates that the Tibetan issue, popularly portrayed
in the West as a straightforward case of mass religious
persecution, is more complex. In remote places like Diqing, Tibetan
culture passes less molested apparently because the locals don't
challenge Beijing's authority. In Tibet, China has answered
persistent calls for independence with relentless oppression.
	   If Chinese leaders ever sit down with the Dalai Lama to
negotiate Tibetan autonomy _ as President Clinton urged they do
during his Beijing summit last month _ Diqing may point the way to
compromise.
	   From Diqing in Yunnan province in the south to Gansu province in
the north, visitors report a resurgence in Tibetan culture and
little government interference all along the 1,000-kilometer
(600-mile) frontier between Chinese and Tibetan civilizations.
	   From its broad valleys surrounded by snowy peaks to the flat
roofs on towering houses, Diqing _ pronounced DEE-ching _ looks
Tibetan. Women in colorful wool aprons haggle over the price of yak
butter in markets. Buddhist pilgrims prostrate themselves on stone
temple floors before gilded images.
	   Chinese shops line the streets of its towns, heirs to a
centuries-old trade that brought Chinese tea through Diqing to
exchange for Tibetan salt and wool. In recent decades, Chinese
settlers have come to log the tree-covered mountains and open
restaurants.
	   ``People here get along with each other,'' said Qi Zhala,
Communist Party secretary for Diqing's Zhongdian county, whose
family came from Tibet 14 generations ago. His aide, Sun Jiong, a
Chinese, calls the area ``a model of stability.''
	   The ruin of nearly a half century of Chinese communist rule is
everywhere evident. Elderly monks, some bent from years of forced
labor, wander broken-down monasteries. Slopes once thick with pine
trees are denuded.
	   Forests passed lightly touched until the Chinese brought
commercial logging to the region in the late 1950s. Now provincial
forestry officials estimate at least a fifth of the virgin pines
are gone.
	   ``The effect on the environment has been disastrous. Many places
have become unfit for plant life,'' Qi said. In an implicit
criticism of Chinese rule, the county party leader noted that
``Tibetans' traditional outlook is that the forests should be
protected.''
	   Tibetans, too, have shared in the exploitation. Chain saws buzz
through supposed nature reserves cutting virgin pine for use in
local houses.
	   Much of the Gedan Songzan monastery, once Diqing's largest, lies
in clumps of broken stone and charred beams scattered across a
hillside outside the town of Zhongdian.
	   Officials carrying out Mao Tse-tung's radical Cultural
Revolution 32 years ago destroyed the 300-year-old temple in two
weeks. To spread the complicity, every village in Zhongidan county
was forced to send workers to take part in the destruction.
	   Those same villages have sent legions of hands and hundreds of
thousands of dollars to rebuild the monastery since the government
relaxed bans on religion in 1984.
	   Luozang Nangpo, the master carpenter who has supervised the
reconstruction, had to learn the fine points of temple building in
secret from an 80-year-old artisan during the Cultural Revolution.
	   ``This is my contribution to religion,'' Luozang said. ``We
Tibetans have to do this because we have the skills. The Chinese
don't.''
	   Eight residential colleges have been put up so far, housing 500
monks _ still only a fraction of the 2,000 who once lived there.
	   For a sign of the complex ties at work in the renaissance look
at the monastery's abbot, Luosang Tudan. He spent 32 years exiled
in India with the Dalai Lama and the elite of Tibet's religious
hierarchy before returning to Zhongdian, his birthplace in 1991.

	   PARIS (AP) _ ``We are the champions!'' The cry, powered by
honking horns, whistles and the indescribable noises of sheer joy,
resounded around France, a nation basking in its World Cup victory
over Brazil.
	   From the Mediterranean port city of Marseille to Lille in the
north, France cheered for itself unabashedly.
	   In Paris, the joy exploded, with at least one million people
jamming the Champs-Elysees, according to police.
	   ``We dreamed it would be a good night, but never this good,''
said Josephine Bequin, 41, her face painted with the blue, white
and red colors of France and the 3-0 score written on her cheeks.
	   ``Beating Brazil by three goals was beyond our wildest
expectations. We'll be up all night,'' she said, heading from the
Latin Quarter to the Champs-Elysees.
	   The Marseillaise, the national anthem, resounded in the streets
of Toulouse and at the Palais des Sports packed to capacity with
5,000 people watching the match on a giant screen. It was a rare
show of patriotism for the usually discrete people of southwestern
France.
	   In Bordeaux, some 40,000 people watched the match on a giant
screen at the Mondial Cafe in the city center, moving toward the
Place de la Victoire at the final whistle.
	   There was a special celebration at Bordeaux's Nulle Part
Ailleurs restaurant, owned by French team star Zinedine Zidane --
who scored two goals -- and Christophe Dugarry, who also played.
	   Dugarry's brother, David, sprayed the crowd with Champagne at
the close of the match.
	   In Lille, some merrymakers jumped into the fountain in the
central square, awash in French flags.
	   In Marseille, some 40,000 people thronged the streets, according
to police, with 20,000 at the Prado beach where they followed the
match on a giant screen.
	   ``This is the most beautiful day of my life ...,'' said Gerard
Gianni, who tends bar at the Cours Pierre Puget. ``We're going to
party until July 14,'' he said, referring to Bastille Day Tuesday,
France's national day.
	   ``Zizou, Zizou,'' shouted the the crowds, using their
affectionate name for Zidane, who hails from north Marseille.
	   ``When Zidane scored, I thought my heart would stop ...,'' said
Jules Fernandez, a city employee.
	   ``My father told me about the Liberation of Marseille,'' he
said, referring to World War II. ``I'm sure that what we're living
at this moment must be like that.''

	   ``The Chinese government said they were supporting religious
freedom. Teachers were needed for this monastery,'' said the gaunt,
61-year-old abbot as he issued blessings to leathery-faced farmers
and young monks with freshly shaven heads in a small prayer hall.
	   The revival is not only religious. Excessive logging has been
outlawed, and the local government is providing seed money to
encourage start-up businesses and tourism as part of a campaign to
raise incomes _ now about 800 yuan (dlrs 100) a year for farmers _
and to preserve traditional culture.
	   Across the provincial boundary in Tibet, the Chinese government
has made religion a battleground to strengthen its 47-year rule.
Intent on wiping out separatist sentiment, Beijing launched a purge
two years ago of Dalai Lama supporters among the strongly
pro-independence clergy. One monitoring group estimates nearly
4,000 clergy have been expelled.
	   Officials in Diqing insist there have been no purges, no
denunciation campaigns and, also unlike Tibet, no limits on the
numbers of monks and nuns in monasteries. Monks agree.
	   ``Our government is concerned with the economy. They don't
bother us,'' said Luosang Jumen, a 25-year-old monk at Gedan
Songzan.
	   Still, if Luosang wants to fulfill his dream of traveling to
India to see the Dalai Lama and study Buddhism, he will have to
make the trip illegally, sneaking across the Himalayan border to
evade border guards.

<TEXT>
	   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) _ For the Kola Peninsula, the Iron Curtain
was brought down only to have a Silver Curtain close in its place.
	   It marks the chasm of wealth that splits Europe's Arctic between
poor and chaotic Russia and the wealthy, orderly Nordic states.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West's Cold War
fears of nuclear attack from the Kola have been replaced by anxiety
about the spread of atomic radiation, industrial pollution, disease
and social unrest.
	   The peninsula, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) north of St.
Petersburg and on the Barents Sea, is home to strategically located
military harbors as well as pristine forest and stark tundra.
	   Offering the Russian navy a sea corridor to the North Atlantic,
it is the only place where Russia borders the European Union, at
neutral Finland, or NATO, at Norway.
	   Few frontiers have a greater contrast in living standards. Finns
and Norwegians earn perhaps 30 times more than their Kola
neighbors, in addition to having generous education, health and
welfare services.
	   Good jobs dried up on the Kola along with the decrease in
Russian military spending after the Cold War.
	   In an outdoor market, Fiina Torchinkova tries to make a living
by selling shoes, after working as a photographer for 12 years. ``I
make enough to buy a piece of bread, and maybe some butter if I am
lucky,'' she says.
	   As the base for the once-powerful Russian North Fleet, the Kola
still is home to 155 nuclear submarines, although 71 of them are
derelict. And it has eight nuclear-powered icebreakers.
	   It is those deteriorating vessels that have the peninsula's
Western neighbors worried. In 1996, a report by the Norwegian
environmental group Bellona said about two-thirds of the nuclear
waste ever dumped in the world's oceans lies off the Kola.
	   Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, has spent about
160 million kroner (dlrs 21 million) on Kola environmental
projects. The European Union and the United States also are
involved in similar projects.
	   Nordic countries, notably Norway, are augmenting environmental
projects with programs to shore up the Kola's collapsed health and
social services.
	   ``The challenge is to show the public, not in the least on the
Kola, that some progress is being made,'' said Geir Hunneland, a
Norwegian expert on the Kola.
	   For peninsula residents, immediate survival overshadows
long-term dangers from radiation and pollution. Even those with
jobs often don't get paid. And there is little of a social safety
net for those without work.
	   Life on the tundra can be extremely harsh. Some homes lack heat
on 40 degree C (F) winter nights. There are few jobs, money for
food is short, and medicine often is unavailable.
	   Life expectancy has plunged to 47 years for men and 48.9 years
for women. That's about 30 years less than their Nordic neighbors.
	   About 200 kilometers (125 miles) to the east of Murmansk, a
rough road ends at the village of Lovozero. There Europe's largest
and most pristine wilderness stretches in unbroken grandeur south
to the shores of the White Sea.
	   Murmansk, on a long bay near the middle of the Kola, is the
biggest city anywhere in the Arctic. Its 500,000 people are a
reminder of the days when Soviet rulers sent thousands of soldiers,
miners and others to the peninsula, pushing the population from a
few thousand to more than a million.
	   Nearly 10 percent of the Kola's population has deserted the area
over the past five years, and many more would go if they could.
	   An increasing number of those stuck on the Kola take cheap bus
junkets to nearby Norway, Sweden and Finland, often to sell
trinkets or smuggled alcohol and tobacco, engage in prostitution or
_ merchants charge _ to shoplift.
	   Norwegian health officials, among others, now fear the spread of
diseases like cholera _ considered eradicated in the Nordic
countries but which hit the Kola over the winter.
	   ``We are especially concerned about the new and reemerging
diseases that threaten the public health situation in Europe,''
said Norway's deputy foreign minister, Aaslaug Haga.

Cipollini's tragedy is Boardman's salvation in Tour de France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ British speed champion Chris Boardman
will start Monday's second stage of the Tour de France still
donning the leader's yellow jersey after a last-minute tumble cost
his chief Italian opponent a chance at victory.
	   Mario Cipollini posed the major threat to Boardman's points lead
as Sunday's opening stage reached a tense, furious conclusion in
Dublin's Phoenix Park.
	   But one of Cipollini's Saeco teammates collided with another
rider right in front of him as the bulk of 189 cyclists cleared the
park's broad entrance and began sprinting for the finish line. Six
riders in all fell, but Cipollini was the one who most lost out.
	   ``His crash was a stroke of luck for me,'' said Boardman, who
remained No. 1 for the French Gan team thanks to his victory
Saturday in the Tour's opening short time trial. ``I'm really sorry
he fell, but it meant I could hold onto the yellow jersey.''
	   ``I'm reluctant to leave Dublin, because the public here have
given me such outstanding support,'' added Boardman, whose English
home lies about 200 miles (320 kms) east of Dublin. In the absence
of any Irish competitors, he became a local favorite.
	   Cipollini, a flamboyant sprinter who had hoped to reproduce his
1997 stage-one victory, suffered ``contusions multiples'' _ plenty
of bruises _ but expects to race Monday.
	   Sunday's stage winner, Belgium national champion Tom Steels,
said the narrow victory took a tremendous amount of pressure off of
him and felt ``something like revenge.''
	   Steels, riding for the Italian team Mapei-Bricobi, was expelled
from the 1997 Tour after throwing his water bottle at another rider
during the closing sprint of stage six.
	   Another 174 riders shared Steels' winning time of 4 hours, 29
minutes and 58 seconds, reflecting the professional cycling world's
policy of not recording split-second differences in packed groups.
	   Germany's star sprinter Erik Zabel missed a good shot of winning
his first-ever Tour stage victory, falling behind Steels in the
final 100 yards (meters). Like most of the others in the pack, he
hadn't fared well enough in the Saturday prologue to pose a points
threat to Boardman even with a win.
	   Boardman finished 39th, while last year's Tour winner, Germany's
Jan Ullrich, finished 62nd. Cipollini finished 184th, 3 minutes 40
seconds behind the mark.
	   Boardman knows he'll be vulnerable to losing his shirt Monday
when the race heads 128 miles (205.5 kms) along Ireland's southern
coast to the port of Cork.
	   That will mark the end of the Tour's first sojourn into Ireland
in its 95-year existence. The race resumes Tuesday in France's
Brittany region and concludes Aug. 2 in Paris.

Schumacher wins confused British GP; third straight victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Did he or didn't he win the British
Grand Prix?
	   For three hours after the race, Michael Schumacher wasn't
certain _ and neither were race officials, tangled up in one of
Formula One's strangest finishes.
	   With Schumacher's Ferrari leading by more than 20 seconds Sunday
as he raced around the 60th and final lap _ just seconds from
taking the flag _ he surprisingly drove into the pits.
	   Pursuing in a McLaren, Mika Hakkinen flashed across the finish
line. Television monitors showed Hakkinen had won. Then they showed
Schumacher had. British television commentators calling the race
admitted they didn't know who'd won.
	   ``I was not sure what was going on,'' Schumacher admitted later.
``I didn't even know where the finish line was.''
	   In the pit, Schumacher climbed out of his car, gazed around for
a clue, shrugged _ and then got a thumbs-up sign for his brother
Ralf, who drives for Jordan.
	   Schumacher did win, but he did it driving down pit lane _
parallel to the track as he crossed the finish line _ a first for
even long-time Formula One observers.
	   McLaren protested _ and lost _ but appealed the decision and has
seven days to confirm it with the sport's governing body, FIA.
	   Here's what happened.
	   Schumacher, under orders from his garage, came into the pit on
the final lap to take a 10-second penalty for overtaking Giancarlo
Fisichella on the 43rd lap under a yellow caution flag. McLaren
said he should have taken the 10-second stop-go penalty during the
final few laps _ not at the end.
	   Formula One officials _ eventually admitting an error by race
stewards _ threw out the protest on a technicality, saying Ferrari
wasn't notified about the penalty for 30 minutes and, therefore,
couldn't impose it until the end.
	   ``Under the circumstances, the time penalty imposed cannot apply
and is therefore rescinded,'' a statement said.
	   Schumacher's average speed was 172.810 kph (107.384 mph) and his
time was 1 hour, 47 minutes, 2.450 seconds _ 22.465 ahead of
Hakkinen.
	   Only nine of the 22 cars finished. Third was the Ferrari of
Eddie Irvine followed by Alexander Wurz and Fisichella, both of
Benetton.
	   ``I haven't seen yellow, but it wasn't easy to see anything at
certain stages,'' Schumacher said, describing a race run in
near-constant rain _ conditions in which he excels.
	   ``Maybe it was while I was following someone, I don't know.''
	   ``This was not the result we expected. But, it is very
satisfactory to be only two points down going to the next race in
Austria.''
	   The victory was Schumacher's third straight _ his first in the
British GP _ and moved him within two points of Hakkinen in the
series standings, 56 points to 54. It also was his 31st career win,
putting the German into a third-place tie on the all-time victory
list with Nigel Mansell. Alain Prost has 51 wins and Ayrton Senna
41.
	   Hakkinen, who once had a 22-point lead in the series standings,
survived a spin that sent him pin-wheeling off the water-logged
track on the 42nd lap.
	   McLaren teammate David Coulthard spun off and stalled on the
38th lap. He's scored only one point in the last four races and,
with 30 points in the season standings, is slipping behind the top
two.
	   Hakkinen, in the lead from the pole, was ahead 38 seconds when
the safety car pulled onto the track during the 44th lap.
	   After six laps behind the safety car, Hakkinen held the lead for
the 50th lap. But on the 51st, he went off a second time and when
he got back on the track again, Schumacher was ahead for good.
	   ``I'm never going to forget that one,'' Hakkinen said,
describing the first spin.
	   ``I was coming around the corner, it was probably one of the
worst moments on the track (for rain) and I wasn't going that
quick. I went around there and I just lost the back end and there
was nothing I could do.''
	   The second spin was costly, as he explained that the first had
left him driving a car with a damaged front end.
	   ``The second was caused because I had no aerodynamics in the
front end of the car,'' Hakkinen said. ``It (the car) just went
straight in the turn, absolutely straight.''
	   ``It is extremely disappointing. We were looking good until the
heavy rain came. I was just lucky to get second place.''

Another Schumacher scores; Ralf sixth for Jordan Mugen-Honda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Another Schumacher _ Michael's
younger brother, Ralf _ scored his first points of the season in
the British Grand Prix.
	   Driving for Jordan Mugen-Honda, the younger Schumacher was sixth
in Sunday's race, his first and the first of the season for Jordan.
	   ``We have waited so long for points, that it almost feels like a
win today,'' said the 23-year-old. ``I think the first points are
the hardest to win.''
	   The promising young German, rumored to be as fast as his
brother, broke in last year with Jordan and racked up a surprising
13 points. This season he's failed to finish five and finished way
back in the others.
	   Teammate Damon Hill _ the 1996 series champion _ spun off on the
14th lap and still hasn't scored a point in nine races.
	   Hill, 37, has hinted he may retire when the season ends, but
reports suggest he might move to the new British American Racing or
join an IndyCar team in the United States.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WOE IS PROST: At least France won soccer's World Cup on Sunday.
	   There's no similar joy for Alain Prost _ winner of a record-51
GPs _ who is having an abysmal season with his new Prost-Peugeot
team. Through nine races, Prost still doesn't have a point with
Olivier Panis (11th) and Jarno Trulli (12th) on Sunday.
	   ``I am very disappointed with our weekend,'' Prost said. ``We
were never competitive.''
	   It's been that way all season. The team's best finish is ninth _
once by each driver.
	   __ &QC; 
	   INS AND OUTS: Look for wholesale changes at Williams, which has
won five of the last six constructors' titles but has slumped this
season with its Mecachrome (Renault) engine.
	   Jacques Villeneuve is reported moving to the new British
American Racing team. Heinz-Harald Frentzen is almost certain to be
dropped and will probably move to IndyCars. The new lead driver is
widely reported to be IndyCar champion Alex Zanardi _ perhaps on a
three-year deal _ with Johnny Herbert of Sauber, or Williams test
driver Juan Pablo Montoya taking the second seat.
	   In 2000, Williams begins running a BMW engine.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GOOD LIFE: Michael Schumacher's driving partner at Ferrari,
Eddie Irvine, is outspoken, often branded as a troublemaker _ and a
great quote.
	   ``I'm young, free, single and I have a lot of money so I like to
enjoy it,' he said. ``There was a man who said he didn't regret
anything he had done but he did regret plenty that he hadn't done.
For me, that's exactly it. That's why I've got a boat and a jet and
all these other toys.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HONORS JACQUES: Villeneuve picked up the Hawthorn Memorial
Trophy at the British Grand Prix, awarded annually to the top
British driver, or driver from the British commonwealth. Damon Hill
won the last four. Mike Hawthorn was the first British driver to
win a F1 championship (1958).
	   ___
	   PIT STOPS: Why has Villeneuve dyed his hair purple? a look
unveiled for the British GP. ``No reason, just for fun,'' said the
French-Canadian.
	   FIA president Max Mosley took a ride in McLaren's two-seat
racing car for three laps at Silverstone Saturday with former F1
driver Martin Brundle behind the wheel. He is reported to have
bumped Sylvester Stallone for the spot when Stallone couldn't take
a medical exam.
	   If you believe the British tabloids _ in this case Sunday's News
of the World _ McLaren's David Coulthard takes a 15-year-old pair
of pale blue boxer shorts to every race as a good luck charm.
	   ``I Can't Drive Without My 15-Year-Old Underpants,'' screamed
Sunday's headline.

World Cup: Zagallo rues worst World Cup loss as France celebrates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ It should have been a ``penta'' _ a
fifth World Cup triumph for the best team on the planet.
	   It turned out to be Brazil's worst World Cup defeat.
	   Brazil lost 3-0 to France in the final Sunday to blow a big
chance of taking its record number of World Cup wins to five. Mario
Zagallo's team was outplayed at the Stade de France as the French
won for the first time in their first final.
	   The Brazilians had been there so often before it seemed like a
formality. But Zinedine Zidane headed home two corners and Emmanuel
Petit underlined France's superiority on the day with a breakaway
third in second half injury time.
	   ``We won the final because we wanted it the most,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said. ``It was the result of hard work. We really
worked as a team. There was good will and friendship between all of
us.
	   ``We played better and better because we had confidence and we
proved we had great players.''
	   Those should have been the words of Zagallo.
	   He blamed his team's tame performance on the psychological
fallout from almost losing a sick Ronaldo. He also said his team
never recovered from a slow start and never looked like winning a
fifth championship.
	   Zagallo explained that Ronaldo, a two-time FIFA Player of the
Year who was expected to be the biggest star of France 98, reported
sick only hours before the game.
	   ``Ronaldo shouldn't have played,'' the veteran coach said. ``It
was a tough problem for me. We gave the lineup without Ronaldo and
that rattled the team psychologically.
	   ``They were inhibited because Ronaldo wasn't go to play. I said
it was a strategy that Ronaldo would stay on the bench. I was
hiding the real situation.''
	   Ronaldo started, but was nowhere near his full form. He even
missed his only chance, a close-range drive he usually puts away
with ease but went straight to French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.
	   And that was after Zidane had headed home Petit's 27th-minute
rightwing corner and produced another from Youri Djorkaeff's kick
from the other corner.
	   ``The whole nation was behind France,'' Zagallo said. ``The
fifth title will have to be some other time. This wasn't our day.
France was better.
	   ``Brazil lost the final in the first half,'' Zagallo said. ``In
the second half we did everything we could but we were not able to
make up the difference.''
	   They also couldn't take advantage of the 67th-minute expulsion
of standout French centerback Marcel Desailly, who was shown two
yellow cards during the game.
	   Desailly was a colossus in the French defense, especially in the
absence of the already suspended Laurent Blanc, who was expelled
against Croatia in the semifinal.
	   Desailly and Blanc's replacement, Frank Leboeuf, locked up the
Brazilian front line to such an extent that Zagallo sent on
Denilson and Edmundo to help Ronaldo and Bebeto break down the
weakened French defense.
	   They failed dismally and created few openings even against a
10-man team while the French always looked like scoring against the
Brazilian defense.
	   Stephane Guivarc'h squandered three opportunities with only
Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel to beat, otherwise the record
Brazilian loss would have been even worse.

Yen plunges after Japan's ruling party suffers election setback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with early stock trading, bond prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen plunged against the U.S. dollar Monday
after Japan's ruling party suffered a stunning defeat in
parliamentary elections seen as likely forcing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto to resign. Tokyo share prices fell.
	   In early trading, the dollar bought 144.06 yen, up 2.73 yen from
its level of 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading, also on Friday.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.48 points,
or 1.35 percent, to 15,872.58 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the Nikkei index lost 356.89 points, or 2.17
percent,
	   The dollar began its surge in early Asian trading as investors
dumped the yen following the surprisingly poor showing of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's election for Japan's
upper house of Parliament.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of
the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ according to
national broadcaster NHK television.
	   The number is far short of the 69 seats the LDP needed to regain
a majority in the chamber, which it lost in 1989, and fell far
short of matching its current strength of 61.
	   Counting seats that were not up for election, the Liberal
Democrats now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house, although they
may add more by wooing independent legislators.
	   Despite the results, the conservative, pro-business Liberal
Democrats will continue to rule because they have firm control over
the more powerful lower house, which can pass the national budget
and choose the prime minister without the approval of the upper
house.
	   But the Sunday result suggests widespread frustration in Japan
with the LDP's inability to come up with the right policies to get
Japan's recession-plagued economy back on the track toward
recovery.
	   ``The results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto
said. ``Everyone has handed down their judgment, and we must accept
that with sincerity.''
	   Hashimoto, who has been Japan's leader since January of 1996,
said he would announce his decision at a meeting of party leaders,
set for 12:30 p.m. Monday (0330 GMT). He refused to say what his
decision might be, but his comments suggested that he wanted to
resign.
	   Mentioned in the Japanese media as possible successors were
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened sharply lower amid
political uncertainty following the ruling party's poor election
showing.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 15.49 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,226.01. The
TOPIX closed down 20.78 points, or 1.65 percent, the day before.
	   ``The market is reacting in shock to the LDP's defeat'' said
Akira Nakamura, stock manager at Chuo Securities.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.410 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370
percent, driving its price down to 110.36 yen from 110.60 yen.

Win or lose, Brazil depends on Ronaldo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ The World Cup was Ronaldo's stage.
Hero or villain, the leading role was sure to be his.
	   And sure enough, he was the pivotal figure in the final, even
though he was a virtual no-show.
	   The two-time FIFA world player of the year felt so bad a few
hours before the game that Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo pulled him
from the lineup. The move upset his teammmates, and Zagallo put him
back in. But the damage was done.
	   The Brazilians seemed apathetic and hesitant against the French
attack. The players seemed to be looking to Ronaldo, who tried a
run or two and gave up. In the end it was France 3-0, and Brazil's
excuses began with their marquee player.
	   ``It was a great trauma for us,'' Zagallo said. ``Ronaldo
shouldn't have played. We gave the lineup without Ronaldo, and that
rattled our team psychologically. They were stymied, inhibited
because Ronaldo wasn't going to play.''
	   But what exactly was the matter? FIFA said he had gone to the
hospital for X-rays on his left ankle, and that doctors cleared him
to play just before the game.
	   Team doctor Lidio Toledo said Ronaldo felt dizzy after lunch.
Press officer Nelson Borges acknowledged that the player had
vomited. Zagallo said Ronaldo felt ``indisposed'' but asked to play
at the last minute.
	   ``I kept thinking, `Should I play him or not?''' Zagallo said.
``We were very apathetic, and even with him in, the group already
was affected.''
	   Team captain Dunga said it was the uncertainty that got to the
players. But with the cream of international soccer in its lineup,
why was the team so dependent on one 21-year-old striker?
	   It's been that way throughout the Cup. The spotlight has rarely
wavered from Ronaldo. Even when the team wins, Brazilians judge
him. Had he measured up? Had he performed like the world's best?
	   Until Sunday, the answer was no.
	   It wasn't just the skimpy scoring, four goals in the first six
games, one on a penalty kick _ not bad for any other player, but
not for Ronaldo. And the dominance wasn't there, the unstoppable
upfield charges, the explosion, the weaving, high-speed dribbles.
	   Sure, he had moments. There were the two goals against Chile, a
pair of assists against Denmark, an inspired half against the
Netherlands. But glimmers of greatness weren't enough for Pele's
successor, soccer's poster boy.
	   Zagallo said Ronaldo was too static, and against double coverage
that was deadly. He had to move more, use the edges of the field.
Sometimes he did, but not always.
	   Rumors flew about the reason for his spotty play. Ronaldo had
tendinitis in his knee. He was overweight. He was depressed over an
impending breakup with his fiancee, Brazilian model Suzana Werner.
Maybe even that the pressure of the Cup was too great.
	   Ronaldo denied them all.
	   Still, life in a fishbowl took some getting used to for the kid
from Bento Ribeiro, a poor district on the gritty north side of Rio
de Janeiro.
	   It was a rocket ride to the top. At 16, he was bought by
Cruzeiro, where his 50 goals in as many games was a better average
than Pele's. In 1994, he was on the national team, watching from
the bench as Romario, Bebeto and company won a fourth Cup title.
	   Transfers and titles came in quick succession. From Cruzeiro it
was on to PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands, Spain's FC Barcelona,
Inter Milan of Italy.
	   Success hasn't spoiled him, he says.
	   ``Nothing has changed in my head,'' he said. ``I'm well off
financially, but my behavior is the same.''
	   Ronaldo is Brazil's present and its future. If he stays healthy,
he almost certainly has at least two more Cups in him, maybe three.
But he shuns the superman tag.
	   ``People always expect me to resolve everything,'' he said.
``But nobody wins anything alone.''

World Cup: Zidane comes through in the end after seesaw World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Zinedine Zidane let France long doubt
his soccer genius. He warned the French: ``I am not the Messiah.''
On Sunday, though, he engineered France's most glorious victory in
sports.
	   With two goals in the World Cup final and displaying the most
Brazilian of skills in midfield, Zidane became the pivotal figure
in the 3-0 triumph over Brazil, its worst thrashing in 16 trips to
soccer's big stage.
	   ``I was so hungry to score a World Cup goal that I made it
two,'' he said.
	   With his piercing eyes and balding head at 26, Zidane will
forever be associated with the roller-coaster adventure that led to
the first World Cup title for Les Bleus.
	   ``It was the first time France is world champion so it has to be
extraordinary,'' he said, emerging all smiles from a melee of
players.
	   Four weeks ago, he was a sorry figure, suspended for two World
Cup matches for stepping on an opponent, unsure whether he would
play another game in the tournament.
	   But France got through the second round and Zidane came back a
towering figure in the quarterfinals against Italy. He continued to
grow in confidence and stature. On Sunday, he outshone the
brightest star of all, Ronaldo.
	   The son of an Algerian immigrant in the Mediterranean port of
Marseille, Zidane came to symbolize, for one shining moment at
least, the vision of the New France, a melting pot of cultures and
races joining forces for the common good.
	   The 80,000-strong crowd at the Stade de France was shouting
``Zizou,'' turning him into France's greatest World Cup hero. He
took over that mantle from Michel Platini, the World Cup organizer
who also was the son of an immigrant.
	   French President Jacques Chirac was sitting next to Platini on
Sunday and watched Zidane's every move, applauding the glory he
brought to the nation.
	   Zidane led a squad all dressed in blue but made up of every hue
of France's once sprawling empire, from Algeria to Ghana, from the
Antilles to New Caledonia.
	   On a personnal level, Zidane proved he was not a loser.
	   What had specifically irked the Juventus star was that despite
his smooth, unmatched skills, three European Cup finals had left
him with nothing but tears of frustration.
	   On Sunday, he proved his critics wrong.
	   ``It's great to score twice in the final. What could be
better?'' he asked rhetorically, admitting headers usually are his
weak spot.
	   He had promised to help his teammates after Les Bleus kept him
in the tournament, winning both matches without him.
	   ``Now it's all up to me,'' Zidane said.
	   Without ``Zizou,'' France struggled long and hard to overcome
even an unlikely challenger, Paraguay.
	   With Zidane, Brazil was dismantled in 45 minutes.

New Zealand makes country's biggest heroin bust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Two Vietnamese men have been
arrested and more than 22 pounds (10.3 kilos) of high-purity heroin
worth U.S. dlrs 25 million (50 million NZ dollars) seized in the
country's biggest illicit drug haul, police said Monday.
	   Police and customs agents arrested the pair Friday as they tried
to arrange shipment of the heroin, sent from Bangkok, on from
Auckland to Australia.
	   New Zealand Customs announced the drug bust after they
intercepted the heroin shipment Thursday and arrested the two
Vietnamese men the next day.
	   Customs investigations manager Phil Chitty said the seizure
shows international drug trafficking groups are using New Zealand
as a transit point to disguise the origins of a drug assignment
from authorities in destination countries.
	   He said police and customs drug liaison staff working with Thai
authorities in Bangkok had alerted Auckland customs and police to
the shipment.
	   Drug investigators had conducted a ``controlled delivery'' of
the consignment, and arrested the two Vietnamese men.
	   The pair, whose names have been withheld by court order,
appeared in court in South Auckland on Saturday morning, charged
with importation and possession for supply of a controlled drug.
	   They were remanded in custody to reappear Monday, when further
charges could be laid.

Orangemen march on big day clouded by death of three children

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant Orangemen were
preparing to march on their big holiday Monday, chastened and
divided by the deaths of three boys in the violence swirling around
their defiance of a government order to avoid one Catholic
neighborhood.
	   Some prominent Orangemen had called for an end to the week-long
confrontation between marchers and security forces near Portadown,
following the Sunday morning firebombing that killed the Quinn
brothers, Richard, 10, Mark, 9 and Jason, 7, in their home in
Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Their Catholic mother and her Protestant partner escaped safely.
	   ``After last night's attack a 15-minute walk down Garvaghy Road
by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory because it would
be in the shadow of the coffins of three little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order is about,'' said the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh.
	   Last week, Bingham was one of four Orange officials who met with
Prime Minister Tony Blair pressing their demand to walk down that
road, despite the hostility of Catholic residents there and an
order from the Parades Commission blocking the march.
	   The Portadown district Orange Lodges defiantly declared that
their protest would continue until they walked the Garvaghy Road.
But they asked Orangemen not to join them Monday in the pastures
near Drumcree Anglican church for a mass confrontation with police
and British troops.
	   The Orange Order has disclaimed any responsibility for the
roadblocks, attacks on homes and cars, and assaults on police and
soldiers which erupted after the march was stopped July 5. At
Drumcree, hard-liners have thrown bombs at security forces _ and
have been cheered by men wearing the orange collars of the Order.
	   The 12th of July is the biggest holiday on the Orange calendar,
celebrating the defeat of the Catholic King James II by the
Protestant William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
The marches were put back until Monday this year because of the
holiday falling on Sunday.
	   Many Catholics dread the sound of flutes and booming Lambeg
drums, and see the Orange marches as sheer muscle-flexing by the
majority community.
	   David Trimble, an Orangeman and recently elected first minister
of Northern Ireland's new Assembly, abruptly abandoned his support
for the Drumcree marchers after Sunday's killings.
	   ``The only way they can clearly distance themselves from these
murders and show the world that they repudiate those who murder
young children, the only way to repudiate that, is to come down off
the hill,'' Trimble said.
	   The split in Orange ranks reflected the deep divisions among
Protestants over the agreement among eight political parties to set
up a new government in Northern Ireland with power shared between
Catholics and Protestants.
	   In Ballymoney, neighbors laid flowers, teddy bears and notes of
condolence outside the blackened home where the boys died.
	   Francis Quinn, whose sister Chrissy Quinn was the boys' mother,
said the family had been harassed for two years.
	   ``They murdered three innocent little children. They weren't
being brought up Catholic or Protestant _ they just were three
kids,'' Francis Quinn said.
	   ``And I'm just _ full of hate,'' he said haltingly.
	   ``This last couple of years we've been terrorized ... threats,
letters, bombs through the windows, it goes on and on,'' he added.
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, the senior British
official in the province, appealed for people to step back from
confrontation and ``to think twice before they exit their front
doors.''
	   ``People should think do they need to go and parade? People
should think do they need to demonstrate? Do you really need to do
this today?'' Mowlam said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto faced an uncertain
political future Monday following his ruling party's stunning
defeat in parliamentary elections in which management of Japan's
slumping economy was the major issue.
	   Hashimoto grimly conceded defeat and indicated he was ready to
resign Monday after his Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats
out of the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ in
Sunday's elections.
	   ``It is all my responsibility,'' he said. ``As a politician, in
my heart, I have decided what I must do.''
	   He was scheduled to meet with party leaders to discuss his
future early Monday afternoon, and had scheduled a news conference
to make his formal announcement at 2:00 p.m. (0500 GMT).
	   Uncertainty over how a leadership change would effect efforts to
revive Japan's moribund economy sent share prices on Tokyo's stock
exchange plunging.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.48 points,
or 1.35 percent, to 15,872.58 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the Nikkei index had lost 356.89 points.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, soared to 144.06 yen, up 2.73 yen from
its level of 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading Friday.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama were seen as the most likely successors to
Hashimoto.
	   The Liberal Democrats' performance fell far short of the 69
seats they needed to regain a majority in the chamber, which it
lost in 1989, and also was well below its strength going into the
polls of 61. They now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house.
	   With Japan in its worst recession since World War II, many
voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to get the
economy back on track. Unemployment is at a record high, consumer
spending is plummeting and Japan's financial system is wobbling
under massive bad loans.
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   The party will need the cooperation of other parties to pass key
legislation, however.
	   The LDP's defeat has emboldened opposition parties, who are now
calling for the dissolution of the lower house and for general
elections to be held soon.
	   But John Neuffer, a senior research fellow who follows Japanese
politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a Tokyo think tank,
said the opposition was too fragmented to pose a real threat to the
Liberal Democrats.
	   ``The LDP remains the only show in town when it comes to running
the government,'' he said.
	   In the long run, the electoral humiliation may prompt the LDP
and the government to work harder to get the economy back on track,
Neuffer said.
	   For now, however, the political situation remains confused.
	   Hashimoto's scheduled official visits to the United States and
France next week are expected to be canceled. He was to use the
trips to try to win support for his administration's efforts to
jumpstart the economy.
	   And Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma has canceled plans to visit
Washington from Tuesday, a ministry spokesman said.
	   The Liberal Democrats' sense of near panic was apparent as the
voting neared.
	   The party flip-flopped repeatedly on cutting income taxes, which
many voters, as well the United States, considered a key factor for
economic recovery.
	   The Democrats _ a liberal, relatively new party that has
recently emerged as the main opposition threat to the LDP _
promised such a tax cut early in the campaign.
	   They won 27 seats, a gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire
upper house.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ French soccer fans flooded one of Manhattan's
ritziest streets, dancing on cars amid chants of ``Vive la
France.''
	   They crowded in front of televisions set up on Fifth Avenue on
Sunday as part of the city's Bastille Day celebration. But the
tribute to food and wine did not stand a chance against France's
3-0 triumph over Brazil in the World Cup final.
	   ``It seems like the French people are believing again,'' said
Nicole Veyne, 67, a native of Avignon, France, who works for the
United Nations and has lived in New York for 15 years.
	   An exuberant Frederique Browne thought the victory would improve
race relations in France. Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice Sunday,
is the son of an Algerian night watchman.
	   ``It's going to change the opinion of French people toward North
Africans,'' she said.
	   Actors performing a re-enactment of the storming of the Bastille
had to stop because of cheering fans.
	   In Australia, more than 700 supporters of the victorious French
team celebrated at a large Sydney hotel, where a breakfast of
croissants and French pastries helped set the scene. The hotel
spokesman predicted there might be a few late starters, or
non-starters, at workplaces around the city.
	   ``We mainly had French supporters in here,'' he said. ``There
were a few brave Brazilian supporters who wandered through but
they're not very happy at the moment.''
	   In Canberra, Australia, French Ambassador Dominique Girard said
the support confirmed Australia and France were friends again after
two years, when relations between the two countries was damaged by
French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
	   ``Everywhere people were stopping me in the supermarkets and in
the street and saying good luck,'' Girard said moments after the
final whistle. ``So it's clear there are no bad feelings.''
	   In Brazil, the unexpected defeat forced Brazilians to put off
their victory marches at least until 2002.
	   Marinede da Costa, a 28-year-old secretary who watched the game
on Copacabana beach, maintained her composure after Brazil's
defeat.
	   ``I think Brazil fought a lot. It just wasn't our day. We lost,
but second is still great,'' she said.
	   In Sao Paulo, Micheline Lagnado, a graphic designer, said she
was already looking forward to the World Cup competition to begin
in 2002.
	   ``The French deserved to win because they played better. ...
Hopefully we will get our fifth World Cup victory in 2002,'' she
said.
	   The somber mood was the same in Los Angeles, Boston and Miami,
which has one of the largest Brazilian expatriate communities in
the United States.
	   Walter Scigliano, 52, from Sao Paolo, window shopping on New
York's Fifth Avenue, said the hype in Brazil created unrealistic
expectations.
	   ``Brazil didn't have a great team,'' he said. ``Nike and other
advertisers were the ones that created the myth of the team.''
	   Nike sponsored the Brazilian team with a dlrs 200 million
contract and put players in their international advertising
campaign.
	   Danielle Sirgant, 29, of Toulouse, France, and her boyfriend,
Jose Garcia, a Brazil fan and native of Peru, watched the game on
neutral ground in midtown.
	   ``I'm very depressed,'' Garcia said. ``It was the only team from
South America.''
	   In Florida, thousands of people _ many of them Brazilian fans _
spilled onto Ocean Drive in Miami Beach. They danced, waved flags
and banged drums.
	   ``It hurts,'' said Marcelo Araujo, a Brazilian visiting Miami.
``But it's not that bad where we can't party anyway.''
	   Police closed two blocks of Ocean Drive to traffic as fans
poured out of bars and restaurants. But in a crowd estimated at
20,000, only one arrest was reported.
	   Crowds wearing Brazil's yellow and blue colors grew quiet when
France scored.
	   ``Win or lose, we still have four titles,'' said fan Paulo
Santos, a New Yorker. ``The soccer gods will come again.''
	   The French in Boston took to Newbury Street to celebrate the
landmark victory.
	   College students screamed from car sunroofs along the city's
tony strip, joining an impromptu parade of hundreds.
	   The city's French Consulate was unprepared for the stunning
victory, and its champagne supply was insufficient.
	   ``For the first time ever, we've won we've won,'' Celine Kern of
Strasbourg, France, screamed in between singing and whistle
blowing. ``It's fantastic! It's brilliant!''
	   The parties in Massachusetts stretched to Cape Cod, where about
200 Brazilians gathered at the Atrium Restaurant in West Yarmouth.
	   ``It went very well,'' manager Jim McCourt said. ``They seemed
to enjoy it even though they lost.''
	   In Los Angeles, some 400 Brazilian fans streamed into the street
after the game, blocking traffic before police ordered them onto
the sidewalks.
	   The fans had been watching on TVs from businesses along Venice
Boulevard. Police reported no arrests, damages or injuries.
	   ``They came out and some people had been drinking, and I guess
they were getting a little boisterous and rowdy,'' Officer Mike
Partain said. ``It's kind of like our Super Bowl.''
	   In Ecuador, voting was light in the presidental election as many
soccer-mad voters, disgusted by ongoing political turmoil, chose to
watch the World Cup final instead.
	   In Kingston, Jamaica, Jamaican fans cheered fellow underdogs
France even though their own team was eliminated long ago.

New Zealand makes country's biggest heroin bust

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Two men have been arrested and more
than 22 pounds (10.3 kilos) of high-purity heroin worth U.S. dlrs
25 million (50 million NZ dollars) seized in the country's biggest
illicit drug haul, police said Monday.
	   Police and customs agents arrested the pair Friday as they tried
to arrange shipment of the heroin, sent from Bangkok, on from
Auckland to Australia.
	   New Zealand Customs announced the drug bust after they
intercepted the heroin shipment Thursday and arrested the two men
the next day.
	   Customs investigations manager Phil Chitty said the seizure
shows international drug trafficking groups are using New Zealand
as a transit point to disguise the origins of a drug assignment
from authorities in destination countries.
	   He said police and customs drug liaison staff working with Thai
authorities in Bangkok had alerted Auckland customs and police to
the shipment.
	   Drug investigators had conducted a ``controlled delivery'' of
the consignment, and arrested the two men.
	   Bill Wei Zhao, 23, a Chinese salesman from Auckland, and Sam
Lam, 27, a driver from Daly, California, did not make pleas when
they appeared before Judge Robert Kerr in Auckland District Court
on Monday.
	   They were remanded in custody to July 20 on two charges:
attempting to export heroin and possession of tools to forge a
Fijian Immigration stamp.

Australian Medical Association calls for quick Viagra approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Viagra should be approved for the
Australian market soon to avoid misuse of the anti-impotence drug,
Australian Medical Association president Dr. David Brand said
Monday.
	   Viagra, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in March, is awaiting approval from Australian
authorities.
	   Brand said the drug was not supposed to be freely available in
Australia until early next year but newspaper reports had suggested
it would be on the market in October.
	   ``Our concern is that people are accessing it widely on the
Internet or getting it without proper medical supervision,'' Brand
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``It may be better to bring it in sooner rather than later.''
	   Brand said part of the problem was that Viagra had been
associated with, but did not cause, 30 deaths overseas.
	   ``I don't think it's a major cause for alarm, but certainly
people ought to be having a close look at those deaths and just
make sure that there's not some causable relationship,'' he said.
	   ``But at this stage, the evidence is that it's a very safe drug
and that most likely most of the people that have died while taking
it have died from other causes.''
	   Brand said he expected the world's most sought-after drug to be
a ``boom drug,'' enjoying the same popularity in Australia as it
had in the United States.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The Harvard-trained mayor of Quito and a
populist banana tycoon were locked in a tight race in the
presidential runoff in Ecuador, a nation plagued by political
instability.
	   Jamil Mahuad, of the centrist Christian Democrat party, claimed
victory over populist banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa, after a respected
exit poll announced Sunday that he had an ample 7 percentage point
lead.
	   But the margin shrank abruptly as the poll count advanced,
creating a technical tie. Ninety-nine percent of the exit polls had
been tallied as of late Sunday.
	   According to a poll sponsored by seven television stations,
Mahuad had about 51.3 percent compared with 48.7 percent for Noboa,
Ecuador's richest man. The poll, which had a margin of error of 1.6
percent, has been accurate in the past.
	   The winner will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon, ending
17 months of transition government that began when Congress removed
the eccentric Bucaram from power for ``mental incapacity'' amid
street protests.
	   A second exit poll by the private company, Cedatos, gave Mahuad
a 7 percent lead.
	   Noboa, refusing to concede defeat, also claimed victory.
	   ``Ecuadoreans! I thank God for this spectacular victory,'' said
Noboa, 47, who vowed to send his supporters into voting counting
stations to make sure officials did not rob him of his supposed
win.
	   Voting was light in this small Andean nation of 12 million as
many soccer-mad fans watched the World Cup Final instead going to
the polls. Ecuadoreans showed strong support for Brazil, which lost
to France 3-0.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa were the top vote-getters in the first
round of voting on May 31, but neither got enough votes to win the
election outright.
	   Mahuad entered election day with a hefty lead in the polls,
buoyed by a reputation as an honest, effective politician, earned
during his six years as mayor of Quito, Ecuador's capital.
	   But Mahuad's once-massive lead in the polls shrank sharply in
the final days of the campaign as Noboa announced populist
measures, promising to create one million jobs.
	   Noboa, who calls himself the candidate of the poor despite his
wealth, voted Sunday with a Bible in hand.
	   Official results are expected Wednesday, according to the
elections board.
	   The new president will inherit Ecuador's tattered democratic
reputation and an economy staggered by El Nino-driven floods,
deepening poverty and plummeting prices of the nation's main
export, oil.
	   Ecuador's state coffers are empty and the new president will
have to introduce tough austerity measures, economists say.
	   Ecuador's political carnival hit a low point in February 1997,
when Congress removed eccentric former President Abdala Bucaram,
nicknamed ``El Loco'' _ the Crazy One _ from office for ``mental
incapacity.''
	   Noboa ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's government and is
the former president's friend and political ally. Many Ecuadoreans
feared a Noboa win would mark a return to the Bucaram years.
	   The colorful world of Ecuadorean politics also includes
congressmen who get in fights and hurl glass ashtrays at opponents.
Mudslinging added to popular disgust during the campaign.
	   Mahuad was forced to admit he had a 10-year-old son from an
extramarital affair. Noboa also alleged that drug money entered

Yen plunges after Japan's ruling party suffers election setback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen plunged against the U.S. dollar Monday
morning after Japan's ruling party suffered a stunning defeat in
parliamentary elections seen as likely to force Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto to resign. Tokyo share prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 142.38 yen in midday trading, up 1.05 yen from
its level of 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading, also on Friday.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average shed 16.48 points,
or 0.10 percent, to 16,073.58 points at the end of the morning
session. On Friday, the Nikkei index lost 356.89 points, or 2.17
percent,
	   The dollar began its surge in early Asian trading as investors
dumped the yen following the surprisingly poor showing of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's election for Japan's
upper house of Parliament.
	   But the dollar's rally soon ran out of steam, as Japanese
investors who bought the U.S. currency near its highs earlier in
the session hurried to take profits, traders said.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 144.50 yen during
morning trading, its highest intra-day level in Tokyo since June
16, when the currency rose to 146.75 yen.
	   Despite the election results, the conservative, pro-business
Liberal Democrats will continue to rule because they have firm
control over the more powerful lower house, which can pass the
national budget and choose the prime minister without the approval
of the upper house.
	   The outcome of Sunday's elections underscores widespread
frustration in Japan with the LDP's inability to come up with the
right policies to get Japan's recession-plagued economy back on the
track toward recovery.
	   ``The results are entirely my responsibility,'' a grim Hashimoto
said.
	   Hashimoto, who has been Japan's leader since January of 1996,
said he would announce his decision at a meeting of party leaders,
set for 12:30 p.m. Monday (0330 GMT). He refused to say what his
decision might be, but his comments suggested that he wanted to
resign.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei index at one point slipped 280
points amid political uncertainty following the ruling party's poor
election showing.
	   But the index recovered much of its early losses on late morning
buying as investors felt the government will still carry out the
reform plans it has promised internationally, even if the prime
minister is replaced, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.30 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,239.20. The
TOPIX closed down 20.78 points, or 1.65 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.395 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370
percent, driving its price down to 110.47 yen from 110.66 yen.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An apparently drunk driver plowed into a group of
fans celebrating France's World Cup victory early Monday, injuring
about 60 people, some seriously, rescue officials said.
	   The accident happened as the capital exploded in joy after its
team beat Brazil for the championship. At least a million people
streamed to the Champs-Elysees to celebrate.
	   A woman zigzagging down the avenue from the Arc de Triomphe in a
black Volkswagen plowed into the partying fans, injuring about 60 _
seven seriously, officials said. None were critically injured.
	   ``Apparently it was a crazy car, which drove for several dozen
meters (yards), knocking over people on its way,'' said Cmdr.
Philippe Lavoil, a rescue official. Two hundred rescue workers in
at least a dozen ambulances arrived to treat the victims.
	   The driver was attacked by the crowd before police intervened.
	   Witnesses said the woman dragged some people for several meters
(yards) after hitting them.
	   One witness, Stephan Gueroui, said he'd seen the car coming down
the Champs-Elysees the wrong way. ``A car was coming down the
Champs-Elysees in the wrong direction,'' he said. ``It hit a group
who was crossing.''
	   His face was swollen and bleeding. He said he'd been caught in a
brawl and gotten hit with a can.

Japan's Hashimoto; tough negotiator, but weak on economy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ When Ryutaro Hashimoto became Japan's prime
minister two and half years ago, he was highly regarded as a tough
negotiator and savvy leader.
	   But on one issue he has proved weak _ the economy.
	   During his 35-year career in national politics, Hashimoto's
policymaking and analytical skills won him several top Cabinet
positions, including the trade, finance, and transportation
portfolios.
	   Hashimoto's star really ascended when, as trade minister in
1995, he demonstrated a rare toughness against Washington in a
bitter and high-profile auto sales dispute.
	   Hashimoto, who is 60 and comes from the Okayama area of southern
Japan, also won praise for his diplomacy in settling several thorny
issues.
	   To quell opposition to U.S. military bases on Okinawa, Hashimoto
last year arranged to return land leased to the United States to
the local government. He promised aid to shore up Okinawa's
struggling economy.
	   But his toughness _ he is an expert swordsman and a mountain
climber _ has gotten him into trouble as well.
	   He triggered protests from China and other nations invaded by
Japan by visiting a shrine dedicated to Japan's fallen war dead _
including those hanged for crimes against humanity.
	   It was the ailing economy, however, that dominated his tenure.
	   After he took office in January 1996, Hashimoto made a series of
controversial and unpopular fiscal decisions _ including an
increase in the national sales tax and a bailout for housing loan
companies awash in bad loans.
	   Worries about Japan's deepening economic morass, a major factor
in the broader financial crisis throughout Asia, had sent
Hashimoto's support ratings to record lows in recent months.
	   In response to the concerns, Hashimoto proposed a 16 trillion
yen (dlrs 127 billion) package of tax cuts and new government
spending _ Japan's largest such plan ever, and a ``bridge bank''
bad loan settlement plan.
	   But the Japanese currency continued to slip against the dollar,
and Hashimoto found himself under increasing criticism for failing
to demonstrate strong enough leadership.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met with party
leaders to discuss his resignation Monday after the ruling Liberal
Democrats suffered a stunning defeat in elections dominated by
voter anger over their failure to revive Japan's ailing economy.
	   Hashimoto grimly conceded defeat and indicated he was ready to
resign after his Liberal Democratic Party won just 44 seats out of
the 126 contested _ half of Parliament's upper house _ in Sunday's
elections.
	   He met with party leaders to discuss his future early Monday
afternoon, and had scheduled a news conference to make a formal
announcement at 2:00 p.m. (0500 GMT).
	   Party leaders had already begun discussing who would replace
Hashimoto, according to NHK, Japan's public television network.
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama were seen as the most likely successors.

<TEXT>
	   ``It is all my responsibility,'' Hashimoto said after the
election results became clear just after midnight. ``As a
politician, in my heart, I have decided what I must do.''
	   Hashimoto's resignation would likely confuse Japan's efforts to
pull itself out of its worst recession since World War II, and
concerns over a leadership change sent share prices plunging.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.48 points,
or 1.35 percent, to 15,872.58 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the Nikkei index had lost 356.89 points.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, soared to 144.06 yen, up 2.73 yen from
141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen in late New
York trading Friday.
	   ``We must fix the economy as soon as possible'' said Takashi
Imai, head of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic
Organizations. ``We cannot afford to have a political vacuum.''
	   The Liberal Democrats' performance fell far short of the 69
seats they needed to regain a majority in the chamber, which it
lost in 1989, and also was well below its strength going into the
polls of 61.
	   They now have 102 in the 252-seat upper house.
	   Voters vented their frustration at the LDP's inability to get
the economy back on track. Unemployment is at a record high,
bankruptcies are swelling and Japan's financial system is wobbling
under massive bad loans.
	   The conservative, pro-business Liberal Democrats will continue
to rule because they have firm control over the more powerful lower
house, which can pass the national budget and choose the prime
minister without the approval of the upper house.
	   The party will need the cooperation of other parties to pass key
legislation, however.
	   The LDP's defeat has emboldened opposition parties, who are now
calling for the dissolution of the lower house and for general
elections to be held soon.
	   But John Neuffer, a senior research fellow who follows Japanese
politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a Tokyo think tank,
said the opposition was too fragmented to pose a real threat to the
Liberal Democrats.
	   ``The LDP remains the only show in town when it comes to running
the government,'' he said.
	   In the long run, the electoral humiliation may prompt the LDP
and the government to work harder to get the economy back on track,
Neuffer said.
	   For now, however, the political situation remains confused.
	   Hashimoto's scheduled official visits to the United States and
France next week are expected to be canceled. He was to use the
trips to try to win support for his administration's efforts to
jumpstart the economy.
	   And Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma has canceled plans to visit
Washington from Tuesday, a ministry spokesman said.
	   The Liberal Democrats' sense of near panic was apparent as the
voting neared.
	   The party flip-flopped repeatedly on cutting income taxes, which
many voters, as well the United States, considered a key factor for
economic recovery.
	   The Democrats _ a liberal, relatively new party that has
recently emerged as the main opposition threat to the LDP _
promised such a tax cut early in the campaign. They won 27 seats, a
gain of nine, and now hold 47 in the entire upper house house.

his Japanese counterpart Masaru Hayami on Monday to discuss
economic issues, including Japan's bad debt problem, the Bank of
Japan said.
	   A Bank of Japan official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said only that the central bank chiefs exchanged views in a ``very
frank manner.''
	   He declined to comment on whether they discussed foreign
exchange rates or the impact on the currency market of Japan's
Parliamentary elections Sunday.
	   The approximately 90-minute meeting took place over breakfast
before a monthly gathering in Tokyo of the Bank for International
Settlements, the official said. The Bank for International
Settlements sets standards for banks which operate internationally.
	   The meeting came as the Japanese yen plunged against the dollar
early Monday amid political uncertainty over Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's future following a disappointing showing by his ruling
party in parliamentary elections Sunday.
	   At midday Monday, the dollar bought 142.38 yen, up 1.05 yen from
its level of 141.33 yen late Friday in Tokyo and above 140.93 yen
in late New York trading, also on Friday.
	   At one point in early trading, the dollar moved as high as
144.50 yen, its highest intra-day level in Tokyo since June 16,
when the currency rose to 146.75 yen.
	   In a major setback for Hashimoto, his Liberal Democratic Party
won only 44 of the 126 seats contested _ half of the Parliament's
upper house _ far below its current strength of 61.
	   Hashimoto is expected to announce his resignation later Monday
to take responsibility for the election loss, being blamed on voter
frustration over Japan's slumping economy.
	   The Bank of Japan official also refused to comment whether
Greenspan and Hayami discussed the Asian economic crisis or other
financial issues.
	   Last month, the U.S. and Japan intervened jointly in world
currency markets to stem an abrupt weakening of the yen that saw
the Japanese currency fall to eight-year lows.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A car plowed into a group of fans celebrating
France's World Cup victory early Monday, injuring about 60 people,
some seriously, rescue officials said.
	   The accident occurred as the capital exploded in joy after
France beat Brazil for the championship. At least a million people
streamed to the Champs-Elysees to celebrate.
	   A woman zigzagging down the avenue from the Arc de Triomphe in a
black Volkswagen plowed into the partying fans, injuring about 60 _
seven seriously, officials said. None was critically injured.
	   ``Apparently it was a crazy car, which drove for several dozen
meters (yards), knocking over people on its way,'' said Cmdr.
Philippe Lavoil, a rescue official. Two hundred rescue workers in
dozens of ambulances arrived to treat the victims.
	   Helmeted riot police lined the avenue, keeping dye hard revelers
and curiosity-seekers at bay.
	   The driver was attacked by the crowd before police intervened,
according to witnesses. The car was seen lying on its side.
	   The driver ``has fled but has been identified,'' Lavoil said.
	   Reports that the driver was apparently drunk could not be
confirmed. There were suggestions she may simply have panicked when
the car was set upon by crowds of revelers.
	   Witnesses said the woman dragged some people for several meters
(yards) after hitting them.
	   One witness, Stephan Gueroui, 24, said he'd seen the car coming
down the Champs-Elysees the wrong way, then veered diagonally
across the avenue.
	   ``A car was coming down the Champs-Elysees in the wrong
direction,'' he said. ``It hit a group who was crossing.''
	   His face was swollen and bleeding. He said he'd been caught in a
brawl and gotten hit with a can.
