<HEADLINE> Housing Study Raises Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- America's homeownership rate reached a new high
last year, but rising prices are keeping the poor out of the
market, a new study says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 66.8 percent of Americans owned their own home, up from
66.3 percent in 1998, according to a Harvard University report.
</P>
<P>
   But those seeking to buy homes are facing higher prices and,
over the last year, higher interest rates, leaving many behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The red-hot economy has done little to relieve the housing
problems of low-income households,'' the annual report says.
</P>
<P>
   The price of homes rose faster last year than the general
inflation rate for the sixth straight year. Inflation-adjusted
prices have increased 11 percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the thriving housing market has done little to narrow the
gap between minority and white homeownership rates, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The traditional premise used to be that if you work you could
afford a decent place to live,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director
of Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. ''In many housing
markets, you can work, you can work hard, you can work long, and
you still won't find a decent place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeownership rates for whites increased from 70 percent to 73.2
percent. For blacks the rates rose from 42.5 to 46.7 percent, and
for Hispanics from 41.2 to 45.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 1 million more black homeowners today than five
years ago, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, this year's report was more cautious than last
year's, warning that recent rises in interest rates would
inevitably cool the market. That may already be happening -- housing
starts dipped 3.9 percent between April and May.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also expressed concern that an opportunity to
improve the housing conditions of the poor is being squandered.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, rents rose faster than inflation for the third
straight year. Since 1996, rents have exceeded the general rate of
inflation by about 1 percent a year. Portland, Ore., San Francisco
and Seattle had record rents last year, and rents in the Northeast
approached their highs from the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's other conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Between 1995 and 1998, the value of primary residences rose
from $7.8 trillion to $9.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   -- Only three metropolitan areas -- Miami and Buffalo and
Rochester, N.Y. -- experienced real price declines.

<HEADLINE> Commissioner Probe Halts GOP Ascent  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A state lawyer said Monday she went
public in the scandal surrounding Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush because she was outraged by the agency's lenient
treatment of insurers after the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In opening testimony at a legislative hearing, Insurance
Department attorney Cindy Ossias said the settlements the
department reached with insurers accused of mishandling claims
after quake were far lower than her investigation found were
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was appalled,'' Ossias told the Assembly Insurance
Committee. ''I had been involved in three of the examinations. ...
I felt these exams showed violations that were egregious and
warranted hefty fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the panel ordered the arrest of a witness who
failed to appear. And two key witnesses who did appear -- Deputy
Commissioner Mark Lowder and former Deputy Commissioner George
Grays -- invoked their Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination and declined to answer questions about
California's biggest political scandal in years.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias, who released confidential audits to legislators
investigating Quackenbush, said the settlements were for far less
than the department could have obtained.
</P>
<P>
   She detailed $119 million in alleged claims violations against
State Farm and said she was ordered to shred her report on the
insurer, which later settled by giving $2 million to a fund created
by Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias said her $119 million figure was an ''opening gambit''
for negotiations, reflecting ''the absolute maximum exposure of the
company to the Department of Insurance,'' and that a final
settlement might be lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't seem out of line for State Farm to have paid $20
million or $40 million,'' she said. But the $2 million payment, she
testified, was inadequate to resolve hundreds of alleged violations
outlined in department audits.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican former state assemblyman, Quackenbush was elected
to the insurance commissioner post in 1994, pledging to crack down
on insurance fraud and other crimes and make insurance more
affordable. He won re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in just weeks, the 46-year-old former Army helicopter pilot
has become enmeshed in controversy. He is accused of leveraging
millions of dollars in settlement funds from the insurers he
regulates -- and who donated to his campaign -- to further his own
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner himself is scheduled to testify Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has denied knowledge of any improper activities and
contends he is target of a Democratic vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly Minority Leader Scott Baugh, a Republican, said
earlier hearings ''unearthed a truckload of disturbing evidence,
and it is quite apparent that Insurance Department personnel were
engaged in inappropriate activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance committee is expected to decide after
Quackenbush's testimony whether he committed wrongdoing, and if so,
what action it should recommend. The possibilities include censure,
criminal charges or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias testified Monday that her anger led her to release
confidential department audits to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''With each settlement amount I saw I was more outraged,''
Ossias said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 claims were filed following the quake, which
killed 72 people and caused more than $15 billion in insured
losses. It rivals Hurricane Andrew as the nation's costliest
national disaster.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the scandal is Quackenbush's creation of a
series of nonprofit foundations with money from insurance company
settlements. By one estimate, he authorized more than two dozen
settlements totaling $19 million, enabling companies to pay a
fraction of the amount they could have been fined.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush created the largest foundation, the California
Research and Assistance Fund, in April 1999 with donations from a
half-dozen insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Audits by Quackenbush's staff detailed hundreds of allegations
of mishandled earthquake claims and suggested potential fines of up
to $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush allowed the insurers to resolve the complaints by
contributing just $12 million to the fund, designed to provide
money for consumer assistance and quake research.
</P>
<P>
   But even Quackenbush acknowledges none of the money had been
spent for either purpose. More than $4.1 million financed
public-service television advertising featuring the commissioner,
and hundreds of thousands of dollars went to groups with no
connection to quake issues.
</P>
<P>
   The committee issued an arrest warrant for B.T. Thompson of the
Skillz Athletic Foundation, which received $217,000 in foundation
funds and ran a sports camp attended by Quackenbush's children.
Thompson failed to appear under subpoena, and the committee ordered
the sergeant-at-arms to arrest him and compel him to testify,
possibly at the Thursday hearing.

<HEADLINE> Only juries can decide motive in 'hate crime'  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) - A white New Jersey man who was
sentenced by a judge to 12 years in prison for firing shots into a
black family's home is entitled to a jury trial, the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The court Monday said juries, not judges, must decide whether
someone charged with a hate crime was motivated by bias and
therefore can be given a higher maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision overturns the sentence imposed on Charles C.
Apprendi Jr., of Vineland.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C., lawyer who follows the Supreme Court said
the ruling will have ''huge implications'' on criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi was arrested in December 1994 after eight shots were
fired into the home of a black family living in his otherwise
all-white neighborhood of Vineland, about 35 miles southeast of
Philadelphia. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi admitted firing the shots, and at first he told police
he wanted to send a message to the black family that they did not
belong there. Later, he said he was pressured into making a false
statement, and that he had no racial intent but fired into the
house when its purple front door caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi pleaded guilty to a firearm violation and possessing a
bomb in his house, which carried a maximum 10-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors sought a longer term under the hate-crime law. The
judge imposed a 12-year sentence, saying prosecutors showed by a
''preponderance of the evidence'' that Apprendi's act was racially
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi contended that such decisions must be made by a jury
using the highest legal standard - whether prosecutors offered
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's lawyers said the hate-crime law punished motive,
which traditionally is a sentencing issue to be decided by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against Apprendi and upheld
his sentence. On Monday, the nation's highest court reversed the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said the case
was a question of procedure. The justices previously ruled that any
factor, except for a prior conviction, ''that increases the maximum
penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to
a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New Jersey procedure challenged in this case is an
unacceptable departure from the jury tradition that is an
indispensable part of our criminal justice system,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, said the court's ruling
''has grand implications throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Green, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., law firm of
Sidley &AMP; Austin, who observes the Supreme Court, said the ruling
will have enormous ramifications for both federal and state
criminal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that would include something about bodily injury, or
taking of money, or harm to a child or harm to a vulnerable adult
is likely to fall within the category of something which must go to
a jury if it increases the maximum statutory sentencing,'' he said.
''This case will have huge implications for the practice of
criminal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi, 45, has served five and a half years. If he had not
been convicted of a hate crime, he would have been sentenced to
five years, O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should get out now. I'm going to petition for his
release,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi's mother, Bernice, of Vineland, was overjoyed at the
news, as was her son in an emotional telephone call, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was choked up. You could tell there were tears in his
throat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just an overwhelming thing because it's such an important
issue and it came through in his favor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her son, a pharmacist, is looking forward to ''starting
his life over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all states have some type of hate-crime law, although
many already specify that a jury, not a judge, must decide whether
a defendant was motivated by bias.	   Earlier this month, the justices ruled
unanimously in a case
involving five members of the Branch Davidian cult that a jury, not
a judge, must decide whether people deserve extra punishment for
using a machine gun during their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was one of the first states to adopt a hate-crime
law, in 1981. It bans acts of racial or ethnic intimidation, such
as burning crosses or painting swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   The law was expanded in 1990 to provide stiffer sentences for
such common crimes as assault and harassment if the defendant acted
with a ''purpose to intimidate'' because of factors such as race,
sex or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens noted that the jury convicted Apprendi of an offense
with a maximum 10-year penalty, adding that the effect of the
''sentencing enhancement here is unquestionably to turn a
second-degree offense into a first-degree offense, under the
state's own criminal code.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Stephen G. Breyer and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, O'Connor said, ''Our court has long
recognized that not every fact that bears on a defendant's
punishment need be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury
and proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Instead,
she said, legislatures can define the elements of an offense.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Apprendi vs. New Jersey, 99-478.

<HEADLINE> Honduras: Military Chopper Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- A military helicopter carrying four
soldiers crashed into electrical lines Monday and plunged into a
hydroelectric dam, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not release the Honduran soldiers names, but said
U.S. and Honduran military crews were looking for the men.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were taking part in a U.S.-Honduras disaster relief
training at El Coyolar dam, and were returning to Tegucigalpa under
heavy rains when they lost contact with the control tower, said
Col. Daniel Lopez Carballo of the Honduran Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tegucigalpa is about 120 kilometers north of the dam.
</P>
<P>
   About 430 U.S. and Honduran military officials are participating
in a series of water, land and air exercises, which started June 1
and ends Tuesday. The exercises are designed to train soldiers how
to respond to natural disasters and to combat drug smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Promoter says payoffs began after he got rankings for South Africans </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Cedric Kushner, who parlayed a sixth-grade
education into a successful career promoting rock 'n' roll shows
and boxing matches, says he could read the writing on the wall when
the IBF let him know it operated on a cash basis.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, a native South African, said he convinced IBF founder
Robert W. Lee in 1987 that his powerful sanctioning organization
should rank South African fighters despite that nation's apartheid
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, longtime IBF ratings chairman C. Douglas Beavers
approached Kushner and demanded $20,000, Kushner testified Monday
at Lee's racketeering trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to be too smart to realize it will impact you
if you don't pay,'' Kushner told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner said he agreed to pay only $10,000, and that payoff
became the first of periodic payments that he made over the next
eight years that were divided among Lee, Beavers and other IBF
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, now an American citizen who gained fame in the 1970s as
a promoter of rock 'n' roll concerts before turning to boxing in
1982, is the fourth major promoter to testify against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   All said payoffs were required to do business with the East
Orange, N.J.-based IBF. As one of three major sanctioning bodies
for boxing in the world, its rankings and decisions play a large
role in the purses earned by boxers, of which managers and
promoters get a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, the IBF and the WBC would not rate South African
fighters in protest of the now-scrapped apartheid policy that
relegated blacks to second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, who promoted some black fighters from South Africa,
protested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was double punishment to the fighters. They were
discriminated against in their country and then they didn't get
(championship) opportunities,'' Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   In undercover FBI tapes made by Beavers and played for the jury,
Beavers and Lee referred to Kushner as the ''fat man.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavyset promoter, sporting his trademark walrus mustache,
was not asked about the nickname, but corroborated testimony by
Beavers on how the payoffs were done.
</P>
<P>
   Three to four times a year, from 1987-1994, Beavers would drive
from his home in Portsmouth, Va., to Kushner's home in East
Hampton, N.Y., and get cash ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, Kushner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The visits would be preceded by a call from Beavers, who would
say, ''The boss wants to know when we're getting together again,''
Kushner testified.
</P>
<P>
   ''He might say, 'There are 5,000 reasons I have to come and see
you,''' Kushner said. The implication was clear: he had to pay
$5,000, Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers would deliver shares to Lee and Bill Brennan, then the
IBF championship committee chairman, Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   The money was never for a specific favor, Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner is expected back on the stand Tuesday, where he is to
discuss a $100,000 bribe other witnesses have said he funneled to
the IBF for a rematch between heavyweight champion George Foreman
and Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking $338,000 over
more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged rankings, but
the bulk of that money stems from the machinations regarding
Foreman and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, N.J., and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of
Scotch Plains, N.J., are the only defendants on trial. They face
multiyear prison terms if convicted of conspiracy, racketeering,
fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S. Boxing
Association, a group that became the IBF, was severed from the
trial because of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF's South American representative, Francisco ''Pacho''
Fernandez of Colombia, remains at large.

<HEADLINE> FDA Opening OTC Drug Debate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Envision powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs
sitting between the cough syrup and dental floss on store shelves --
no doctor's prescription required. Just toss a box of Mevacor or
Pravachol into the shopping cart and you're off.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a safe way to ward off a heart attack? And if the
government lets those cholesterol medicines start selling without a
prescription, what's next -- over-the-counter antibiotics or blood
pressure therapy or diabetes drugs?
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration this week begins debating major
changes in how it regulates over-the-counter drugs, and the fate of
Mevacor and Pravachol could signal whether a new wave of
nonprescription drugs is headed for a store near you.
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol patients don't have the only stake. Consider the
allergy reliever Claritin. A prominent insurance company wants
Claritin to sell without a prescription like it does in Canada,
where a month's supply is about $17 instead of the $60, plus
doctor's fees, Americans pay.
</P>
<P>
   Money aside, Blue Cross of California argues nondrowsy Claritin
is safer than today's over-the-counter antihistamines that make
people sleepy, very dangerous if they're driving.
</P>
<P>
   But manufacturer Schering-Plough Corp. -- which is aggressively
lobbying Congress for patent extensions to preserve Claritin's
profits -- opposes selling nonprescription Claritin here. Can the
FDA, citing public safety, force the switch?
</P>
<P>
   They're serious dilemmas. On one side is better consumer access.
Prices usually drop when drugs move over the counter, and experts
say only a fraction of people who could benefit from nondrowsy
allergy relievers and powerful cholesterol drugs called ''statins''
use them.
</P>
<P>
   But critics question how you'd ever know without a doctor's exam
if simmering cholesterol was improving. Insurers seldom pay for
nonprescription drugs. Plus, if FDA forces Claritin over the
counter, it likely will wind up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are more interested in taking care of their own
health problems as much as they can,'' says Dr. Robert Delap, FDA's
chief of nonprescription drugs. ''We recognize that, and we're
reexamining ... what our policies should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes public Wednesday and Thursday, when the FDA
holds hearings in suburban Washington for consumers and advocacy
groups to voice opinions. (FDA also will accept written comments;
check http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00725.html).
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, far more drugs could be affected. What about blood
pressure medicines, or the ''morning after'' pill that women need
in a hurry to prevent pregnancy? Look ahead to vaginal
''microbicides'' that companies are rapidly developing to protect
against the AIDS virus, products many advocates argue will have to
be nonprescription to help poor women.
</P>
<P>
   But the statins and Claritin are the first FDA must decide. Next
month, FDA's independent scientific advisers will formally vote on
Mevacor and Pravachol's fate. No Claritin deadline has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The cholesterol decision is overdue, says industry consultant
Steve Francesco, noting Americans already can buy an unregulated
dietary supplement called Cholestin that contains Mevacor's active
ingredient. Plus, there are FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering
margarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''These drugs are vastly superior than some of the nutritionals
out there, and yet the nutritionals are being marketed to the
public and these drugs are not,'' contends Francesco.
</P>
<P>
   But Mevacor and Pravachol patients today must get blood tests
against a rare side effect, liver damage, that would be impossible
if they don't see a doctor, argues consumer advocate Dr. Sidney
Wolfe of Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   As for Claritin, the FDA worries that people use today's
nonprescription but sleep-inducing allergy relievers, such as
Benadryl, before getting behind the wheel. Worried enough to say
the nondrowsy competitors Claritin, Allegra or Zyrtec should be
nonprescription, too?
</P>
<P>
   Delap demurs, saying, ''We need to find a way to accomplish what
needs to happen for the public health. But there are some legal
issues here that I would not say I have the final word on.''
</P>
<P>
   Schering contends Claritin should remain prescription-only
because ''allergies are a complex and potentially serious disease
that requires a high level of medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about ... a runny nose,'' responds Blue Cross'
Robert Seidman, who petitioned FDA to force the change.

<HEADLINE> Golisano: Chances are I won't run for governor again  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - B. Thomas Golisano, the millionaire
Rochester businessman who twice ran unsuccessfully for governor as
the candidate of New York's arm of the national Reform Party, said
Monday the odds are against a third run.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chances are I won't,'' Golisano said.
</P>
<P>
   The founder and head of Paychex, a successful payroll processing
company, put the New York Independence Party on the electoral map,
when he collected 217,490 votes of the more than 5 million cast in
the 1994 governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   While he finished third behind election winner George Pataki and
then-Gov. Mario Cuomo, Golisano's vote surpassed the 50,000-vote
threshold needed in New York to gain the Ross Perot-inspired party
an automatic spot on the state ballot for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano did even better in the 1998 election, when he won
364,056 votes on the Independence line as Pataki won a second term.
The Golisano vote not only maintained the party's automatic spot on
the ballot for another four years, but moved it into third place on
the ballot behind the Republicans and Democrats, pushing the state
Conservative Party into fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a party's vote for governor determines its spot on
the ballot. Higher spots are considered more advantageous.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he might not run for governor again, Golisano said
Monday, ''Why not? Maybe the question should be, 'Why should I?'''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano said in a telephone interview that he was busy
''running my company'' and was not disillusioned by his two
unsuccessful runs.
</P>
<P>
   While New York's Independence Party has been riven by leadership
battles in recent months, Golisano said he felt it remained strong
and would likely survive such internal disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leadership, just like governmental leadership, comes and
goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting recent enrollment figures from the state Board of
Elections that showed the Independence Party had surpassed the
Conservative Party in actual membership, 172,471 to 171,496,
Golisano remarked, ''I'd say it was doing damn well.''

<HEADLINE> Regional Red Cross arm declares blood supply emergency  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Giving blood is no big deal to Larry Koch
- he's donated 16 gallons in the past 25 years. If only the Red
Cross could clone him.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with fewer donors and increasing demand, the New York-Penn
Region of American Red Cross Blood Services has declared a blood
emergency, calling it the most drastic hospital demand-driven
shortage in a least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said the regional blood supply was 45 percent of
what it should be as the Fourth of July holiday nears. Supplies of
nearly every blood type are low because hospital demand has
outpaced blood donations for two months. Some hospitals have even
decided to cut back on elective surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Although summer shortages are the norm, there is the feeling
that this one is acute.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we do expect is that it dips in the summer,'' Red Cross
spokesperson Andrea Strano said Monday. ''We usually don't arrive
at that point until midsummer. But this isn't the usual summer cry
for donations. We don't know how this is going to play out through
September.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New York-Penn region, which serves 129 hospitals in 61
counties, 2,600 more units of blood were distributed in May than a
year ago. That's a 12 percent increase. And Strano said the problem
is likely to grow in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our speculation is that generations are getting older and need
more medical attention and medical procedures,'' she said. ''This
is really a trend that we're seeing the beginning of.''
</P>
<P>
   Strano said a directive from the federal government barring
people who have spent six months in Great Britain may have cost the
Red Cross 2 percent of its donors. ''That's a lot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown how long the March ruling, a response to the
overseas mad cow disease scare, will be in place.
</P>
<P>
   Although it only takes 8-10 minutes for the actual process of
giving blood, donors end up spending about an hour because they
also have to fill out a questionnaire and take time to recover.
That's an hour that many feel they don't have.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a busier lifestyle. It makes it more convenient to
forget that blood donations are needed,'' Strano said. ''It's been
something that's gradually occurred as society has gone from a
one-income household to everybody working. There are also lot of
activities competing for civic duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in Larry Koch's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in the cause,'' said Koch, a 46-year-old architect
in the Syracuse area with a 6-month-old baby keeping him awake when
it's time to sleep. ''I make sure that I get down there and donate
every 56 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do my best to proselytize, but it hasn't worked,'' Koch
said. ''People are afraid of needles, afraid of maybe catching a
disease, although you can't catch a disease from donating. Most
people have two reasons for not giving - they're afraid of needles,
or they've tried it and had a bad experience, and that finished
them off forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Strano said blood donation centers will be open extra hours for
the next two weeks. Any healthy person age 17 or older and who
weighs at least 110 pounds may be eligible to give.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who profess a fear of needles, Koch can empathize.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a big needle person,'' he said. ''When I was in
elementary school, I feigned being sick when they gave certain
shots, I was so terrified. I think that's part of why I give. It's
an atonement for that. You've got to challenge your fears. Once I
started giving, I never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information, prospective donors are urged to call the
Red Cross toll-free at: 1-800-272-4543.

<HEADLINE> Shaq Insists He's a team Player  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal,
criticized for making a commercial during the ongoing actors'
strike against the ad industry, insisted he's really a team player.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been through two work stoppages in my career and I know
how difficult they are to union members and their families,''
O'Neal said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal filmed an instant ''I'm going to Disneyland!'' spot after
the Lakers won the NBA championship June 19. O'Neal's fee went to
his charity for disadvantaged children, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the regular season and NBA Finals MVP, came under fire
from the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists, which authorized the strike that
began May 1. Union membership is mandatory for all who make
commercials, including athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a SAG and AFTRA member, I fully support the strike and hope
that negotiations can resume in the very near future so both sides
can get back to business as quickly as possible,'' O'Neal said.

<HEADLINE> Cop calls conviction in Louima case 'lynching'  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An ex-patrolman facing severe prison time for
his role in one of the worst police brutality scandals in city
history has lashed out at federal authorities, calling himself a
victim of a ''modern day lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   In a spiteful, defiant letter filed with pre-sentencing court
papers, Charles Schwarz claimed he is ''totally innocent'' of
charges he and another officer tortured Abner Louima with a broken
broomstick following Louima's arrest in a 1997 street disturbance.
Schwarz was to be sentenced Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no excuse for what happened to Abner Louima, however,
I will not take responsibility for a criminal act that I didn't
commit, nor will I apologize for something I didn't do,'' the
defendant wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Schwarz added, ''was nothing more than a modern day
lynching'' staged by ''shifty'' and ''overzealous'' prosecutors. He
also accused U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson of allowing the
government ''to get away with their misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, 34, a former Marine, was convicted last year of
violating Louima's civil rights by restraining him while another
officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized the handcuffed Haitian immigrant
with the stick in a precinct bathroom. Volpe, in a guilty plea,
said he flew into a blind rage because he believed - mistakenly -
that the prisoner had punched him in the street.
</P>
<P>
   In a second trial this year, a jury found Schwarz and two other
officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, guilty of concocting a
story to try to clear Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz faces a possible life sentence for the bathroom assault,
although the judge has authority to give him less time; Volpe
received 30 years. The judge also is to sentence Schwarz, Bruder
and Wiese for obstruction of justice, which carries a penalty of up
to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz has maintained at both trials - and through a ''Free
Chuck Schwarz'' campaign waged by his family, attorneys and police
union officials - that he was never in the bathroom. Taking the
witness stand at the second trial, he claimed he was searching a
patrol car at the time of the assault; Volpe testified that it was
Wiese, not Schwarz, who was the second officer.
</P>
<P>
   But two officers credited with breaking the so-called blue wall
of silence testified that they saw Schwarz leading Louima toward
the bathroom. And Louima testified his second assailant was ''the
driver'' who transported him to the station; records show Schwarz
drove the patrol car.

<HEADLINE> More Civil War soldiers' graves disturbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROVELAND, N.Y. (AP) - Vandals disturbed the graves of two more
Civil War-era veterans near where the skull of a Union officer
known as an ''evil genius'' was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Five holes have appeared within the last two months in the
Williamsburgh Cemetery in Groveland 35 miles south of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes were dug near the tombstone of Army Maj. Fitzhugh
Birney, a military lawyer. Another two holes appeared near the
grave of Navy Capt. Samuel Adams Lee. A fifth hole wasn't near a
gravestone, said Groveland town Historian Larry Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston County sheriff's deputies are unsure whether anything
was taken. They are checking to see whether the incidents are
related to last week's theft of the skull of Union officer Elisha
G. Marshall's skull from Mt. Hope Cemetery in Rochester. He was a
brevet general, a temporary title, and retired as a colonel. Police
believe that desecration on the summer solstice may have been part
of a satanic ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Satanic symbols were found nearby and the solstice is a day
police watch for such activity in cemeteries.	   
</P>
<P>
   In the Groveland incident, Turner said he suspects thieves armed
with metal detectors are searching for Civil War-era relics. A
well-preserved belt buckle or sword can be worth thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think they are going to dig up one of those graves and
find a bonanza and get rich,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anything to indicate a (relationship), but you
never know,'' said Rochester police spokesman Carlos Garcia said of
the Groveland and Rochester incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Birney was the son of James Birney, an abolitionist who ran for
president on the Liberty Party line in 1840 and 1844. His maternal
grandfather was Col. William Fitzhugh, who with Col. Nathaniel
Rochester and Maj. Charles Carroll bought the land along the
Genesee River that now forms downtown Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Lee wasn't so successful. When a ship's rigging fell on his
foot, doctors had to amputate, Turner said. Then, when recovering
in hospitals, Lee became addicted to painkillers, Turner said. In
1882, Lee died of an opium overdose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want these guys stopped,'' Turner said. ''I put too much
work into these cemeteries to have them all messed up.''

<HEADLINE> Japan on Alert for Volcano Eruption  </HEADLINE>
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Earthquakes rattled a small Japanese island in the
Pacific on Tuesday, and 2,500 people were evacuated from their
homes amid warnings of a possible volcanic eruption.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation was ordered late Monday on Miyakejima, 120 miles
south of Tokyo, after a series of mild earthquakes suggested
volcanic activity. The area around Miyakejima is volcanic, and
Mount Oyama, a 2,686-foot volcano on the island, has had several
major eruptions this century.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists detected nearly 3,150 quakes on Miyakejima starting
late Monday. Many were too small to be felt, the Meteorological
Agency said. Two of the latest tremors on Tuesday registered a
magnitude of 4.0, the strongest so far, the Meteorological Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe an eruption has possibly begun undersea already,''
said Yoshiaki Ida, a seismologist at the Coordinating Committee for
the Prediction of Volcanic Eruptions. ''Our biggest fear is that
there would be violent explosions if eruption occurs closer to
shorelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Agency said the surface of the ocean about 1 mile
off the west coast of the island had turned yellow and blue,
meaning the seabed may have erupted Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In more possible evidence of an undersea eruption, the agency
later reported that one of its patrol ships felt a strong jolt from
below. A moment later, another vessel observed thick steam rising
from the sea's surface.
</P>
<P>
   As the undersea activity increased, Tokyo and local authorities
readied evacuation and assistance plans.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office set up a crisis center to evacuate
people from the island if necessary, and officials dispatched 29
ships to stand by. The local government ordered residents in the
south to seek shelter in schools on the northern side.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo city government was preparing to ship 800 blankets,
medicine and water to the island, city official Kazuhiro Sakurai
said. The city's fire department sent a 10-member team of rescuers
and planned to send more rescuers, equipment and heat-resistant
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial flights to Miyakejima were canceled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama last erupted in 1983, spewing lava down the
mountain's southwestern flank and destroying homes. No one died
because all the residents were evacuated. An eruption in 1940
killed 11 people and injured 20.
</P>
<P>
   The island has an area of 21 square miles and is home to about
4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most seismically active nations. A
volcanic eruption on Miyakejima would be Japan's second this year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,000 people living at the foot of Mount Usu in
northern Japan were ordered to leave their homes after the volcano
coughed up steam and ash March 31 for the first time in 22 years.
Many evacuees have been allowed to return home since officials said
in May that the volcano may be drifting back to sleep.

<HEADLINE> Ballooning Runs Afoul in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- As dawn breaks through the hilltop
palms, dozens of sleepy-eyed ''baloeiros'' use a welding torch to
ignite the wad of wax-soaked-cotton that will propel their hot air
balloon skyward and keep it flying for up to 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Then they gingerly raise the 30-foot orb, with its three baskets
of fireworks trailing below, out of the volcano-shaped hill -- a
hidden patch of jungle on Rio's otherwise drab westside. As the
balloon climbs higher, the fireworks begin firing a rat-a-tat-tat
of white sparks and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of applause follows the final explosion, then everyone
rushes to their cars: Some hoping to recover the balloon, others to
catch a second launch whispered through the baloeiro grapevine and
others, still, home to sleep. No matter where they are headed, they
go quickly to avoid the police.
</P>
<P>
   To the baloeiros, setting off balloons during Brazil's annual
June festivities honoring Saints Peter, Paul, Anthony and John is a
300-year-old tradition, brought over by the Portuguese, that needs
to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities don't share that vision. The 1998 ''environmental
crimes'' law made the launch, transport and storage of unmanned
balloons a crime punishable by fines and even prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''These balloons are just like stray bullets because they are
unguided and can fall anywhere, on top of houses, on electric
wires, wherever. They present a hazard to aviation and every year
they destroy hundreds of hectares of forest,'' said Major Fabio
Jose Meirelles, commander of Rio's forest fire fighting brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Meirelles said balloons started about 43 percent of the forest
fires that claimed some 1,720 hectares -- 4,250 acres -- around Rio
in 1997. Fires burned only about a third of that acreage in 1999, a
year after balloons were banned.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran baloeiro Humberto Pinto, a retired police colonel,
concedes the fires are a problem but says the answer lies in better
regulation, not a total ban.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto was arrested in May while handing out fliers defending the
legalization of ballooning. He was charged under a Brazilian law
that makes it illegal to advocate criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ridiculous; there's no such thing as free speech here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baloeiros say the crackdown won't deter them and claim that
hundreds of crews working independently launched some 5,000
balloons this past Mother's Day alone.
</P>
<P>
   Like graffiti artists who spend entire nights covering subway
cars with murals just to see them buffed clean the next day,
there's more than a touch of the fanatic among baloeiros. The ban
only adds to the mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them sport a T-shirts bearing the slogan ''Arte
Prohibido,'' or prohibited art, accompanied by an elegantly
rendered drawing of a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police are cracking down more and more these days. Last
weekend, I was at a launch where they even fired three shots before
we could get away,'' brags 29-year-old baloeiro Emiliano Martinelli
with a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rio's samba groups during carnival, baloeiros often spend
thousands of dollars and several months on elaborate creations that
will be glimpsed only briefly during seasonal celebrations. The
main difference being the baloeiros' parade floats really float.
</P>
<P>
   Towering as high as 72 feet, the balloons often carry enormous
banners or, if launched at night, panels made up of hundreds of
tiny candles arranged to make a picture, usually honoring soccer
teams or saints.
</P>
<P>
   At Neneh's bar, a popular baloeiro hangout on Rio's poor
northside, enthusiasts trade stories and photographs of balloons
honoring Jesus, Charlie Chaplin, Ernest Hemingway, the late
Brazilian entertainer Chacrinha and Lady Diana.
</P>
<P>
   There's even one in the shape of the Eiffel Tower whose wide
base and pointy top would seem to defy basic balloon design sense.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Jandir Oliveira da Silva, 42, and his friends
take time off from their drinking to go across the street and
launch three-foot-high balloons using cigarette lighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will die, but ballooning will never die,'' he said. ''My
father made balloons in the dining room. This is a tradition that
passes from father to son, like music.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Greenway officials decry Pataki's firings at agencies  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki's firing of two Hudson
Valley development agencies' leaders has compromised the groups'
independence, the ex-chairman of one agency told a legislative
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and former Gov. Mario Cuomo set up the Hudson
Greenway Council and the Greenway Conservancy as ''public benefit
corporations,'' former Greenway Conservancy Chairman Matthew Bender
IV said.
</P>
<P>
   Their boards got the power to hire and fire so the agencies
would be buffered somewhat from the whims of gubernatorial
intervention, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Bender on Monday recounted for two Democratic Assembly members,
Richard Brodsky of Westchester County and Susan John of Rochester,
how he was told on May 24 by Pataki's appointments secretary Thomas
Doherty to fire Greenway Conservancy Executive Director Maggie
Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked for a reason and I was told, 'The governor wants her
fired,''' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   When he described how well Vinciguerra had performed in a
demanding job, Bender said he was told by Doherty, '''The governor
wants her job' and his job was to deliver that message to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals of Vinciguerra and his counterpart at the
affiliated Greenway Council, David Sampson, triggered a public
discussion of a matter the Republican Pataki administration has
preferred to keep private, the removals of officials inherited from
the Democratic Cuomo administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's spokesmen have defended the governor's action as
prompted by the need to enhance the agencies and to get more done.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, heir to a famous Albany-based legal publishing business,
compounded attention the case received by balking at removing
Sampson, being replaced by Pataki in the unpaid chairman's position
at the Conservancy and by speaking openly about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Janeway has since been hired to replace Vinciguerra and
Carmella Mantello has taken Sampson's job. Mantello will earn
$80,000 year while Janeway will get $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bender said the result of the changes at the Greenway
Conservancy is that the agency is ''politicized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservancy and Council were set up to promote agreement
among Hudson River Valley communities for recreational, tourism and
business development programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who was executive director of the Council for a decade,
said Monday he initially thought there was not enough support on
his board of directors to carry his dismissal. But as time went on,
Sampson said, that support ''eroded'' and the former official said
he heard from several board members that they were pressured by
Pataki's office to vote for Sampson's dismissal on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson said that in at least one case, an unidentified member
of the board was threatened with loss of state funding for the
agency if Sampson wasn't fired.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson said he also heard that Pataki's appointment office was
angered at Sampson and Vinciguerra for appearing at West Point in
May at an economic development event with U.S. Housing Secretary
Andrew Cuomo, a possible Democratic candidate against Pataki in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Bender and Sampson said they heard little, if any, complaints
about the jobs the Council and Conservancy were doing prior to the
directives in May to fire Sampson and Vinciguerra. Sampson did
concede, however, that he did not have a ''warm'' relationship with
Pataki's office. He attributed that to being a holdover from
Cuomo's administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnabas McHenry, chairman of the Greenway Council,
testified Monday that he knew for two years or more that the Pataki
administration was unhappy with the Council and Conservancy.
Specifically, he said there was grumbling over the pace of the two
agencies' work on projects and over their attention to economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw those storm clouds gathering,'' McHenry said. ''What do
you do with storm clouds? You can't do much.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon dismissed Monday's hearing as
political grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took my kids to the circus yesterday so I've had enough of
clowns for the week,'' McKeon said. ''I am not going to comment on
Richard Brodsky's little spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky, who chairs the Assembly's environmental conservation
committee, told Bender and Sampson they did not deserve to be
dismissed by Pataki. Brodsky said the firings were a ''simple
purge'' designed by Pataki to gain tighter control of agencies the
Legislature intended to be more independent of the executive.

<HEADLINE> Settlement will open 12 miles of Moose to canoes, kayaks  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A 12-mile stretch of the Moose River in the
Adirondack Mountains will be opened to canoes and kayaks under an
agreement touted Monday by environmentalists as a landmark for
recreational boaters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement calls for non-motorized access to the south
branch of the river from May 1-Oct. 15 through property owned by
the Old Forge-based Adirondack League Club.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement lays out a number of rules for members of the
public using that stretch of the river, including prohibitions
against fishing, swimming or hunting; anchoring or tying up of
watercrafts; use of any motorized watercraft and overnight trips.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was signed nine years to the month after five
canoeists were barred access to the Moose River in Herkimer County.
A sign hanging over the river on a wire notified canoeists and
kayakers that they were entering private property not open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute touched on a longstanding debate over which of the
thousands of miles of waterways which honeycomb the Adirondacks are
open to the public even though they run through privately owned
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Attorney General Robert Abrams joined the
canoeists' suit against the Adirondack League Club back in 1991 and
the three subsequent New York attorneys general continued to argue
on behalf of greater public access to the Moose River.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration was also arguing on the canoeists'
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state Court of Appeals ruled that the proper test
to determine if a waterway is navigable - and open to the public -
is whether it can be used for commercial or recreational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the commercial use of a waterway was the legal
standard of its navigability, but the judges said the days were
long past when it was relevant to New Yorkers whether a river could
accommodate the floating downstream of logs felled by lumberjacks.
A river or lake's recreational use is also a valid factor, the
judges ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was signed last Friday by state Supreme Court
Justice Joseph Sise in Herkimer County and distributed by lawyers
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Woodworth, counsel for the Adirondack Mountain Club, said
the settlement is the first he knows of in the country establishing
that canoe or kayak travel can make a waterway ''navigable'' in the
legal sense that it is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first settlement that recognizes the right of
portage, he said. That is when boaters get on land and carry canoes
or kayaks around non-navigable obstacles such as waterfalls or
rapids in the river.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five canoeists who originally prompted the
litigation, Tom Kligerman, said the agreement will also open to the
public eight miles of the Moose River, including Remsen Falls,
where it meets the Adirondack League Club property.
</P>
<P>
   ''The river is open - after 110 years of posting - the river is
open,'' Kligerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The five canoeists called Monday on the state to issue a list of
navigable waterways so it is clear to paddlers and to landowners
around those water courses which ones are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other provisions of the agreement are ones calling for
no public access to the Moose River if water levels are too low or
when the Adirondack League Club is stocking the river with fish or
engaging in scientific studies of the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack League Club issued a statement Monday saying it
was happy with the agreement. It also said it would enforce the
terms of the agreement on boaters stringently.
</P>
<P>
   According to the club's recommendation, only experienced
paddlers should try to use the Big Moose due to the remoteness of
the region and the difficulty of the rapids.

<HEADLINE> 15 Dead in Laos Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A passenger helicopter crashed into a
mountain in Laos killing at least 15 people, diplomats said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter of the national carrier Lao Aviation was
traveling on a regular route between Xaysomboune and Xieng Khouang
provinces when it crashed Sunday. No foreigners were reported to be
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Laotian authorities believe the crash site is at the side of a
remote mountain north of Long Tieng, about 94 miles north of the
capital Vientiane but had yet to reach it, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. It happened in
an area where anti-government ethnic Hmong insurgents, who have
stepped up resistance this year, are active.

Housing Study Raises Concerns
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- America's homeownership rate reached a new high last year, but
rising prices are keeping the poor out of the market, a new study says. In 1999,
66.8 percent of Americans owned their own home, up from 66.3 percent in 1998,
according to a Harvard University report. But those seeking to buy homes are
facing higher prices and, over the last year, higher interest rates, leaving
many behind. The price of homes rose faster last year than the general inflation
rate for the sixth straight year.

bitter, 34-year debate over criminal suspects' rights and the Supreme Court

<HEADLINE> CSU Lab To Study Health of US Parks  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The country's 378 national parks, monuments and
historical sites will undergo a massive diagnostic study to assess
where repairs are needed and establish a checklist to measure
future wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State University ecologists and scientists from the
U.S. Geological Survey will conduct the survey independently of the
National Park Service, which already estimates up to $6 billion in
backlogged repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be patterned after an ecological assessment
conducted by Parks Canada in that country's 39 national parks.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed ''significant to severe'' ecological stresses in 31
of Canada's parks and an increase in the intensity of the stresses
in 13 of those parks since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Park expert Mark Peterson said ''I suspect our American parks
could be just as degraded, if not more so, than Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The crush of visitors -- 65 million people to 54 national parks
alone -- has left many suffering from traffic congestion, air
pollution, vandalism, and an invasion of alien plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, manager of research for the National Parks
Conservation Association, said the CSU project will be done in
three phases over four years.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a plan to develop a ''vital signs chart'' for parks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Park Service is very interested in finding where their
weak spots are but their funding is very limited for comprehensive
assessments like this,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Parks Conservation Association and the National
Trust for Historic Preservation organized the study and are
arranging its financing.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Taiwan Leader To Visit Britain  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Making his first visit abroad since
retirement, former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui flew to Britain
on Tuesday, a surprise trip that could raise tensions with rival
China.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lee retired last month, Beijing tried to block the
outspoken Taiwanese leader's efforts to travel to nations that
don't have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, fearing that such
visits would give his government legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Since China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949, Beijing has
considered the island to be a renegade province unworthy of formal
ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Lee flew to Britain for a private visit,
said Christina Chen, spokeswoman at the British Trade and Cultural
Office. The office serves as Britain's de facto embassy in Taipei
because London does not have formal diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. Chen said she had no further details about Lee's travel
plans.
</P>
<P>
   China did not immediately comment on Lee's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Lee planned to attend his granddaughter's high school graduation
ceremony in Britain, said the state-run Broadcasting Corporation of
China and Central News Agency. He planned to return on July 2, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has long reviled Lee and has repeatedly accused him of
trying to push Taiwan toward independence -- a move China has warned
it would use force to stop. Lee has repeatedly said he supports
reunification once China is more democratic and economically
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee visited the United States in 1995 to attend a class
reunion at Cornell University, China conducted war games and fired
missiles into the seas near Taiwan. It recalled its ambassador to
Washington and suspended negotiations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   This is Lee's first trip abroad since he retired after 12 years
in office. He has long expressed an interest in visiting Japan, but
Tokyo was reluctant to approve a visa while he was president.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has also said he would like to visit several Latin American
nations, who are among about 30 nations -- most of them small,
impoverished countries -- that recognize the Taipei government. Lee,
an agricultural economist, has said he would like to help advise
farmers in the nations.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Election Widely Praised  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's presidential election this Sunday is
widely being praised as the fairest and most open in the country's
history. It's the result of a very long march. And some say there
is still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an incremental process, a step-by-step process,'' said
Roderic Ai Camp, a Mexico specialist at Claremont-McKenna College
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has slowly opened its political system since at least
1946, when opposition parties were first allowed into Congress. And
it has been slow -- another 43 years would pass before an opposition
governor was allowed to take office. Not until 1994 did a candidate
outside the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- or PRI -- have much
chance in a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ernesto Zedillo, who won that year, admitted that while the
race was clean, ''it was not equitable,'' apparently because of
PRI's greater spending, media coverage and network of entrenched
power.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 11 significant shake-ups of the
electoral system since 1946 as opposition factions gradually
leveraged their way to a shot at power.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials replaced tough-to-monitor local election
organizers in 1946. Women won the right to vote in 1953.
Proportional representation gave minority parties congressional
representation in 1963. Minority parties received more rights and
more proportional seats in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Camp said the most important change may be the most recent: the
1996 law that removed direct government control over the Federal
Electoral Institute that organizes the voting.
</P>
<P>
   That change ''gives it a stronger basis for creating a level of
credibility among the electorate,'' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of laughable elections, credibility has not come
cheaply. The Institute -- whose board is dominated by academics --
has a budget of about $860 million. Some $353 million of that goes
to political parties to finance their campaigns -- a process meant
to end the PRI's financial dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Critics remain unsatisfied, accusing the government of buying
voters or threatening to cut their benefits if they buck the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a country whose elections are riddled with fraud, yet
not one Mexican has gone to jail because of that,'' said Carlos
Heredia, spokesman for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no such thing as a legitimate election in Mexico.
When the opposition wins it is in spite of the absence of a level
playing field, and in spite of the prevailing impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has seen other tight presidential races, but none where
the result was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The first election for the party later known as the PRI was
''the prototypical, the dirtiest election,'' said George Grayson,
an expert on Mexican elections at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Official results in 1929 showed 1.8 million votes for the
party's Pascual Ortiz Rubio to 105,655 for Jose Vasconcelos, a
quirky educator who was and is something of a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   The result ''was just totally fabricated,'' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Enrique Krauze has written that that Gen. Juan Almazan
might have won the ''dirty and bloody'' 1940 election over the
official candidate, Manuel Avila Camacho, had the race been fair.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the officials counted just 151,000 votes for Almazan
and 2.5 million for Avila Camacho. Camp said his investigations
indicated Almazan had lost nationally -- though he probably carried
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Mexicans insist that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won the
1988 election over the PRI's Carlos Salinas de Gortari, only to be
cheated by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson called that race ''a close second'' to 1929 as Mexico's
most fraudulent election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cardenas wasn't ready to fight the system and (incumbent
President Miguel) de la Madrid wasn't ready to turn over to him,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is running again this year for Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to remove the stain of the election, Salinas oversaw
major reforms: the electoral institute was created with largely
independent directors, campaign spending was regulated and foreign
election observers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most remarkable things about the 2000 race are the
things that go unremarked: In the past, complaints of ballot
stuffing or rigged voter roles were common.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an issue anymore, which is a huge achievement,'' Camp
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Coastal Structures Threatened  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-fourth of the buildings within 500 feet of
the nation's coastlines are threatened by erosion in the next 60
years.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Tuesday by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency concluded that close to 87,000 homes and other buildings
stand on land likely to wash away into the oceans or the Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The findings are sobering,'' FEMA Director James Lee Witt said
in a statement. ''If coastal development continues unabated, and if
the sea levels rise as some scientists are predicting, the impact
will be even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Costs of erosion damage to the owners of homes and other
buildings are expected to average more than half a billion dollars
per year, with the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts the most
threatened. Flood insurance does not cover damage caused by gradual
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists report that the nation appears to be entering a
period of increased hurricane activity. The additional storms can
be expected to increase the coastal erosion threat.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, improved construction and raising homes on posts
has improved the ability to survive storms, creating an unexpected
result after storms that cause severe erosion, said William Seitz
of Texas A&AMP;M University at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Now, houses that would simply have tumbled in the past remain
standing, but out in the water, he said. They have to be condemned
anyway because their septic systems can no longer function.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of storms, erosion is often a gradual process, but it
can be relentless. Its impact is easily illustrated by the problem
of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, which was 1,500 feet from the
shore when erected in 1870. By 1987 the lighthouse was in danger of
falling victim to erosion. Finally, last year, the National Park
Service moved it back 2,900 feet at a cost of $9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of moving homes can be beyond the means of most people.
</P>
<P>
   The FEMA study was ordered by Congress during a debate over how
best to manage coastal erosion, currently handled piecemeal by a
mix of federal, state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time to renew public dialogue about how we can lower
the risks to life and property and reduce the costs from the
inevitable consequences of coastal erosion,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the John H. Heinz III Center for
Science, Economics and the Environment, a Washington research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   It estimated that 338,000 structures are within 500 feet of the
coasts in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii. It did not include
Alaska or such large coastal cities as New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Miami, which it said are heavily protected against
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Of 86,600 structures estimated to be threatened by erosion in
the next 60 years, 53,000 are on the Atlantic Coast, 16,000 on the
Great Lakes, 13,000 along the Gulf of Mexico and 4,600 on the
Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of erosion vary greatly from place to place, with some of
the highest in parts of the Gulf of Mexico at six feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   A major storm can erode the coastline 100 feet in one day, the
report noted, though much of that loss may be restored over the
following years.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of lost and damaged property because of erosion was
estimated at $530 million per year for property owners alone. In
addition it estimated costs of $410 million annually to communities
for loss of land and structures.
</P>
<P>
   Federal flood insurance, for damage caused by floods and storms,
would pay about $80 million of this total at current enrollment
rates, the study said. Even at 100 percent enrollment the insurance
would cover only about $200 million of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommended that Congress direct FEMA to develop
erosion hazard maps for coastal areas and to include the cost of
expected erosion losses when setting flood insurance rates in
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested several other options for dealing with the
threat, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Establish Coastal High Hazard Zones that include both flood and
erosion risks.
</P>
<P>
   --Impose mandatory surcharges on flood insurance in these zones
to add coverage for erosion.
</P>
<P>
   --Impose regulatory measures such as requiring building setbacks
to reduce potential damage.
</P>
<P>
   --Require communities to impose building standards that take into
account future flood potential because of erosion.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide erosion insurance for bluff areas.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide relocation help or buyouts.

<HEADLINE> China Premier Starts Tour of Europe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on Tuesday began a
six-nation, 15-day tour of Europe intended to push for better
relations and more trade.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu hopes to take advantage of the momentum created by last
month's agreement between China and the European Union on terms for
Beijing's long-sought after entry to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu opens his tour with a three-day stay in Bulgaria, the only
non-EU member on his itinerary. He will then travel to Germany,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy and Belgium as well as hold
talks with EU President Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   ''The visit is aiming at furthering the friendly and mutually
beneficial cooperation between China and the six countries and the
EU,'' the government's Xinhua News Agency said in reporting Zhu's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese officials preparing for Zhu's trip anticipated
disputes over human rights, they foresaw few differences on other
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Zhu's agenda is trade. China would like to see
trade with the 15-member EU boosted beyond last year's $59 billion,
and Zhu was taking with him the governor of the central bank and
other key economic advisers.

<HEADLINE> Warning Could Have Saved WWII Jews  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secret intelligence documents suggest Britain
and the United States knew several days beforehand in late 1943
that the Nazis were going to round up Rome's Jews for ''thorough
eradication.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to historians and analysts to debate whether lives
could have been saved, officials said Monday at one of the largest
openings of declassified intelligence records ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have a much better picture of how the Holocaust in
Italy began,'' said historian Richard Breitman in a report he
co-authored for the U.S. government's Nazi War Criminals Records
Interagency Working Group's release of some 400,000 pages of
intelligence records.
</P>
<P>
   ''The release (of the documents) raises the historical question
once again of what Allied governments knew about the Holocaust
during World War II and what might have been done with information
they possessed,'' said Breitman and co-author Timothy Naftali.
</P>
<P>
   Their report was prepared for the declassification of 400,000
pages of documents from the Office of Strategic Services, the World
War II predecessor to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The documents included messages between Nazi secret service
officials in Rome and Berlin that were intercepted and decoded by
British agents and shared with U.S. intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   One from Berlin on Oct. 11, 1943, said the ''immediate and
thorough eradication of the Jews in Italy'' was in the interest of
''general security in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer the delay, the more the Jews ... have an
opportunity (to escape) by moving to the houses of pro-Jewish
Italians,'' said the message ordering the deportation ''of the Jews
without further delay.''
</P>
<P>
   A message intercepted five days later from Rome said: ''Actions
against Jews started and finished today'' and reported the seizure
of more than 1,200 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the ''gap of four or five days'' before the order was
executed, Naftali said British Prime Minister Winston Churchill or
American President Franklin Roosevelt should have made a statement
warning the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that had a statement been made on the radio to the
effect that Allied forces feared for the safety of Romans, and
particularly the Jews of Rome, this might well have had an effect
on decisions made by people to get out,'' Naftali said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it disheartening that there was no more use of some of
this information at the time,'' said Breitman.
</P>
<P>
   But Naftali also warned against a ''rush to conclusions.'' He
and others said it is unclear in hindsight whether taking action on
the information would have compromised British intelligence
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was unclear whether Jews could have acted on the
information had they received it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there will be much study and debate over the
volumes of documents released Monday before history decides what to
make of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is so much here that historians will be digging
fruitfully for a long time to come,'' Naftali said.
</P>
<P>
   The interagency working group was established in January 1999 to
coordinate a large-scale effort by U.S. federal agencies to find,
declassify and release U.S. records relating to Germany's Nazi
regime.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the decoded messages, the OSS documents included
transcripts of conversations among German POWs secretly recorded by
the British and information gathered by the OSS using an anti-Nazi
German informant.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have resisted opening their files for half a
century, saying national security was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is reviewing decades-old documents gathered from the
Department of Defense, the OSS, Justice, State, FBI and other
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chile Guard Confirms Executions  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A former army officer has openly
confirmed stories that have long circulated in Chile -- that
political prisoners were routinely executed at a soccer stadium in
the capital of this South American country after the 1973 military
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Former guard Roberto Saldias' interview Monday on state-owned
television was the first time a member of the armed forces has
verified such stories publicly and without the cloak of anonymity.
Rumors about executions, torture and other violations of human
rights at the National Stadium after the coup led by then army
chief Gen. Augusto Pinochet have been rampant for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, the noncommissioned officer said he was
prepared to identify the executioners by name.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took the law in their own hands,'' said Saldias. At the
time, he said, he was one of the hundreds of guards at the stadium,
which was used as a prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   Saldias' willingness to reveal the names of alleged human rights
violators could be the first concrete, public result of the armed
forces' commitment to help determine the fate of more than 1,000
dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with the military was reached early last week that
included the guarantee of anonymity for those who deliver
information on those who disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   According to Saldias, prisoners at the stadium were organized in
groups identified by yellow, black and red discs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever received a red disc had no chance'' and would be
killed, Saldias said.
</P>
<P>
   The only person Saldias named in the interview was former lt.
Armando Fernandez Larios, who fled to the United States in the late
1970s and cooperated with investigators looking into the killing of
former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington in September
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armando Fernandez Larios is the biggest murderer in Chile;
he's a psychopath and a murderer,'' Saldias said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,190 people were killed under
Pinochet's regime and more than 1,000 remain missing.

<HEADLINE> Elian Case Reaches Supreme Court  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bye-bye, Elian? Well, not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez could be allowed to return to his native Cuba by
Wednesday, but his Miami relatives are mounting a last-gasp effort
to keep him on U.S. soil unless the Supreme Court rules otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the relatives filed a formal appeal with the court,
asking that Elian be required to remain in the United States until
the high court has a chance to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Falk, a professor at the City University of New York
School of Law, said Monday the latest appeal was a long shot, and
she predicted that Elian's U.S. stay was nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, 6, has been living with his family at a historic home in
a residential area of Washington. He remained out of sight Monday
while his fate was being weighed by lawyers and by judges from the
nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives are asking that the court review an Atlanta
federal appeals court ruling handed down Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal filed Monday said the case's legal issues ''boil down
to a single straightforward question: Can the Immigration and
Naturalization Service deprive an alien child of his statutory and
constitutional right to apply for asylum without conducting any
hearing of any kind -- or even without interviewing the child
himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court unanimously rejected the Miami relatives'
request for a rehearing and said its earlier order requiring
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to keep the boy in this
country would dissolve at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to
keep Elian in the United States until that formal appeal is acted
upon.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy handles emergency matters from Florida for the high
court.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks' delay in the long legal fight over the boy ''is a
minimal cost in a case with stakes of such magnitude,'' Kennedy was
told.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what recourse the relatives would have if the high court
does not act, Kendall Coffey, an attorney for the relatives, said
in Miami: ''If the injunction is not granted by Wednesday at 4
p.m., our assumption is that there is nothing that will prevent the
child from being immediately moved to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who was rescued off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving
Day, has become a rallying point for anti-Castro sentiments in the
United States, particularly in Miami's Cuban exile neighborhoods.
The boy's mother and 10 other people drowned after their boat sank
en route from communist Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian stayed with his Miami relatives until federal agents
seized him on April 22 and turned him over to his father pending
the court appeals.

<HEADLINE> Braves Ban Announcers From Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves banned four TBS announcers
from the team's chartered flights after the cable channel revealed
that the catcher's box was altered at Turner Field, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reported in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Caray, Joe Simpson, Don Sutton and Pete Van Wieren usually
fly with the team on road trips. Now, they will have to use
commercial flights, beginning with Tuesday's game at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was imposed even though TBS and the Braves are both
subsidiaries of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   During the first inning of Saturday night's game against the
Milwaukee Brewers, TBS aired video showing the catcher's box was 4
to 5 inches smaller than the previous night. The footage was shown
after a rare balk call Friday against Atlanta catcher Fernando
Lunar for lining up with his right foot outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox was ejected after arguing the call.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing teams have long claimed that Atlanta pitchers are given
the benefit of an extra-wide strike zone, particularly on the
outside corners. Catchers who set up wide of the plate can increase
the chances of an outside pitch being called a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and team president Stan Kasten declined comment, the
newspaper said. The other three announcers could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball said it is looking into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- What a night for Arizona newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major league at-bat, minor league sensation Alex
Cabrera hit a two-run home run as the Diamondbacks beat the Houston
Astros 6-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   One day after being recalled from Triple-A Tucson to replace
injured Matt Williams, Danny Klassen had a home run and an RBI
single for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, a 28-year-old first baseman, hit .382 at Double-A El
Paso with 35 home runs and 82 RBIs in just 53 games. He was called
up Monday to take the roster spot of injured right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera hit Yorkis Perez's 2-2 pitch 400 feet into the
left-field stands with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (5-6) allowed five hits in 7 1-3 innings for the
Diamondbacks, who improved to 5-2 halfway through a 14-game
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, in his first victory in four starts, struck out two and
didn't walk a batter. Byung-Hyun Kim got the final five outs, four
by strikeouts, for his 11th save in 13 tries.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez hit a solo homer for the Diamondbacks, in their
first game against the lowly Astros this season.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel (1-5) struck out a career-high 13 batters in six
innings for the Astros and was locked in a 1-1 duel through five.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez led off the sixth with his 17th homer of the
season, which barely cleared the left-field wall into the glove of
a fan, just over the outstretched glove of Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley doubled with one out, moved to third on a wild
pitch and scored on Klassen's two-out single to center. Damian
Miller doubled off the glove of Alou, who misjudged the line drive,
and Klassen scored to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio singled with two outs in the sixth inning to become
Houston's career hits leader. His 1,938 hits broke the record set
by Jose Cruz (1975-87).
</P>
<P>
   Dotel allowed four runs on six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who have lost six of seven and have the worst record
in the majors (26-49), took a 1-0 lead on Lance Berkman's leadoff
homer off Reynoso's first pitch in the fifth. Klassen's
opposite-field homer, his second of the season, led off Arizona's
fifth and tied it at 1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Astros closer Billy Wagner will undergo season-ending
surgery in Los Angeles on Tuesday to repair a torn flexor tendon in
his left elbow. Wagner, who led the NL with 39 saves last season,
blew nine of 15 save chances this year. ... Arizona placed
Stottlemyre on the 15-day DL for the second time this season with a
recurrence of tendinitis in his right elbow. ... Dotel, whose
previous career best was 10 strikeouts, fanned Tony Womack three
times.

<HEADLINE> Padres 9, Dodgers 5  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bret Boone hit a two-run homer and doubled in
three more runs during an eight-run second inning against Orel
Hershiser as the San Diego Padres beat Los Angeles 9-5 Monday
night, extending the Dodgers' losing streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres rocked Hershiser (1-5) for eight runs on six hits and
three walks in just 1 2-3 innings. The 41-year-old right-hander was
starting on one day's rest, having thrown 27 pitches during a
rain-delayed 1 1-3 innings of a 6-1 loss Saturday at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's victory came several hours after the Padres learned
that Tony Gwynn will undergo arthroscopic surgery Tuesday on his
degenerative left knee and could be out as briefly as a month or as
long as the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Gwynn, an eight-time NL batting champion, has
had five operations on the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Meadows (6-5) limited the Dodgers to Todd Hollandsworth's
sixth homer, leading off the first; Gary Sheffield's sacrifice fly
in the fifth; and Alex Cora's leadoff shot -- his first major league
homer -- in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows allowed six hits in 7 1-3 innings. He walked three and
struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Nicholson and Eric Owens added RBI singles in the second,
and Ed Sprague chipped in with a sacrifice fly for the other run as
San Diego sent 12 men to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko had an RBI groundout in the ninth for the final San
Diego run.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Gilbert doubled in two runs in the bottom half, making it
9-5, after Carlos Almanzar walked three straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser developed control problems this year and hasn't won in
eight starts dating to an 8-1 victory over Cincinnati in the
Dodgers home opener on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   He matched a modern major league record, hitting four batters in
a 10-3 loss to Houston on April 19. Hershiser did it in just 1 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning against San Diego, he threw one pitch five
feet over the head of catcher Todd Hundley, then, with Klesko up
next, bounced a pitch that hit Klesko on the left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Hershiser volunteered to go to the minors, making three
starts before rejoining the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In addition to Gwynn, the Padres placed RHP Stan Spencer on
the 15-day DL with a strained right elbow. They also transferred SS
Chris Gomez to the 60-day DL, recalled RHP Will Cunnane from
Triple-A Las Vegas, and purchased the contract of OF Dusty Allen
from Las Vegas. ... Padres RHP Brian Tollberg, who made his big
league debut last Tuesday, was named the NL player of the week. He
went 2-0 with a 1.25 ERA in his two starts last week, at Arizona
and Cincinnati. ... The Dodgers activated Hundley, who had been out
with a strained rib cage, and assigned C Paul LoDuca to Triple-A
Albuquerque.

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000 Approaches Finish  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, World Cups and European Championships have been
dominated by defense-oriented games in which players seemed more
preoccupied with avoiding mistakes than scoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   This year, fans at Euro 2000 have been treated to 77 goals and
games of the highest caliber -- Portugal 3, England 2; Spain 4,
Yugoslavia 3; Netherlands 3, France 2; Netherlands 6, Yugoslavia 1;
and France 2, Spain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it looked like Euro 2000 would be remembered for the
drunken violence of English thugs. Instead, it will go down as a
memorable meeting of players at the top of their games, such as
Portugal's Luis Figo, France's Zinedine Zidane and Dutchman Edgar
Davids.
</P>
<P>
   The three midfield maestros, undaunted by grueling seasons and
the prospect of six games in 23 days if they go all the way to the
July 2 final in Rotterdam, are getting stronger and better every
game.
</P>
<P>
   How Zidane and Figo fare in the rest of the competition -- they
face each other in Wednesday's France-Portugal semifinal in Bruges
-- could decide who will be crowned world Player of the Year.
Thursday's other semifinal is between Italy and the Netherlands in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Both games seem too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I have seen gives me great satisfaction,'' Gerhard
Aigner, chief executive of UEFA, the European soccer federation,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, he added, sent ''a kind of shudder over the
tournament for a couple of days ... but I think we in Europe can be
very proud of what the players have demonstrated on the field of
play.''
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of drama that saw 14 goals in four games,
players started preparing for the semifinals. But they couldn't
help raving about what they'd seen so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Zidane is playing like that, there is no stopping him,''
French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez said Monday. ''He had a brilliant
match. The man can do anything with the ball at his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''AC Milan must regret ever letting him go.'' France's
Christophe Dugarry said of Davids, the Juventus midfield general.
</P>
<P>
   As for Figo, he's been on everybody's lips since his bullet goal
from outside the box stunned England, paving the way for a 3-2
victory in one of the tournament's first games. He plays for
Barcelona, one of the world's biggest clubs, but that hasn't
stopped a host of other clubs from coveting him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a rest day, was a chance for players to wind down, and
for injuries to be patched up.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's captain Paolo Maldini is suffering from a thigh strain,
France's Dugarry has a broken nose and Emmanuel Petit a knee
injury. But all three could be back for the semis.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese are likely to be the freshest after a day off
Sunday spent outside the team hotel. But they're also walking a
disciplinary tightrope, with five players on yellow cards and all
in danger of missing a possible final if cautioned again.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Smith &AMP; Wesson Pact  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Undeterred by his latest defeat, the sponsor
of a drive to thwart the government's gun-safety pact with Smith &AMP;
Wesson says he will mount one more try on a future bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 201-196 on Monday to reject legislation by Rep.
John Hostettler, R-Ind., that would have prevented the Justice
Department from implementing the agreement. The vote was a defeat
for the National Rifle Association and Smith &AMP; Wesson's rival gun
manufacturers, which have criticized the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord reached in March, the nation's largest gun
maker agreed to install childproof locks on its guns, require its
dealers to conduct background checks and take other safety steps.
In exchange, at least 411 participating communities have promised
to favor Smith &AMP; Wesson weapons when equipping their law
enforcement officers and to drop pending lawsuits against the arms
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Following Monday's vote, Hostettler noted the absence of 38
lawmakers and said that in coming days, he would offer a similar
provision that would block the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms from enforcing the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we could win,'' he said in an interview. ''We should
give everyone a chance to hear the arguments once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the House voted 219-206 against a Hostettler
measure that would have forbidden the Department of Housing and
Urban Development from enforcing the agreement. That agency and its
secretary, Andrew Cuomo, have been at the forefront of forging the
deal and encouraging local governments to join.
</P>
<P>
   That same evening, the House sent a mixed message by voting
218-207 to prevent HUD from working with the Communities for Safer
Guns Coalition. The coalition represents the group of communities
that have agreed to give a preference to Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler sponsored both of those proposals as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler offered his provision on Monday as an amendment to a
$35.5 billion bill financing the departments of Commerce, Justice
and State for 2001. The House approved the overall bill by 214-195.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said President Clinton would veto the
spending bill because it cuts his requests for money for hiring new
police officers and local gun-law prosecutors, for grants to
high-technology companies, and for U.S. contributions for U.N.
peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   It also would cut by more than half Clinton's $340 million
request for the Legal Services Corp., which provides legal aid to
poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to write its own version of the spending
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   During House debate, Hostettler said gun restrictions like those
in the Smith &AMP; Wesson deal should be imposed only by Congress, not
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the founders of this nation would want us to
hand our constitutional authority to Andrew Cuomo or (Attorney
General) Janet Reno,'' Hostettler said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said his aim was to dismantle the agreement. They said
the deal would help reduce the number of children killed by guns,
which they said averages 12 each day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gun lobby does not control this House,'' said Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy, D-N.Y., one of the Democrat's highest-profile gun
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   On other amendments, the House:
</P>
<P>
   --Voted 217-181 that a prohibition in the bill against
initiatives furthering the Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gas
emissions does not apply to programs already under way. The 1997
treaty, aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other gases that may
cause global warming, has not been ratified by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   --Blocked Democratic efforts to boost peacekeeping money by $241
million, to $739 million, the amount Clinton asked for, and to use
some of that money for Sierra Leone, Congo and other African
countries ravaged by violence. Republicans used parliamentary
procedures to block both proposals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> A Peek Inside Search for a Veep  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bob Menendez of New Jersey was at Newark
International Airport, ready to board a Continental flight to
Washington, when a text message on his pager made his curiosity
take off.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher had called.
</P>
<P>
   Whipping out his cell phone, Menendez dialed the number
Christopher had left with the congressman's staff in Washington.
Christopher, who was in California, said he wanted to discuss the
vice presidency, but only on a more secure land line. Menendez
called again from his Capitol Hill office a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Since early April, when Democratic presidential contender Al
Gore put Christopher in charge of his search for a running mate,
Democrats have jumped to attention when the former secretary of
state has called.
</P>
<P>
   By offering a detailed account of his May 22 talk with
Christopher, Menendez shed light on a secretive process leading up
to a pivotal decision in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez, who is little known outside of New Jersey and
Washington, said Christopher was interested in his thoughts on how
ethnicity, gender and religion would affect a presidential ticket.
What about a Jewish vice-presidential candidate? Or Catholic?
Female? Hispanic?
</P>
<P>
   Christopher asked specifically about Sens. Bob Graham of
Florida, Dianne Feinstein of California and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, as well as Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked about Bill Bradley, Gore's vanquished Democratic
presidential rival.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he gave Menendez a chance to argue his way onto the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from a battleground state, New Jersey,'' said Menendez,
a Cuban-American and the fourth-ranking member of the House
Democratic leadership. ''I have a national reach in the Hispanic
community, and a good background in international relations.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Christopher has quietly visited Democrats including
Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Lieberman and
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Russ
Feingold of Wisconsin, John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Breaux and
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of
California, as well as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and former
Sen. George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Via telephone he also has spoken to North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt
and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack.
</P>
<P>
   Though the selection is unlikely to be made until just before
the Democratic convention in August, would-be vice presidents are
understandably jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight on June 15, a phone call from Gore woke
Commerce Secretary William Daley. Gore was asking Daley to succeed
Tony Coelho as campaign chairman; Daley confessed he briefly
thought he was being offered the vice president slot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, it was 12:20 in the morning,'' he later explained, ''so
you've got to give me a little slack for thinking that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have treated a call or visit from Christopher as
sacrosanct. Dodd's spokesman called their meeting ''a personal and
private conversation'' and declined to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez did not hesitate to describe his half-hour talk with
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't tell me it was private,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
   To Christopher's inquiry about religion and ethnicity, Menendez
pitched himself, noting that important states like New Jersey,
Illinois and California have large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher offered a few names for Menendez to evaluate,
some oft-speculated ones were left out, including Bayh, Durbin and
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   On the idea of Bradley as vice president, Menendez said he did
not believe the former New Jersey senator was interested.
</P>
<P>
   And regarding what he could bring to the ticket, Menendez cited
his leadership post among House Democrats, his knowledge of
international relations, his ability to help swing New Jersey to
the Democrats and his ''national reach in the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Though supported by House Minority Whip David Bonior of Michigan
and some labor officials, Menendez is considered a long shot to
fill out the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said just getting the call from Christopher marked a
political breakthrough for Hispanic-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've broken some ground as a community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mummification for a Price  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If burial sounds boring and cremation
leaves you cold, here's another idea: mummification.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your standard wrap, either. We're talking high-tech
interment, a combination of ancient art and tomorrow's science. The
basic procedure can run about $63,000, according to Summum, a Salt
Lake City religious that says there is little use in shopping
around.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the only ones worldwide that do modern mummification,''
said Corky Ra, Summum's founder and leader.
</P>
<P>
   Think of mummification as just another option for those who
don't want to go out the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   There are already burials at sea, burials in space, chrome-edged
caskets for Harley-Davidson buffs and coffins customized with
computer software. The ashes of the dearly departed can be dropped
from a plane, entombed in a coral reef or used to grow bonsai
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a trend in funeral service over the past decade
or so toward more personalized and individualized funeral service
rituals,'' said Kelly Smith, spokesman for the National Funeral
Directors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Summum started researching mummification in 1979, practicing on
30 cadavers contributed by a local medical school. Its method is
more advanced than traditional mummification, which involved a
salt-like preservative called natron and yards of linen.
</P>
<P>
   In a warehouse behind the gleaming metal pyramid Summum uses for
its services, modern-day mummies are cleaned and drained of blood
before being soaked for up to six months in a vat of preservation
fluid that Ra calls his ''secret formula.'' Afterward, the corpse
is covered with lanolin and wrapped with gauze.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes a dozen coats of polyurethane rubber, which dries as
tough as a tire, followed by layers of fiberglass bandages, which
are used to set the body in the desired position. A bronze
mummiform much like those found in the ancient pyramids provides
the final layer of protection, and the body is sealed inside with a
resin.
</P>
<P>
   Ra got a patent for the procedure, and in 1985 showed it off at
a funeral directors' convention in Las Vegas. The reaction was
chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting a funeral director to do something different is like
moving a mountain,'' Ra said. ''And this is really different.''
</P>
<P>
   Summum's general philosophy incorporates aspects of organized
religion into a sort of new-age spirituality that includes
meditation, science fiction and reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Summum, a nonprofit organization, has mummified several pets
($9,000 per cat, $20,000 per dog), but is still waiting for its
first human body. Ra said 137 people have paid in advance to be
mummified once they die.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Menu, who leads a meditation class, signed up 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just felt like it was what I wanted to have done,'' she
said. ''To be honest, I hadn't really thought much about it because
I was fairly young and I hadn't really even thought about death.''
</P>
<P>
   The average traditional funeral costs about $7,000, including
burial. Basic cremation is between $1,100 and $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Mummification is far pricier -- $12,000 for the basic
mummification process, plus $36,000 for the simplest bronze
mummiform. Then there's the cost of shipping a body to Salt Lake
City, about $5,000; and arrangements and mausoleum space, which the
group estimates at at least $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advantage to mummification unravels when you compare
prices,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Ra likes to joke that everyone who signs a contract seems to
live forever.
</P>
<P>
   ''People always ask, 'When is your first person going to die so
you can mummify them?''' Ra said. ''All of our people are in really
good health. I don't know anybody even near death.''

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The country's 378 national parks, monuments and historical
sites will undergo a massive diagnostic study to assess where repairs are needed
and establish a checklist to measure future wear and tear. Colorado State
University ecologists and scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey will
conduct the survey independently of the National Park Service, which already
estimates up to $6 billion in backlogged repairs. The program will be patterned
after an ecological assessment conducted by Parks Canada in that country's 39

<HEADLINE> Astros' Wagner To Have Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Houston Astros reliever Billy Wagner, who was
third in the National League with 39 saves last season, will
undergo surgery on his left elbow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros said Monday that a second opinion from Dr. Lewis
Yocum confirmed a partially torn flexor tendon. Yocum, the Anaheim
Angels medical director, will perform the surgery in Los Angeles to
repair the damaged tendon and remove scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Astros will miss Wagner, manager Larry Dierker said
it's comforting to know there was a reason for the closer's
ineffectiveness this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to know that the reason he was struggling was,
partially at least, due to the fact there was something wrong with
his arm,'' Dierker said before Monday night's game at Arizona.
''Instead of being a mystery and wondering will he be able to get
anybody out again, we're saying, 'yeah, if he can get the pain out
of his arm and he can hit his spots again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pain first surfaced late last season and was so serious that
Dierker said the left-hander would not have been able to throw
again if the playoff series against the Atlanta Braves had lasted
any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed tendinitis, but no tear. Doctors told Wagner that
an offseason of rest should solve the problem, but the pain began
to reappear early this season. Not wanting to blame his poor
performance on the injury, Wagner said he withstood the pain until
it was apparent it wasn't going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wagner did not tell his teammates or his
manager how much he was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he had no idea that Wagner was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think there was anything wrong with his arm,''
Dierker said. ''I was really surprised when they said he had a
tear, because he was throwing real hard. It wasn't a matter of
velocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston entered Monday night's game at Arizona with the worst
record in the majors, 26-48. Wagner, who lost his closer's job
after blowing nine of 15 save opportunities, is 2-4 this year with
a 6.18 ERA. He has walked 18 and struck out 28 in 27 2-3 innings.
Last season, he was 4-1 with a 1.47 ERA, 124 strikeouts and 23
walks in 74 2-3 innings. He did not allow an earned run in his last
21 appearances of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's struggles are a big reason for the Astros' woes,
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he blew three saves last year,'' Dierker said. ''If he
was at a point where he'd been healthy and he'd only blown two
saves this year, we'd be close to .500. There have been that many
games in the ninth where we've had the lead and lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said Wagner may not come back next season with the same
velocity, but he doesn't have to in order to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't have to throw 98. The way he throws, if he throws
94 or 95, he'll be fine,'' Dierker said. ''He may not hit 100 mph
again. He hit 100 once about a month ago, but I don't think he has
to do that to be effective. But he does have to be able to throw
the ball where he wants it, and that's what he hasn't been able to
do this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's injury is the latest in a wave that has hit the Astros
this season. Seven of the starters on opening day have missed time
because of injury or illness.

<HEADLINE> Bush continues outreach to minorities  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - George W. Bush demonstrated a two-prong approach
in speaking to minority groups - touching on concerns they share
with other Americans as well as addressing those issues that have
greater impact in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   At a benefit dinner for the Congress of Racial Equality on
Monday in New York City, the Republican presidential contender
spoke of some broad themes, emphasizing the need to ''make sure the
American dream touches every willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also mentioned a program he said he would ask Congress to
fund if he became president - a program that would provide mentors
to children whose parents have been incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of black people in prison is much higher than
that of white people. An April report from the Justice Department
showed that among black men in their 20s or early 30s, about 11
percent were in prison or jail. For the same age group, 4 percent
of Hispanic men and 1.5 percent of white men were prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   And when speaking to the League of United Latin American
Citizens in Washington earlier on Monday, Bush focused on
immigration, a subject of major importance for many Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   His speech to them included a proposal to split the Immigration
and Naturalization Service into two parts: a welcoming one for
legitimate immigrants and a tough one for border enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for allowing relatives of permanent residents
to visit the United States while their own immigration papers are
being processed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I've said, family values should not stop at the Rio Grande
River,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has split from fellow Republicans in ways that could help
him with some Hispanics. While former California Gov. Pete Wilson
backed measures such as Proposition 187, which sought to end
government benefits for illegal immigrants, Bush advocated public
education for undocumented immigrant children. He supports
beefed-up border enforcement but believes in helping people already
here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he's ''a different kind of Republican,'' and is
working this week to convince voters of that with speeches to
Hispanic and black audiences and promotion of welfare-to-work
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke of the need to improve education, about making
sure the power to shape children's educations stayed on the state
and local level.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no second-rate children in America and no
second-rate dreams,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one group he reached out to, it wasn't that much of
a stretch. CORE is led by conservative black activist Roy Innis,
and accepts the support of the National Rifle Association. NRA
executive vice president Wayne LaPierre attended the dinner.
Another attendee was Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who received a loud round of applause when introduced.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush first ran for governor of Texas in 1994, he ended up
winning the support of 15 percent of black voters and 28 percent of
Hispanic voters, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Bush won re-election, exit polls showed he had won
the support of 27 percent of black voters - an improvement of 12
percentage points. Among Hispanics, he got almost half of the vote
- an improvement of 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush plans to make a speech near the Detroit area on
overhauling the welfare system.

<HEADLINE> Harrelson's Father Seeks New Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The father of actor Woody Harrelson says a judge
and federal prosecutors conspired against him to make sure he was
convicted of killing a Texas judge more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson is serving two life sentences at a federal
maximum security prison in Colorado for the 1979 murder of U.S.
District Judge John Wood Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his fight to have the 1982 conviction overturned, he
testified Monday during a hearing that the trial judge and
prosecutors were ''like two watermelons in a peanut shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's lawyers contend he should get a new trial because a
lawyer who Harrelson believed was part of his legal team at the
trial was once considered a possible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brown, a San Antonio attorney who was cleared after passing
a lie detector test, testified that he never represented Harrelson,
though he said he visited him in jail and took frequent phone calls
from him.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson, who got his start as Woody the bartender on
''Cheers'' and went on to star in films such as ''Natural Born
Killers'' and ''The People vs. Larry Flynt,'' attended the hearing
along with his brother Brett.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought a lot of good things came to light,'' he said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to conclude by Wednesday but a ruling is
not expected immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Previous hearings have been held in San Antonio, where the case
was tried, but the hearing is being held in Denver because of
security concerns over transporting Harrelson to Texas.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Patriot'  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the major U.S. wars, the Revolutionary War has been the
most overlooked by the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hollywood studios have concluded that audiences
cannot connect with characters in powdered wigs and three-cornered
hats who shoot front-loading muskets. Now Columbia Pictures is
striving to combat that notion with ''The Patriot,'' a big-scale
epic with Mel Gibson for box-office star power, playing a respected
South Carolina landowner and widower with seven growing children.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's Benjamin Martin is unswayed by the call to arms sparked
by the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The hidden
reason: a hero in the French and Indian War, he is haunted by the
atrocities of which he was a party.
</P>
<P>
   His teen-age son, played by Heath Ledger, is eager to join the
Continental Army, but his father forbids him.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changes when British troops, led by a sadistic
colonel played by Jason Isaacs, invade Gibson's plantation. After
helplessly watching his family brutalized and his son carried off
to be hanged, Gibson regains his war fervor.
</P>
<P>
   He organizes a ragtag militia and starts a guerrilla campaign
that thwarts the Brits' plans for an easy victory in the South.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides were lining up their troops and firing
point-blank at each other, Gibson employs stealth strategy -- he and
his followers hurtling out of swamps and forests for sudden attacks
on small enemy units. They concentrate their fire on officers, a
tactic the British consider not quite cricket.
</P>
<P>
   The redcoats are commanded by Gen. Cornwallis (the fine English
actor Tom Wilkinson), who believes the colonists can be subdued by
time-worn British army methods. Gibson arranges a meeting with
Cornwallis to exchange prisoners. The episode is the most engaging
in the movie; Gibson tricks the stuffy general and even steals his
two prize great Danes.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting sequences are offset by Gibson's returns to his
family, whose lives are threatened by the vindictive colonel. There
is a hint of romance with his dead wife's sister (Charlotte
Selton), but most of the time she is limited to casting fond looks.
</P>
<P>
   Having fought the British centuries before in ''Braveheart,''
Gibson brings the same intensity to ''The Patriot.'' He aptly
portrays the complex nature of a warrior turned pacifist who must
take up arms again.
</P>
<P>
   Ledger is effective as the militiaman's son, though his
character is sketchily defined.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson's Cornwallis dominates his scenes and would almost be
likable except for his snobbish pigheadedness. And Isaacs is
allowed to play the sadistic colonel way over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Emmerich (''Independence Day'') directed ''The Patriot''
with his usual flourish, assisted by digital magic that can make
the line of troops seem a mile wide.
</P>
<P>
   John Williams' thundering score contributes to the drama. Robert
Rodat's screenplay keeps a good balance between military and family
matters, but most of the plot turns have a deja vu quality -- the
stuff of many a Hollywood war movie or Western.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency in period movies like this is to write stilted
dialogue. That may be how they wrote, but it's hard to imagine that
they spoke that way in normal conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot'' seems likely to stir rebuttal from historians,
especially those on the other side of the pond. Did the British
army really commit Nazilike atrocities during the Revolutionary
War?
</P>

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Trixie'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trixie Zurbo is one smart cookie, though it's hard to
distinguish her insightful intellect amid the figure-of-speech
butchery that spills like idiot's wit from her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   With a zestfully off-kilter performance from Emily Watson in the
title role, director-screenwriter Alan Rudolph's ''Trixie''
delivers on his promise of a ''screwball noir'' flick, part homage
to Hollywood's great detectives, part spoof and part something
truly indefinable.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a bit unclear and criminal motives are hazy, but
the best of the classic noir films often emphasized character and
ambiance over their convoluted plots. ''Trixie'' is no different,
presenting a clever, engrossing portrait of a shrewd yet dotty
woman on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   A gum-chewing, soda-slurping gumshoe wannabe, Trixie (Watson) is
hot on the case of, well, a case. Relegated to store security
patrol and a new job fingering pickpockets at a casino resort,
Trixie reads Police Insight magazine and wants nothing more than a
shot at being a real ''private defective,'' as she puts it in her
malapropian speech.
</P>
<P>
   Trixie gets her wish when she becomes involved with the casino's
resident gigolo Dex (Dermot Mulroney). Dex unwittingly draws Trixie
into a murder mystery involving a ponderous senator (Nick Nolte), a
smarmy tycoon (Will Patton), a teen-age siren (Brittany Murphy) and
a bimbo (Lesley Ann Warren) the men all lust after.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out these unusual suspects is Nathan Lane in a standout
turn as a boozy lounge impersonator who becomes enchanted by
Trixie's perversely wise innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences will find Trixie equally enchanting. Awkward, twitchy
yet utterly adorable, Trixie offers plenty to love, and even more
to scratch your head over.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the world according to Trixie:
</P>
<P>
   -- ''It's time to fish or get off the pot.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Most people condescend from monkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Boy, do I wish I had an answer to that question, because I'm
really getting tired of answering it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''I'm absolutely ravishing, where's the food?''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''She's dead now. She's never going to be the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''I don't want you letting anyone into the room when I'm not
here unless I recognize them, or else I'll beat you up good.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''If you don't have the clues, the bread and butter can be
pulled right out from under your feet, and then there's only one
person to blame, and that's each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her seeming inanity, Trixie muddles through with
perseverance and perceptiveness. She offers a possible explanation
for why her tongue operates independently of her brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a kid, I got hit on the head with a bowling ball,
and I woke up unconscious,'' she says. And when they X-rayed her
head, doctors found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Trixie, other characters have their own patterns of
miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte pronounces: ''You have to wear your unpopularity as a
badge of honor, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Dex tells Trixie to ''bet big. The less you bet, the more you
lose when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane's lounge performer philosophizes that ''we're each tap
dancers in the canoe of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of the film is that no one is who they seem, and
through her blundering detective work, Trixie exposes them all.
Mulroney and Patton's characters prove to be romantics at heart,
Lane's breezy mimic turns out to be haunted by past violence, and
Murphy's young temptress changes shades throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte, spewing colorful but empty dialogue largely culled from
real-life political speeches, has two gripping encounters with
Trixie then has an anguished, cathartic, very public soul-baring.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everyone in ''Trixie'' comes clean in unexpected
ways.
</P>
<P>
   As Trixie puts it: ''Hey, nobody's human. That's the way things
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Robert Altman, ''Trixie'' is a Sony Pictures
Classics release. It runs 117 minutes and is rated R for language,
sexuality and violence.

<HEADLINE> Linda Ellerbee Gets Taste of Acting  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It caused a minor political storm in New York
City when Donna Hanover, the actress wife of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, agreed to perform in the off-Broadway production called
''The Vagina Monologues.'' She withdrew before going onstage when
her husband was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone noticed when Linda Ellerbee took a role in the
same show. To young viewers, Ellerbee is Katie Couric, Dan Rather
and Barbara Walters wrapped up in one because of her nine years of
news reports for Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Linda, what would the kids say?
</P>
<P>
   ''Nick News is for kids,'' she said. '''The Vagina Monologues'
is not for kids. There is no conflict there.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief appearance as herself during an episode of
''Murphy Brown,'' it is Ellerbee's first acting role since she was
an ear of corn during a fourth-grade pageant.
</P>
<P>
   She's working alongside actresses Calista Flockhart and LisaGay
Hamilton during a brief run that ends this week. Each portrays
several different characters during the course of the play, and
Ellerbee takes turns as a 78-year-old woman, a 6-year-old girl, a
sophisticated New Yorker, and a woman watching her daughter give
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee admires the way the play illustrates issues important
to women, including body shape, self-image, aging and
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like I'm appearing in a porn flick,'' she said.
'''The Vagina Monologues' is a serious play and has been taken
seriously by all the critics and a substantial number of prominent
women who have taken part in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flattered but frightened, Ellerbee wondered if the playwright
had the correct phone number when the call came asking her to
perform. She worried about memorizing the lines, but was told she
could read them.
</P>
<P>
   She was nervous until the day before her debut, when her son
announced that he would be getting married. A wedding -- perfect
obsession material for a mom -- was enough to put her own concerns
into some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of being offered something completely different at age
55 intrigued her. Besides, she thought it would be fun.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee had to be taught by Flockhart and Hamilton how to bow
to the audience after the performances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned that I'm not going to quit my day job,'' she said.
''The trouble is, I haven't been able to quit my day job while I'm
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The onetime rebellious network newscaster has a sprawling
Greenwich Village office for her company, Lucky Duck Productions.
In addition to the weekly Nick News, she does periodic specials for
the network, and won a Peabody Award for one show that tried to
explain President Clinton's impeachment to young people.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's having the somewhat mortifying experience of being
approached by young adults who tell her that they grew up watching
Nick News. Nickelodeon has just signed on for three more years with
Ellerbee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were sort of inventing it as we were going along,'' she
said. ''We came in with an attitude of 'don't talk down to the
audience, treat them with respect.' Our message is to get kids to
think, not tell them what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   She's gearing up to describe a presidential election to an
audience that has really only known one president in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives a crusty old journalist an opportunity to look at the
world with new eyes,'' she said. ''In fact, it commands that you
do. It allows me in a way to throw off years of what I really know
about American presidential politics and campaigns and come to it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee is also the author of two childrens books that she
hopes will become a series. The books, ''Girl Reporter Blows Lid
Off Town'' and ''Girl Reporter Sinks School,'' star an aspiring
journalist described as a ''world-class writer trapped in an
11-year-old's body.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Duck, with complete production facilities on site, is also
a major supplier of programming to other networks, doing occasional
''Intimate Portrait'' segments for Lifetime and ''Headliners and
Legends'' for MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbee probably won't resist the opportunity someday to write
about her two weeks on stage. She's already taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a Walter Mitty way, there's a kind of coolness to doing
it,'' she said. ''I get to play an actress for two weeks, without
the involvement in work, in commitment, in rejections and
difficulties that real actors have to go through.''

   SURVIVOR: How much more growth potential is there for CBS'
''Survivor''? The summer sensation reached 24.2 million viewers
last Wednesday for its fourth edition. That was a relatively modest
increase of 1 million over the previous week, despite the advantage
of not having any high-powered competition for the first time from
the NBA Finals or ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' However, it's
still 24 million people -- coming only one week away from what is
traditionally the least-watched TV week of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jeff Probst: Happy Host of Survivor  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Probst knew he would be held accountable
for his actions. (By an audience of millions.)
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was treading in dangerous territory. (Obliged to say
hammy things like ''At tribal council you are held accountable for
your actions'' and ''You tread in dangerous territory every time
you come here'' without looking like someone being force-fed a
rodent.)
</P>
<P>
   Could he survive the rigors of ''Survivor''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, four episodes into CBS' 13-week summer hit (airing
Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Eastern), Probst is not just surviving, he's
thriving on remote Pulau Tiga. As a back-to-nature game show host,
he's a natural.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been otherwise. With those dimples and pearly
whites, he seems better suited to be just another pretty boy on
''The Young and the Restless.'' But on ''Survivor,'' Probst quickly
proved to be more than an emcee with a Banana Republic expense
account. Advising, cajoling and sometimes manipulating, he shines
as this fantasy island's Mr. Roarke.
</P>
<P>
   His charges are the ''Survivor'' castaways, each of whom (as
everyone from here to Pulau Tiga surely knows) is vying to be the
show's sole survivor, the one spared by luck and cunning from exile
by the others. For these contestants, now down to 12 from the
original 16, the obvious motivation is the $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was Probst at the series' first tribal council,
ascribing to them incentives besides money. ''I'm sensing there
could be personal reasons, different journeys you might be on.''
</P>
<P>
   And here he was last week, suggesting that, to vote a member off
the island, ''you're sort of forced to hold a mirror up to
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Shades of chakras, Esalin and Deepak Chopra! Attitude and irony
has been voted off this island, at least by Probst. His manner is
earnest, friendly and -- like any group facilitator -- comfortably
detached.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a really fine line you walk between being neutral and
objective, and being distant and aloof,'' Probst explained to a
reporter last week. Back since April from the 39-day ''Survivor''
shoot (and, of course, mum on who will be revealed as the
millionaire-survivor), he was talking by cell phone as he steered
through Hollywood en route to an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   This was quite a different setting from an island in the China
Sea, but, even slashing through the jungle of lunchtime traffic, he
could readily summon the ''Survivor'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone roughed it, he said. But while the castaways were
trying to build a hut or make a fire to grill the day's catch of
rats, much of Probst's time was spent watching video footage that
recorded such activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to be constantly aware of what relationships were
forming, who was aligning with who, and to keep track of what each
of them didn't know that I did know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other times, I would visit the tribes to see what was going
on, or to plant a seed about something for them to think about. I
used all this information during tribal councils.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still early in the series,'' Probst noted. ''But the
tribal councils got much more'' -- a split-second pause to find the
right adjective -- ''interesting by weeks five, six, seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''And as the politics got deeper and deeper, and the deception
and the duplicity started to play out, my role became more of
trying to dig it up and not let all that stuff just sit there. It
was really interesting group therapy at times.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. The 38-year-old Probst has served as host of
several shows for cable's FX network, as well as on the VH1 game
show ''Rock and Roll Jeopardy.'' What does he know about playing a
shrink?
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife's a psychotherapist,'' he said with a laugh. ''I
learned from the way she deals with me, how she maneuvers me to
where she wants me to get, without it ever feeling like it's her
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a host I could've played it many ways. I could've said'' --
he effects a syrupy tone -- '''OK, you gotta go. Sorry! And
hopefully we'll talk more when we get back to the states.' The
other extreme was, 'Moon-walk your butt off this island, we don't
want you around no more!'''
</P>
<P>
   Probst's chosen course was to initiate a made-to-order ritual
and stick to it. ''What happens here is sacred,'' he declared on
one episode.
</P>
<P>
   From his car, Probst laughed. ''Is it a little over the top?
Absolutely! And I've taken my share of potshots. The running joke
is, 'Vote the HOST off!' But I'll take any criticism you want to
throw at me. This job was a blast!'' And he's eager be off for
Australia and the next ''Survivor'' adventure, which gets under way
in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he's got a movie to make. ''Finder's Fee,''
which Probst describes as a morality tale, starts shooting next
week in Vancouver. Probst will direct his own script, whose final
draft, it turns out, was inspired by real-life intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens in the last couple of weeks of 'Survivor'
couldn't have been any juicier,'' Probst confides. ''I lifted some
of the ideas.''

   INFAMOUS AND ILLICIT: For more than 16 years, Andrew Chambers
lied for a living, posing as a high-rolling drug dealer and
infiltrating some of the nation's largest drug trafficking

recent admission to lying under oath about his criminal record has
not only destroyed his career, but may put scores of felony drug
convictions in jeopardy. Now, serious allegations of a Drug
Enforcement Administration cover-up have surfaced, with charges
that the government knew of Chambers' record and continued to use
him as an informant. Chambers steps out of the shadows to discuss

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 29; Nasdaq Gains 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher on the eve of the
Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Trading activity was
quiet Tuesday as most investors opted to wait for the Fed's
announcement before staking out major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.35 at 10,572.34 in
the early going on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also slightly higher. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.31 at 1,459.56, and the Nasdaq
composite index was up 27.16 at 3,939.28.
</P>
<P>
   A watch over interest rates kept many investors out of the
market. The Fed was meeting in Washington, and was expected to
announce its decision on interest rates Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists expect the central bank to leave rates
unchanged, because the economy has shown signs of slowing from its
former breakneck pace. Financial stocks, which benefit from stable
rates, led the Dow's advance, with J.P. Morgan rising $3.063 to
$121.50.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the Conference Board offered the latest sign
that rising rates are taking a toll on consumers' enthusiasm. The
group said its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 138.8 in June from
a revised 144.7 in May as higher rates and soaring gas prices
pressured the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates six times in the past year to slow the
economy to a more sustainable pace, hoping to keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 115.13 million
shares, behind Monday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.58 to 517.94.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Liver Cells From Bone Marrow  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Liver cells have been found to come from
an unlikely source -- bone marrow -- raising the possibility that
people with hepatitis and other liver diseases could somehow use
their own cells to heal themselves, a new study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study also increases the understanding of stem cells:
free-agent cells in the body that scientists believe have the
capacity to convert into several kinds of organ cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''This breaks all the boundaries we're taught in medical school.
This isn't supposed to happen,'' said researcher Dr. Neil Thiese.
''Organs are separate things -- they work together, but one does not
become the other -- that's always how we've looked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by Thiese, from the New York University School of
Medicine, and Dr. Diane Krause, from the Yale School of Medicine,
was published this month in the journal Hepatology.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said Monday that the discovery has definite benefits for
people with liver disorders.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that far-fetched to think that doctors will be able to
take bone marrow from a patient with a liver condition, treat it
and put it back into the patient so the new cells can treat the
person's own liver, Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clinical applications are not difficult to imagine. I'm
certain this will come to fruition. I'm not sure when,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at two female patients who had undergone bone
marrow transplants from male donors, and four male liver disease
patients who had liver transplants from female donors.
</P>
<P>
   A green-glowing stain was used to light up the Y chromosomes in
the cells -- chromosomes that are found only in men. Researchers
could analyze the livers of the test subjects to see where the
liver cells were coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found that the women who got bone marrow transplants
from men had some Y-chromosome liver cells. In one woman, 17
percent of her liver cells were male a year after the bone marrow
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The only place the Y-chromosome cells could have come from was
the male bone marrow, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who got liver transplants from female donors, also had
Y-chromosome liver cells on their female livers. In one man, 40
percent of his liver had Y chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   The liver has long been known to regenerate and repair itself,
but it was assumed before that the new cells were just coming from
the liver, Thiese said.
</P>
<P>
   The liver is the body's main chemical factory. It regulates the
levels of chemicals in the blood, helps filter out poisons and
produces proteins for blood plasma that help the immune system and
help blood coagulate.
</P>
<P>
   Diseases that affect the liver include hepatitis, which comes in
various strains and appears in epidemic proportions in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adrian Di Bisceglie, the medical director of the American
Liver Foundation, said the study may lead to practical applications
someday to help people who have liver ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, there's a leap from these data to clinical
applications,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For people with genetic liver problems, gene therapy may be
possible, where a person's own stem cells could be modified to
carry the correct gene to the liver and repopulate it, Di Bisceglie
said.
</P>
<P>
   For people with hepatitis or who have liver damage from drugs or
alcohol, it may be possible some day to repopulate their livers
with healthy cells derived from their own stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   This technique would differ from a regular liver transplant from
a donor, which carries the risk that the body would reject the
organ.
</P>
<P>
   The American Liver Foundation and the Mary Lea Johnson Richards
Research Foundation paid for the study.

<HEADLINE> Coastlines Threatened by Erosion  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-fourth of the buildings within 500 feet of
the nation's coastlines are threatened by erosion in the next 60
years.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Tuesday by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency concluded that close to 87,000 homes and other buildings
stand on land likely to wash away into the oceans or the Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The findings are sobering,'' FEMA Director James Lee Witt said
in a statement. ''If coastal development continues unabated, and if
the sea levels rise as some scientists are predicting, the impact
will be even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Costs of erosion damage to the owners of homes and other
buildings are expected to average more than half a billion dollars
per year, with the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts the most
threatened. Flood insurance does not cover damage caused by gradual
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The American Coastal Coalition, a group representing coastal
communities to promote tourism and encourage shore protection, was
critical of the report. It contended that the goal of the report is
to get FEMA to use the federal flood insurance program to encourage
people to move inland.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists report that the nation appears to be entering a
period of increased hurricane activity. The additional storms can
be expected to increase the coastal erosion threat.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, improved construction and raising homes on posts
has improved the ability to survive storms, creating an unexpected
result after storms that cause severe erosion, said William Seitz
of Texas A&AMP;M University at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Now, houses that would simply have tumbled in the past remain
standing, but out in the water, he said. They have to be condemned
anyway because their septic systems can no longer function.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of storms, erosion is often a gradual process, but it
can be relentless. Its impact is easily illustrated by the problem
of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, which was 1,500 feet from the
shore when erected in 1870. By 1987 the lighthouse was in danger of
falling victim to erosion. Finally, last year, the National Park
Service moved it back 2,900 feet at a cost of $9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of moving homes can be beyond the means of most people.
</P>
<P>
   The FEMA study was ordered by Congress during a debate over how
best to manage coastal erosion, currently handled piecemeal by a
mix of federal, state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time to renew public dialogue about how we can lower
the risks to life and property and reduce the costs from the
inevitable consequences of coastal erosion,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the H. John Heinz III Center for
Science, Economics and the Environment, a Washington research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   It estimated that 338,000 structures are within 500 feet of the
coasts in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii. It did not include
Alaska or such large coastal cities as New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Miami, which it said are heavily protected against
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Of 86,600 structures estimated to be threatened by erosion in
the next 60 years, 53,000 are on the Atlantic Coast, 16,000 on the
Great Lakes, 13,000 along the Gulf of Mexico and 4,600 on the
Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of erosion vary greatly from place to place, with some of
the highest in parts of the Gulf of Mexico at six feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   A major storm can erode the coastline 100 feet in one day, the
report noted, though much of that loss may be restored over the
following years.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of lost and damaged property because of erosion was
estimated at $530 million per year for property owners alone. In
addition it estimated costs of $410 million annually to communities
for loss of land and structures.
</P>
<P>
   Federal flood insurance, for damage caused by floods and storms,
would pay about $80 million of this total at current enrollment
rates, the study said. Even at 100 percent enrollment the insurance
would cover only about $200 million of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommended that Congress direct FEMA to develop
erosion hazard maps for coastal areas and to include the cost of
expected erosion losses when setting flood insurance rates in
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested several other options for dealing with the
threat, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Establish Coastal High Hazard Zones that include both flood and
erosion risks.
</P>
<P>
   --Impose mandatory surcharges on flood insurance in these zones
to add coverage for erosion.
</P>
<P>
   --Impose regulatory measures such as requiring building setbacks
to reduce potential damage.
</P>
<P>
   --Require communities to impose building standards that take into
account future flood potential because of erosion.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide erosion insurance for bluff areas.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide relocation help or buyouts.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 67; Nasdaq Adds 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher in quiet trading
Tuesday on the eve of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest
rates. A muted report on consumer confidence provided the latest
sign that the Fed's long course of rate increases may be slowing
the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 66.78 at 10,609.81.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 6.34 at 1,461.65, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 6.23 at 3,918.35.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were buying stocks on the hope that the Fed will leave
interest rates unchanged when its two-day meeting ends Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year,
but many economists expect the central bank to stand pat this week
because the economy has shown signs of slowing from its former
breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interest rate increases by the Fed are starting to bite,''
said Joseph T. Keating, chief investment officer at the Kent Funds
in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''But the economy isn't falling apart. We'll
still have growth -- just at a slower pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable rates, led the Dow's
advance, with J.P. Morgan rising $2.688 to $121.125.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the Conference Board offered the latest sign
that rising rates are taking a toll on consumers' enthusiasm. The
group said its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 138.8 in June from
a revised 144.7 in May as higher rates and soaring gas prices
pressured the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Fed tightened credit to cool growth to a more sustainable
pace, investors have started shifting money from sector to sector
as they debated which stocks will perform best in a slowing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, technology stocks were leading the market higher. Intel
rose $1.438 to $135.625 and Cisco Systems rose $1.75 to $64.563.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 291.80 million shares
at late morning, slightly ahead of Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.19 to 514.17.

<HEADLINE> Glance at Regional AIDS Impact  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Regional breakdown of HIV/AIDS epidemic as estimated
by UNAIDS:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- North America: Estimated 900,000 people living with AIDS virus
at end of 1999. United States has infection rate of 0.61 percent of
adult population, and Canada 0.30 percent. Concentrated among
injecting drug users and homosexual men. San Francisco studies
report increase in high-risk behavior among young homosexuals and
rise in gonorrhea, indicating danger of increase in HIV.
</P>
<P>
   -- Latin America and Caribbean: Estimated 1.67 million people
living with AIDS virus at end of 1999. Epidemic mainly spread by
heterosexual intercourse. Haiti worst hit, with 5.1 percent of
adults infected, followed by Barbados with 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Europe: Estimated 940,000 people living with AIDS virus at end
of 1999. Increasing rates of infection in Eastern Europe and former
Soviet Union among drug addicts sharing needles. Ukraine has
highest rate in the region with 1 percent of adults infected.
</P>
<P>
   -- Asia: Estimated 6.13 million people living with AIDS virus at
end of 1999. Cambodia has highest rate with 4.4 percent infected,
largely through heterosexual intercourse. Thailand has infection
rate of 2.15 percent and has slowed spread of disease through
heterosexual intercourse by good prevention campaigns. Estimated
3.7 million people in India living with the virus, second highest
national total behind South Africa, with infection rate of 0.7
percent. World's most populous nation, China, has infection rate of
just 0.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Australia and New Zealand: Estimated 15,000 people living with
AIDS virus at end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sub-Saharan Africa: Estimated 24.5 million people living with
AIDS virus at end of 1999, with 4 million new infections last year
alone. More than one-tenth of adult population infected in 16
countries. Worst hit are Botswana (35.8 percent infection rate);
Swaziland (24.3 percent); Zimbabwe (25.1 percent); Lesotho (23.6
percent); Zambia (20 percent), South Africa (20 percent). Work
force is being devastated by high death rate among young adults,
development gains are being reversed, and health systems crumbling.
Spread mainly through heterosexual intercourse and women are worse
affected than men.

<HEADLINE> American Revolution Goes Epic  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Going muzzle to muzzle with the redcoats in
an open field. It's madness,'' groans Mel Gibson's character in
''The Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that explains why Hollywood has been gun-shy about the
American Revolution, depicted in only a handful of films before
''The Patriot,'' which opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's madness, perhaps, to expect movie audiences reared on
action to turn out for the archaic, bizarrely passive spectacle of
18th century ''gentlemanly warfare'': opposing forces marching
together in slow columns, then plugging one another like tin ducks
in a shooting gallery.
</P>
<P>
   And for Hollywood, there is the memory of Al Pacino's
''Revolution,'' a huge critical and commercial flop in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hadn't recalled seeing a Revolutionary War film that
worked,'' Gibson said in an interview. ''I wasn't aware that there
was some kind of curse about it until (producer) Dean Devlin
informed me about it, after I had signed on.''
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth-century wars, particularly World War II and Vietnam,
have dominated Hollywood's battlefield sorties, from ''Sands of Iwo
Jima'' and ''The Deer Hunter'' to ''Platoon'' and ''Saving Private
Ryan.'' Those modern wars are closer to moviegoers' hearts, and
provided the sort of dramatic action -- whether on the beaches of
Normandy or in the jungles of Southeast Asia -- that today's
audiences can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War also has been popular with Hollywood since the
earliest days of film, which saw D.W. Griffith's silent epic ''The
Birth of a Nation.'' Buster Keaton set his comedy classic ''The
General'' in the Civil War, and dozens of films followed, from
''Gone With the Wind'' and ''Shenandoah'' to ''Glory'' and
''Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But the American Revolution? Nick Nolte starred in the 1995
''Jefferson in Paris,'' though it focused on Thomas Jefferson's
time as ambassador to France, after the war. (And bombed at the box
office anyhow.)
</P>
<P>
   There were a few silent films based on such figures as George
Washington, Betsy Ross and Paul Revere, and Griffith worked his way
back from the Civil War to the Revolution with ''America'' in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Disney's ''Johnny Tremain,'' a family flick in the
1950s, and the musical ''1776,'' there's not much else. Pacino's
''Revolution'' was such a bomb that critic Leonard Maltin wrote in
his Movie and Video Guide that ''it'll be 2776 before we get
another'' Revolutionary War film.
</P>
<P>
   But it took only 15 years for Hollywood to go once more unto the
breach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot'' stars Gibson as Benjamin Martin, a widower and
hero of the French and Indian War who resists the call to arms in
the Revolution until the British inflame his lethal-weapon
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that Hollywood has shied away from the Revolutionary
War out of fear that audiences would view it as a history lesson,
said Mark Gordon, one of ''The Patriot's'' producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American Revolution hasn't been a sexy arena to tell a
story in,'' Gordon said. ''For people now, it seems a less
emotional conflict than the Civil War, which was very clear, North
and South, slavery vs. anti-slavery, brother against brother. And
the Second World War, you had the most fabulous antagonists in
history, Adolf Hitler and the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution simply feels remote -- a war fought by a
still-unformed nation, in a time before photography.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been very successful in our country in humanizing other
wars,'' said Caroline Keinath, deputy superintendent of Adams
National Historical Park in Quincy, Mass., which is dedicated to
the legacy of the John Adams family and the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who visit Manassas or other Civil War battlefields ache
with pain at recreations of those battles. They haven't really done
that to this point with the Revolution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson compared the Civil War to ''neighbors sort of slugging it
out ... It's like watching Tyson and Holyfield go at it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But with the Revolutionary War, it's a totally different
thing. It's something (American audiences) never experienced,
because they live in a free country. They were never part of a
colony of another country that was oppressive.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also that outdated style of fighting. ''The Patriot''
depicts such prissy though deadly warfare early on, but once Martin
enters the fray, he assembles a motley band of guerrilla fighters
who chip away at the British troops and morale with ferocious
ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone expecting a pure history lesson can check their textbooks
at the door. Directed by Roland Emmerich (''Independence Day,''
''Godzilla'') and written by Robert Rodat (''Saving Private
Ryan''), ''The Patriot'' is heavy on action.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie runs a hefty two hours, 40 minutes, Gibson's
star power and its bloody, frenzied battles make for a likely
box-office hit.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, whose ''The Perfect Storm'' opens two days after
''The Patriot,'' already has conceded the weekend's box-office
crown to Gibson's flick.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Patriot'' also has two romantic subplots and the lure of a
doting father trying to protect his seven children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men will go, 'Oh yeah, lots of guns blazing,''' said Heath
Ledger, who plays Martin's oldest son. ''But it has a lot of
passion, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, now working on the World War II epic
''Pearl Harbor,'' said he had been toying with the idea of a
sweeping film about the American Revolution before ''The Patriot''
stole his thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right before they announced 'Patriot,' I was thinking we've
got to do something about the Revolutionary War because it's such a
rich area,'' Bruckheimer said. ''We're all really
revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said another reason why the Revolution has tended to
discourage filmmakers is that it played out far differently than
later American wars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't have the drama because we really didn't win a lot
of battles,'' Bruckheimer said. ''It was the French that came in
and saved us. It was Ben Franklin going over and getting money and
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Action, bloodshed and romance aside, ''The Patriot'' has one
clear advantage over other Revolution films in Gibson, doing for
18th century America what he did for 13th century Scotland in
''Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As you see in the flick,'' says Ledger, ''there's a lot of Mel
Gibson.''

   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

optimism, evidenced by the fact that more stocks were rising than
falling. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues
outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Also, trading volume was quiet, but not as anemic as some
analysts had expected on the day ahead of the Fed's decision. NYSE
volume came to 427.49 million shares at midday, slightly ahead of
Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are starting to put some money back to work,'' Keating
said. ''A good deal of cash built up on the sidelines while volume
tapered off in the past couple of months.''

<HEADLINE> South Africa Leads in HIV Infections  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- The stigma and silence
surrounding AIDS must be broken if the epidemic is to be controlled
in South Africa, now home to more HIV-infected people than any
other nation, experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new U.N. report on HIV/AIDS, about 4.2 million
South Africans -- roughly 10 percent of the population -- are HIV
positive. South Africa's infection rate is even higher among
pregnant women: 22 percent of those who visited prenatal clinics
last year tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But like elsewhere in southern Africa, most infected South
Africans are unaware of their status, said Dr. Elhadj Sy, leader
for the UNAIDS team for eastern and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   African countries need to provide facilities for voluntary tests
and counseling so infected people can avoid transmitting the virus,
Sy said. But people won't test themselves unless the stigma
surrounding the disease is removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, people who openly say they are HIV positive
often are treated as outcasts, fired from their jobs and sometimes
even chased from their homes. In 1998, Gugu Dlamini, a woman in
KwaZulu-Natal province, was beaten to death after revealing during
World AIDS Day that she was infected.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people who test positive are kicked out of their homes and
their children are discriminated against, and we say come and take
a test, I don't think people will do that,'' Sy said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a news conference in advance of the 13th
International AIDS Conference, set for July 9-14 in Durban, South
Africa. The conference's theme is ''Break the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV-infected people must be recruited to join the battle against
AIDS, Sy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way to combat stigma. This is a way to combat
exclusion. This is also a way to put a face on this number,'' he
said, referring to the 24.5 million people with the HIV virus in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's high infection rate is partly attributable to the
migrant labor system under apartheid, said Dr. Hoosen Coovadia,
chairman of the International AIDS Conference. He said male workers
were forced to live in hostels far from their families, and many
turned to prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The response from the South African government and communities
was initially not as vigorous as it could have been because the
country was preoccupied with its transition from apartheid to
democracy, Coovadia said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here have blasted the government for failing to provide
drugs that can prolong AIDS sufferers' lives. The government has
responded that, like other African nations, it simply cannot afford
anti-retroviral AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, AIDS is a priority for the government, said Thami
Skenjana, director of the South African government's AIDS action
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, authorities unveiled a five-year plan to combat the
epidemic. The plan calls for promoting safe sexual behavior,
improving access to testing and counseling and providing treatment
and support for HIV positive people, their children and AIDS
orphans.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Will Use Time To Travel  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices, ready to begin a
three-month summer recess this week, like to use that time to
travel -- and have other people pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released financial disclosure reports for 1999 show the
justices left the nation's capital for fully subsidized trips to
four other continents -- Australia, Europe, Asia and South America --
and dozens of American cities last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Universities and others were only too glad to pay for the
excursions for the honor of featuring a justice as a teacher or
speaker. Spouses often get all expenses paid also.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a guest lecturer at Tulane
University law school's summer program in Greece (she traveled to
the Netherlands as a guest lecturer the previous February).
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer took on lecturing duties in Austria
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor made it to Japan for a speech and
discussions with faculty and students at Doshisha University in
Kyoto. She also participated in conferences and meetings in
Scotland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Auckland, New Zealand, was Justice Antonin Scalia's destination
for a weeklong seminar sponsored by the University of Auckland. He
also taught for two weeks at Hofstra University's summer law school
program in Nice, France.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy made it to Salzburg, Austria, as a
teacher for University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law, and
to Moscow, London and Edinburgh, Scotland, for others.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist got his expenses paid for
teaching at the University of London but turned over a $2,000
honorarium to his church.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas stayed stateside, giving speeches and
judging moot court competitions at Brigham Young University in
Utah, the University of Montana and the University of Chicago,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens was reimbursed for trips to speak at
the Gerald Ford museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., and at a University
of Iowa event.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, the court's ascetic New Englander who
likes to spend virtually all summer at his home outside Concord,
N.H., listed no reimbursed trips for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 34; Nasdaq Loses 24  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in quiet trading Tuesday on
the eve of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. A
muted report on consumer confidence provided the latest sign that
the Fed's long course of rate increases may be slowing the economy
enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But investors remained restless, shifting money from sector to
sector without much conviction about the underlying strength of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 33.55 at 10,576.58.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 0.79 at 1,456.04, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 23.60 at 3,888.52.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks got support from hopes that the Fed will leave interest
rates unchanged when its two-day meeting ends Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year,
but many economists expect the central bank to stand pat this week
because the economy has shown signs of slowing from its former
breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interest rate increases by the Fed are starting to bite,''
said Joseph T. Keating, chief investment officer at the Kent Funds
in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''But the economy isn't falling apart. We'll
still have growth -- just at a slower pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable rates, led the Dow's
advance, with J.P. Morgan rising $1.375 to $119.813.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the Conference Board offered the latest sign
that rising rates are taking a toll on consumers' enthusiasm. The
group said its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 138.8 in June from
a revised 144.7 in May as higher rates and soaring gas prices
pressured the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Fed tightened credit to cool growth to a more sustainable
pace, investors have started shifting money from sector to sector
as they debated which stocks will perform best in a slowing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, drug stocks and consumer goods companies were leading
the market higher. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose $1.875 to $97.375 and 3M
rose $2.063 to $87.563.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell $4.219 to $110.188 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said
he expects IBM's second-quarter revenue to be ''mediocre'' compared
with the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were demonstrating some cautious
optimism, evidenced by the fact that more stocks were rising than
falling. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues
outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Also, trading volume was quiet, but not as anemic as some
analysts had expected on the day ahead of the Fed's decision. NYSE
volume came to 651.78 million shares in early afternoon, slightly
ahead of Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are starting to put some money back to work,'' Keating
said. ''A good deal of cash built up on the sidelines while volume
tapered off in the past couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.56 to 510.80.

<HEADLINE> Nations Try To Develop Poverty Plan  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Rich and poor nations, replowing the same
territory they did at last year's, riot-torn Seattle trade
conference, tried Tuesday to hammer out a United Nations plan to
tackle global poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''A major political struggle is going on here,'' said John
Langmore, head of the United Nations division of social policy and
development. ''There are powerful differences of position and of
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   A special meeting of the U.N. General Assembly here is looking
at progress since a summit on poverty in Copenhagen five years ago.
Governments and U.N. officials concede that little has changed, and
in some places the situation has actually worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ''The poor are subject to daily humiliation, abuse, rejection,
exclusion and harassment,'' said U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The poorest feel the unrelenting agony of chronic hunger, the
suffering of untreated disease and the exposure of inadequate
shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi, prime minister of Mozambique, said:
''Our people -- with reason -- doubt our seriousness when the
decisions we have made as governments do not bring direct and
tangible impact on the quality of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Governments are trying to agree on a statement of targets for
the eradication of poverty over the next years, with the aim of
halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   But as at the World Trade Organization meeting in November, the
poor and rich nations differ over labor standards, market access,
the environment and debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries want to see the industrialized world
writing off more debt for the poorest nations while opening markets
to imports in areas like agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   They are also concerned that richer countries are failing in the
commitments they made to provide aid to poorer countries. Only four
nations are meeting the promise they made to the United Nations to
provide 0.7 percent of gross national product in Official
Development Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Rich nations claim that many of the world's poor countries have
done little to help themselves by tackling corruption or drafting
national plans to pinpoint and eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   They also believe that development issues should be linked to an
improvement in human rights -- particularly in rights for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say that implementing labor rights holds back
development,'' said Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg. ''I
say it is the other way around. Fundamental workers' rights sustain
development and foster democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the U.N. Development Fund,
said he thought all sides needed to look at what they had done
since Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no monopoly of right or wrong on this,'' Malloch
Brown told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4,600 delegates are attending the assembly, which
runs until Friday.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Defends Energy Policies  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson again faced
testy lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday, this time listening to
House Republicans ridicule the Clinton administration as
weak-willed in dealing with soaring gas prices and the OPEC oil
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, however, argued that ''our policy of quiet diplomacy
... is working,'' and gas prices, while still ''unacceptably
high,'' are falling 7 to 12 cents in the hard-hit Midwest.
Republican members of the House International Relations Committee
didn't seem to consider the efforts meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ''This administration is still firing blanks when it should be
making an all-out attack,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., the
panel's chairman. He said the administration has been ''remarkably
passive'' in dealing with OPEC and has failed to promote greater
domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman last week introduced legislation that would allow
antitrust lawsuits to be brought against foreign energy cartels,
though legal experts have said little can be done legally to
prevent production or pricing agreements among sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that the GOP-led Congress should accept much
of the blame for rejecting $2 billion worth of proposals since 1996
to promote energy conservation and development of alternate fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some criticized the administration for not releasing oil
from the government's emergency reserve. Others suggested a harder
line is necessary to get friendly OPEC nations, such as Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, to push for production raises beyond the modest
ones recently announced.
</P>
<P>
   After all, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., ''we went to the
Persian Gulf to protect them'' when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson suggested that attempts to dictate to OPEC would be
counterproductive. He said he had always dealt firmly with OPEC,
and argued with foreign oil ministers that price stability favored
both producing and consuming nations.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence ''we are close to turning the corner,'' Richardson
cited new Energy Department figures that showed gasoline prices
nationwide dropped 3 cents a gallon over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Low stocks and ''soaring demand'' have kept oil prices high,
above $30 a barrel, Richardson said. While worldwide production has
increased by 3.5 million barrels a day, demand also has risen, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said non-OPEC nations are producing at close to capacity, so
they can contribute only ''modest amounts'' of additional oil to
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said high demand, low inventories, pipeline
disruptions and the high cost of cleaner-burning gasoline have
caused the dramatic price spikes in Chicago and Milwaukee; oil
companies have blamed these as well. But ''the oil companies have
some explaining to do,'' because, he said, there is no credible
answer for the price gap between conventional gas and the cleaner
fuel required in those cities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Richardson recently ordered loans of 500,000 barrels
each to two refineries that suffered supply interruptions, he has
steadfastly argued the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should only be
used for such supply disruptions, and not to influence prices.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern lawmakers also were concerned about low stocks of
heating oil, and predicted possibly another winter of high prices
unless inventories increase.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil stocks were 40 percent lower than normal in New
England at this time of year, said several lawmakers. Richardson
urged Congress to approve a proposal for stockpiling heating oil in
the Northeast for an emergency.

<HEADLINE> 'Sopranos' Faces Death of Actress  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Livia Soprano, the manipulative matriarch of New
Jersey's fictional mob family, would have really enjoyed this: Even
in death, people are consumed by her.
</P>
<P>
   The writers of HBO's ''The Sopranos'' are trying to figure out
how to deal with the death of actress Nancy Marchand, who played
Livia. They have nearly nine months before new shows air.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marchand made no secret of her lung cancer before dying
June 18, series creator David Chase said the writers had only once
before talked about losing her but quickly changed the subject
because it was too unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, people have repeatedly come up to Chase and said,
''This is a problem for you, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   For while actor James Gandolfini, as Tony Soprano, is clearly
the star, Marchand's scenes were some of the most electric. The
relationship between Tony and his mother -- the woman who tried to
have him whacked in the first season -- is the emotional
underpinning of ''The Sopranos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One way or another, either through Livia's death or without
Livia's death, Tony Soprano has to get over his mother, which he
was doing,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusion of real life into fiction is an occasional
challenge for TV writers, most recently seen with Michael J. Fox's
exit from ''Spin City.'' Some series handle it more adroitly than
others.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's character, New York City Deputy Mayor Michael Flaherty,
took the fall for a political scandal and quit his job. Fox is
leaving the series because of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   When ''Cheers'' actor Nicholas Colasanto died suddenly in 1985,
so did his character, the bartender Coach. Actor Woody Harrelson
took his spot behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Conrad, who as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on ''Hill Street
Blues'' warned his officers, ''Let's be careful out there,''
continued in his role after contracting cancer, as did Jim Davis,
who was the patriarch Jock Ewing on ''Dallas.'' After their deaths,
the characters were killed and the shows went on.
</P>
<P>
   After Dick York left ''Bewitched'' because of illness in 1969,
actor Dick Sargent took over as Darrin and the series continued.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a faux Livia on ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we will probably do is deal with what does one feel like
when a parent dies with whom you haven't had a good relationship,''
Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   A misconception held by many of the show's fans is that Marchand
limited her appearances during the second season because of her
cancer. Instead, Chase said, her appearances were limited by her
dark-hearted character's deeds: Tony understandably held a grudge
over the hit attempt and didn't want to have anything to do with
Livia.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said he actually wrote scenes superfluous to the plot this
past year just to get Marchand more air time. Livia was in police
custody in her final scene, picked up with stolen airline tickets
that Tony had given her.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Chase and his writers decide to deal with
Marchand's death, they will do their best to keep it a secret.
Chase would undoubtedly like the same look of surprise on viewers'
faces as Richie Aprile had when his girlfriend turned the gun on
him and fired.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain: It will mean the end for one of Tony's
favorite sayings about his mother, one that became a catchphrase:
''She's dead to me!''
</P>
<P>
   ''No, we can't use that line,'' Chase said. ''But that line will
come back to haunt him, I'm sure.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Runway Summit Debates Safety  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concluding there's no ''silver bullet''
solution to the problem of close calls on airport runways, a panel
of experts proposed a series steps they called ''silver BBs.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions ranging from improved signs and lights to changes in
terminology, radio frequencies and better airport design were
debated Tuesday at the Federal Aviation Administration's National
Runway Safety Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference is seeking to boil down ideas and
proposals collected during nine similar sessions around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Close calls on the nation's airport runways have increased
steadily over the last decade and are a growing concern in aviation
circles. More than 320 close calls were reported last year. Just
two weeks ago, the independent National Transportation Safety Board
returned to the issue and provided some proposals to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is expected to develop a series of corrective actions
in the coming months based on the proposals it is accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   Special light signals that would tell a pilot turning on to a
taxiway when his plane is completely clear of the runway were
proposed by Kim Cardosi of the Transportation Department's Volpe
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pilot may be clear of the runway, but the guy in seat 32J
may not be,'' she said, noting that with a large plane it can be
hard to tell when the whole craft is out of the runway and thus out
of the path of other planes.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles as well as planes can pose a hazard on runways, and
Craig Williams of the American Association of Airport Executives
suggested requiring special tests and licenses for specific airport
activities.
</P>
<P>
   A limited license might be issued for people moving vehicles
around the apron and loading areas, he said, with an extended
license needed to drive a vehicle across runways and taxiways.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine McCoy of Ohio University also urged extra training in
ground operations for pilots, particularly private pilots who may
learn to fly at a small airport and later land or take off at a
larger, more complicated one.
</P>
<P>
   Raja Parasuraman of Catholic University of America suggested
improvements in lights to signal pilots, including the possibility
of red-green stop-and-go lights for crossing runways or waiting. A
red-green system is used at London's busy Heathrow Airport, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers urged that air traffic controllers not give
pilots taxi instructions when a plane is landing and completing its
rollout on the runway. This is a very busy time for pilots working
in a noisy cockpit, and it's easy to misunderstand instructions
that could wait a few minutes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the problem of too much radio traffic, Cardosi
suggested that some current standard messages may be unnecessary.
For example, if a pilot has been waiting behind a jumbo jet for 10
minutes, and then watches the big plane take off, it shouldn't be
necessary to warn him about wake turbulence when he follows, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kelley of the Mitre Corp. endorsed a Safety Board
suggestion that taxiing pilots be required to get specific
controller clearance before crossing each runway. Currently,
directions to proceed to a certain spot on the airport imply
permission to cross any intersecting runway.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Oil Spill Worsens  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Their boots and overalls coated
with a layer of shiny oil, workers waded into rock pools Tuesday to
grab blackened pieces of kelp. With more oil hitting the mainland
with every tide, authorities predicted the ecological damage from
the spill could get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the slick has coated thousands of African penguins in
oil and angered many residents in a city that prizes its clean
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as the tide comes in, more oil comes in,'' supervisor
Mike Minaar said, gazing out at the Atlantic Ocean. He forecast at
least two more weeks of mopping up following Friday's oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   The large oil slick hit the mainland Saturday, the day after the
Panamanian-registered Treasure went down carrying 1,300 tons of
bunker oil and 90 tons of gas oil.
</P>
<P>
   So far only small patches of oil have been washed up on the
city's most popular beaches. But the Robben Island nature reserve,
home to about 14,000 adult African penguins and 6,000 chicks, has
been hit badly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the island's birds were coated with oil and efforts
are under way to evacuate the endangered birds -- the world's
third-largest penguin colony.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue effort is expected to become one of the largest of
its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suspect by the end of the week we will have between 10,000
and 12,000 birds to take care of,'' said Estelle van der Merwe of
the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal
Birds. ''We have lost about 32 penguins so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African Maritime Safety Authority on Tuesday estimated
that 400 tons of oil had been released. Others had reported earlier
that just 100 to 300 tons had spilled.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 tons of oil were still thought to be trapped in the
ship, and cleanup workers are racing to pump it from the sunken
ship, said Capt. Bill Dernier of the maritime authority.
</P>
<P>
   The operation entails anchoring a barge over the wreck of the
Treasure and sending divers down with hoses to pump the oil out
from the ship's tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping to start pumping on Thursday, so we don't waste
the good weather,'' said Jimmy Cook, who is overseeing the dive
operation that's expected to take at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   It will be dangerous and difficult work.
</P>
<P>
   To reach some of the oil, divers will have to navigate their way
through the inside of the Treasure in chilly waters up to 100 feet
below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Divers had to battle heavy swell when they used an underwater
video camera to survey the wreck, which showed the Treasure to be
badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasure was managed by the Greek shipping company Good
Faith and owned by a Panamanian company, Dernier said. Earlier
reports said the Treasure was owned by a Chinese company.

<HEADLINE> Blackstreet Members Settle Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Music producer and former Blackstreet
group member Teddy Riley has reached a settlement in a slander
lawsuit filed against a former bandmate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claimed former Blackstreet member Chauncey Hannibal
defamed Riley on MTV and five East Coast radio stations by playing
a rap song called ''Shame on You'' that accused Riley of
dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement reached last week are confidential,
Riley's attorney, David Ventker, said Monday. The suit was filed
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Riley had sought $2 million from Hannibal, who goes by the stage
name Chauncey Black, and also sought an injunction to stop Hannibal
from playing ''Shame on You'' and making further accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Hannibal said that there had been some ''creative and artistic
differences'' between him and Riley and that he wanted ''to express
my regret for the false statements which were made about Teddy, by
the media and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley formed Blackstreet in 1993, and the band won a Grammy
Award in 1997 for best R&AMP;B performance by a duo or group with
vocal. Blackstreet broke up last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Gorbachev Visits Vatican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- He sat between two clerics, quoted the pope
and helped plug a book recounting a cardinal's battle against
church repression in the Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's poll ratings are
sagging at home, but he has become a popular figure at the Vatican
after forging a friendship with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev sat on a dais Tuesday along with two cardinals, the
Italian foreign minister and the president of the European Union's
commission to promote the book ''The Martyrdom of Patience,'' the
memoirs of Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.
</P>
<P>
   Casaroli, who died in 1998, was considered an architect of the
Vatican policy that helped the church survive in Eastern Europe
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev called Casaroli ''a great personality,'' recalling
their meeting in Moscow to help prepare Gorbachev's historic visit
to the Vatican in 1989, the first by a leader of the Soviet
Communist party. Gorbachev has met with the pope at least a half
dozen times since.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Treasury Secretary Rubin Lauded  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin won praise for leading the
Treasury Department during America's longest economic expansion.
But President Clinton also remembered him as a failure -- as least
in his grasp of popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rubin didn't know about the popular television
series, ''The X-Files.'' He didn't know who blues legend B.B. King
was. And he thought that folk singer Jimmy Buffett was the son of
billionaire investor Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton poked fun at Rubin Tuesday -- and lavished praise on him,
too -- at the unveiling of Rubin's official portrait at the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, and former Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor joined Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at
the unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, now affiliated with Citigroup, served as Treasury
secretary from Jan. 10, 1995 until July 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted him because I knew he was committed at turning the
economy around,'' Clinton said. ''I knew he wanted the economy to
work for ordinary Americans. And I knew he cared very much about
poor people in poor places that are too often forgotten here in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton momentarily broke his 7&AMP;frac12; year rule against talking about
interest rates. Complimenting Summers for introducing him, Clinton
said, ''If that won't keep interest rates down, I don't know what
will.'' Clinton hastened to say he made the remark only to see who
would faint first: Summers or Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that Clinton ''used to tease me, outrageously I
thought, about not knowing all the picky minutiae of popular
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Jimmy Buffett. ''Any normal person would say
Warren Buffett's son,'' Rubin said. He said he even checked with
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ''And Alan said, 'It must be Warren's son,''' Rubin said. ''So,
it just goes to show, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Clinton ''was not overwhelmingly impressed'' that
Greenspan had come up with the same answer. ''In fact, he said,
'That doesn't surprise me in the least.'''

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol Drugs May Help Bones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two more studies suggest that widely used
cholesterol-lowering drugs may prevent brittle bones.
</P>
<P>
   Participants using drugs called statins reduced their risk of
fractures by about 70 percent in one study and by 45 percent in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The studies in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association follow last week's publication of similar research in
the British medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   The three are among the first to suggest that statins might have
bone-enhancing effects in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Statins are taken by about 8 million Americans to treat high
cholesterol. Research has shown they can activate an enzyme that
promotes bone growth, and in rats they have been shown to increase
bone formation.
</P>
<P>
   If statins do the same thing in humans, they would stand apart
from existing osteoporosis drugs, which slow bone erosion rather
than increasing bone, said Dr. Philip S. Wang of Harvard's Brigham
and Women's. Hospital, who led one of the JAMA studies.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of both JAMA studies said it is too soon to start
prescribing statins to prevent or treat osteoporosis, an often
crippling bone-thinning disorder of aging that affects about 10
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, two researchers agreed, noting
that neither study included measurements of bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   Drs. Steven Cummings and Douglas Bauer of the University of
California at San Francisco said studies specifically designed to
compare statins with a dummy pill are needed to confirm the link.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's study involved 6,110 New Jersey residents 65 and older,
including 1,222 who underwent hip-fracture surgery in 1994.
Patients taking statins were 71 percent less likely to have
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In the other JAMA study, Swiss researcher Christoph Meier of
University Hospital of Basel and colleagues analyzed data on 91,611
people in Britain ages 50 to 89 from the late 1980s through 1998,
including 3,940 participants with fractures. Current statin users
were 45 percent less likely to break bones.

<HEADLINE> Youngsters Learn About Zoo-Keeping  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Being a zoo keeper doesn't mean just cuddling
furry animals: the National Zoological Park is showing both
teen-agers and pre-teens that it can also mean cleaning up an
operating room with a mop and tin pail.
</P>
<P>
   ''How Do You Zoo?'' is a new interactive exhibit that covers
work with captive animals from serving appetizers to conducting
x-rays. For the pre-teens -- five to 10-year-olds -- it's play. They
pretend to feed oxygen, for example, into a small intensive care
unit with a plush owl inside. The teen volunteers -- there's a pool
of 20 -- get a four-day training course in the actual animal houses
so they can help handle the little ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great way to build bridges,'' said Lucy Spelman, the
zoo's new director, introducing the program to reporters Tuesday.
She is the former chief vet.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Fields, executive director of the Friends of the National
Zoo, pointed out that play at being adults is an important part of
children's learning process.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Small Mammal House'' presents a choice of activities, the
zoo's statement said, ''including scooping up sloth 'poop'...'' At
the ''Commissary'' there are plastic food items in plastic
containers with menu cards listing the diets of different species.
The kids wear dark aprons rather than the white coats available in
the ''Animal Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's morning session took on a K-5 group -- kindergarten
through fifth grade -- from the Turkey Thicket Recreational Center
in northeast Washington. One of the day's four volunteers was
13-year-old Christina Haramis, just graduated from a Montessori
school in Bowie, Md. Her ambitions don't run to zoo-keeping, but
she said she likes working with kids.
</P>
<P>
   Her interests run to marine life and archaeology and she hopes
to get a look at some ancient Greek ruins next March.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be really wonderful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fields recalled that when he was a kid, all that he and his
friends thought of becoming were cowboys and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't know all the things we could be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A zoo problem came up earlier in an unusual venue: the Senate
Committee on Rules and Administration. Lawrence M. Small, secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution which runs the zoo, was questioned
by panel chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, about a shooting
among young visitors in April. Seven children were hurt and one
youngster charged with attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Small said the incident had occurred just outside the park.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it could have been 20 yards inside, too,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The only useful measure, he suggested, would be to increase both
internal security and cooperation with police on days when large
numbers of visitors are expected. The shooting occurred during an
annual black family day celebration.

<HEADLINE> Erosion Threatens U.S. Coastline  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Erosion threatens one-fourth of the homes and
buildings along America's coastline in the coming decades, as many
as 87,000 risking damage or destruction, a government's disaster
agency warns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are, in many ways, far more alarming than we
thought,'' said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which financed a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If current trends hold, more than 1,500 homes a year will be
lost to coastal erosion. The cost of these homes, and the land on
which they sit, will be more than $500 million per year.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis looked at the erosion threat over the next 60 years
to structures within 500 feet of the nation's coastlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the beach ends up on the wrong side of your property,
that's a disaster. You lose your land as well as your structure,''
said Bill Merrell, who directed the study prepared by the H. John
Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal erosion can be worse than inland flooding, he explained,
because it also removes the land itself, often more valuable than
the structures on it.
</P>
<P>
   The American Coastal Coalition, a group representing coastal
communities to promote tourism and encourage shore protection,
criticized the report. The coalition fears it will be used, through
the federal flood insurance program, to entice people to move
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell denied that. The aim is for people who want to live
along the coastline to understand the risk and to help set federal
flood insurance rates accordingly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not saying don't locate,'' he said. ''Each individual
has to make those decisions. But they need to be apprised of the
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt warned, ''If coastal development continues unabated, and if
the sea levels rise as some scientists are predicting, the impact
will be even worse.'' He noted that current flood insurance does
not cover damage caused by gradual erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists report the nation appears to be entering a period
of increased hurricane activity, the additional storms expected to
increase the coastal erosion threat.
</P>
<P>
   A major storm can erode the coastline 100 feet in a day, the
report noted, though much of that loss may be restored over the
following years.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of storms, erosion is often a gradual process, but it
can be relentless. Its impact is illustrated by the problem of the
Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, erected 1,500 feet from the shore in
1870. By 1987 the lighthouse was in danger of falling victim to
erosion. Finally, last year, the National Park Service moved it
back 2,900 feet at a cost of $9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of moving homes can be beyond the means of most people.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered FEMA to commission the study during a debate
over how best to manage coastal erosion, currently handled
piecemeal by a mix of federal, state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time to renew public dialogue about how we can lower
the risks to life and property and reduce the costs,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimated that 338,000 structures are within 500 feet
of the coasts in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii. It did not
include Alaska or such large coastal cities as New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles or Miami, which it said are heavily protected against
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Of 86,600 structures estimated to be threatened by erosion in
the next 60 years, 53,000 are on the Atlantic Coast, 16,000 on the
Great Lakes, 13,000 along the Gulf of Mexico and 4,600 on the
Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of erosion vary greatly from place to place, with some of
the highest in parts of the Gulf of Mexico at six feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of lost and damaged property because of erosion was
estimated at $530 million per year for property owners alone. In
addition, the study estimated costs of $410 million annually to
communities for loss of land and structures.
</P>
<P>
   Federal flood insurance, for damage caused by floods and storms,
would pay about $80 million of this total at current enrollment
rates, the study said. Even at 100 percent enrollment the insurance
would cover only about $200 million of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommended that Congress direct FEMA to develop
erosion hazard maps for coastal areas and to include the cost of
expected erosion losses when setting flood insurance rates in
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested several other options for dealing with the
threat, including establishing Coastal High Hazard Zones; imposing
mandatory surcharges on flood insurance in those zones to add
coverage for erosion; requiring building setbacks to reduce
potential damage; and requiring communities to impose building
standards that take into account future flood potential because of
erosion.

<HEADLINE> Army Hires New Advertising Agency  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army hired a new advertising agency
Tuesday in hope of improving its pitch to potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Burnett Worldwide Inc., based in Chicago, will work with two
minority partners: Cartel Creativo, which specializes in Hispanic
advertising, and Images USA, which specializes in marketing to
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is about 30 percent black and about 8 percent Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, expected to be worth about $95 million a year, is
structured so that Leo Burnett's compensation is tied to the Army's
success in meeting its recruiting goals. So far this year, the Army
is running about 3,600 enlistees short of its goal of 80,000
recruits for the year, Army Secretary Louis Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera told a Pentagon news conference the contract with Leo
Burnett gives both it and the Army more flexibility in reaching
potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Army is dropping its current advertising agency,
Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. of New York, which has held the account for 12
years, Caldera said, ''We wanted to do business in a different
way.'' Last year the Army fell 6,200 short of its recruiting goal.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam did not compete for the new contract, Caldera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wolf, Leo Burnett's chief executive officer, said her
agency has not yet settled on specific advertising slogans. She
said no decision has been made on whether to ditch the ''Be all
that you can be,'' slogan which has been a trademark Army
recruiting pitch since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Burnett's other clients include McDonald's, Coca-Cola and
Nintendo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Is Cautious on Mexico Election  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Its southern neighbor and second-largest
trading partner is preparing for a dramatic election that could end
71 years of single-party rule. So what does the United States have
to say about Mexico's presidential election on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   As little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United States and Mexico are so sensitive
that the Clinton administration has avoided saying anything that
could even hint of U.S. interference.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is historically wary of U.S. economic and military might,
and politicians routinely swear to defend national sovereignty.
U.S. officials are cautious about statements that could affect
cooperation on important issues including trade, drug smuggling or
immigration -- or become a campaign issue themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So, when pressed for comment, U.S. officials have made innocuous
comments praising Mexican democracy, saying they will accept
whatever choices Mexicans make and insisting that they have no
favorites among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We very much look forward to seeing what the Mexican people
decide,'' Luis Gutierrez, deputy assistant secretary of state for
Western Hemisphere Affairs, told reporters in Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in a tight race with Vicente Fox of the center-right
National Action Party. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party is a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. government had a favorite candidate, it would be
unlikely to admit it publicly. But even privately, U.S. officials
insist they have no preferences and are interested only in a fair
race that will assure Mexico's continued stability.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that a victory by one or the other does have some
implications for the United States, but they're much less
significant than the view that the election is seen as free and
fair,'' said Robert Pastor, a political science professor at Emory
University and a former director of Latin American and Caribbean
Affairs on the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the front-runners has indicated they would make major
changes in the relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Labastida victory could offer greater continuity in
U.S.-Mexican relations. But a Fox victory could please U.S.
officials who see it as an important advance in Mexican democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who speaks English, is
generally seen as being more open to a closer relationship with the
United States. But in Mexico, he has been accused of accepting
illegal foreign contributions and his patriotism has been
questioned. That means he would likely face greater scrutiny in his
relations with the United States -- and have less room to maneuver --
than Labastida would.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that each candidate has its pros and cons, but I think
they do somehow even out,'' said Armand B. Peschard-Sverdrup,
director of the Mexico Project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Election day could be trickier for U.S. officials than the
campaign has been. Most polls show Labastida and Fox in a
statistical tie, though Labastida has a slight advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If Labastida is declared the winner by a narrow margin and
opposition candidates challenge the vote, any declaration by the
United States -- or maybe even the lack of a declaration -- could be
seen in Mexico as interference.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, the United States criticized the Peruvian
presidential run-off after the opposition candidate backed out,
citing fears of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects a similar response over Mexico. There's no chance
of the same kind of election-day fraud, said George Grayson, a
Mexico expert at the College of William &AMP; Mary in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States could never take a heavy-handed approach
with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Washington will bend over backward to not involve
itself in adjudicating the Mexican election,'' Grayson said.

<HEADLINE> British Exhibit Features Viet Photo  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Associated Press photographer Nick Ut's wrenching
picture of a 9-year-old Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack
went on display Tuesday for the first time with the camera used to
shoot the famous image.
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 shot of Phan Thi Kim Phuc earned Ut a Pulitzer Prize
and thrust the burned, screaming youngster into photographic
history.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other Ut photographs, they form part of a display on
technology at the $75 million Wellcome Wing of London's Science
Museum, which opens Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good place to show the camera because a lot of
people will see it,'' said Ut, who attended the press viewing
Tuesday with Kim Phuc, the girl in his famous photo and now a
longtime friend. ''Everyone knows the photo, but not the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Queen Elizabeth II toured the exhibit, exclaiming ''Is it
really you?'' when she saw the 37-year-old Kim Phuc standing next
to the picture, clad in a black silk Vietnamese tunic and trousers.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the exhibit, senior curator Andrew Nahum said he
looked at many photographs ''but I couldn't persuade myself that
any of them had the emotional power of the Kim Phuc photo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''More than just showing the iconic image, we want to unpack the
history around it,'' Nahum said. So the exhibit identifies other
children in the photo, including Kim's older brother, who lost an
eye but survived the South Vietnamese army's napalm bomb attack on
the village of Trang Bang, 25 miles northwest of Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Ut's Leica viewfinder with its wide-angle lens stands a
Muirhead transmitters once used to send photographs around the
world. Other Ut pictures show two of Kim Phuc's male cousins, one
just 9 months old, who died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Stretched over four floors, the Wellcome Wing has displays on
genetics, digital technology, bio-medicine and artificial
intelligence, and a 450-seat IMAX cinema.
</P>
<P>
   A section on new developments already displays details of
Monday's announcement that scientists have mapped the human genetic
code.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most museums have a 'build and walk away' philosophy,'' said
John Durant, head of the Wellcome Wing program. ''We will stay on
the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Phuc, who was treated for her burns in West Germany, studied
and married in Cuba, and defected to the West in 1992. Ut, now an
AP photographer based in Los Angeles, often visits her in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Ut returned to Trang Bang in April, the 25th anniversary of the
end of the Vietnam War, but Kim Phuc -- who works as a UNESCO
ambassador and runs a foundation for children damaged by war -- has
not visited her homeland since leaving in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not ready yet, financially or emotionally,'' she said
Tuesday. ''Someday, I'll go. Now I'm just happy to be free.''

<HEADLINE> Tight security, two-beer limit planned for Mets-Braves series  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - If Atlanta relief pitcher John Rocker carries
out his threat to ride the subway to games between the Mets and the
Braves, there could be more cops on the train than purple-haired
punks, unwed mothers and AIDS patients combined.
</P>
<P>
   Security at Shea Stadium will be tighter than a drum. And Mets
fans itching to taunt Rocker - who angered New Yorkers with his
politically incorrect views on punks and foreigners riding New York
subways - may find their anger dulled by a two-beer limit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rocker told USA Today Baseball Weekly that he planned
to ride the No. 7 subway train through Queens during the
Mets-Braves series that starts Thursday. ''I won't be in a cab,''
he vowed. ''I won't be on the bus. I'll be on that train.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Tuesday that Rocker can take the subway, which
passes through many immigrant communities. But he may have trouble
starting a meaningful dialogue with other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Rocker gets on the train, he'll be entirely surrounded by
police officers,'' said police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode.
</P>
<P>
   Once he gets to the stadium he'll be protected by a sea of blue.
Mode said that in addition to the 60 officers usually assigned to
Mets games there will be an extra 500 uniformed cops plus an
unspecified number of plainclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Police sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity told The Associated Press that officers will be on every
subway platform along the No. 7 line between Grand Central Terminal
in Manhattan and Shea in Queens, and any train Rocker boards will
become an express so that it picks up fewer passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A police source also said that an Atlanta police lieutenant
would travel with the team, wearing a Braves uniform at the games
to blend in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mets senior vice president David Howard said that
fans would be allowed to buy only two beers at a time during the
four-game series. The normal limit is four. Howard said beer sales
will stop after the sixth inning instead of the usual seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident New Yorkers will rise above the situation and
not stoop down to his level,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker became persona non grata here when he told Sports
Illustrated during the off-season that he would rather retire than
play for a New York team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine taking the 7 train ... looking like you're (in) Beirut
next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS,
right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time,
right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids,'' he said.
''It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York are
the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and
not hear anybody speaking English. ... How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   The series this week will be the hurler's first trip to Shea
since the story appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Braves and Mets players had varying opinions on the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I'm thinking about is going up there and doing my job on
the mound,'' said Braves starter Kevin Millwood, who is scheduled
to pitch Friday. ''I think major league baseball and security at
Shea Stadium is smart enough to prevent having anything bad from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza said: ''I'm sure the crowd will be loud
and rowdy. That's what New York baseball is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And if ugliness does break out on the subway, the Mets will come
to the rescue - in a comic book. The team has commissioned a
24-page comic book featuring a villain who wants to blow up a No. 7
train. The bad guy and his robotic henchmen are defeated by the
Mets' multiracial lineup, with reliever John Franco pounding the
villain, named Larcenous Vein, into outer space with his baseball
bat. The comic book will be handed out to fans 14 and under at
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The team said no similarity between Vein and Rocker was
intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a coincidence,'' said Mets spokesman Jay Horowitz. ''The
idea was conceived a long time ago.''

<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Convicted murderer Robert O. Marshall is
another step closer to execution after 14 years on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's first appeal in the federal courts has been rejected,
continuing a string of setbacks in state courts, where the onetime
insurance salesman from Ocean County has exhausted his appeals.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for his execution, pending further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas rejected the inmate's bid
for freedom, finding no merit to Marshall's argument that he was
denied a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling filed Friday and publicized Tuesday, Irenas denied
Marshall's application seeking a chance to gather evidence and have
a hearing in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas, who sits in Camden, wrote he believes ''as the New
Jersey Supreme Court found, that (any error in) petitioner's trial
was neither 'fundamentally unfair' nor 'so infected the entire
trial that the resulting conviction violated his due process.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who is imprisoned at New Jersey State Prison in
Trenton, was told of the ruling by one of his public defenders,
said Judith L. Borman, a public defender who prepared the latest
appeal, known as a ''habeas corpus'' petition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I assume he was very disappointed,'' Borman said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the defender's office will prepare a request to the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking for permission to appeal the
ruling to the circuit court. Habeas rulings have no automatic right
of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we have substantial constitutional issues, and it
should have been granted,'' Borman said.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was opposed by the state attorney general's office,
which was pleased with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a well-reasoned decision. We always contended his
federal claims were without merit, and the judge agreed he got a
fair trial,'' office spokesman Chuck Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was convicted in 1986 of hiring men to murder his wife,
Maria, in 1984 so he could collect life insurance and continue an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The case was chronicled in Joseph McGinniss' 1989 best seller,
''Blind Faith'' and in a television mini-series based on the book.
</P>
<P>
   In his habeas petition, Marshall claimed misconduct by the Ocean
County prosecutor's office, including improperly failing to
disclose evidence favorable to him.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall also said his constitutional rights were violated
because he had an ineffective lawyer and an unfair jury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Marshall claims the state's death penalty and
appeal procedures are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas rejected all 22 claims made by Marshall, 60, who had
lived in Toms River with his wife and their children.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to death by lethal injection for hiring three
Louisiana men to murder Maria so he could collect $1.4 million in
life insurance and continue an extramarital affair with Sarann
Kraushaar, who testified against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marshall, 42, was found shot to death on Sept. 7, 1984, at
a rest area along the Garden State Parkway. Marshall, a prominent
businessman, has maintained his innocence. He told police he had
pulled over to check on a tire and was knocked unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Marshall became the first death row inmate to have his
death sentence upheld by the state Supreme Court since New Jersey
restored capital punishment in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, that court again affirmed his death sentence,
following the post-conviction relief process. The U.S. Supreme
Court, which hears appeals from state high courts, declined in
October 1997 to take his appeal of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has conducted no executions since restoring the death
penalty. Fifteen men are on death row.
</P>
<P>
   The habeas petition raised many of the issues rejected by the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall contended that his trial lawyer, Glenn Zeitz, failed to

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chilean Soldier Ready To Talk  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Relatives of the missing urged a former
Chilean army guard on Tuesday to go to authorities with all he
knows about the reported execution of political prisoners after the
1973 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   The former soldier, Roberto Saldias, told state-owned television
in an interview Monday night that prisoners were routinely executed
at a soccer stadium in the Chilean capital after the coup led by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Saldias' disclosure marked the first time that a member of the
armed forces has verified stories of executions publicly and
without the cloak of anonymity. Rumors about executions, torture
and other violations of human rights at the National Stadium after
the coup have been rampant for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Diaz, who heads a group of relatives of the missing,
told The Associated Press that the next step is for Saldias to take
his information to authorities probing human rights violations of
the former dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing to do is to hand this information over to the
competent authorities ... to the tribunals,'' said Diaz, whose
group for years has sought the whereabouts of loved ones and
punishment for those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,197 people were killed and
more than 1,000 are missing from the 17-year regime that began with
the September 1973 coup that toppled Marxist president Salvador
Allende.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview, Saldias said he was prepared to
identify the executioners by name. ''They took the law into their
own hands,'' said Saldias.
</P>
<P>
   Saldias said he was one of the hundreds of guards at the main
Santiago soccer stadium, which was used as a prison camp. According
to Saldias, prisoners there were put in groups identified by
yellow, black and red discs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever received a red disc had no chance'' and would be
killed, Saldias said.
</P>
<P>
   The army said Tuesday it would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Saldias' willingness to reveal the names of alleged human rights
violators could be the first concrete, public result of the armed
forces' commitment to help determine the fate of more than 1,000
dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with the military was reached last week that
included the guarantee of anonymity for those who deliver
information on those who disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos backed the accord and insists it will
help find out the truth. Wherever he goes, Lagos has appealed for
unity among Chileans, who remain deeply divided over Pinochet's
1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   At Lagos' unveiling of a monument Monday to Allende, he again
called for unity even as demonstrators shouted: ''Trial for
Pinochet!''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 84, has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a
lower court ruling stripping him of diplomatic immunity.
Prosecutors want to try him for human rights violations committed
during his regime, and the high court's decision was expected in
July.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Appeals For Reconciliation  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe appealed for
national reconciliation Tuesday after his ruling party narrowly won
parliamentary elections following a bitter campaign marked by
violence and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe promised to work with Zimbabwe's newly elected
parliament, which will have a serious opposition presence for the
first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our next parliament is certainly destined to prove very
lively, but hopefully lively in a very positive way,'' the
76-year-old authoritarian president said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidates, promising a change from the country's
disastrous economic performance, made sweeping gains in the vote.
The 9-month-old Movement for Democratic Change won 57 seats,
compared to 62 for Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. An independent party won
one.
</P>
<P>
   The previous parliament had only three opposition members.
</P>
<P>
   The strong opposition showing in the weekend vote, however, will
not give it much say in running the country. Its strength will be
diluted after Mugabe appoints 30 members to the 150-seat
parliament, as permitted by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has said he will not bring the opposition into the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Saturday and Sunday came after months of political
violence and intimidation that left more than 30 people dead.
European Union monitors said the violence, which they called
state-sponsored terror, meant the elections were flawed and the
campaign was not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai expressed disappointment that his
party had not won a majority, but said the country was ''on the
path of change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who believes the destiny of this country rests on
Robert Mugabe must have his head examined,'' Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai said he would challenge Mugabe when the president's
term expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In his televised address Tuesday, Mugabe said it was now time
for the country to unite across racial, class and ethnic divides.
</P>
<P>
   During the election campaign, Mugabe branded the opposition as
puppets of the country's small, but economically powerful white
community and stooges of Britain, the former colonial power. He
called white farmers enemies of the country and promised to seize
some of their land and redistribute it to the country's
impoverished, landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the campaign's violence and intimidation, voters turned
out in large numbers -- more than double the turnout of the last
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In February, voters shocked the government by rejecting a
referendum that would have strengthened Mugabe's powers. The
parliamentary vote also was seen as a blow to the government, which
had predicted the opposition would be lucky to win three seats.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's strong showing was clearly a protest vote
against the government, said Jonathan Moyo, a spokesman for the
ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front.
Many voters cited endemic corruption and Zimbabwe's withering
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe had one of Africa's strongest economies at independence
in 1980. Today, it is wracked with high unemployment and soaring
inflation, crippling fuel shortages and chronic shortages of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on a course that is not sustainable, but we've got a
government that is very proud of itself and may not want to
change,'' said independent economist John Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, armed ruling party militants, with Mugabe's
support, have occupied more than 1,600 of the country's white-owned
commercial farms and demanded they be redistributed to landless
blacks. The occupations have badly damaged commercial farming, the
most important sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of its election victory, the government will push
forward with its plans to seize at least 800 white farms, Moyo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of people who voted for ZANU-PF ... voted for
land, and they will get that,'' Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party performed strongly in rural areas, its
traditional stronghold. However, those were the areas most affected
by a campaign of political violence and intimidation, and MDC
officials said the tactics worked in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai, who lost his bid for a parliamentary seat, said the
opposition would challenge the results in up to 20 districts.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, the promise of land seizures and Mugabe's heated
condemnations of whites have hurt Zimbabwe's chances of gaining
economic support from Western countries, said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The credibility of the government has suffered such damage
that people are not going to accept anything it says,'' he said.
''Zimbabwe is going to have to earn its right to be taken seriously
again.''

<HEADLINE> Another error in summer school notifications  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Letters were sent out in error this week
incorrectly telling some public-school students that they must
attend summer school, the Board of Education said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know some letters were sent out in error,'' said Pam
McDonnell, board spokeswoman. ''It does not seem to have been just
in one spot in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the problem to errors in entering data from
standardized test scores that help determine whether children are
promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   She said parents are allowed to appeal decisions made regarding
whether their children should attend summer school, and delays in
processing the results of those appeals may also have created some
errors on the final list.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell could not provide an estimate of how many children
were affected.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major problem to plague the city's new policy
of requiring children to attend summer school if their grades on
standardized tests don't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 8,600 city elementary and middle school
students were told to attend summer school or were held back
because a testing company incorrectly evaluated their grades.
</P>
<P>
   CTB/McGraw-Hill, a Monterey, Calif.-based company which has
tested millions of students across the nation in its 72 years,
notified the Board of Education about the mistake after the 1999
summer school sessions were completed.
</P>
<P>
   This year's mistake is also causing anguish among parents. One
mother, Yasmin Sanchez, said on Tuesday her son's third-grade
teacher told her a few weeks ago that her son had passed both the
standardized math and reading tests, and that he would be promoted
to fourth grade at PS 59 in Belmont in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got the letter this week from the Board of Ed informing
her 8-year-old boy that he had to go to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was devastated,'' she said. ''I was furious. I was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez went to the principal's office and was told ''I wasn't
the only one. There were more parents who received the letter after
being told their child had passed, and they were complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said school officials are double-checking the names of
children who received the letters against the lists of children who
are not going to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonnell noted that test scores are not the sole criterion.
If a child fails one but not the other of the two standardized
tests but has good attendance and decent classwork, a teacher can
recommend that the child be promoted. She said some of the
confusion over who must attend summer school may stem from a lack
of communication between parents and teachers over a child's
progress.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Embargo for Food Sales To Ease  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans cut a deal Tuesday to allow
direct sales of U.S. food to Cuba for the first time in four
decades as hard-line anti-communists yielded to pressure from the
farm and business lobbies to ease the embargo on Fidel Castro's
government.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, concluded early Tuesday after 5&AMP;frac12; hours of
negotiations, may be largely symbolic: It would bar both the
federal government and U.S. banks from financing food sales.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to attach the agreement to a military
construction bill this week. It still must be approved by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., a leading advocate for easing
the embargo, said the agreement was a ''huge breakthrough for our
farmers.'' He said Cuba could finance its purchases of U.S. food
through other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was wary of the deal, because it also would
require congressional approval before a president could impose
future embargoes on food and medicine to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not opposed to allowing things like food and medicine
to go to Cuba, as long as it is for the benefit of the people and
not the benefit of the Castro government,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart. ''We do have concerns, on what I call an
institutional basis, based on the limits that it puts on
presidential prerogatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Castro negotiators sought to downplay the agreement's
impact. Rep. Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the legislation
would ''make it as difficult as possible'' for such sales to take
place. The agreement also would write into law the existing ban on
Americans going to Cuba as tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that what Castro has wanted is access'' to U.S.
financial markets, she said. ''He's not going to get any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Policy Institute has estimated that the United States
could commercially export more than $400 million in food and
agricultural products to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the restrictions on financing mean Cuba is likely to buy no
more than $45 million worth of U.S. farm goods in the first year --
largely rice, soy and powdered milk, said John Kavulich, president
of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short-term, this is symbolic. Medium- to long-term it can
provide some substantive opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce praised the pact as well. ''We view this as step one.
We'll be back for step two and step three later,'' said Mary Kay
Thatcher, a lobbyist for the farm bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over whether to weaken the 38-year-old embargo has
stalled passage of an agricultural appropriations bill for a month.
</P>
<P>
   A provision the House Appropriations Committee attached to the
bill in May would allow private U.S. financing of food sales to
Cuba, something that would be forbidden under the agreement reached
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted overwhelmingly last year to ease the Cuban
embargo, but the House refused to go along. The effort gained
momentum this year because of tight re-election races faced by
Nethercutt and other GOP proponents of easing the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats also dropped their support of the embargo after
the immigration battle over Elian Gonzalez, the boy who has been
the subject of a legal tug-of-war between his Florida relatives and
his father, who lives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who has led the Senate
effort to roll back the Cuban embargo, was studying the agreement
Tuesday, aides said. But he issued a statement saying ''a
tremendous accomplishment for American agriculture, and an
affirmation of America's humanitarian values, is in sight,''
</P>
<P>
   An ally of Ashcroft's, Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan, said the
agreement was ''more symbolic than real.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Republican Whip Tom DeLay,
both of Texas, had strongly opposed weakening the embargo but left
it up to Castro critics Ross-Lehtinen and Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart,
R-Fla., to negotiate a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you're the windshield. Sometimes you're the bug. In
this case I'm the bug,'' Armey said Tuesday, quoting a popular
song. ''There is a strong desire to open that market for American
sales. You cannot thwart the will of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban American National Foundation criticized the agreement
and said it would continue running pro-embargo ads in Nethercutt's
district.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would not affect sales of U.S. medicine and health
products, which have been permitted since 1992.

<HEADLINE> State pledges $41M to redevelop Camden neighborhood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday unveiled a
$41.2 million financing package for construction of hundreds of new
homes in a blighted neighborhood in Camden, the state's poorest
city.
</P>
<P>
   The state pledged $33 million in conditional funding for
Westfield Acres/Hope VI, a planned development of 523 homes and
apartments that would replace the dilapidated Westfield Acres
public housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   The state funds are contingent on a successful application for
federal funds by the Camden Housing Authority and some financing
approvals by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has approved $8.2 million for construction of a
50-unit rental development next to the Hope VI site. That
development, on North 32nd Street, will consist of 45 duplex units
and five single-family units to be rented to low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The development is being funded with $1.3 million from the state
Department of Community Affairs and $6.9 million from the Housing
and Mortgage Finance Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are laying the foundation for a strong new community,''
said Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the Department of Community
Affairs. ''We're fast approaching that point of critical mass that
turns an entire neighborhood around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camden Housing Authority is applying to the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development for about $35 million in
additional funding under a program that tries to replace blighted
and obsolete public housing with mixed-income, low-rise town houses
and garden-style apartments, as well as road and infrastructure
improvements and social service programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is much more than housing,'' said Kenny. ''It represents
the rebirth of the entire neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   If the federal application is successful, the Westfield
Acres/Hope VI project would be developed by St. Joseph's Carpenter
Society, a nonprofit community development corporation, with
private developers K. Hovnanian and Pennrose Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Pennrose also is the developer of the North 32nd Street project,
with the St. Joseph's Carpenter Society.

<HEADLINE> House Urges To Uphold Ohio Motto  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House gave its symbolic support to Ohio's
state motto -- ''With God, all things are possible'' -- which a
federal appeals court ruled violated church-state separation
provision of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On a vote of 333-27 Tuesday, with 66 other lawmakers voting
''present,'' the House said the court ruling should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's action is nothing more than political correctness
run rampant,'' said Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, chief sponsor of the
nonbinding resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State
issued a statement calling the vote an election-year stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is shameless political grandstanding,'' said the Rev.
Barry W. Lynn, the group's executive director. ''It is deplorable
to see government meddling with religion in such a reckless and
political fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ''no votes'' on the resolution was from Rep.
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democrat from Cleveland who said her vote
stemmed from her great respect for laws and the courts. ''As a
former prosecutor and judge, I take decisions made by the courts
very seriously,'' she said. ''This violated the separation of
church and state as written into the United States Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio adopted the motto in 1959. It became an issue in 1997 when
then-Gov. George Voinovich decided to etch it on a bronze plaque
embedded in front of the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision in April, a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said U.S. District Judge James Graham of Columbus
erred in 1998 when he concluded the words were acceptable as a
motto if the state did not attribute them to their biblical source.
In the New Testament, Matthew 19:26 attributes the comment to
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Judge David Nelson said he found Ohio's motto no
more troubling than the national motto ''In God We Trust'' that
appears on money.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has appealed the ruling to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   During debate on the resolution, Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio,
noted the day's session began with a prayer, and the House chamber
displays the national motto.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the things that I think makes people wonder about
their government and what's going on here,'' Chabot said. ''It's
such a ludicrous decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, drew a smattering of applause with a
floor speech in which he called federal judges a ''bunch of
overeducated nincompoops.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have become so politically correct they're street-stupid
and miss the whole point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is not the only state with a motto mentioning God. Arizona
uses ''God Enriches,'' and South Dakota's is ''Under God the people
will rule.'' Florida's motto of ''In God we trust'' mirrors the
nation's.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Vasvari, legal director for the American Civil Liberties
Union of Ohio, which is challenging the Ohio motto, said the other
slogans ''have much more casual or bland references to God.'' The
ACLU went to court over Ohio's motto because it uses sacred text,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is H.Res. 494.

<HEADLINE> Drug May Help Huntington's Disease  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An antibiotic used to treat a variety of
infections may one day offer hope to people suffering from the
inherited and deadly Huntington's Disease, if experiments in mice
also work in humans.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated quarter-million Americans suffer from the currently
untreatable disorder in which the brain degenerates, gradually
reducing the person's ability to walk, talk and reason.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and
Harvard Medical School report that they were able to slow the
progress of the disease in mice by using the antibiotic
minocycline. Their findings appear in the July issue of the journal
Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very excited about this,'' said Dr. Robert M.
Friedlander, lead researcher. He said he expects minocycline will
eventually become part of a cocktail of several drugs in treating
Huntington's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is an important study,'' added Dr. Christopher
Ross of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who was not part of
the research team. ''They have a new drug which can be given orally
... which can slow the progression of the disease in this mouse
model. I think that's very much a reason for hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But minocycline must first be tested for toxicity in humans,
Friedlander cautioned, noting that the drug appeared slightly more
toxic in mice with their form of Huntington's Disease than it did
in normal mice.
</P>
<P>
   Minocycline is a form of tetracycline currently used in humans
to treat acne, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. Unlike the
better known tetracycline, minocycline can cross the blood-brain
barrier that blocks most chemicals from entering the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, minocycline blocks the production of some of the
enzymes called caspases that cause brain cells to commit suicide.
Production of caspases in adult brains has been associated with
Huntington's Disease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and
strokes, Friedlander said.
</P>
<P>
   Caspases help eliminate unneeded cells in the developing fetus.
But victims of Huntington's Disease inherit a gene that causes
changes in the brain, usually beginning in middle age, that include
the activation of caspases.
</P>
<P>
   Friedlander previously succeeded in delaying the onset of Lou
Gehrig's Disease in mice using a different chemical to inhibit the
action of caspases.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1998 study found that minocycline reduced the size of
the injury following a stroke by limiting caspases, Friedlander
decided to see if it had affect in Huntington's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we found evidence that caspase-1 plays a role in the
progress of HD we decided to test the drug and it worked,''
Friedlander said. ''It prolonged the life of the mice, which was
the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the mice eventually went on to die, indicating
that the disease is complex and this was treating only one part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said he believes that minocycline will become part of a
set of drugs useful in battling the disease, just as several drugs
are now used in combination against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the new paper, Friedlander's team reports that minocycline
blocks the production three of the enzymes that appear to be
involved in the progression of the of Huntington's Disease,
caspase-1, caspase-3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
</P>
<P>
   Blocking iNOS uncovered a new part of the mechanism causing the
disease, said Ross, who heads the medical and science advisory
council of the Huntington's Disease Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme iNOS helps produce nitric oxide, a source of free
radicals than can damage cells, providing ''the first really direct
evidence'' that oxidants and stress have a significant role in
Huntington's, Ross said.

<HEADLINE> St Dept: China Can't Use Building  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is prohibiting China's
state-run news agency from occupying an apartment building it
bought near the Pentagon while the department decides whether to
allow cancel the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy provided the department Monday a copy of a
May 22 letter the department never received that was to notify the
U.S. government of the Xinhua agency's intention to buy the
seven-story building, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said under rules governing Chinese government purchase of
property in Washington, the department has until Aug. 26 to approve
or disallow the sale, which Xinhua said was completed this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of right now, the Xinhua news agency has been put on notice
by the department, through the embassy of the People's Republic of
China, that they may not occupy or use the building they have
purchased without first seeking department approval, and we will
continue to look at this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker repeated assertions that Xinhua failed to observe U.S.
law in making its decision to purchase the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're currently evaluating the situation and are considering
options available to us under the Foreign Missions Act,'' he said.
He would not elaborate on the options.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the House approved a measure to withhold from the
State Department any money it might use to approve the a sale.
Reeker said the issue should be resolved before the law could have
any impact.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress and others have said Xinhua could spy
on the Pentagon from the building. The Chinese deny that the news
agency's employees are spies.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Judges Worth Millions  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of the Supreme Court's nine members
were millionaires as the year began, led by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg's family wealth estimated at between $7.4 million and
$33.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Financial disclosure reports for 1999 indicated that at least
five, and perhaps six, of the top court's members held investments
worth over $1 million. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist may have
joined the court's millionaires club, but Justice Antonin Scalia
sold stock during the year and dropped far below the million-dollar
level.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges, members of Congress and other high-ranking
government officials are required to file annual reports. The
federal law requires only broad ranges of worth for assets and
exempts personal property and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul
Stevens and David H. Souter are millionaires, according to their
reports. None came close, however, to Ginsburg and her lawyer
husband, Martin, whose long list of investments included six worth
between $1 million and $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   They included retirement accounts and a tax-exempt JMP Pierpont
bond fund, total assets of $7.4 million to $33.1 million. Last year
she reported assets from $5.9 million to $24.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's report reflected the most varied investment
portfolio, state bonds and Treasury notes to holdings in
pharmaceutical and communications companies. Her ownership of AT&AMP;T
and MCI Worldcom stock, among others, has forced O'Connor to
disqualify herself from several cases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's total assets were reported in a range between
$525,000 to $1.3 million, up from $360,000 to $960,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's reported assets fell to $145,000 to $535,000, down from
$645,000 to $1.5 million the previous year. He sold off significant
amounts of shares in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear were Justices Anthony M. Kennedy ($65,000
to $195,000) and Clarence Thomas ($150,000 to $410,000).
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's annual salary is $181,400; the eight other Supreme
Court members receive $173,600.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the financial reports' usual listings of stock
holdings, some unusual entries cropped up.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist listed as a donation to the Smithsonian Institution
the robe he wore during the Senate impeachment trial of President
Clinton. His report said the robe had been appraised by Sotheby's
at $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice did not respond when asked Tuesday whether he
had taken a tax deduction for the donation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the noninvestment income Rehnquist received in 1999 was
$15,000 from ''the Lantz Office,'' his literary agent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas received an $800 commemorative jacket and traveled free
by private plane when he served as grand marshal of the 1999
Daytona 500 auto race.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Connor received a crystal piece and china rose -- estimated
value $500 -- when honored by the National First Ladies' Library.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disclosure reports were filed by May 15, and in
past years had been released within days or at most a few weeks.
The six-week delay this year was attributed to new rules that allow
judges to excise information from the reports they feel might
compromise their security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can really say the intent is to get these reports released
as quickly as possible,'' said David Sellers, a spokesman for the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   The reports for the nine justices were released Monday, the day
the Supreme Court announced several important rulings as it neared
the end of its 1999-2000 term.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee you that was a coincidence,'' Sellers said. ''The
release date had nothing to do with events occurring in the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices did excise much from their reports. Each signature
was blacked out, apparently to thwart would-be forgers, as were
some references to spouses and other family members.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Tops Nielsen Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Survivor'' topped the weekly television
ratings for the first time, helping CBS to a victory in a week
dominated by newsmagazines and game shows.
</P>
<P>
   More than 24 million people watched 28-year-old chemist Ramona
Gray get voted off the island in the fourth week of ''Survivor.''
So far, the 13-week summer series has gained viewers each week.
</P>
<P>
   In another show of strength, a competitor has changed its
schedule in reaction to ''Survivor.'' The new Fox series ''Opposite
Sex,'' which was supposed to premiere opposite the CBS summer hit
on Wednesday, was pushed back until July 17 -- a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A lower-key summer hit is the CBS newsmagazine ''48 Hours,''
which repackages previously-aired material in a mystery format. It
was the most-watched of seven newsmagazines in Nielsen Media
Research's top 20 last week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's experiment of running repeat episodes of ''Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' also paid off. Five editions of the show landed in
Nielsen's top 10, with all reaching between 15 million and 17
million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   With second quarter numbers out, CNBC said it beat CNN in total
day ratings over a three-month period for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   The combined prime-time audience share for CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox
was 44 last week, down from the season average of 52. That means
cable viewership was up.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, CBS drew 9.6 million viewers (6.9 rating, 13
share), NBC had 9.4 million viewers (6.7, 12), ABC had 8.8 million
(6.3, 12) and Fox had 5.4 million (3.7, 7). UPN had 3 million
viewers (2.0, 4), the WB had 2.5 million (1.8, 3) and Pax TV had
1.2 million (0.9, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
8.8 million viewers (6.8 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.3 million viewers (6.4, 15), while the ''CBS
Evening News'' had 7.3 million viewers (5.6, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of June 19-25, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 15.0; ''NBA Finals Game 6: Indiana at L.A.
Lakers,'' NBC, 14.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday-9:30 p.m.), ABC, 11.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Sunday-9:30 p.m.), ABC, 11.5; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Tuesday), ABC, 11.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday-9
p.m.), ABC, 10.9; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday-9
p.m.), ABC, 10.2; ''48 Hours'' (Monday), CBS, 9.5; ''NBA Finals
Tip-Off,'' NBC, 9.5; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.4; ''Dateline NBC''
(Tuesday), 9.4.

<HEADLINE> House Expands Raditation Payments  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to expand a federal
program that pays up to $100,000 to people sickened by Cold War-era
uranium mining and nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   The bill adds to the list of cancers and other diseases that
make former miners or nuclear test ''downwinders'' eligible for
payments under the 1990 law. The measure also expands the sites
where miners and downwinders can seek compensation, and adds
open-pit uranium miners and those who transported or milled
uranium.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will provide compensation to about 9,600 people
''who lost their health and in many cases their lives working for
this country's nuclear defense program,'' said Rep. Chris Cannon,
R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as a nation owe these people what this bill allows for,''
he said before the House approved the bill on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure now goes to the White House for President Clinton's
signature. The Senate approved it in December.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the uranium used in nuclear weapons produced during the
Cold War was mined in the Four Corners area of Arizona, New Mexico,
Colorado and Utah, while above-ground nuclear tests were detonated
in New Mexico and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the 1990 law sought the enhancements, saying the
original law was too narrow and too many people with legitimate
claims were denied. As of March 1, the Justice Department had paid
3,302 claims worth $244 million and denied another 3,500 claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the changes would
cost about $750 million during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some former miners have said the latest bill isn't broad
enough because it does not increase the compensation amount, cover
miners who worked after 1971 or include all the illnesses miners
say radiation caused.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill would extend eligibility to uranium
workers from South Dakota, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon and Texas.
The current law covers Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming
and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions include:
</P>
<P>
   --Adding leukemia and cancers of the lung, thyroid, brain,
kidney, esophagus and stomach to the list of cancers that make
miners eligible for compensation. Kidney disease and two lung
ailments also would be added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   For downwinders -- people who lived in areas of Nevada, Utah and
Arizona most affected by nuclear fallout from tests -- the added
cancers include leukemia and those of the brain, bladder, colon,
ovaries and salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminating provisions that give less money to downwinders or
miners who smoked.
</P>
<P>
   --Cutting the average time a person had to work in uranium mines
from just under 20 years to less than four.
</P>
<P>
   -- Requiring the Justice Department to take American Indian law
and custom into account when processing applications. Navajo
officials have complained that widows of dead miners have been
denied compensation because they were married in traditional Indian
ceremonies and do not have marriage certificates.
</P>
<P>
   --Spending up to $20 million a year for community health centers
and state health departments to screen for claims.

<HEADLINE> Italian Jews Hurt On Beautification  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- At a seminar on Pope Pius IX, a woman stood from the
audience and introduced herself: Elena Mortara, great-great-niece
of a Bolognese Jew who was forcibly baptized as a toddler and then
taken from his family to be virtually adopted by the 19-century
pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pius IX is due to be beatified Sept. 3, and Elena Mortara
said she hoped that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been damaged by this,'' she told the seminar Tuesday,
referring to the forced conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Jewish leaders said the beatification -- which advances
Pius on the path to sainthood -- threatens to harm two decades of
efforts by Pope John Paul II to improve Vatican relations with
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Mortara case ''is the biggest wound that remains in the
Italian Jewish world .... that still hasn't scarred over'' after
more than 150 years, said Amos Luzzatto, president of the Union of
Italian Jewish Communities. His organization and a historical
society were hosts of the seminar, which examined Pope Pius IX's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Mortara was baptized secretly when he was two years old
by a housemaid worried about his soul when he had a high fever.
When he was six he was snatched away from his parents by papal
police in 1858 and brought to Rome, where Pius IX took him under
his wing. The boy later entered a seminary and became a priest.
</P>
<P>
   B'nai B'rith International's president, Richard D. Heideman, has
expressed dismay in a letter to the head of the Vatican
congregation that handles the process toward sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the Jewish perspective, Pius IX was the pope who
countenanced the abduction of a 6-year-old Jewish child and his
conversion -- obviously against the will of this family -- to
Catholicism,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews are already upset by John Paul's defense of another
Pius, Pius XII, who is a candidate for beatification and who Jews
and others allege didn't use his moral authority enough to save
Jews during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet John Paul has won widespread admiration from Jews for his
efforts at healing centuries-old wounds between Catholics and Jews,
including his groundbreaking trip this year to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Mortara, who recalled that her father used to talk with
Edgardo before the latter's death in 1940, said the Jewish
community is ''embarrassed'' to intervene in the beatification
process, she cannot help but protest her ancestor's forced
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Jewish leader Luzzatto said the Pius IX beatification
will ''leave in us a bitterness'' that will affect Jewish-Vatican
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Carlo Liberati, a Vatican official involved in the
process leading to Pius IX's beatification, said Catholics have the
duty to try to ''send to paradise'' the soul of an unbaptized child
in danger of dying.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were Pius IX, I would have baptized him too,'' Liberati
said of the Mortara boy. He criticized opponents of the
beatification for what he said was ''using today's mentality to
judge the facts of 150 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberati, in a telephone interview, said Edgardo Mortara
deposited testimony on behalf of Pius IX's beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Pius IX's pontificate, from 1846 to 1878, was the longest in
history.

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps Expands Anti-AIDS Fight  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All Peace Corps volunteers in Africa will be
trained in methods necessary to slow the spread of AIDS, the agency
announced Tuesday in launching a worldwide campaign against the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Corps director Mark Schneider, as part of the
unprecedented effort, asked for up to 200 former volunteers to
return to duty as a ''crisis corps'' for up to six months to help
combat the disease that has hit sub-Saharan Africa harder than any
other region.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers formerly worked exclusively in agriculture, small
business, education and other projects but now will spend part of
their time teaching AIDS prevention and care. Health volunteers
will focus even more on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Additional volunteers will be recruited to spend all their time
fighting spread of the sexually transmitted HIV virus, Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Corps has 2,400 volunteers in Africa. With turnover,
5,000 are expected to receive AIDS training over the next three
years. In all, 7,000 volunteers are in 76 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS drive follows a Clinton administration declaration in
April that the global epidemic of the sexually transmitted disease
is a threat to U.S. national security -- a proclamation criticized
by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and some other
Republicans as a political move to appeal to ''certain groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With specialties that cut across every sector of society, ...
Peace Corps volunteers are in a unique position to impact AIDS from
every angle,'' Schneider told a crowd of Peace Corps and other
officials as well as 29 new volunteers headed for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no option for any organization working in development
other than to play a role in helping these countries confront the
HIV-AIDS crisis,'' Schneider said in an interview before the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS outpaces malaria and war fatalities as the leading cause of
deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Two-thirds of the 31 million
HIV-infected people live on the continent. The disease has killed
11 million Africans, 80 percent of total world AIDS deaths.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. concern for AIDS abroad has increased with intelligence
projections that the depth of the AIDS crisis correlates with the
likelihood of revolutionary wars, ethnic conflicts, genocide and
failure of partial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said Peace Corps volunteers can have a big influence
because they work with local communities and can spread their
expertise to hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Extra funding for the effort comes from the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation,
Schneider said.

<HEADLINE> 'Sopranos' creator is trying to deal with actress' death  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Livia Soprano, the manipulative matriarch of New
Jersey's fictional mob family, would have really enjoyed this: Even
in death, people are consumed by her.
</P>
<P>
   The writers of HBO's ''The Sopranos'' are trying to figure out
how to deal with the death of actress Nancy Marchand, who played
Livia. They have nearly nine months before new shows air.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marchand made no secret of her lung cancer before dying
June 18, series creator David Chase said the writers had only once
before talked about losing her but quickly changed the subject
because it was too unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, people have repeatedly come up to Chase and said,
''This is a problem for you, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   For while actor James Gandolfini, as Tony Soprano, is clearly
the star, Marchand's scenes were some of the most electric. The
relationship between Tony and his mother - the woman who tried to
have him whacked in the first season - is the emotional
underpinning of ''The Sopranos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One way or another, either through Livia's death or without
Livia's death, Tony Soprano has to get over his mother, which he
was doing,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusion of real life into fiction is an occasional
challenge for TV writers, most recently seen with Michael J. Fox's
exit from ''Spin City.'' Some series handle it more adroitly than
others.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's character, New York City Deputy Mayor Michael Flaherty,
took the fall for a political scandal and quit his job. Fox is
leaving the series because of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   When ''Cheers'' actor Nicholas Colasanto died suddenly in 1985,
so did his character, the bartender Coach. Actor Woody Harrelson
took his spot behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Conrad, who as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on ''Hill Street
Blues'' warned his officers, ''Let's be careful out there,''
continued in his role after contracting cancer, as did Jim Davis,
who was the patriarch Jock Ewing on ''Dallas.'' After their deaths,
the characters were killed and the shows went on.
</P>
<P>
   After Dick York left ''Bewitched'' because of illness in 1969,
actor Dick Sargent took over as Darrin and the series continued.

   ''What we will probably do is deal with what does one feel like
when a parent dies with whom you haven't had a good relationship,''
Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   A misconception held by many of the show's fans is that Marchand
limited her appearances during the second season because of her
cancer. Instead, Chase said, her appearances were limited by her
dark-hearted character's deeds: Tony understandably held a grudge
over the hit attempt and didn't want to have anything to do with
Livia.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said he actually wrote scenes superfluous to the plot this
past year just to get Marchand more air time. Livia was in police
custody in her final scene, picked up with stolen airline tickets
that Tony had given her.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Chase and his writers decide to deal with
Marchand's death, they will do their best to keep it a secret.
Chase would undoubtedly like the same look of surprise on viewers'
faces as Richie Aprile had when his girlfriend turned the gun on
him and fired.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain: It will mean the end for one of Tony's
favorite sayings about his mother, one that became a catchphrase:
''She's dead to me!''
</P>
<P>
   ''No, we can't use that line,'' Chase said. ''But that line will
come back to haunt him, I'm sure.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebel Attack Kills 2 Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Guerrillas firing homemade missiles
flattened a church and a police station and killed two officers in
an overnight attack on a small southern town, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other policemen were wounded, and a bank and several homes
were destroyed in the 12-hour siege of Algeciras, 162 miles from
the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ''They arrived, they entered (the town), and they destroyed
everything,'' one resident, fighting back tears, told a Colombian
television crew. The man, who said his house was commandeered by
rebels during the fighting, asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, retreated early Tuesday after air force fighters were called
in to repel the attack, military said.
</P>
<P>
   Algeciras is just 48 miles from San Vicente del Caguan, the hub
of a demilitarized zone about twice the size of New Jersey cleared
of government troops to facilitate peace talks with the FARC,
Colombia's largest rebel band.
</P>
<P>
   Regional army commander Col. Alberto Tamayo said FARC rebels
based in the peace zone carried out the attack on Algeciras.
</P>
<P>
   Peace negotiations to end the South American country's 36-year
conflict are going forward without a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of European delegates are expected to arrive in San
Vicente del Caguan on Thursday for a two-day conference hosted by
the government and the FARC on eradicating illegal drug crops.

<HEADLINE> House Expands Radiation Payments  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to expand a federal
program that pays up to $100,000 to people sickened by Cold War-era
uranium mining and nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   The bill adds to the list of cancers and other diseases that
make former miners or nuclear test ''downwinders'' eligible for
payments under the 1990 law. The measure also expands the sites
where miners and downwinders can seek compensation, and adds
open-pit uranium miners and those who transported or milled
uranium.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will provide compensation to about 9,600 people
''who lost their health and in many cases their lives working for
this country's nuclear defense program,'' said Rep. Chris Cannon,
R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as a nation owe these people what this bill allows for,''
he said before the House approved the bill on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure now goes to the White House for President Clinton's
signature. The Senate approved it in December.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the uranium used in nuclear weapons produced during the
Cold War was mined in the Four Corners area of Arizona, New Mexico,
Colorado and Utah, while above-ground nuclear tests were detonated
in New Mexico and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the 1990 law sought the enhancements, saying the
original law was too narrow and too many people with legitimate
claims were denied. As of March 1, the Justice Department had paid
3,302 claims worth $244 million and denied another 3,500 claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the changes would
cost about $750 million during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some former miners have said the latest bill isn't broad
enough because it does not increase the compensation amount, cover
miners who worked after 1971 or include all the illnesses miners
say radiation caused.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the bill would extend eligibility to uranium
workers from South Dakota, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon and Texas.
The current law covers Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming
and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions include:
</P>
<P>
   --Adding leukemia and cancers of the lung, thyroid, brain,
kidney, esophagus and stomach to the list of cancers that make
miners eligible for compensation. Kidney disease and two lung
ailments also would be added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   For downwinders -- people who lived in areas of Nevada, Utah and
Arizona most affected by nuclear fallout from tests -- the added
cancers include leukemia and those of the brain, bladder, colon,
ovaries and salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminating provisions that give less money to downwinders or
miners who smoked.
</P>
<P>
   --Cutting the average time a person had to work in uranium mines
from just under 20 years to less than four.
</P>
<P>
   -- Requiring the Justice Department to take American Indian law
and custom into account when processing applications. Navajo
officials have complained that widows of dead miners have been
denied compensation because they were married in traditional Indian
ceremonies and do not have marriage certificates.
</P>
<P>
   --Spending up to $20 million a year for community health centers
and state health departments to screen for claims.

<HEADLINE> Assemblyman renews pledge to fight beach fees  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Despite little support from his fellow
legislators, an assemblyman has renewed his pledge to fight beach
fees.
</P>
<P>
   This time Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Union, has an ally in
Philadelphia sports radio personality Angelo Cataldi, who is
challenging beach fees in court.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has been trying since 1997 to make all New Jersey beaches
free and raise public awareness of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even when the Soviet people were not free, their beaches
were,'' Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday. ''Access to the
shore area, whether it's the Bahamas, California, Cape Cod, North
Carolina, or South Carolina ... are free of charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's Environment Committee is reviewing two bills
sponsored by Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   One would prohibit towns from charging fees to beachgoers and
establish a $20 million fund for beach maintenance. The second
measure would create a 20-member commission to study beach access
issues.
</P>
<P>
   On the judicial end, WIP's Cataldi is fighting a ticket he
received last August on a beach in Avalon. He was with his
daughter, but only had one beach badge.
</P>
<P>
   The case is pending an appeal. Cataldi said he plans to
challenge the constitutionality of the state's beach fee system.
</P>
<P>
   If Cataldi is found guilty, he could be fined between $55 and
$1,000 or sentenced to three months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may not love me down there, but the fact of the matter is
that beach tags are wrong,'' said Cataldi, of Mount Laurel, who
recently bought a summer house in Sea Isle City.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also has proposed two constitutional amendments that have
garnered little support from other legislators.
</P>
<P>
   One would grant New Jersey residents free access to public
beaches, and the other would authorize a lottery system to fund the
cost of beach maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Although proposed measures over beach fees have languished in
the lower house, Cohen believes the issue will reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's something that will take a long time,'' Cohen
said. ''Ultimately, if this cannot be resolved by legislation, I
think there will be a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the right case, beach access is free. They are running
the risk by ignoring reasonable legislative actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1930s, when the state Legislature passed a law
allowing towns to charge beach fees, a growing number of resort
communities have chosen to charge visitors for the pleasure of
playing in the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials say the fees go toward specific beach expenses
such as police protection, trash removal and equipment maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the state's beach towns charge between $2 and $6 for
daily beach badges. Atlantic City and the Wildwoods charge no
admission, while Seaside Heights and Sea Isle City offer free
access on certain weekdays.

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects sheriff bid for restraining order on new law  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a
temporary restraining order seeking to block provisions of a new
state law that could lead to abolishment of the county sheriff
system.
</P>
<P>
   The state's eight high sheriffs argued in a lawsuit filed Monday
that the law passed in May by the General Assembly violates their
constitutional right to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits county sheriffs from soliciting contributions
from deputies, their immediate families or business associates, and
also takes away sheriff's power to hire and fire. The law puts the
future of the sheriff system in the hands of voters during a
November referendum.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments behind closed doors and then in open
court Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Alan H. Nevas rejected the
sheriffs' request for a temporary restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said cases dating back to 1876 show that Congress and
other governmental bodies prohibited government employees from
soliciting contributions for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the new law does prohibit the sheriffs from talking
about the referendum with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can speak out as much as they like about this issue,''
Nevas said.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for the sheriffs, George Springer Jr., called the
ruling ''devastating'' and said the law effectively stops the
sheriffs from speaking at all on the issue because their remarks
could indirectly result in contributions that could later be called
a violation of the law. He said the statute also does not define
what a business associate is, so sheriffs do not know who exactly
they are precluded from soliciting for donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute does not define what they can and cannot do, who
they can say it to and when they can say it,'' Springer said.
''It's a grotesque infringement of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who pushed for the law have criticized the sheriffs,
saying they have a history of strong-arming their deputies for
political contributions. The sheriffs vehemently deny those
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strong-arm? You can ask any of my deputies. I don't ask them
to ... do anything. They have their own minds in my county,'' said
Charles M. Valentino Sr., the high sheriff of Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've set it up so that we cannot engage in any meaningful
dialogue,'' said Walter J. Kupchunos Jr., the Hartford County high
sheriff. ''What they're basically saying is we're going to tie both
hands behind your back, we're going to tie up your legs, we're
going to put tape over your mouth, and go speak on the
referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the judge's ruling
''reaffirms the importance of letting the voters decide whether to
reform the sheriff system without undue influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The high sheriffs remain free to advocate for defeat of the
proposal at the polls because the statute simply and solely
prohibits their soliciting money from their staff, which in no way
violates their constitutional rights,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs are also seeking a preliminary injunction. A
hearing is scheduled for July 11 in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   If voters approve the ballot issue, the office of county sheriff
would be terminated and most of its duties would move to the
Judicial Branch.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff system is under investigation by Blumenthal. Two
sheriffs are facing criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Kimeses sentenced to life in prison for murder of elderly widow  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A scam artist and her son were sentenced on
Tuesday to more than 120 years to life in prison after being
convicted of the murder of an 82-year-old millionaire widow whose
body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Rena Uviller said the sentence for
Sante Kimes, 65, is ''just desserts'' for a life spent preying on
the ''weak,'' and is mitigated only by the fact that she will not
live to serve all of it.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence for Kenneth Kimes, 25, who first seemed to be ''a
vacuous dupe of his mother but is now a remorseless criminal,'' is
meant for his ''permanent incapacitation'' so that he is never free
again, Uviller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, Las Vegas residents who recall the mother and son
played by Anjelica Huston and John Cusack in the film, ''The
Grifters,'' were convicted May 18 on some 60 counts, including the
murder of Irene Silverman, 82.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti
said his office will begin extradition proceedings to bring the
Kimeses to California to stand trial for murder this week. The
Kimeses have been indicted in Los Angeles for the 1998 murder of a
business associate of theirs, David Kazdin, 63.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors - there were four in the New York case - said the
Kimeses killed Silverman, a former Radio City Music Hall dancer and
widow of a real estate millionaire, in their scheme to steal her $7
million six-story home.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, who had rented a first-floor apartment in
Silverman's Beaux Arts mansion on Manhattan's East 65th Street on
June 14, were arrested on July 5, 1998, on unrelated charges
involving an allegedly stolen car, the last day Silverman was seen
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney John Carter said that at some point
that morning, with the house empty, Kenneth Kimes had pulled
Silverman into his apartment and strangled her.
</P>
<P>
   ''What terror she have felt,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said the Kimeses ''packaged'' Silverman in
garbage bags, put her into the trunk of their green 1997 Lincoln
Town Car, and between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. disposed of her body
in a place only they know.
</P>
<P>
   When police searched the Kimeses' car and luggage, they found
guns, a knockout liquid, plastic handcuffs, fright masks, syringes,
tapes of Silverman's telephone conversations and a fake deed to
Silverman's home.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Kimeses' crimes and Mrs. Kimes' convictions, Carter
said the two are suspected in other murders, called them serial
killers and told the court, ''She'll never change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's almost 66 years old,'' Carter said. ''She will continue
to cheat and steal, and kill anyone who stands between her and her
goals. She is so incorrigible she should get the maximum
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge called the Kimeses ''the most degenerate defendants to
ever appear in this courtroom,'' and said Mrs. Kimes' continuing
protestations of innocence were as fake as any bad check she had
ever passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes as no surprise that she is one of the rare people in
this century to be convicted of slavery,'' Uviller said. The judge
was referring to Mrs. Kimes' 1986 conviction for illegally
transporting and keeping young Mexican girls as prisoners and
household slaves in her Las Vegas home.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses made a mistake by overrating their own cleverness,
Uviller said. Referring to Mrs. Kimes' notebook diaries that jurors
said helped them vote to convict, the judge said she could think of
nothing as ''staggeringly stupid'' as Mrs. Kimes writing out the
steps of a crime she was planning.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes, given the chance to speak, told Uviller that she was
rich, that she was a friend of Silvermanf03029k588

<HEADLINE> Little Progress In Kurdsish S.East  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) -- Youths crowd internet cafes and
couples take romantic, late-night walks in the streets of the
overwhelmingly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, once the site of
gunbattles and firebombings.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan ordered a cease-fire
from his prison cell, there has been little fighting in the largely
Kurdish areas of southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But as Turkey marks the first anniversary of a court's June 29
death sentence against Ocalan, there also has been little
reconciliation between Kurds who demand increased cultural freedoms
and a government that fears Kurdish nationalism could lead to the
collapse of a unified state.
</P>
<P>
   After defeating the rebels on the battlefield and later
abducting their leader from Kenya, where he had fled, the Turkish
government seems satisfied with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this nationalist government would make any
concessions to the Kurds at this stage,'' said Huseyin Bagci, a
political analyst at Ankara's Middle Eastern Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Diyarbakir there is anger, but also exhaustion
from the war which left hundreds of thousands of Kurds homeless.
Some 37,000 people died in 15 years of fighting, most of them
Kurdish civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am fed up with the tension,'' said Faruk Tuzger, a
22-year-old welder. ''Neither the government nor the politicians
are doing anything for us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Kurdish politicians swept to power in local elections last
year, but the central government has slowed down funding to the
municipalities, leaving the mayors largely powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading members of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy
Party or HADEP, have been detained by police, some for days.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's tough stand and its refusal to grant Kurds cultural
freedoms, such as the right to teach or broadcast in Kurdish, is
not only likely to keep tensions high in the region, but could also
frustrate the country's efforts to gain membership in the European
Union. The group has demanded that Turkey improve its human rights
record before it can become a full member.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of giving minority status to citizens of Kurdish
origin, the implementation of all rights given to Turkish citizens
is enough,'' Turkey's all powerful National Security Council said
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turkey grants Jews, Armenians and Greeks minority
rights, it considers all Muslims living within the country to be
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not consider Kurds a separate entity. After so many
generations it is difficult to differentiate a Turk from a Kurd,''
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said during a visit to Norway early
June.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's rebels, who have demanded autonomy in the southeast,
now say they will try to press for increased cultural rights using
political means, a move that Turkey has already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who have given up hopes for armed separatism will not
achieve political separatism,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ocalan waits on death row in an island prison.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament must approve his execution before he can be hanged,
but legislators say they will wait for the results of an appeal to
the European Court of Human Rights before taking any action. The
appeal could take at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   And while the politics remain deadlocked, signs of tensions lurk
beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   When a Kurdish businessman greeted Ecevit in Kurdish during a
recent visit to Diyarbakir, the premier smiled bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kurdish is my mother tongue,'' said Ramazan Ore, a fruit
merchant who was selling black mulberries. ''I want it to be
freed.''

<HEADLINE> Brother of police officer convicted of bank robbery accused of perjury </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The brother of a police officer convicted of
the gunpoint holdup of a bank in his own district was indicted
Tuesday on charges he lied during the officer's trial and to a
grand jury about $3,500 found at his residence.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Michael Spinello was offered to bolster Officer
Robert Spinello's alibi that the money was the remainder of casino
winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintained that the money found by investigators
just hours after the robbery was the exact amount - in identical
denominations - as that taken from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spinello, 27, of San Francisco, lived in an Edison
condominium owned by his brother at the time of the robbery, Jan.
13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He testified to a federal grand jury in September 1999, and
during the trial in May that he put the $3,500 in an end table, and
that the money was from the officer's gambling winnings.
</P>
<P>
   The cash was in the same denominations as the money taken from
the bank, trial testimony revealed: $1,000 in $100 bills, $1,000 in
$50 bills, $1,000 in $20 bills, and $500 in $10 bills.
</P>
<P>
   The defense said the money was from Caesars in Atlantic City,
but prosecutor's called a casino manager who testified winnings
like that would not be paid with $20 bills and $10 bills, U.S.
Attorney Robert J. Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary, the ranking federal law officer in the state, tried the
case. He maintained that Spinello turned to robbery amid
desperation over debts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spinello was not arrested. He is to enter a plea before
a federal judge here within two weeks. That arraignment has not yet
been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   He faces four counts of perjury, each of which carry up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine, although the actual penalties
would be far less, under federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Kevin H. Marino, said he could not comment since he
had not yet seen the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spinello was fired and placed in federal custody after
his May 17 conviction, awaiting sentencing Sept. 6 by U.S. District
Judge Joseph A. Greenaway Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Spinello, 32, of Brick, Ocean County, did not testify during the
nine-day trial. His lawyer told the jury that the 11-year officer
was the victim of ''an unfortunate series of coincidences,''
including mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   He was found guilty on all three charges he faced - bank
robbery, armed bank robbery and using a gun during a crime -
following about six hours of deliberations over two days.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge, armed bank robbery, carries up to 25
years in prison, although under sentencing guidelines, the actual
term would be about four years. Combined with a five-year mandatory
consecutive term on the gun charge, he faces about nine years
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Spinello was arrested shortly after he reported to work Jan. 13,
1999, about an hour after a man not wearing a mask showed a teller
at the First Savings Bank in Edison a revolver and fled with
$3,500.
</P>
<P>
   His trial lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg, did not immediately
return a call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette companies win state's first tobacco-liability trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn jury sided with Big Tobacco on
Tuesday, finding that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and other cigarette
makers are not liable for a smoker's lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury voted 5-1 in favor of the defendants to
conclude the state's first tobacco-liability trial. Similar legal
battles have been fought in at least a half dozen other states.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month trial pitted Clyde Anderson, 56, a laborer with
lung cancer, against five cigarette producers. In a lawsuit,
Anderson said he mainly smoked R.J. Reynolds' Salems for 33 years
before being diagnosed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff alleged that before 1969 - when Congress made
cigarette makers put warning labels on their product - the
defendants suppressed information about the dangers of smoking. His
suit also claimed that after 1969 the industry should have produced
safer cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kaczynski, an attorney for R.J. Reynolds, said the
verdict shows the jury believed defense arguments that Anderson was
aware of the health risks - and chose to smoke anyway. The defense
has also pointed out that he had been exposed to toxic substances
as part of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's attorney, Leonard Finz, did not immediately return a
call for comment.

<HEADLINE> Marines: Osprey Has Deficiencies  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps on Tuesday acknowledged 23
''deficiencies'' in its MV-22 Osprey, but said it is confident they
can be fixed before the Pentagon decides whether to enter
full-scale production of the hybrid aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The shortcomings were publicly identified last year and the
Navy's director of air warfare granted waivers to allow the Osprey
to enter a phase of development called operational evaluation
before the corrections were made, Marine spokeswoman Capt. Aisha M.
Bakkar-Poe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''None (of the deficiencies) are anything that would have any
effect at all on the combat effectiveness of the aircraft,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to enter full-scale production of the
Osprey is scheduled for late this year. The Marines hope to field
their first squadron of Ospreys in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the 23 deficiencies are
cited in a draft of a Pentagon inspector general report. Bacon said
he discussed the issue Tuesday with the head of Marine Corps
aviation, Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, who told Bacon that none of the
23 problems are safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle also said there is no connection between the
deficiencies and the April 8 Osprey crash that killed 19 Marines.
That accident investigation is not finished, but it is expected to
cite pilot error rather than mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey crashed while participating in a simulated rescue
operation as part of an evaluation of the aircraft's effectiveness
in Marine Corps missions. That evaluation has resumed and is
expected to be completed this summer, Bacon said. Afterward the
decision will be made on entering full-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deficiencies cited by the Pentagon's inspector general
is the absence of defensive weapons on the Osprey, Bacon said. He
said the Marines are installing defensive weapons on it but are
behind schedule because Congress withheld money for that work.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem: it takes too long to fold up the Osprey's wings
after landing on a carrier. That and all the other shortcomings are
being addressed, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon declined to release the inspector general's report
because it is not yet complete. Bakkar-Poe, the Marine spokeswoman,
said the final report is expected by late July.
</P>
<P>
   Critics question whether the Osprey is safe and worth the $36
billion price tag. The Marines consider it crucial to their future
because it is intended to replace their aging fleet of
troop-carrying helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey, which takes off and lands like a helicopter but
flies like an airplane, is manufactured by Boeing Co. and Bell
Helicopters Textron. The Marines plan to buy 360 Ospreys, the Navy
48 and the Air Force 50.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Caught In Tax Trap  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Simply because they live in a high-tax state
or claim numerous deductions, thousands of middle-class Americans
are paying a special tax originally designed to prevent investors
and the wealthy from sheltering too much income.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says 828,000 taxpayers were caught in the tax trap in
1998 -- a 25 percent increase over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are expected to go nowhere but up, mainly because
the alternative minimum tax was never indexed for inflation. As
incomes continue to rise and Congress gives people more deductions
and credits, more and more taxpayers will be forced to pay this
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's catching people it was never intended to catch,'' said
Hank Gutman, a partner in the Washington office of the KPMG
accounting firm. ''It's making people go through a lot of
complexity and they don't even understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative minimum tax is essentially a parallel income tax
system created in 1969 to ensure that the wealthy and corporations
could not entirely escape taxes through legal means. Income is
taxed at up to 28 percent, and numerous deductions and credits --
including those for state income taxes and unreimbursed employee
business expenses -- are either not allowed or have greatly reduced
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service figures released Tuesday show that
about 480,000 taxpayers paid $2.8 billion in minimum taxes in 1996.
A year later, the number of taxpayers affected jumped to 618,000
who paid just over $4 billion -- a 42 percent increase -- followed by
another increase to $4.4 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There is also further evidence that the minimum tax is reaching
more middle-income families. For example, in 1996 about 59,000
taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $75,000 and $100,000
were subject to the tax. A year later, that number had grown to
almost 86,700 taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows once and for all that when taxes are meant to soak
the rich, it's usually the middle class that gets wet,'' said Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Such taxpayers pay the bottom 15 percent income tax on a great
portion of their earnings and can take a broad range of deductions
under the ordinary tax system. Under the alternative system, they
must pay a flat tax of either 26 percent or 28 percent and cannot
enjoy many of those same deductions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really does seem to take more than its share of a bite,''
said Maggie Doedtman, a senior tax research specialist at tax
preparer H&AMP;R Block. ''Something that wasn't ever designed to hurt
John Q. Individual is now doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more people would probably be forced to pay the
minimum tax, particularly those with large families living in
high-tax states, if Congress and President Clinton had not agreed
to ensure that breaks such as the $500 per-child tax credit would
not trigger the special tax. That protection is temporary, however;
the current exemptions run only through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned about that,'' said Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Roth and other GOP leaders tried last year to begin repealing
the minimum tax as part of a larger tax cut bill, but it was vetoed
by Clinton. Yet the president's on IRS taxpayer advocate, Val
Oveson, recommended earlier this year that it be phased out and
called it ''unnecessarily complex and burdensome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Often, the way many individuals first hear of the alternative
minimum tax is when they receive a notice from the IRS,'' Oveson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing federal budget surpluses, the sheer cost of
repeal -- estimated last year at more than $80 billion over 10 years
-- gives many lawmakers pause. Clinton this year proposed gradually
making certain that all personal exemptions could be deducted
without triggering the tax and ensure that taxpayers could take the
standard deduction under the minimum tax instead of being forced to
itemize.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, however, has largely ignored that 10-year, $33 billion
plan, mainly because the minimum tax will be kept away from most
middle-class families until after 2001 under current law.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have taken some of the pressure off, but all of these are
sort of band-aids,'' said KPMG's Gutman. ''The real question is,
why do we have this thing today?''

<HEADLINE> Prisoner escapes from hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A prisoner pretending he was suffering from
seizures was taken to a hospital where he escaped from several
correction officers guarding him early Tuesday morning, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued their search for Jamal Hightower, 24, of the
Bronx. Hightower had been jailed on Rikers Island for attempted
murder and robbery charges stemming from an April shootout with
police.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower complained he was having seizures and was taken from
Rikers Island to Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, police said.
Shortly after 6 a.m., he managed to run past several correction
officers, who could not catch him. He was wearing a white T-shirt,
blue jeans and sneakers at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower was jailed after he allegedly tried to buy drugs in
the Bronx, but ended up in a fight and allegedly stabbed a man on
April 30.
</P>
<P>
   The victim pulled out a gun and Hightower grabbed it and fled.
Police began to chase him and Hightower and the police officers got
into a gun battle. A bystander was shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower managed to flee from police and ended up at the
Fordham Road Metro-North Station where police said he took a woman
hostage and shot at police officers, who fired back. Hightower
released the hostage, ran onto the train tracks and was captured.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 39; Nasdaq Falls 53  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors lost their nerve on the eve of the
Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates, sending key stock
indexes lower Tuesday in a late-afternoon selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had been modestly higher for most of the session as
investors speculated that the Fed will leave interest rates
unchanged Wednesday. But investors remained uncertain and restless,
shifting money from sector to sector without much conviction about
the underlying strength of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, stocks slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fear of higher interest rates is putting some pressure on the
market and causing it to be very, very selective,'' said Mark T.
Minervini, president of Quantech Research Group in New York. ''We
want the market to be working on all cylinders and right now that's
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.53 points to close at
10,504.46.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 4.76 at 1,450.55, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 53.16 at 3,858.96.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were demonstrating some cautious
optimism, evidenced by the fact that more stocks were rising than
falling. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues
outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors kept their eyes on Washington, where Fed
policy-makers gathered Tuesday to begin discussing interest rates.
Central bankers were scheduled to announce their decision Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the past year,
but many economists expect the central bank to stand pat this week
because the economy has shown signs of slowing from its former
breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interest rate increases by the Fed are starting to bite,''
said Joseph T. Keating, chief investment officer at the Kent Funds
in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''But the economy isn't falling apart. We'll
still have growth -- just at a slower pace.''
</P>
<P>
   A muted report on consumer confidence provided the latest sign
that the Fed's long course of rate increases may be slowing the
economy enough to keep inflation at bay. The Conference Board said
its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 138.8 in June from a revised
144.7 in May as higher rates and soaring gas prices pressured the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Fed tightened credit to cool growth to a more sustainable
pace, investors have started shifting money from sector to sector
as they debated which stocks will perform best in a slowing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, drug stocks and consumer goods companies were leading
the market higher. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose $2.375 to $97.875 and 3M
rose $1.375 to $86.875.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those groups were merely the sectors du jour, Minervini
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen any sign that we've established leadership,''
he said. ''There's nothing you can sink your teeth into.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell $4.656 to $109.75 after a Merrill Lynch analyst said he
expects second-quarter revenue to be ''mediocre'' compared with the
year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, semiconductor stocks, among the best performers in recent
weeks, fell as investors took profits. JDS Uniphase fell $6.625 to
$119 and Rambus fell $8.734 to $108.641.
</P>
<P>
   Trading activity was quiet, but not as anemic as some analysts
had expected on the day ahead of the Fed's decision. NYSE composite
volume came to 1.25 billion shares, compared with 1.08 billion on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are starting to put some money back to work,'' Keating
said. ''A good deal of cash built up on the sidelines while volume
tapered off in the past couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that some buying and selling was due to
end-of-the-quarter reshuffling of portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.28 to 508.08.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.1 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.5
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> FDA Meets On Lotronex Bowel Drug  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixteen women suffered serious intestinal side
effects -- some requiring surgery -- after using a treatment for
irritable bowel syndrome that has been on the market for only four
months, federal health officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's unprecedented public debate about the safety of
Lotronex, a long-awaited treatment, signals the Food and Drug
Administration's concern goes far beyond this one medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by a spate of drugs banned in part because doctors
disregarded or never even read safety warnings, the FDA has begun a
new initiative to swiftly counter side effects of newly approved
drugs -- especially when the risk may be caused by improper
prescribing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of Lotronex's side effects appear to have been
caused because doctors gave the drug to women who shouldn't have
taken it.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the FDA often has assumed that putting safety
warnings in the fine print of a drug's label was enough unless
large numbers of patients were injured or someone died.
</P>
<P>
   No more, declared Dr. Florence Houn, FDA's chief of
gastrointestinal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, the FDA convened its scientific advisers
to debate Lotronex's risks even though just a handful of some
100,000 users have reported serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Critics might ask ''isn't the government jumping the gun?'' Houn
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But ''it's in everyone's interest'' to address risks early, she
added. ''We need to create a new culture about safe drug use.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s Lotronex is the first new therapy in
decades for irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. The mysterious
intestinal disorder affects up to 15 percent of the U.S.
population, mostly women.
</P>
<P>
   IBS involves chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, the sudden and
urgent need to go to the bathroom, and either frequent diarrhea or
constipation or both.
</P>
<P>
   Lotronex is only for women with diarrhea-predominant IBS,
offering modest relief of their illness. It does not work for men.
And it is not supposed to be used by constipated women, because it
can worsen that symptom.
</P>
<P>
   Since the drug's approval on Feb. 9, seven users developed
serious constipation, six so severe they were hospitalized. Three
required surgery, including one woman who had her entire colon
removed. Some had been prescribed Lotronex even though they had a
history of constipation problems.
</P>
<P>
   In premarket testing of Lotronex, 27 percent of users suffered
constipation, but none considered truly serious.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 13 Lotronex users have suffered ischemic colitis, a
potentially life-threatening inflammation of the large intestine.
Four cases occurred during premarket testing, and an additional
nine have occurred since February. So far, patients have recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo insisted Lotronex is a big help when properly prescribed,
and said it's not nearly risky enough to warrant bearing FDA's
strongest safety warning. Instead, Glaxo plans a special campaign
to ensure Americans and their doctors know how to use Lotronex
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Among the plans are physician education and patient leaflets
explaining side effects and clearly outlining who should avoid the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   But a drug maker can only do so much, cautioned Glaxo chief
medical officer Richard Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot sit in the physician's office with a patient and say
... you are a sloppy, uncaring physician'' who didn't warn about
side effects or gave Lotronex to the wrong woman, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's scientific advisers didn't vote Tuesday on what safety
steps Glaxo should take, but called clearly worded warnings made
directly to patients as imperative as educating doctors.

<HEADLINE> Claritin Patent Extension Opposed  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers renewed
efforts Tuesday to block a patent extension for the allergy drug
Claritin, fearing that supporters will try to add the provision to
one of the spending bills now moving through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are sick and tired of this kind of wheeling and
dealing,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ''Who in the world are
we representing? The pharmaceutical companies that are making
obscene profits off the misery, illness and sickness of people? Or
are we representing the people back in our states?''
</P>
<P>
   Claritin now sells for up to $2.66 per tablet, a price so high
some health insurance companies have stopped paying for it. The
expiration of the patent would allow cheaper, generic versions of
the drug to be developed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Schering-Plough, which makes Claritin, has sought
legislation that would allow it to seek a three-year extension of
its patent, scheduled to expire in 2002. Supporters of the
provision have tried to add it to one of the must-pass spending
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a supporter of
the extension, acknowledged that a draft with his name on it had
been circulated on Capitol Hill. But he said his staff had drafted
the provision without his knowledge or instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone is attempting to attach such legislation to an
appropriations bill, it is not me,'' said Hatch, who made use of
Schering-Plough's private jet during his presidential campaign last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The issue grew out of a 1984 bill, when Congress extended the
patents of future drugs by five years in recognition of the lengthy
approval process by the Food and Drug Administration. Drugs already
being reviewed by the FDA, like Claritin, got two-year extensions.
Because Claritin wasn't approved for another nine years,
Schering-Plough has argued that it should be allowed to seek an
additional three-year extension of its patent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a matter of Schering-Plough asking that they be given
an opportunity to have their day in court to prove they should be
treated like other drug companies who were granted a five-year
patent extension, instead of a two-year extension,'' said Linda
Daschle, a Schering-Plough lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle is married to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota. To avoid any conflict, she is lobbying only the
House, not the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another senator opposing the extension, Republican Jim Jeffords
of Vermont, said drug companies can't argue they don't want any
government interference, and then ask the government to extend
their patents.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't have it both ways,'' said Jeffords, who chairs the
Senate Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The group of lawmakers also criticized Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.,
for inserting a provision into an agriculture spending bill to help
Columbia University -- his alma mater -- win a patent extension on a
process for making some widely sold biotechnology drugs. The
patent, which nets Columbia up to $100 million a year in royalties
from companies using the procedure, is set to expire in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''These provisions are simply a giveaway by Congress to
patent-holders who don't deserve them,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.

   WASHINGTON -- A majority of Americans who smoke want to quit but
get little help from their doctors, who often don't even ask
whether they smoke or offer treatments, according to a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the U.S. Public Health Service urges physicians to
aggressively treat smoking just like any other chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which summarizes new guidelines for getting people
to quit, said spending as little as 3 minutes talking to patients
about their smoking habit can dramatically raise the chance that
patients will eventually quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''A doctor isn't providing an appropriate standard of care for
his or her patients if he or she doesn't ask two key questions --
'Do you smoke?' and 'Do you want to quit?' -- and then work with
that individual to make it happen,'' said Dr. Michael Fiore, a
tobacco researcher at the University of Wisconsin Medical School
who headed a panel of private and public health officials that
created the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association said the report was a wakeup
call for doctors, who need to do a better job treating smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to with every one of our patients inquire whether they
are a smoker and spend some time with them to get them to be
ex-smokers,'' said Corlin. ''Doctors have a duty to deal with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiore said that 70 percent of the 50 million Americans who smoke
have tried to quit at least once. Over 20 million Americans will
try to kick the habit this year. Most will go cold turkey and only
a million will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, which will go out to doctors, health clinics,
hospitals and health plans, urge physicians to treat smoking no
differently than other chronic disease such as diabetes and
hypertension. They should prescribe nicotine gums, inhalers or
patches and refer smokers for counseling. The combination of
medicine and counseling -- especially frequent counseling -- is
highly effective in getting people to quit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   If doctors, nurses and other clinicians followed the guidelines,
the number of people who quit annually would double to 2 million,
said Fiore.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the new guidelines ''an important tool
to help...patients quit using tobacco products,'' and ordered
federal agencies to use the new guidelines in updating their
tobacco cessation programs.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also urged health insurance companies and
government health programs to pay for tobacco cessation treatments
and counseling. Only about half of all insurers currently do so;
Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, doesn't cover
anti-smoking treatments and only 22 states provided Medicaid
coverage for tobacco dependence treatments. Medicaid is a
state-federal health program for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore said it only costs between $200 and $400 for patients to
get a medication and one or two counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of Americans are in health plans sponsored by
their employers. Managed care officials say that the decision to
cover tobacco cessation programs is up to employers since they will
have to pay for the programs or pass the costs on to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We emphasize prevention but we don't decide what to pay for --
the employers do,'' said Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents health maintenance
organizations.

<HEADLINE> House Votes On Women's Violence Act  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Judiciary Committee has voted to
reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act but rejected efforts to
overturn the Supreme Court decision banning rape victims from suing
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats pushed for the amendment to the domestic
violence law Tuesday, which in part renews funding for domestic
violence programs established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court last month struck down the part of the law
allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court.
States, not Congress, should provide such help for victims of
violence, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by ranking Democrat Rep. John Conyers of
Michigan, say rape victims deserve that right. ''There is a great
need to repair what the Supreme Court has torn asunder,'' said Rep.
Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   However, each attempt to add it back into the law was blocked by
Rep. Bill McCullom, R-Fla., who had it ruled non-germane to the
bill. In addition, ''it is highly improbable what you have drafted
is constitutional,'' said McCullom, chairman of the Judiciary crime
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers even tried to get through an amendment to allow
unlimited authority for those victims to sue in state court in its
place, but McCullom defeated it on a technical maneuver as well.
''It did not mean I was opposed to the concepts,'' McCullom said
later, ''they were just not germane to the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Before passing the bill, the committee did add amendments to
create a task force to coordinate domestic violence research,
target funds for disabled women, have the Justice Department create
a national standard for rape kits and genetic sampling and adding
domestic violence records to electronic records checked for gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The full House will consider the bill next. A similar bill could
be considered in the Senate Judiciary Committee as early as this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says the rate at which women were
attacked by ''intimate partners'' -- current or former spouses,
boyfriends, girlfriends or partners -- dropped 21 percent during the
mid-1990s. Attorney General Janet Reno and the sponsors of the 1994
legislation credited VAWA for the decrease.

<HEADLINE> No Chest Pain in Many Heart Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Debunking a medical myth, a nationwide study of
434,877 heart attack victims found that a surprising one-third of
them showed up at the hospital without chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   Such patients were more than twice as likely to die, in part
because they delayed going to the hospital and because doctors
failed to diagnose them quickly, according to the study in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Women, nonwhites, people older than 75 and those with previous
heart failure, stroke or diabetes were most likely to have
''painless'' heart attacks, as previous research has shown.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long known about painless heart attacks. But the
researchers and experts not involved in the study said the
magnitude of the problem is greater than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirty-three percent is a huge bunch,'' said Dr. Lynn Smaha,
president of the American Heart Association. ''I didn't know it was
that large.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. John G. Canto of the University of
Alabama at Birmingham, said the findings should alert doctors and
paramedics to the need for rapid diagnosis and treatment of
patients in the high-risk groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other less typical symptoms can include shortness of breath,
irregular heartbeat, nervousness, nausea, fainting or overwhelming
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks strike an estimated 1.1 million Americans each
year, killing more than 40 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers analyzed 1994-98 data from a national registry
of heart attack patients at 1,674 hospitals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Among patients without chest pain, 23 percent died in the
hospital, compared with 9 percent of those with the classic
symptom.
</P>
<P>
   Study participants without chest pain delayed going to the
hospital by about two hours more than those with pain, probably
because they didn't realize they were having a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with chest pain were more than twice as likely to be
diagnosed upon admission and to get either clot-busting drugs or
angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped catheter is used to open
blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack occurs when a blood clot forms in an artery
narrowed by fatty deposits, cutting off the flow of blood and
oxygen to the heart. The process generally takes about six hours,
so the sooner the blocked artery can be opened, the better.

<HEADLINE> GOP: China Trade Hurdle Removed  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday said they
had resolved the biggest obstacle to Senate progress on legislation
to grant permanent favorable trade status to China.
</P>
<P>
   But the chamber's top Democrat, Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
later demanded that the GOP leadership also set a ''date certain''
in July for action on the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., announced jointly that the Senate would vote separately
next month on legislation to penalize China for contributing to
weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Thompson, the sponsor of that measure, agreed not
to pursue it as an amendment to the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and other China-trade bill supporters
feared the Senate would adopt Thompson's proposal if offered as an
amendment -- and that it could torpedo the underlying trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he planned to bring up the Thompson measure on July
10, the first day after the Senate returns from its weeklong Fourth
of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   He said he still planned to bring up the larger China-trade bill
before Congress recesses for the political conventions in August.
''It is my hope that we'll do it in July and that is my
intention,'' Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott said he was still unable to announce a date for the
China trade vote. He said there was still important spending bills
that had to be done first.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, D-S.D., who has suggested that delaying the China trade
bill until September would be fatal to it, hinted he might not go
along with plans for a separate vote on the Thompson measure unless
Lott also announces a July date for the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lott sets such a date, ''I am not at all opposed to
moving this (Thompson) legislation,'' despite wide Democratic
opposition to it, Daschle told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors hope to keep the China trade bill free of amendments --
so that it won't have to go back to the House. The House passed the
legislation in May after a bruising fight and over strong
objections of organized labor, and sponsors don't want to have to
refight the battle again in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson proposal would set up a process for monitoring
Chinese compliance with international weapons nonproliferation
agreements. It would require U.S. economic sanctions to be imposed
on the Chinese government or Chinese companies found to be in
violation.
</P>
<P>
   It has significant support in the Senate. Lott, for instance, is
a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House strongly opposes the Thompson measure.However,
Thompson told reporters that he had offered to modify it to meet
some of the administration's objections and ''I have not heard back
from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill itself would grant China so-called
permanent normal trade relations, allowing it the same low-tariff
access to U.S. markets that nearly every other country in the world
already has.
</P>
<P>
   China is one of a dwindling handful of communist countries that
must have its trade status reviewed and renewed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a top priority of President Clinton's final year,
would also allow U.S. companies to take full advantage of
market-opening concessions China made in its bid to join the World
Trade Organization, the Geneva based body that sets rules for world
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Chain-reaction crash triggers questions about police pursuit  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The city's black leaders, mindful of the
death of a young man by East Haven police three years ago, are
questioning the Hamden police department's role in a chain-reaction
crash that injured 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses to Monday evening's chaotic crash report that the
Hamden police were chasing a suspect in a sport utility vehicle
down Dixwell Avenue, a mostly residential street in a main
thoroughfare between Hamden and New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Hamden Police Chief Robert Nolan said Tuesday he does not
believe there was a high-speed pursuit. Nolan said other witnesses
reported there was no chase.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police Major Crime Squad and the New Haven state's
attorney's office are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility vehicle hit eight cars in its wild ride down
the street. Fifteen people, including four children and the
suspect, were injured and sent to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Anderson, 29, of New Haven, was arraigned in Meriden
Superior Court Tuesday on charges of reckless endangerment, evading
responsibility for an accident, operating a car with a suspended
license and failure to obey a stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from New Haven and Hamden said they were flooded with
telephone calls and visits from people who witnessed the crashes
and the arrest of Anderson by Hamden police.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday with political and police leaders
from both municipalities, some ministers questioned the right
Hamden police have to pursue and arrest a suspect in New Haven.
Some said they doubted a white suspect would have been treated the
same way as Anderson, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   ''My question is, 'Would they chase a 27-year-old European for
whatever reason?' and my answer is no, because of the issues that
have been happening in our community,'' said the Rev. W. David Lee,
pastor of Varick Memorial AME Zion Church in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said that pursuing suspects on the basis of race is not
tolerated and that he would fire any officer who engaged in racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donald Morris of Wayfaring Ministries in Hamden said
the incident reminded him of the death of Malik Jones, a black New
Haven man who was shot and killed in 1997 by a white East Haven
police officer following a pursuit. An investigation found that the
shooting was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners are looking for answers about why Hamden police
were allowed to pursue and arrest someone in New Haven, Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are very angry, very hurt,'' he said. ''It's a blessing
no one was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   New Haven Police Chief Melvin Wearing said it is commonplace for
police from one town to make an arrest in another town for an
incident that occurred in their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   A high-speed pursuit, however, is a different story, Wearing
said, since pursuits are not permitted in New Haven for minor
offenses. He deferred to the state police investigation to
determine if the Hamden officer was chasing Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The offending car was traveling at a high rate of speed. If
they were pursuing, I don't know,'' Wearing said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio communications showed that Officer Stephen DeGrand was not
engaged in a high-speed pursuit, Nolan said. He said the officer
called headquarters to let them know the suspect was going into New
Haven, so that New Haven police would be notified. Wearing said he
did not know if the notification was made.
</P>
<P>
   DeGrand began following Anderson after police say Anderson
nearly hit DeGrand's cruiser. As DeGrand followed Anderson, a
police received a report of a hit-and-run crash in Hamden,
reportedly involving Anderson's car.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Wilson, 36, said he had just parked his car along
Dixwell Avenue in New Haven when he saw a truck flip over in the
road in front of him. It had hit a car, which ran into his car and
caused his car to bump into another car.
</P>
<P>
   The police cruiser came to a stop behind him, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have no siren on or nothing,'' said Wilson, who
estimated the speeding sport utility vehicle was going 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should have turned that fellow loose and waited for backup.
Somebody could have been killed,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven emergency medical technician Myron Oliver was called
to help Wilson and others who were injured in the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very chaotic - the magnitude of the debris and cars and
the number of injuries,'' Oliver said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Jews Hurt by Beatification  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- At a seminar on Pope Pius IX, a woman stood from the
audience and introduced herself: Elena Mortara, great-great-niece
of a Bolognese Jew who was forcibly baptized as a toddler and then
taken from his family to be virtually adopted by the 19th-century
pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pius IX is due to be beatified Sept. 3, and Elena Mortara
said she hoped that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been damaged by this,'' she told the seminar Tuesday,
referring to the forced conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Jewish leaders said the beatification -- which advances
Pius on the path to sainthood -- threatens to harm two decades of
efforts by Pope John Paul II to improve Vatican relations with
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Mortara case ''is the biggest wound that remains in the
Italian Jewish world .... that still hasn't scarred over'' after
more than 150 years, said Amos Luzzatto, president of the Union of
Italian Jewish Communities. His organization and a historical
society were hosts of the seminar, which examined Pope Pius IX's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Mortara was baptized secretly when he was 2 years old by
a housemaid worried about his soul when he had a high fever. When
he was 6 he was snatched away from his parents by papal police in
1858 and brought to Rome, where Pius IX took him under his wing.
The boy later entered a seminary and became a priest.
</P>
<P>
   B'nai B'rith International's president, Richard D. Heideman, has
expressed dismay in a letter to the head of the Vatican
congregation that handles the process toward sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the Jewish perspective, Pius IX was the pope who
countenanced the abduction of a 6-year-old Jewish child and his
conversion -- obviously against the will of this family -- to
Catholicism,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews are already upset by John Paul's defense of another
Pius, Pius XII, who is a candidate for beatification and who Jews
and others allege didn't use his moral authority enough to save
Jews during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet John Paul has won widespread admiration from Jews for his
efforts at healing centuries-old wounds between Catholics and Jews,
including his groundbreaking trip this year to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Mortara, who recalled that her father used to talk with
Edgardo before the latter's death in 1940, said the Jewish
community is ''embarrassed'' to intervene in the beatification
process, she cannot help but protest her ancestor's forced
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Jewish leader Luzzatto said the Pius IX beatification
will ''leave in us a bitterness'' that will affect Jewish-Vatican
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Carlo Liberati, a Vatican official involved in the
process leading to Pius IX's beatification, said Catholics have the
duty to try to ''send to paradise'' the soul of an unbaptized child
in danger of dying.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were Pius IX, I would have baptized him too,'' Liberati
said of the Mortara boy. He criticized opponents of the
beatification for what he said was ''using today's mentality to
judge the facts of 150 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberati, in a telephone interview, said Edgardo Mortara
deposited testimony on behalf of Pius IX's beatification.
</P>
<P>
   Pius IX's pontificate, from 1846 to 1878, was the longest in
history.

<HEADLINE> Florio to assist Gore on energy, environment  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Gov. Jim Florio, who lost his bid for
the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, will work with Al Gore's
presidential campaign as an adviser on energy and environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he hopes to help refine and ultimately implement the
energy plan that the vice president unveiled Tuesday in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal, which aims to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign
oil, includes $75 billion in tax incentives over 10 years to
promote fuel-efficient technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides to Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush derided Gore's energy ideas as ''recycled,'' but Florio
praised the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the sort of thing I've been talking about for years,''
Florio said, ''trying to harmonize energy concerns with
environmental concerns with business concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he spoke last week with President Clinton about how
he can remain involved in politics now that his Senate bid is over.
He was defeated in the June 6 Democratic primary by Jon S. Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion led to a conversation Tuesday morning with Peter
Knight, a longtime Gore fund-raiser, over how Florio could help the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Energy and the environment were two top interests of Florio
during his 15 years in Congress before becoming governor in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the bill creating the Superfund program to clean up the
nation's worst toxic chemical waste dumps, and he was a member of
the House committee on energy and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He now teaches energy and environmental policy at Rutgers
University and serves on an advisory board to U.S. Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said many people incorrectly assume that energy
production and environmental preservation are competing goals. Some
steps, like promoting gas-fired plants to replace coal-fired ones,
would boost both economic efficiency and clean air, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said energy is a topic discussed only ''in times of
crisis,'' such as this time of soaring gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   He said he envisions his goal as trying ''to keep this alive,
not only through the course of the campaign if gas prices start to
stabilize, but into a new administration.''

<HEADLINE> World War II Crime Data Is Studied  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of a commission trying to identify and
declassify millions of World War II documents on possible war
crimes say they might finish work on Nazi Germany by October 2001,
but will need at least another year to review files on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   More than halfway through the commission's three-year task, at
least 70 percent of documents remain secret, members told Congress
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing the search is the need to clear some documents with
other governments, as well as CIA, FBI and Pentagon resistance to
any ''bulk declassification'' of files even though they are now
half a century old. Those agencies insist, however, that their
page-by-page, and sometimes line-by-line declassification
procedures are moving along rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of Japanese documents is complicated by the need to
obtain Japanese cooperation, commission members said at a hearing,
although they had not yet taken steps to do so. Millions of
documents captured during the war were returned to Japan in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not even begun to get our arms around the Japanese
issue,'' said Richard Ben-Veniste, member of the Interagency
Working Group assigned to ensure compliance with the 1999 Nazi War
Crimes Disclosure Act.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires declassification within three years of all
U.S-held papers relating to possible war crimes and looted property
during World War II. It covers Germany and its allies, including
Imperial Japan during its battle to conquer Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The working group, which includes government agency
representatives as well as outside members, reported on its
progress to members of the House Government Reform Committee a day
after releasing 400,000 newly declassified pages from the Office of
Strategic Service, World War II predecessor of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those documents, now available at the National Archives,
suggested that Britain and the United States knew several days
beforehand in late 1943 that the Nazis were going to round up
Rome's Jews for ''thorough eradication.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Kurtz, assistant national archivist, said those
documents and others yet to be released will help scholars for
years and ''may help to answer questions about how much our
government knew about the Holocaust as it was being perpetrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on papers from the European war probably could be completed
by January 2002, and work on Japan could be completed in another
year -- if Congress agrees, Kurtz said. Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.,
Congress' only Holocaust survivor, is preparing legislation to
extend the deadline and provide additional funding.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Holtzman, a former member of Congress who sits on the
commission, said she doubts whether even the European documents can
be finished to meet the congressionally mandated deadline. On
Japan, she said, investigation is needed to find out the conditions
under which papers were sent back to Tokyo in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be quite extraordinary to have returned those
documents and then not be permitted to see them,'' Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission started in 1999 with more than 600 million pages
that might have been covered by the act. By last July, that had
been narrowed to about 90 million and officials expect between 5
million and 8 million when all records are screened.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 1.5 million pages have been declassified -- all related
to the war in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Levit, CIA special counsel who sits on the commission,
said the CIA opposes mass declassification because it needs to
protect its sources and methods. But he said procedures have been
established for quickly declassifying older records, however.
</P>
<P>
   John Collingwood, FBI member on the panel, said the FBI has been
declassifying documents at ''an incredibly fast pace'' but also
could not agree to any bulk declassification of World War II data.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Lewis Thompson, Army representative, said the Army has been
converting old microfilms to digital files on optical disks and is
rapidly gaining the capability of searching old records by
computer, processing up to 70,000 pages a week.

<HEADLINE> Beruit Hails Israel Border Report  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A Lebanese man was injured by stones
thrown from Israel on Tuesday, and Lebanon welcomed a U.N. report
that said Israel was violating Lebanese territory more than a month
after its troops withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old man was wounded in the head on the
Lebanese-Israeli border when an Israeli soldier, apparently
responding to Lebanese stone-throwers, hurled some stones back,
Lebanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon on May
24, there have been frequent incidents on the border, with Lebanese
demonstrators taunting Israeli soldiers and pelting them with
stones.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Israeli soldiers opened fire on a Jordanian union
delegation visiting Fatima gate on the border, wounding four
people. An Israeli soldier guarding the border was hit in the head
Sunday by a rock thrown from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's U.N. Ambassador Selim Tadmoury sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, condemning the attack on the
Jordanians as ''an act of provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said the U.N.
Security Council's acknowledgment that Israel was violating
Lebanese territory ''amounted to an international recognition of
Israel's failure to strictly implement U.N. Resolution 425,''
according to a statement by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution 425, adopted by the Security Council after an Israeli
invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978, called for a complete and
unconditional Israeli troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council called Monday night for an immediate end to
the Israeli infringements of Lebanese territory after the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Lebanon reported half a dozen border
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss told reporters Tuesday that
the Lebanese cartographers working with U.N. officials had found 14
Israeli infringements.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud said he hoped the United Nations' efforts would force
''Israel to quickly withdraw to the internationally recognized
border'' with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has refused to deploy troops in southern
Lebanon, where anti-Israel guerrillas are the de facto authority,
until it is satisfied that Israel has completely withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, the United Nations said it had verified that Israel
had completely withdrawn from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, in its first report since the verification, the
peacekeeping force cited violations such as military patrols on
roads that cut into Lebanon and Israeli machine-gun posts on
Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the first 50 Ukrainian troops of a detachment of 650
arrived at Beirut airport with minesweeping vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They are to help the 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon remove thousands of land mines reportedly planted by
Israeli forces.

<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Leaders of the state's second-largest public
employee union Tuesday approved a four-year contract calling for
pay hikes of three percent in the first two years and 3.5 percent
in the next.
</P>
<P>
   The deal approved by the Executive Board of the Public Employees

<HEADLINE> Appeals court allows Apple Tours' buses back on the road  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A state appeals court in Manhattan has ruled
that under certain conditions, New York Apple Tours' familiar red,
double-decker buses can resume sightseeing trips around the city.
</P>
<P>
   A five-judge panel of the Appellate Division on Monday said
buses and drivers can get back to work once a court-appointed
monitor, Ross Sandler, finds they comply with city and state laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision lifts the automatic stay that the state and city
got earlier this month when they appealed a June 14 ruling by State
Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob. The judge had ruled
that suspending Apple Tours' bus registrations and tour licenses
without proper hearings raised questions of due process and
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Hayim Grant, president of Apple Tours, said he hoped to have the
company operating by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to contact 350 employees to see if they are
available,'' he said. ''I hope they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Tours' most popular ticket costs $40 for two days and
permits the tourist to hop on or off any of the company's buses at
any time at any of 65 stops in Brooklyn and Manhattan, Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has said Apple Tours should be put
out of business, said in a statement that he was ''deeply
disappointed that the Appellate Division has disregarded both the
state and city's determination that New York Apple Tours in unfit
to operate safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city will continue vigorously to pursue the administrative
hearing, begun last April, seeking to revoke their license and
cease their operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Tours was closed down on May 31 when the city's Department
of Consumer Affairs suspended its license. On the same day, the
state Department of Motor Vehicles suspended the registrations of
the company's 63 tour buses.
</P>
<P>
   In shutting down Apple Tours, state and city officials charged
that the company was operating buses that had hundreds of
violations and using drivers who were in many cases unqualified.
They alleged that the company had ignored the rules for years and
willingly paid fines as a cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The company's closing - to cheers in many neighborhoods - was
spurred by an accident in which one of the tour buses struck and
killed Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, in mid-Manhattan on
May 22.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Money Laundering,0305  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Current and former New York City employees were
among 17 defendants charged on Tuesday with money laundering for
allegedly trying to legitimize millions of dollars in cash
generated by narcotics organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were contained in criminal complaints issued by federal
prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan who want to shut down what
they said was a large-scale money laundering organization.
</P>
<P>
   Those charged with crimes that carry potential penalties of up
to 20 years in prison include a New York City building inspector
earning less than $50,000 annually and a New York City lifeguard
who earns less than $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees of the city include Othniel Simpson, who
allegedly led the organization and fled to Ecuador in January after
other members of the group were charged in Fort Myers, Fla., with
money laundering, prosecutors said in court papers filed in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the organization allegedly tried to hide the criminal
source of their money by depositing cash in banks in denominations
smaller than $10,000, an amount which requires the filing of a
Currency Transaction Report with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   After depositing the money in various banks, members of the
organization wired money to entities and individuals throughout the
United States and in Central and South America, prosecutors
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, about $200,000 in narcotics proceeds was
seized from a member of the organization in Fayetteville, N.C.,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the money laundering organization hired a paralegal
employed at a Brooklyn law firm to file a fictitious claim to
retrieve the money from law enforcement officials, prosecutors
said.

<HEADLINE> Prescription contraceptives now covered for county employees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Birth control pills and other
prescription contraceptives will be covered under Westchester
County's medical plan beginning Saturday, County Executive Andrew
Spano said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other employers, the county had excluded
contraceptives from the list of prescriptions covered by its health
plan. But Spano and the county Legislature agreed earlier this year
to budget funds for contraceptives in the county's self-funded
health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Spano said women in their childbearing years pay as much as 68
percent more in out-of-pocket health costs as men, much of it due
to reproductive care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become increasingly important that we recognize the
specific needs of our female workers,'' Spano said.

<HEADLINE> 164 Vieques Protesters Are Detained  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters hurled iron bars at U.S.
sailors at sea and crept under ''no trespassing'' fences on land,
the U.S. Navy said Tuesday, as more than 160 demonstrators
intensified their fight to oust the Navy from the Vieques island
training range where it practices bombing and shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican fishermen wielding the metal bars injured two U.S.
sailors at sea, the Navy said. On the nearby island, guards
arrested 164 Independence Party demonstrators who invaded the
bombing range to disrupt the Navy's shelling.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation was the first since Navy ships and warplanes
resumed bombing with non-explosive ''dummy'' rounds last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest renewed a 14-month-old dispute on Vieques, a
populated Puerto Rican island that is also the site of the Navy's
prime Atlantic Fleet training ground. Activists committed to
ousting the Navy say the bombing destroys fishing grounds and
endangers residents. The Navy maintains the bombing is safe and
provides crucial training for American sailors and airmen.
</P>
<P>
   Navy vessels were scheduled to start bombarding the Vieques
range with inert shells at 8 a.m. Tuesday. But the protests began
before dawn: Demonstrators tried to invade the training ground and
were rounded up by guards. Meanwhile, Navy officials said, two
sailors were hurt in an assault after fishermen on five boats
surrounded a small Navy patrol boat just off Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Jeff Gordon said the fishermen threw 12-inch iron bars
at the shield-wielding sailors, injuring one in the neck and
another in the chest. Gordon said the sailors were armed but didn't
use their weapons and that the five fishing boats escaped. The
injured sailors were hospitalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Navy has it on film and the FBI will investigate the
matter,'' Gordon said. ''I characterize these acts as very
irresponsible, which put not only their lives at risk but those of
our sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman Cheche Ayala told The Associated Press earlier Tuesday
that a dozen fishermen in five boats who tried to penetrate the
area were chased away by two Navy patrol boats. He made no mention
of a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first violent confrontation -- and largest protest
invasion of the range -- since Navy ships from the USS George
Washington Battle Group began exercises Sunday. Warplanes joined
the exercises Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests, shelling from the ships started at 8:45
a.m., the Navy said. Then fighter jets screamed overhead and thuds
and booms could be heard, presumably from an aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters claimed some of their band might still be at large
after the shelling started. But Gordon said ''the Navy is confident
that no one is on the range right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the protesters promised they would continue putting their
lives at stake for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-month agitation over Vieques has raised concerns about a
rift between this Spanish-speaking Caribbean territory and the
United States -- colonizer to some, benefactor to others. The
protests ''are endangering the relations between Puerto Rico and
the United States, and therefore the welfare of all Puerto
Ricans,'' The San Juan Star said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques and allows navies from
dozens of countries to exercise there. For years, the exercises
have provoked incidents with fishermen who charge that the Navy has
destroyed fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the worst, a Dutch sailor lost an eye in a 1997 clash
when 35 fishermen tried to persuade six warships from Belgium and
the Netherlands to withdraw. In that incident, fishermen said they
were doused with high-pressure water hoses and tear gas, while the
U.S. Navy said both sides hurled tools and other objects.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the protests, the bombing continued. But exercises
stopped in April 1999 after two 500-pound bombs were dropped off
target, killing a civilian security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The first fatality on the range in six decades of bombing united
Puerto Ricans as never before to demand that the Navy leave the
island. Dozens of protesters invaded the range, charging that the
years of bombing have destroyed reefs and wildlife, contaminated
water supplies, stunted tourism and led to a high cancer rate.
Activists camped on the range until federal agents removed them
peacefully last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists the opposition is coming from only a small
minority of Puerto Ricans. It says Vieques is the only place its
Atlantic Fleet can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises
with live fire before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, President Clinton negotiated an agreement with
the Puerto Rican government allowing the Navy to resume training
using non-explosive ordnance. Clinton also promised a referendum,
perhaps next year, when Vieques residents would choose whether to
evict the Navy or allow it to stay and resume live bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello said the protesters' incursions
on the range could endanger the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are putting at risk what is clearly the only instrument
available at this time for a final resolution of the situation of
Vieques to the benefit of the people of Vieques,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Mediates Mideast Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought
Tuesday to bolster Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's resolve to
make widespread concessions to the Palestinians. The Israeli leader
was under attack from his own Cabinet as offering to give up too
much.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, the troubled Barak faced a
renewed rhetorical assault from the Palestinians, who threatened to
set up their own state if Israel does not agree to the one they
want to established on virtually the entire West Bank, Gaza and in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Albright's trip was to narrow differences between
the two sides enough to bring Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat together for a Camp David-style summit, but prospects for a
Washington-area summit did not appear bright.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remain too far apart even for the most ardent
mediation by President Clinton to bring them into line on
statehood, the future of Jerusalem, refugee claims and the future
of Jews who live on land progressively falling under Arafat's
control.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton scheduled a news conference for
Wednesday, his first since March. No agenda was announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Barak was losing favor with his own government
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy, in an interview on Israel
television, said, ''We have made no progress. Israel has offered
the maximum without receiving the minimum of the minimum,'' Levy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for an agreement is mid-September, and Clinton is
running out of time to claim a legacy as a Middle East peacemaker.
He will be turned out of the White House in January.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is eager to attend a summit meeting, and has signaled in
various ways willingness to live alongside a Palestinian state in
control of far more than the 40 percent of the West Bank and Gaza
already under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, trying to rally his coalition partners to take the
plunge, called them to an unusual meeting with Dennis B. Ross, the
senior U.S. mediator participating in the session.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were eager to squelch reports that an
American document had been circulated outlining Israel's positions
on land-for-peace, Jerusalem, water, refugees and other knotty
issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a U.S. document, it does not accurately reflect U.S.
views, and much of it is in error, a senior U.S. official told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is trying to determine if the time is right for a
summit, but at this stage there is no basis for one, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The report evidently stems from an account given by a Barak
adviser to American Jewish organizations. Some participants opposed
to the prime minister's dovish stance then leaked it in an apparent
effort to undercut him.
</P>
<P>
   Ross's participation in Barak's session with members of the
government coalition in the prime minister's office Tuesday may
have been unprecedented. It underscored the U.S. stake in
concluding a deal while also giving Ross an audience to promote his
views. U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk was present as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ross also accompanied Albright in a Tuesday night meeting with
Barak, who was assisted in the two-hour meeting by Danny Yaton, his
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, called it ''a
thorough and useful discussion of the issues.'' He said Clinton
would decide whether the time is right to convene a summit after
Albright flies home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the six parties in Barak's unwieldy coalition
have said they would pull out if Barak makes far-reaching
concessions that have been leaked to the media in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   That could crimp Barak's ability to make a deal acceptable to
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia told the Voice of Palestine
Radio a summit could be convened only after Israel carried out an
additional West Bank troop withdrawal and released Palestinian
security prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The troop pullback was initially due June 23, but the
Palestinians agreed to a U.S. request for a two-week delay.

<HEADLINE> Blackthorne's wife testifies he never discussed killing ex-wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - The wife of South Texas millionaire Allen
Blackthorne testified Tuesday that her husband is a loving father
who never discussed killing his ex-spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Blackthorne took the stand in Blackthorne's federal
trial in San Antonio. She said that while her husband disliked
Sheila Bellush, he was not involved in her 1997 shooting and
stabbing death.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't like Sheila, and he hated some of the things she
did,'' Maureen Blackthorne said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband was a caring father to their two young sons
and was concerned about the welfare of his two daughters with
Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 45-year-old businessman testified that he was
innocent of Bellush's murder but admitted he once threatened to
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne denied accusations that he asked a golfing buddy,
Daniel Rocha, during a golf trip to Oregon to find a hit man to
kill his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed Nov. 7, 1997, shortly after moving with her
second husband, Jamie Bellush, and six children to Sarasota, Fla.
Her 2-year-old quadruplets from her second marriage were discovered
unharmed in the house, two of them crawling in their mother's
blood. Jamie Bellush and the children now live in Sussex County,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne is charged with interstate conspiracy to commit
murder for hire and interstate domestic violence. He faces a
mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Blackthorne was the last witness called by defense
attorneys. Jurors will be off Wednesday and convene again Thursday
morning for closing statements.
</P>
<P>
   During daylong testimony Monday, Blackthorne told his lawyer
that he once became so upset after his younger daughter fell out of
a second-story window that he told Bellush he would kill her if
''anything happens to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple divorced in 1989. Blackthorne said he decided to give
up the custody fight in July 1997 because his older daughter and
pregnant second wife weren't getting along. He surrendered his
parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Murphy
got Blackthorne to admit that he repeatedly has lied. Blackthorne
did not dispute that he changed his name to hide from a debtor,
that he hid assets during his divorce proceedings and that while he
fought to get his child support payments reduced from $1,250 a
month, he regularly lost that amount gambling on a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while his gambling losses to Rocha in 1997 totaled
between $75,000 and $200,000, he has not sent his daughters any
money since their mother was killed. He said his lawyer advised him
to wait until after the trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha testified earlier in the trial that he contacted a friend,
Sammy Gonzales, who hired his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro, the
alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Predicts E.Timor Elections  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The top U.N. official in East Timor
predicted Tuesday that elections in the former Indonesian territory
-- and possibly independence -- will take place late next year, a
timetable endorsed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will be for a constituent assembly that is to
consider a draft constitution, so independence is not expected to
follow immediately on the heels of voting, Sergio Vieira de Mello
told the U.N. Security Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Following discussions with East Timor's independence leader Jose
Alexandre Gusmao, he said, ''I feel safe in predicting ... that
elections and possibly independence will take place next year at
some point between Aug. 30 and December of the year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations took over responsibility for running East
Timor during its transition to independence after the East Timorese
voted overwhelmingly last Aug. 30 to break free from Indonesia's
rule, sparking a rampage by anti-independence militias. Indonesia
invaded East Timor in 1975, after Portugal hastily pulled out its
400-year-old colonial administration.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, ''in the strongest possible
terms,'' supported the election and independence timetable,
assuming the United Nations backs it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be a historic event, a signal achievement for the
United Nations and for the world community,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello said the final decision on dates for the
election and independence will largely depend on how fast progress
is being made in attaining key benchmarks, including: ensuring
security, returning refugees, alleviating poverty, establishing a
credible judiciary, restoring public services, and establishing a
financially viable administration run by East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   East Timorese will shortly take charge of the portfolios for
internal administration, infrastructure, economic affairs and
social affairs and ''for the first time ever, enjoy political
responsibility for their decisions,'' Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   A new all-Timorese National Legislative Council will also be
established next month, with representatives selected from
constituencies, parties and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will render the transition to independence less sudden and
help the concept of governmental responsibility assert itself in
East Timor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and other U.N. ambassadors expressed dissatisfaction
with continued cross-border incidents by militias based in West
Timor, which remains part of Indonesia, and at the slow pace of the
return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the incidents, Vieira de Mello reported that the
security situation is stabilizing, prompting Holbrooke to press for
a timetable for reducing the size of the 12,370-strong U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello said he will be submitting a plan to cut the
U.N. mission, known as UNTAET, by 1,405 people between now and
April.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Education Amendment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans rejected Democratic
attempts Tuesday to increase education funding and reduce class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were offered in a series of amendments to a
measure that renews education spending for kindergarten through
high school. The package provides roughly $15 billion in federal
K-12 grants to help schools pay for programs ranging from boosting
poor children's grades and test scores to training their teachers.
</P>
<P>
   This year Republicans have proposed increasing the program to
about $20 billion. The education package is part of an overall
spending measure that includes funds for the departments of Labor
and Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment proposed by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., rejected
on a 52-47 vote, would have increased Title I funding in the
measure to $10 billion. Title I is an $8.3 billion program to help
10.5 million poor children in 90 percent of the nation's school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a mandate to . . . give this small, but significant
increase to Title I,'' Wellstone said. ''It is time to stop talking
about this and do something. We have to show that our commitment to
education is more than just for photo ops and bumper stickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other amendments by Sens. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Patty
Murray of Washington, also Democrats, would have allotted $250
million to increase accountability at failing schools and $1.75
billion to reduce class sizes. Those amendments also failed, by
votes of 50-49 and 55-44 respectively.
</P>
<P>

	   ST. JOHN'S, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) - A New Jersey man drowned
while he was snorkeling at Water Lemon Cay, a scenic dive spot in
the underwater U.S. Virgin Islands National Park off St. John's
island, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance crew rushed to the scene on Monday, but they failed
to save the life of 40-year-old Francis James McBeigh Jr. of Mount

   ''They tried to do some resuscitation but I guess he didn't make
it,'' said Chief Ranger Schuyler Brown.
</P>
<P>
   McBeigh died of drowning, the medical examiner, Dr. Francisco

<HEADLINE> Jailing of Iranian Woman Protested  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of House members is
protesting detention of an Iranian woman jailed in Virginia two
months after she was deported from Canada as a former commander of
an alleged terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Mahnaz Samadi, who gained political asylum in the United States
five years ago after she was imprisoned and tortured in Iran, is
being held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in a jail
in Hopewell, Va. She is accused in immigration documents of
preparing rebel units under her command for ''coordinated attacks
designed to liberate Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   House members led by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and Rep.
Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, along with 60 other House members,
signed a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno pleading for
Samadi's release and accusing U.S. officials of mistreating her.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi, 35, has the backing of the National Council for
Resistance of Iran, which has been praised by many Republican and
Democratic members Congress as a legitimate group seeking reform of
an anti-democratic government. The State Department, however,
continues to list it as an alias for the Iraq-based Mujahedeen
Khalq, which it describes as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our conviction that Ms. Samadi should be immediately
released,'' said Ros-Lehtinen, quoted in a release from her office.
''The persecution of those seeking to liberate their homeland
violates the principles upon which this country was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Samadi has denied any terrorist acts, and her Washington
attorney, Michael Maggio, says she is no longer a member of the
Iranian opposition and has committed no crimes in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has come under repeated criticism for its
rejection of the Iranian opposition as it tries to establish warmer
relations with more-moderate leaders in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the Iranian regime's record of crimes against humanity,
it is the right of the Iranian people, including Ms. Samadi, to
resist their repressive rulers,'' the House members said in their
letter. They said Samadi's detention sends the wrong message to
Iran's rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and the U.N. High Commission for Refugees
also have protested Ms. Samadi's detention as a human rights
violation. Supporters describe her as a strong advocate of human
rights and women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi has said she was imprisoned and tortured from 1982 until
1986 for her opposition to the Iranian government. She says two of
her brothers, Amir and Manouchehr, were executed at ages 18 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   She was granted U.S. political asylum in 1994, but immigration
officials said she did not tell them then that she had been a
commander in the rebel army. It was not until her February arrest
in Canada and her deportation back to the United States in April
that U.S. officials arrested her.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities accused Samadi of lying about her links to
the Iranian resistance.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans To Vote On Referendum  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandans voting Thursday in a referendum
on their political future are likely to stick with the ''no-party''
system that has prevailed for the past 14 years in this East
African nation. Strong memories of Uganda's bloody past and a long
list of recent successes are in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   But because proponents of a multiparty system are boycotting the
referendum, its real significance lies in how many of the country's
10.5 million registered voters take part at all.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is viewed as a litmus test of the popularity of
President Yoweri Museveni, the former guerrilla leader under whom
Ugandans have enjoyed the longest period of peace since
independence in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ''Museveni is using the referendum to confirm his
dictatorship,'' said Nassir Ssebagala, an outspoken Democratic
Party activist and the former mayor of Kampala. ''We can't win
because the rules are in his favor, so we are calling for a
boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum asks Ugandans which political system they wish to
adopt, Museveni's National Resistance Movement or a multiparty
system. Opponents say the deck is stacked in favor of the movement,
which has the money and the muscle to get out its message that
party politics have only brought chaos to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the final day of campaigning, only a few
thousand people attended Museveni's closing rally in Kampala,
compared to an estimated 20,000 who showed up to hear Ssebagala and
other politicians encourage a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties are legal in Uganda, but they can't raise
funds, elect officials or campaign under their colors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Multi-partyism led to where we were during Idi Amin,'' said
James Wapakabulo, who runs the National Resistance Movement,
repeating the official position that political parties exploited
sectarian, tribal and religious divisions to divide and rule
Uganda's 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Uganda's recent, bloody history would seem to play
in Museveni's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, eight years after independence from Britain, Amin led a
popular military coup that ousted the corrupt, repressive regime of
President Milton Obote.
</P>
<P>
   But things fell apart for Amin after he expelled more than
70,000 people of Indian background who were the country's economic
mainstay. Amin's forces killed at least 200,000 people and were
only stopped by the intervention in 1979 of the Tanzanian army --
and Ugandan exiles including Museveni.
</P>
<P>
   They restored Obote to power in what turned out to be nearly
another decade of chaos and terror that ended only when Museveni
and his National Resistance Movement won a five-year bush war in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Museveni was elected president over two other
candidates and has presided over a remarkable transformation of the
economy and an overall improvement in human rights and press
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The list of successes is long. Poverty has been reduced and the
country has been reunited. There is universal, free primary
education for up to four children in each Ugandan family, free
primary health care, and running water for 90 percent of Ugandan
households.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile telephones abound, and everyone from Museveni on down
calls in to discuss politics on the more than 30 private FM radio
stations in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   But despite average economic growth rates of more than 6 percent
for the past decade, the budget still depends on outside support,
and diplomats and donors feel it is time for Museveni to open up
the political system.

<HEADLINE> Italian Inmates Start Fires  </HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Protesting against prison overcrowding, inmates
across Italy set sheets on fires, pounded on cell bars and waved
signs demanding amnesty for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Few injuries were reported during the fourth day of protests,
which stretched from the southern city of Palermo in Sicily to
Trieste in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But a convict in the northern city of Bergamo cut a guard on the
arm with a razor, while six guards in Novara, also in the north,
were treated for smoke inhalation from a fire started by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In some prisons, inmates dangled signs out windows, demanding
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have fueled a political debate over whether to
grant some sort of amnesty to ease overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's 217 prisons, built to hold 40,000 inmates, now house
about 54,000.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from the governing center-left coalition were trying to
work out an amnesty proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also looking at hiring more guards or building
new prisons.
</P>
<P>
   An amnesty would eliminate prison time for people convicted of
nonviolent crimes and given relatively short sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty is especially touchy in Italy because it might affect
those convicted in the huge and politically charged corruption
scandals of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing National Alliance, the Northern League and the
Democrats are against it, while Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia,
former Christian Democrats and the Greens back it.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition's largest party, the Democratic Left, is
split.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amnesty does not resolve either the problem of the
inmates' rights ... or the security that citizens demand,'' Chamber
Speaker Luciano Violante said. ''It is an illusion.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Mountain Climber Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's highest mountain claimed its fourth
victim this year -- a climber who fell while scaling the 18,400-foot
Pico de Orizaba, the state news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two companions were injured Monday during the climb, which was
complicated by strong winds and icy conditions, Notimex said. It
did not say how the two were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The three climbers began their ascent Sunday morning from the
south side of the mountain, 200 miles east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh weather conditions prevented rescue workers from
recovering the body immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the frozen bodies of three Russian climbers who had
been missing for several days were found on Orizaba. One of the
climbers appeared to have slipped, and may have caused all three to
fall down a steep incline, the Televisa network reported at the
time.

<HEADLINE> Disabilities Act Said Not Enforced  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ten years after its enactment, the Americans
With Disabilities Act is not being enforced aggressively enough by
federal agencies, a study says.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Disability, an independent federal
agency that makes policy recommendations to the president and
Congress, said Tuesday that while agencies follow up on complaints,
they have been ''overly cautious, reactive and lacking any coherent
and unifying national strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cites underfunding, understaffing and the bureaucracy
culture as contributors to the problem, saying that the ''net
impact has been to allow the destructive effects of discrimination
to continue without sufficient challenge in some quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 act prohibits discrimination against people with
disabilities and requires that they have access to transportation
and other public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Four federal agencies, the Justice Department, Transportation
Department, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the
Federal Communications Commission are primary enforcers of the act.
</P>
<P>
   In those agencies, the report blames lack of leadership for
inconsistencies in enforcement. Just within the Transportation
Department, the report says, six sections have different
interpretations of the law, investigation methods and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   To fix these problems, the council recommends that the Justice
Department take a lead role in ADA implementation across the
federal government, and the other federal agencies should be more
aggressive in enforcing ADA as well as take part in community
outreach and education.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it does not agree with the council's
report as a whole. But the department conceded that, even with 30
new positions requested for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, its
ADA enforcement arm is understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the law took effect we have reached hundreds of
settlements improving access across the country and have engaged in
an extensive effort to educate the public about the law,'' the
Justice Department said in a statement. ''And we regret that we do
not have sufficient resources to address every ADA violation that
is brought to our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces ADA
against private employers, local governments and others, responded
to the report by citing its successes. The commission reports that
it has obtained more than $300 million in compensation on behalf of
more than 20,000 litigants, as well as nonfinancial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''In addition to vigorously enforcing the ADA, the commission
provides education, outreach and technical assistance to the
private sector in order to promote understanding and voluntary
compliance with the act,'' said Paul Steven Miller, EEOC
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Disability is not alone in wanting more
from the agencies enforcing ADA. The American Institute of
Architects last week called for ''greater clarity and certainty''
from the Justice Department in the act's requirements. The industry
group has been frustrated with conflicting statements from state
and federal government in building codes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Architects have been striving to meet the intent of the ADA
since its adoption 10 years ago, but can never be certain they've
met the requirements unless they get sued,'' said R.K. Stewart, a
member of the AIA's Accessibility Task Force.

<HEADLINE> Body of Missing Serb Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Serb shepherd whose disappearance
last week prompted rioting was found dead on Tuesday, and NATO
officials said he appeared to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Russell Berg of the U.S. peacekeepeers said the villager
from Strpce, about 25 miles south of the provincial capital of
Pristina, ''died under suspicious circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said the man was found at the foot of a hill near Strpce,
which is within the Kosovo zone patrolled by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Serbs gathered Tuesday evening in Strpce, in front of
the U.N. police building and later dispersed without serious
incident, Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs rioted Friday after NATO peacekeepers refused Serbs'
request for a helicopter to search for the elderly missing
villager.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing campaign a year ago brought a halt to a yearlong
crackdown on the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serb-led
Yugoslav forces. NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N. administrators
moved in once Serb troops left. Since then, international officials
have charged that revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians against Serbs
has left Serbs frightened.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Emergency Bill Worked On  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders labored Tuesday to craft
a trimmed-down emergency bill financing U.S. peacekeepers in
Kosovo, Colombia's battle against drug traffickers and recovery
from hurricanes, fires and other domestic disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be the slimmest Christmas tree you've seen
around this place in a long time,'' said Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, using a Capitol Hill
idiom for a bill laden with gifts for lawmakers' districts.
</P>
<P>
   Though numbers and details were changing by the hour, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., discussed a tentative compromise of up to $5.5
billion, said participants speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla.,
however, said he believed the final package could be several
billion dollars larger than that.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lott and Hastert agreed to try holding the cost to no
more than $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders were willing to pare the price tag in hopes of
speeding congressional approval so the bill could be shipped to
President Clinton by week's end -- when Congress' weeklong July 4
break begins. Aides have said Republicans want to finish the bill
quickly to avoid blame for any problems the Pentagon might face as
it juggles money to pay for U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a really novel idea. Let's go with real emergencies,''
said Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Lott had criticized earlier, larger versions of the package for
being too costly and containing unnecessary items, which slowed
Senate work on the measure for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, participants said that as part of the final package,
the House and Senate would each get a $100 million kitty for
various lawmakers' home-district projects.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and aides said that some amendments that would make
controversial policy changes would also be omitted from the final
package.
</P>
<P>
   That included an effort by Schering-Plough Corp. to win an
extension of its patent for Claritin, the popular and profitable
allergy drug. Also left off the bill was language by Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H., aimed at extending a lucrative patent his alma
mater, Columbia University, has on a process its scientists
invented for making some widely sold biotechnology drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure could, however, end up with compromise language
struck Tuesday that would lift the four-decade-old U.S. food
embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said the compromise the leaders were discussing
would include $2.05 billion to repay the Pentagon for the costs of
5,700 American troops serving with the NATO peacekeeping team in
Kosovo; $1.3 billion to help Colombia battle drug traffickers and
their right- and left-wing allies; at least $660 million for
rebuilding from the government-set fires that ravaged Los Alamos,
N.M.; and $250 million to help North Carolina and other states
recover from last September's Hurricane Floyd and other
agricultural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Hastert have both been strong supporters of the aid
for Colombia as a way to combat drug use in the United States.
Colombia supplies most of the cocaine used in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Aides have said that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittee that oversees
foreign aid, has been trying to keep the Colombia money out of the
emergency package.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving it in the regular foreign aid bill could increase
leverage on Clinton to sign it, aides say. Lott nevertheless
indicated that in the name of completing the emergency bill
quickly, McConnell seemed ready to let the Colombia money be
included.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $5.2 billion for Kosovo, Colombia and natural
disasters early this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved $13 billion in March, mostly by adding extra
money for the Pentagon. Last month, the Senate approved roughly $9
billion.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Airplanes Have Slide Problems  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In more than a third of commercial aircraft
evacuations, at least one inflatable escape slide failed to work
properly or at all, according to a draft of a National
Transportation Safety Board study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A slide problem in 37 percent of the evacuations in which
slides were deployed is unacceptable for a safety system,'' said
NTSB Chairman James Hall. ''It's time for the FAA, the
manufacturers, the airlines, the aircraft crews and the airports to
take action to ensure that no one else dies because of poor
aircraft design, inadequate evacuation procedures, inadequate crew
training or inadequate emergency response.''
</P>
<P>
   The study examined 46 emergency evacuations of commercial
airplanes that occurred from September 1997 to June 1999, involving
more than 2,600 passengers and 18 different types of aircraft. In
the cases studied, about nine of every 10 passengers escaped
without injury.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the serious injuries and all the fatalities mentioned in
the evacuation study occurred in the crash of American Airlines
flight 1420, which careened off the runway after landing in Little
Rock in a late night thunderstorm on June 1, 1999. While 134
passengers escaped, most with injuries, 11 people were killed,
including the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Of the evacuations studied, 19 involved the use of inflatable
escape slides that extend out from a plane's emergency exits. In
five cases, at least one of a plane's slides didn't deploy
automatically and flight crews had to manually inflate it. Slides
failed completely during two other evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   One of those failures occurred on July 9, 1998 after the engine
of an American Airlines A300 caught fire soon after it took off
from San Juan, Puerto Rico. After the plane returned to the
airport, the crew tried to evacuate passengers through the right
side because the left was blocked by fire and emergency vehicles.
One exit and escape slide worked properly, but the other three had
problems: one slide inflated but then flipped over in the wind and
had to be straightened by someone on the ground; another deployed,
but only after a flight attendant made two attempts to open a
jammed door; and one door wouldn't open completely and its slide
didn't work at all.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB repeated Tuesday a December recommendation that the
Federal Aviation Administration require for a year that air
carriers test the evacuation systems on 10 percent of each type of
plane in their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Improper use of slides by passengers can also slow an escape
from a plane. While passengers should be jumping onto slides,
people first sitting down at the exits creates delays.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that while most passengers were able to reach
exits, the most frequent obstacle blocking escape from a plane
wasn't wreckage or debris, but other passengers trying to grab or
haul their carryon luggage. The investigators found air travelers
often stopped to get bags out of overhead bins -- in one case, a
passenger blocked an emergency exit by pausing to rummage through a
closet for a garment bag.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended that material be developed to advise
passengers about the hazard posed by trying to escape with their
luggage.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Armenian Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Links between peace and economic reform in the
Caucasus region highlighted a 35-minute meeting in the Oval Office
Tuesday between President Clinton and Armenian President Robert
Kocharian.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged support for peace in the Nagorno-Karabakh region
of the Caucasus Mountains of southwest Asia. The meeting was a
follow-up to one Clinton had in February with Azerbaijani President
Geidar Aliev.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia has had a cease-fire with Azerbaijan for five years, but
has failed to resolve disputes over independence claims by
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is controlled by Armenia, but is located
within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our message to President Kocharian was that the United States
will do its part along with the international community to support
and implement a durable settlement,'' White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley told reporters after the meeting. ''The opportunity is
there if both sides want to pursue peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is a co-chair with Russia and France of the
Minsk Group, formed by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to urge a peaceful resolution to the
conflict. The territorial dispute has cost several thousand lives,
created nearly 1 million refugees and caused severe economic
hardships and disrupted economic and social ties in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the three co-chair nations are traveling to
the region late next week, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an interest in seeing the region develop in terms of
building prosperity but part of that comes with preventing or
ending conflict,'' Crowley said. ''That was primarily our message
today -- that there's clearly an opportunity for greater prosperity
for Armenia, but that has to come through a stable situation that
then gives confidence to those who wish to invest in Armenia.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States' primary concern in the region is a planned
pipeline to carry Caspian sea oil, being extracted by U.S. and
European oil companies, across Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean at
Ceyhan, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Trooper statistics show higher percentage of minority stops on turnpike </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - First-ever statistics for traffic stops by
troopers statewide show a higher percentage of minorities were
pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Attorney General's office said the statistics
for the first four months of 2000 are preliminary and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they have yet to finish a study on whether a
higher proportion of blacks and Hispanics use the busy turnpike
than the rest of the state's roads.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show 38 percent of the motorists stopped by the State
Police barracks covering the turnpike over the four-month period
were black, Hispanic or of another minority group.
</P>
<P>
   However, for units covering the rest of the state, only 22
percent of the motorists stopped were minorities, a figure that
aligns more closely with the state's population. About 13 percent
of the state population is black, 10 percent is Hispanic and 3
percent is Asian, according to census figures.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the traffic stops resulted in an arrest
statewide, 57 percent of those arrested were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials Tuesday would not say whether they regard this data as
some sort of report card on the progress of reforms promised by the
Whitman administration to snuff out racial profiling by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar data in May showed minority drivers on the turnpike
still faced a higher likelihood of being stopped and of being
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Tuesday's data shows minority traffic stops on the
increase or the decline, Assistant Attorney General Paul Zoubek,
''No one can make that statement because there is not the body of
information of what was going on in prior periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the higher proportion of minorities stopped on the
turnpike, Zoubek said nothing could be inferred from that result.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is necessary is an appropriate survey done in
consultation with the Department of Justice that reflects what the
population actually is on the turnpike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black
Ministers Council of New Jersey, said much of that has already been
proved, adding the disparity between minority traffic stops on and
off the turnpike was meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ''All statistics have some meaning, and so I do think that there
must be some effort at least to determine what that meaning is as
far as the disparity,'' Jackson said. ''There ought to be some
effort made as to why there is that gap and not simply dismiss it
as insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noted the statewide figures for minority stops appear
proportionate to the population, adding further question as to what
is happening on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a surprise, but I guess it does at least raise an
eyebrow because it is the first time we have seen the
information,'' he said. ''I think it goes back to this thing of the
turnpike being a drug artery, and it goes back to the mindset of
the former superintendent who said, who taught his men, minorities
were more involved with drugs than others were.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's data were prepared for U.S. District Judge Mary L.
Cooper, who was assigned to enforce a legal settlement of civil
rights charges against the New Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached between Attorney General John Farmer
and the U.S. Justice Department to forestall a federal civil rights
lawsuit against the state. Cooper with the aide of appointed
monitors will evaluate the state's progress for up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for three men shot and wounded by troopers on the
turnpike in 1998 have filed a private civil rights lawsuit against
the troopers and the state, and they have said they will use racial
profiling patterns to document their claims.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spurred a state inquiry into the controversy and
led Farmer's predecessor, former Attorney General Peter Verniero,
to issue a report in April 1999 confirming the existence of racial
profiling - what some activists call the crime of ''driving while
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statistics show that statewide, of the 118,213 people
stopped from Jan. 1 to April 30, 74 percent of them were white, 16
percent black, 6 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian or American
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 27,831 motorists stopped on the turnpike by the four
State Police units covering the turnpike - units organized
collectively as ''Troop D'' - 62 percent of those stopped were
white, 22 percent black, 10 percent Hispanic and 6 percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
   The highest proportion was at the Moorestown barracks, where 45
percent of those stopped were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide statistics show that black motorists who have been
stopped by troopers are far likelier to be arrested than whites.
However, this was relatively consistent statewide, on or off the
turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 87,500 whites stopped over four months, 1,670 were
arrested for some crime, including 378 for drugs and 15 for
weapons, for an arrest rate of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a fifth as many blacks were stopped, 18,468, but that
resulted in more arrests, 1,801, with 188 for drugs and 17 for
weapons, for an arrest rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But while the traffic-stop statistics for minorities on the
turnpike are sharply higher than in other units in the state, there
was no great difference in arrests. Statewide, 57 percent of those
arrested were minorities, while on the turnpike it was 61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lazio seeks to rally GOP troops at Manhattan fund-raiser  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Long Island congressman Rick Lazio and the man
he replaced in the U.S. Senate race - New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani - took a tag-team approach Tuesday night in attacks on
Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Manhattan fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who spoke to several hundred supporters at the Sheraton
Hotel, repeated themes he has developed in his nearly six-week-old
campaign: He's the native New Yorker with a record of ''legislative
accomplishment'' who is battling not only the first lady, but the
entire Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talk to your friends, talk to your colleagues and
co-workers,'' the Long Island congressman said with his wife, Pat,
at his side. ''Tell them that we're about fighting for New York.
The future of New York is at stake. We need them. You've got to
think about this: The entire White House is lined up behind the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during his speech, Lazio acknowledged the presence of
former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promise you, I will work hard, as hard as anyone worked; as
hard as even Senator D'Amato has worked for this job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, D'Amato said he thinks Lazio has done well in the
early days of his campaign, which was launched May 20 when Giuliani
dropped out citing prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's done incredibly well, given the relentless
attacks that the first lady's surrogates have been conducting upon
him,'' D'Amato said. ''He just has to let the people meet him and
spend time with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio left the Republican rally early to head back to Washington
to attend to business in the House of Representatives. But before
he left, he introduced Giuliani, who picked up on the anti-Clinton
theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean it really is hard, when you step back from this, to
really completely assess the arrogance of all this; never having
lived here, never having held public office and 'I want to be your
senator.' I mean we have to demand more than that, don't we?'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also suggested that the candidates scrap the notion of
debates:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what they should do is put Rick and Hillary in an
automobile at LaGuardia Airport and figure out who can actually get
home on their own.''

<HEADLINE> Patrols Ease Border Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepped-up patrols along the Arizona-Mexico
border have defused tensions between illegal immigrants and
residents, authorities say. But some Arizonans who came to Capitol
Hill said the situation still is explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides are afraid. The residents are afraid of the
migrants and the migrants are afraid of the residents,'' said Sally
Holcomb of Bisbee, Ariz., a restaurateur and mental health program
manager who spoke at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have mounted with reports of armed residents detaining
illegal immigrants in remote Cochise County in southeastern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever and David Aguilar, the Border
Patrol's top official in the Tuscon, Ariz., regional office, met
Tuesday with Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., and assured him the situation
has been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The characterization of conflict along the border as rancher
vigilantism is a real unfortunate and inaccurate characterization
of those conflicts,'' Dever said. ''We have had some extremely
isolated incidents that have led to that characterization.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been only 32 incidents in the past eight months where
citizens have detained suspected illegal immigrants, Aguilar said.
The Border Patrol has nearly tripled its horseback patrols of
Cochise County ranches in the last six months, helping ease
tensions, Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrant rights activists say the government should arrest
residents who hold illegal immigrants at gunpoint. That amounts to
kidnapping and assault, said lawyers for the Tucson-based group
Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, or Coalition for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government needs to take a strong stance and say, 'This is
illegal and you will be prosecuted if you continue,''' said Isabel
Garcia, a Tuscon lawyer and member of the rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that Border Patrol crackdowns in California and
Texas have driven more immigrants to Arizona. Dever and Garcia
criticized the Border Patrol for not giving enough warning or help.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said he was seeking congressional approval for $5 million in
emergency funding for Arizona and additional funding to hire 1,000
new border patrol agents, though the House has approved only 430.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and other critics said that would only further
''militarize'' the border, where motorists are questioned at
checkpoints about their citizenship and destination.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept Sues To Block Merger  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department on Tuesday sued to stop
the merger of the nation's second- and third-largest long-distance
phone companies, saying the proposed $129 billion union of WorldCom
Inc. and Sprint Corp. would leave millions of Americans paying more
for less.
</P>
<P>
   The companies almost immediately withdrew a merger notification
filed with the European Commission but insisted the proposal was
still viable in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they would take ''a couple of days'' to
assess their options before deciding whether to try to win a
decision in federal court or withdraw the merger proposal in the
United States as well.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day before, the European Union's antitrust chief, Mario
Monti, said the companies had offered a ''less than satisfactory''
response to concerns of overseas regulators that their pairing
would dominate high-level Internet access around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, in announcing the lawsuit, said the
merger threatens to undermine gains achieved by the breakup of AT&AMP;T
into ''baby bells'' 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going from the Big Three telecom companies -- WorldCom, Sprint
and AT&AMP;T -- to the Big To would be like giving customers the wrong
number,'' Reno said. ''We must continue to go foward toward greater
competition, better innovation, not backward, toward the telecom
monopoly of esterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeks a
permanent injunction to prohibit the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint General Counsel J. Richard Devlin said he believes Sprint
had ''presented an overwhelming case in support of the merger.''
Until now, the companies' strategy was that the Europeans might go
along if they could convince U.S. regulators of the merger's
benefits, Devlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sprint hopes that a sensible conclusion to this merger can be
reached,'' he said. ''The public benefits are too great to pass
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Reno's announcement, Michael Salsbury, WorldCom
general counsel, said in a written statement: ''WorldCom will
promptly review its options with Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sprint fell $1.188 to $58.375 on the New York Stock
Exchange, while shares of WorldCom rose $2.188 to $39.688 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   It was already clear that the proposal would be rejected by the
Europeans, possibly as early as Wednesday. So instead, the
companies pre-empted them by withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   ''If, in the future, the parties decide to proceed with the
merger (in Europe), they will make such notifications as are
appropriate under European merger laws,'' the companies said in a
joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The government said this was the largest merger challenged by
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general of the department's
antitrust division, said the lawsuit came after a nine-month
investigation and negotiations with the parties.
</P>
<P>
   He said changes offered by the companies were not sufficient to
maintain competition in the industry. Although Klein would not
identify those changes, European Commission officials said the
companies offered to sell Sprint's long-distance services and
Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin said the government also wanted the companies to offer up
Sprint's local telephone service, leaving the new entity with just
a tiny portion of Sprint's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, at that point, it didn't make any sense to continue
discussions because that alternative was unacceptable,'' Devlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the merger would harm ''virtually every American
consumer'' by ending the aggressive competition between the two
companies for customers: ''Just watch television. Just get home and
hear people calling you on the phone trying to switch you from
Sprint to WorldCom or from WorldCom to Sprint,'' said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the impending European decision had little to do with
the U.S. announcement. ''Our analysis of this case was based upon
its impact on U.S. consumers and U.S. businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In residential long-distance telephone markets and several other
markets, WorldCom and Sprint are the only substantial competitors
to AT&AMP;T and to each other, the government said. Each has
constructed national and international fiber optic networks and
developed sophisticated systems for handling millions of customer
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, the department said, the combined companies' long
distance and Internet service could reach as much as 60 percent of
the market.

<HEADLINE> Panel Declines Abortion Limits Ease  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee refused to ease
international abortion restrictions included in a $13.3 billion
foreign aid bill.
</P>
<P>
   By a 34-26 mostly party-line vote Tuesday, the House
Appropriations Committee rejected a Democrat-led effort to end
limits on U.S. support for international family planning
organizations that advocate abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is perennial, and in past years it has held up
payment of almost $1 billion in back U.S. dues to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that we have to have this discussion year after year
after year,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   She sought passage of an amendment to modify the current law to
allow U.S. support of nongovernmental organizations that use their
own, separate money to lobby for changes in abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   Not challenged was the U.S. law that bans outright the use of
U.S. aid money to perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also rejected a proposal by Rep. Sonny Callahan,
R-Ala, chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee, that would
have penalized Israel's proposed sale of a $250 million airborne
early warning system to China.
</P>
<P>
   At $2.8 billion annually, Israel is the largest single recipient
of U.S. foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's proposal already was turned down by his subcommittee.
He indicated he will raise the issue again before the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the foreign aid bill, approved last week

aid.

   Congressional conservatives have protested the pending sale to
China of the advanced airborne radar system, and some have
suggested slashing Israel's aid allowance to protest.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel television, Israel's foreign
minister, David Levy, was asked about such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel would never do anything that would endanger the
security of the United States, and therefore we must discuss how
Israel can on the one hand fulfill its minimum commitments and on
the other hand not let the Americans feel their security has been
impaired by Israel,'' Levy said.

aid bill is S. 2522.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Take on Navy  </HEADLINE>
By LYNNE SLADKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Around midnight they gathered -- a
band of students and independence activists from the main island of
Puerto Rico, armed only with wire cutters and a belief that the
Navy should not be bombing Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: to invade the training ground early Tuesday and
impede the first major Navy exercises in the 14 months since
civilian guard David Sanes was killed there by stray bombs, setting
off a furor of protests laced with anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   From the meeting place at Monte Carmelo overlooking Navy
property, about 60 people set off in three squads, following a few
camouflaged men who knew the terrain and led the way along a dirt
road marked by holes and big jutting rocks. No flashlights
disturbed the Caribbean night. In their dark clothes they were
barely visible to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's go! Let's go!'' they whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Critics deride the Vieques protesters as unreasonable -- for the
U.S. government has already agreed to phase out use of the Atlantic
Fleet's prime training ground within three years, and for
exploiting the Vieques issue to drum up support for the broader and
far less popular cause of Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters made their way toward the chain link fence
marking the border with Camp Garcia, the Navy bombing range that
occupies the eastern third of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   After about 15 minutes of walking they froze in their tracks:
helicopters flew overhead, cutting the darkness with search lights
that swept close by. The group hit the ground, lying in the dirt
until the helicopters roared away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go home, Yankees! This is our land!'' shouted Elba Diaz, a
43-year-old Vieques housewife, casting caution aside.
</P>
<P>
   Below, they could see Navy vehicles crawling along the fence.
And they knew observation posts held lookouts monitoring every
movement with night vision devices as well.
</P>
<P>
   The first group moved downhill to an abandoned house, where they
spent nearly an hour hiding from the searchlights. When it was
finally deemed safe, and no patrols were visible, they scrambled
across some shrubs to the fence, uprooted a section and crawled,
flat down on their backs, through the opening.
</P>
<P>
   There they broke the silence, raised their hands and chanted:
''Vieques, Yes! Navy, No!''
</P>
<P>
   They began moving further into the Navy zone, hoping to reach
the target range of bombing and shelling and hide in the interior.
Another group soon entered, this one cutting the fence with a large
wirecutter to speed entry.
</P>
<P>
   The first group was only in for five minutes before they were
spotted by a patrol car. In an orderly and peaceful procedure, the
protesters held out their arms to be handcuffed and were loaded
onto trucks -- a procedure carried out for some 300 individuals in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Interaction was minimal -- beyond a complaint by the detainees
that the officers addressed then in English, not Spanish.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Against GOP Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Behind the closed doors of a recent party
caucus, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt urged solid
opposition to a Republican prescription drug bill for Medicare, the
better to sharpen a potent issue for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure is not an option,'' he added emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks Monday night underscored the political stakes in the
debate unfolding on a topic that affects 39 million senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''An issue like prescription drugs is an opportunity for
Democrats to regain their advantage with seniors and to regain
their majority in the House,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic
pollster who advises Gephardt in his effort to gain a majority this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Older voters, Garin added in an interview, ''are one of the key
swing'' groups in the coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They also make up a group that has grown increasingly accustomed
to voting Republican in recent years. Garin cited polling data from
1994 that showed Democrats narrowly held onto the votes of those
aged 65 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans prevailed narrowly in 1996, he said. In 1998,
''Republicans won the 65-plus vote by 10 points in House elections
and if the Democrats had broken even with the senior vote,
Democrats would be in the majority today.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans view the same polling data, and know, as well, that
Medicare has historically been a bedrock Democratic issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prescription drug coverage is one of the Democrats' 'Four
Corners' offense for winning back the House - along with health
care, education and Social Security,'' GOP pollster Glen Bolger
recently advised the House GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have good messages on the other issues. It is imperative
that Republicans hang together on this issue and pass a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''It is helpful if we can be bipartisan in our
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   With a vote set for Wednesday, the political maneuvering
continued during the day.
</P>
<P>
   At a Democratic fund-raiser Tuesday night in Washington, Clinton
outlined the political undercurrent on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to vote on it, I think, tomorrow, and I was just
told before I came in here that they're not even going to allow the
House to vote on our proposal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why?'' he asked rhetorically. ''Because it might pass in an
election year. Because they're just five seats in the majority and
they figure there might be six or seven of them that might figure
out that the voters back home may ... actually look at the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt suggested he might lead a walk-out of the House chamber
if Republicans don't allow a vote on the Democrats' alternative. It
was a tactic last employed during President Clinton's impeachment --
in the shadow of another election -- when the GOP refused to allow a
vote on censuring the president rather than seeking his removal.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans showed they are not above taunting
Democrats on Medicare. They touted their proposal at a ceremony
that featured a retirement-age barbershop quartet. Their selections
included ''Happy Days are Here Again,'' a virtual national anthem
for Democrats for more than a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pushing a $40 billion plan which relies on a
blend of private insurance companies and federal subsidies to
spread coverage nationwide to Medicare beneficiaries
</P>
<P>
   Democrats favor a alternative, twice as costly, to establish a
uniform government-defined Medicare prescription drug benefit, also
to be available nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   They say the GOP plan will benefit the pharmaceutical industry
without guaranteeing cover to senior citizens. Republicans accuse
Democrats of endorsing a government ''one size fits all'' approach
that could cost some seniors current coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is likely to resonate through the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly jumped on Bolger's advice as evidence the
Republicans were following a poll-driven plan.
</P>
<P>
   But according to officials, Democrats had already been testing
campaign commercials, preparing to hit Republicans for failing to
offer prescription drug coverage to seniors. Now the attack will be
recast, and aired as soon as August in targeted districts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when Republicans sought Democratic support for
their bill, Gephardt labored to hold defections to a minimum. Aides
say they expect to lose only four or five Democrats on the vote,
enough, they proclaim, to deny the GOP the mantle of
bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last week proposed adding $21 billion to the bill to
raise payments to hospitals and other Medicare providers. Democrats
quickly incorporated the money into their alternative for
prescription drug coverage, a sweetener that had the effect of
making it more attractive politically.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to be outbid, Republicans swiftly spread the word
they, too, would make the money available later this year, in
separate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton upped the ante once again over the weekend, when he
proposing to add another $58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gephardt has called Democrats to frequent caucuses
on the issue, part of an effort to stress the importance he places
on the drug bill. Monday's night's remarks, according to officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity, came after an aide aired a
clip from the movie, Apollo XIII.
</P>
<P>
   The film recounted the account of a manned moon spaceship,
coaxed safely back to earth after a life-threatening onboard
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure is not an option,'' one earth-bound space agency
official says at one tense moment -- the point that Gephardt echoed
in his own remarks.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Experts: The Worst Is To Come  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- AIDS has killed 19 million people worldwide, but
the worst is yet to come, the United Nations predicted Tuesday: the
disease is expected to wipe out half the teen-agers in some African
nations, devastating economies and societies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a whole generation which is being taken out,'' said
Peter Piot, head of the U.N. Joint Program on HIV/AIDS. He said
vulnerable countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Caribbean risk
a similar catastrophe unless they act now to control infection
rates.
</P>
<P>
   In its 135-page report released Tuesday, UNAIDS estimates:
</P>
<P>
   --The virus has killed 19 million people worldwide, up from 16.3
million at the end of 1998. It has infected 34 million more,
including 5.4 million last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   --More than 13 million children have been orphaned by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   --In 16 sub-Saharan African countries, more than one-tenth of the
population ages 15-49 carries the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   --In seven of those countries, at least one-fifth of the
population is infected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the countries where 20 percent of the population is
infected is South Africa, which has 4.2 million people who are HIV
positive -- the largest single national total. The southern African
nation of Botswana has the worst rate, with more than one in three
adults infected. That is the equivalent of 90 million people out of
the U.S. population of 270 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''The probability that you die from AIDS when you are 15 today
is over 50 percent in these countries,'' Piot told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going into societies where there are more people in
their 60s and 70s than there are in their 40s and 30s,'' he said.
''This is unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   With dwindling numbers of economically active adults left to
support the rest of the population, the impact on poor African
nations is devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural production in nations like Zimbabwe, where 2,000
people die each week of AIDS, is falling. Businesses are going
bankrupt because of the deaths of skilled, educated staff members,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of better education are also in tatters. The number of new
teachers trained in Zambia is just keeping pace with the number
felled by AIDS. Children are leaving school because they are
orphaned or forced to work to support their families.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are overwhelmed by AIDS patients. Many have inadequate
supplies of even basic antibiotics to fight the pneumonia,
tuberculosis or mouth fungus that accompany AIDS, let alone the
sophisticated drugs which have eased suffering in rich countries,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Denial continues to be a problem. The report cited a 1999 survey
of 72 minors orphaned by AIDS in a hard-hit Kenyan community:
Although all knew of the disease, none of them believed their
parents had died of it. Most thought witchcraft or a curse was to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said one of the reasons for the explosion of cases in
southern Africa is the legacy of apartheid, which separated men
from their families in rural areas and forced them to work in
towns, with only prostitutes for relief. But he said governments
were also to blame for ignoring the problem for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is happening in southern Africa should be a lesson for
countries today which don't have a big problem yet,'' he said.
''I'm thinking of Asia, I'm thinking of eastern Europe, I'm
thinking of the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   About $4 billion is needed annually for prevention and education
programs to turn the tide, Piot said. He called for debt-relief
programs for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Thurman, director of President Clinton's White House
Office on AIDS policy, said the report urgently underscores the
need for government leaders to face the crisis head on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take the engagement of all sectors of all societies if
we want to win the battle against AIDS,'' Thurman said in a
statement from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asia has relatively low infection rates overall, there
are fears that could change because of the density of its
population. Some 0.7 percent of the Indian population is
HIV-positive, or 3.7 million people overall. The disease has so far
been largely confined to drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Infections in the former Soviet bloc are soaring because of drug
addiction. Piot said the number of new HIV cases in Moscow last
year far outstripped all previous years combined. And the disease
is proliferating in Caribbean countries like Haiti and Barbados
because people have multiple sexual partners from an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloom of the report, Piot said there are signs of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, which used to be the worst-affected country, has slowed
new infections thanks to strong prevention campaigns and increased
condom use. Zambia is following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, the Peace Corps announced a worldwide
campaign to push similar measures -- training its 2,400 volunteers
in Africa in preventive techniques and forming a 200-member
''crisis corps'' to help educate communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no option for any organization working in development
other than to play a role in helping these countries confront the
HIV-AIDS crisis,'' Peace Corps Director Mark Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia, which has the highest rate of infection in Asia at 4.4
percent, is copying Thailand's successful campaign of promoting
condom use. And Brazil's policy of prevention coupled with locally
produced alternatives to high-cost anti-AIDS drugs has halved the
number of deaths and led to huge savings in hospital bills, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the West and in Europe, the impact of treatment has been
spectacular,'' Piot said. ''Mortality has really collapsed. There
is a longer and better life for people with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the report cited studies from Australia and San
Francisco showing that the very success of AIDS therapies has
encouraged a revival in risky behavior, with growing numbers of
young homosexual men having unprotected intercourse and multiple
partners.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - Call it the mystery of the heisted heifer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 500 fiberglass cows placed around the city as part of
CowParade New York 2000 has been stolen, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The cow - painted with orange, red, white, blue, and green
stripes - disappeared from the Richmond Heights section of Queens.
It was last seen at 11 a.m. on Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The statue weighs 80 pounds, and stands 7 feet long, 4 feet tall
and 3 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that sponsored the exhibit, CowParade Holdings,
Inc., offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of anyone responsible for the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cows are here for everyone to enjoy,'' said company
president Jerome Elbaum. ''Pet them, kiss them, take your picture
with them. But why would anyone want to damage these beautiful cows
which were decorated with such love and creativity by talented
artists, including New York City schoolchildren?''

<HEADLINE> Byron Scott to coach Nets, first pick in draft up in the air </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Selecting Byron Scott to coach the
New Jersey Nets turned out to be a no-brainer for Rod Thorn on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Making the decision on the first overall pick in Wednesday's NBA
draft is proving a lot more difficult for the Nets new president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for someone with a lot of energy,'' Thorn said
after giving Scott his first head coaching job. ''I was looking for
somebody who was a good coach, who knew X's and O's, and I was
looking for a real character-type guy. I think Byron brings all of
that to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 39, was given a multiyear contract to replace Don Casey,
who was fired after the Nets (31-51) missed the playoffs for the
second straight year. Terms were not disclosed, but the deal
reportedly covers three years and is worth $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's credentials are impressive. A member of three
championship teams with the Los Angeles Lakers, he developed his
coaching skills while playing under two of the league's top
coaches, Pat Riley and Larry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Scott also walks into a very odd situation. He takes over a team
that has the top pick in a draft that really doesn't have a
can't-miss top pick.
</P>
<P>
   Scott had a definite idea who he wants to take but he didn't say
who it is.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn didn't either because he isn't sure whether the Nets will
use it or trade it, and there have been some interesting deals
offered.
</P>
<P>
   The trading deadline is 2 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the New Jersey does make the pick, Thorn said the final
choices have come down to forwards Kenyon Martin of Cincinnati,
Stromile Swift of LSU and Darius Miles, the high school phenom out
of East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Martin broke his leg in a postseason tournament but Thorn said
team doctors have said the injury is nothing to prevent the Nets
from selecting him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to pick the right one,'' Thorn said. ''Obviously,
Kenyon is more ready, other than his injury, today than the other
two, but you try to project what they're going to be. That's what
gets ticklish. Sometimes guys with great potential realize it and
sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no doubt in Thorn's mind about Scott, who
spent the last two seasons as an assistant coach with the
Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who thought was he going to get the job of replacing
Larry Bird in Indiana, became a candidate for the Nets' job right
after Thorn left the NBA offices to take over the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn and Scott met in Chicago earlier this month and then
returned there 10 days ago and spent five hours talking basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn brought a magnetic board which depicts a court and they
discussed game situations, particularly instances where the Nets
lost games in the fourth quarter, and there were a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the interview, I was amazed with how astute he was with
the X and O part of it,'' said Thorn, who offered Scott the job
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was ready for the interview. He has kept a notebook of how
he would handle late-game situations for the past six years,
something he started in Indiana while playing for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had an answer for everything,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott also has no doubt he'll do a good job, noting that NBA
coach of the year Doc Rivers had no head coaching experience when
he left the television booth to take over the Orlando Magic this
past season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what Doc had going for him is the same things I have
going for me,'' Scott said. ''I played this game, I understand the
players. I understand what it takes to win. I've been to the
mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have achieved unbelievable success in the NBA as a player,''
Scott added. ''So I know what it takes to get to the next level and
I know how to push those buttons. Hopefully, I'll get those guys to
believe in the same things I believe in on both ends of the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott wants the Nets to play an uptempo game, but he admits they
have to play much better defense and rebound a lot better to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just looking forward to coming to New Jersey, having some
fun, and getting this team to the top of the Eastern Conference,''
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was the shooting guard on the Lakers' championship teams
led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson. He played in the
league from 1983-97 with the Lakers, Pacers and Vancouver
Grizzlies. The former Arizona State guard, was the fourth pick in
the 1983 draft.

<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - People here are getting bullish on a wave
of vandalism directed recently at statues of the city's namesake
animal.
</P>
<P>
   At least four of the 39 buffalo statues that have been placed
around the city as part of a nationwide campaign have been
vandalized recently, according to reports. The latest was when a
bison was tipped over and one of its horns broken off.
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested a 23-year-old on charges of criminal
mischief.
</P>
<P>
   The bison are part of a national series of similar animal (and
even vegetable) parades. Other parades include cows in West Orange,
N.J., and Stamford, Conn., pigs in Cincinnati and Peoria, Ill.,
lizards in Orlando, Fla., mermaids in Norfolk, Va., and 6-foot-high

<HEADLINE> Phillips Trial To Start in August  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- A trial on charges that include
beating a girlfriend is scheduled Aug. 16 for Lawrence Phillips, a
one-time Nebraska football star with numerous off-field problems
before and during his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 25, free on bond of $130,000 reduced from an original
$630,000, appeared in Superior Court for arraignment on Tuesday. He
pleaded innocent to a new charge of false imprisonment filed two
weeks after the alleged incident. A pretrial hearing was scheduled
July 19 on four felony charges and two misdemeanor counts.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged beating occurred May 27 when police were called to
Phillips' Beverly Hills residence about 4 a.m. His girlfriend was
treated for injuries at the scene, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is charged with felony counts of false imprisonment,
corporal injury to a cohabitant, making a terrorist threat and
conspiring to dissuade a witness. The misdemeanor counts are having
a concealed firearm in a vehicle and vandalism with damage under
$400. Another misdemeanor charge of carrying a loaded firearm was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The running back has a previous domestic violence conviction,
involving a girlfriend while in college. He pleaded no contest and
was put on probation.
</P>
<P>
   A first-round draft choice of the St. Louis Rams in 1996,
Phillips was later released for insubordination. He played 25 games
for the Rams but his 19 months in St. Louis were marked by three
arrests and 23 days in jail for violating probation after a
drunken-driving arrest in California.
</P>
<P>
   He was subsequently signed by the Miami Dolphins and then
released after a misdemeanor battery conviction in Florida, where
he pleaded no contest to hitting a woman in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   He revived his career as the outstanding runner in NFL Europe in
1999, and was signed by the San Francisco 49ers -- only to be cut
last fall for missing practice.

<HEADLINE> Braves Lift Ban on Announcers  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Paging Mr. Caray, Mr. Van Wieren, Mr. Simpson and
Mr. Sutton. The Atlanta Braves once again have seats for you on
their chartered flights.
</P>
<P>
   A brief feud between the Braves and TBS-Turner Sports, corporate
brothers within the Time Warner family, ended Tuesday when the team
said it would allow the cable channel's four announcers back on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren, Joe Simpson and Don Sutton were
kicked off Monday's chartered flight to Montreal, where the Braves
were playing the Expos in a two-game series, after TBS raised
questions over the weekend about the width of the catcher's box at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The order, apparently made by Braves president Stan Kasten,
forced the announcers to take a commercial flight to Canada. But
the ban was lifted after Kasten talked Tuesday with Turner Sports
president Mark Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's business as usual,'' said Greg Hughes, spokesman for
Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   During the first inning of Saturday night's game against the
Milwaukee Brewers, TBS aired video showing the catcher's box was 4
to 5 inches smaller than it was the previous night, when Milwaukee
management complained about where Braves catcher Javy Lopez was
setting up.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing teams long have claimed that Atlanta pitchers are given
the benefit of an extra-wide strike zone. Catchers who set up wide
of the plate can increase the chances of an outside pitch being
called a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The superimposed video comparing the catcher's box from one
night to the next was shown after a rare balk call against Fernando
Lunar, the Braves' catcher on Saturday night. Plate umpire John
Shulock ruled that Lunar set up with his right foot outside the
43-inch-wide box.
</P>
<P>
   The balk led to Milwaukee's first run and a heated argument
between Shulock and Braves manager Bobby Cox, who was ejected.
Atlanta lost the game 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten, who wouldn't discuss the issue Monday, did not return a
telephone message left at his office Tuesday. In Montreal, Van
Wieren and Caray declined comment, while Sutton would only say,
''It was a family spat and hopefully it's been settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, said the matter was being
investigated by Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, baseball's new vice
president of on-field operations. ''I probably shouldn't comment
until the investigation is completed,'' Alderson said. ''It
shouldn't take that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball announcers generally are employees of the team or a
subsidiary, and usually travel on the club charters.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wieren and Caray have served in the Braves' broadcast booth
since 1976, becoming familiar to millions of baseball fans around
the country through their work on the TBS ''superstation.'' Caray
is the son of late Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Caray and father
of Chip Caray, who works for Fox and the Chicago Cubs' announcing
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, a Hall of Fame pitcher, joined the Braves in 1989 and
Simpson came aboard three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Home-field alterations have been the unspoken norm throughout
baseball's history, with a team tailoring its park to bolster
strengths or hamper the opponent. It's not unusual for a speedy
team to find the infield has been watered down more than usual when
it visits another city. In some cases, a club might allow the grass
to grow higher for the benefit of its slower fielders.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Cleveland owner Bill Veeck was known for ordering
all sorts of methods -- legal and otherwise -- to favor the Indians
at Municipal Stadium. For instance, the groundskeeper would
secretly move the fences back when the opponent was a power-hitting
team. When a team with fewer long-ball hitters came to town, the
fences crept closer to home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten, also president of the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers, was at
the entry draft in Calgary, Alberta, over the weekend when the
dispute began. Lazarus, meanwhile, was en route to London for TNT's
coverage of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The two finally got a chance Tuesday to have a ''long, friendly
conversation,'' Turner Sports said in a statement. ''They are in
complete agreement on how the relationship will work. The
long-standing, warm relationship between TBS and the Braves will
continue as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray and Simpson will remain in Montreal for Wednesday's game,
which is not being televised by TBS but is being carried on the
Braves' radio network. Afterward, Caray will take the team's
chartered flight to New York for a four-game series against the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson has booked a commercial ticket and will stick with those
plans for the New York leg of the trip, Turner officials said. Van
Wieren and Sutton already were scheduled to fly ahead to New York
on a regular flight since they had Wednesday off.

<HEADLINE> Boston Outfielder Disabled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston's decimated outfield took another blow
Tuesday when right fielder Trot Nixon went on the disabled list
with an injured right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, one of the Red Sox' few steady hitters with a .293
batting average, left Friday night's game against Toronto in the
eighth inning with tightness in the hamstring and hasn't played
since. He was put on the disabled list retroactive to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced in right field for Tuesday night's game against
Baltimore by Jeff Frye, Boston's regular second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Boston left fielder Troy O'Leary has been on the disabled list
since June 19, and Darren Lewis is sidelined with tightness in his
left hamstring. Center fielder Carl Everett, who had a root-canal
procedure Tuesday, was replaced in the starting lineup by Curtis
Pride.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox called up Morgan Burkhart, who had 17 homers at
Pawtucket, to take Nixon's roster spot. Burkhart was designated
hitter Tuesday and singled in his first major-league at bat in the
second inning.

<HEADLINE> UNLV Extends Robinson's Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- UNLV football coach John Robinson has agreed to
a contract extension that will keep him at the school through the
2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson led the Rebels to a 3-8 record in his first season,
breaking the school's 26-game road losing streak and its 16-game
overall skid.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV, playing in the Mountain West Conference, won a league road
game for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance also increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the extension shows how successful the relationship
between UNLV and John Robinson has been for both sides,'' athletic
director Charles Cavagnaro said Tuesday. ''He can coach at UNLV as
long as he wants to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his new agreement, Robinson, 64, will receive a 3 percent
raise and earn $365,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was one year into a three-year agreement, which he
signed in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson won a national championship in 1978 at Southern
California. As an NFL coach, he led the Los Angeles Rams to two NFC
championship games.

<HEADLINE> UN: Mongolian Drought Causing Havoc  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A severe drought followed by Mongolia's
worst winter in 30 years has killed millions of livestock, creating
an economic crisis for 500,000 Mongolians, U.N. and Mongolian
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2.2 million cows, horses, camels, goats and sheep
starved or froze to death, leaving some areas with decaying
carcasses every 100 yards, said Douglas Gardner, the U.N.
Development Program's regional disaster coordinator in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   With one third of Mongolia's 2.4 million people directly
dependent on raising livestock, ''this is not just a crisis of
animals,'' Gardner told a news conference, ''it's a human drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Although less than 10 people are believed to have died as a
result of the disastrous weather, it has affected at least half a
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In a documentary presented at U.N. headquarters Tuesday, a
Mongolian herder said he combed his dead goats and sold the
cashmere to buy wheat and flour after most of his livestock died in
the fierce winter, when temperatures dropped as low as minus 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''But what will happen when we run out of this, I just don't
know,'' said 50-year-old herder Ayuurzan, who uses just one name.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has received $371,000 for emergency relief
aid for Mongolia -- just 10 percent of its initial appeal for $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the arrival of the summer has also brought new
dangers and fears of more drought in Mongolia, a vast, sparsely
populated Central Asian nation where approximately one-third of the
people still live a nomadic life.
</P>
<P>
   ''With summer coming there is growing danger of the decaying ...
of dead livestock that could contaminate not only the immediate
environment, but also water resources,'' said Jargalsaikhany
Enkhsaikhan, Mongolia's ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The likelihood of the outbreak of different diseases is quite
high,'' he said. Cholera and other diseases can be transmitted by
contaminated drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressNumber of War Criminals Denied Canadian Entry Grows
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada's war crimes program prevented more accused
war criminals from entering the country and evicted more of them in
1999-2000 than it has in previous years, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   In their annual Report on War Crimes, released Tuesday, the
Justice and Immigration Departments reported that 581 people were
denied entry to Canada and 38 were removed.
</P>
<P>
   The new data come two years after the two departments, along
with the RCMP, received $46.8 million over three years to
investigate and litigate new war crimes cases and improve efforts
abroad to keep suspected war criminals out.
</P>
<P>
   While interested groups say the numbers are encouraging, they
argue the government isn't doing enough to ferret out the last of
the Second World War criminals believed to be still living in
Canada -- and aging quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the government has pursued only 17 such cases. Of
those, two left the country voluntarily and four were found to have
obtained citizenship by misrepresentation. The rest of the cases
are either continuing or have failed.

July 1 Tax Cuts Fatten Paychecks
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The average family could enjoy a couple of extra
pizzas -- with additional toppings -- and maybe a beverage to wash it
all down next month, thanks to federal tax cuts that kick in
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tax reductions announced in the February budget by Finance
Minister Paul Martin take effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Department officials say about 90 per cent of Canadians
will feel the effects.
</P>
<P>
   That includes about 15 million taxpayers who will see their
personal income tax levies reduced.
</P>
<P>
   As well, most families will be affected by improvements to the
Canada Child Tax Benefit on top of the income tax cut, officials
added.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the changes, an average family of four with two
incomes totalling $60,000 will save about $38 a month beginning
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   That would rise to about $41.75 a month -- $501 annually -- next
year, the first full year the cuts apply, officials say.
</P>

Dcotors Release Cost of Smog Study
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Smog will kill about 1,900 Ontario residents this
year and cost the province's economy and health-care system more
than $1 billion, the Ontario Medical Association said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group that represents the province's doctors is offering the
use of groundbreaking new computer software that will allow medical
officers across Canada and anyone else to quantify the effects of
air pollution according to the specific characteristics of their
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The costs of poor air quality are extremely high,'' said Dr.
Ted Boadway, the association's executive director of health policy.
''Air pollution must be reduced. If we can agree on the goals, then
doctors industry, governments and citizens can work together to
bring the human and economic costs of air pollution down
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report called Illness Costs of Air Pollution, researchers
concluded smog costs Ontario residents more than $1 billion a year
in hospital admissions, emergency room visits and absenteeism from
work.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes proposals to monitor Internet in schools  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senators grappling with how best to monitor
the Internet in schools passed two competing proposals Tuesday,
leaving it up to a joint panel to develop a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the two proposals, one by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and the other by Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., both seek to put
certain safeguards in place as the number of schools hooked up to
the Internet continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   But some senators complained that the McCain amendment was too
restrictive for the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain amendment would invite the Federal Communications
Commission ''to be the de facto national censor,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ''This broad self-censoring imposed by the
McCain amendment on schools and libraries will lead to a chilling
of free speech to the detriment of our nation's children and
library patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of schools have started getting connected to the
Internet through a 1996 subsidy known as e-rate, which is funded
through higher phone bills for customers.
</P>
<P>
   About 82 percent of the nation's public schools are
participating in the program, senators said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's amendment, which passed 95-3, would require schools and
libraries who benefit from the subsidy to install some form of
blocking or filtering technology to restrict children's access to
pornography and other obscene material. Voting against McCain's
amendment were Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisc., Sen. Robert Kerrey,
D-Neb. and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we wire America's children to the Internet, we are inviting
these dirt bags to prey upon our children in every classroom and
library in America,'' McCain said. ''Parents, taxpayers, deserve to
have a realistic faith that, when they entrust their children to
our nation's schools and libraries, that this trust will not be
betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But detractors complained that McCain's amendment by allowing
the FCC to certify that schools are using the proper filtering
materials gives the agency too broad authority.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's amendment, which passed 75-24, gives schools the
option of installing the blocking technology or developing an
Internet use policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community, not the federal government, will determine what
matter is inappropriate for minors and what is the most effective
way to protect children,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   The two plans, which were attached to a massive spending plan
for the departments of labor and health and human services, will
now have to be worked out before a conference committee of
Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A less controversial and non-related Internet amendment, offered
by Leahy and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and attached to the McCain
plan, would require large Internet service providers to begin
offering filtering software to customers over the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Welcome Trade Ban Lift  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A senior Cuban official on Tuesday criticized a
U.S. congressional plan that would allow the sale of American food
to Cuba, saying the conditions it appears to impose could worsen a
trade embargo against his island.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said
news reports of the agreement indicated it would impose conditions
on the sale of food, such as refusing U.S. financing for the
purchases, and contained nothing about exports of Cuban goods to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This here not only doesn't modify the blockade but in some
parts makes it worse,'' Alarcon told a forum on state television
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from American farm states and foes of Cuban President
Fidel Castro reached an agreement early Tuesday on a deal to allow
direct sales of U.S. food to the Cuban government for the first
time in nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   While farm-state lawmakers hailed the move as a milestone for
American farmers, others said the agreement was more symbolic
particularly since the deal prohibits the U.S. government or U.S.
banks from financing the sales.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, Cuba imports more than
300,000 tons of rice each year, half of it from Asia. In addition,
Cuba imports about 950,000 tons of wheat a year -- mainly from
Europe. U.S. farm groups say they could provide it all.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cuban shoppers and vendors welcomed word of the
agreement, although they questioned whether it would have any
effect on their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more products there are, the more sales there are,'' said
Yasny Perez Osorio as she presided over piles of cucumbers,
eggplants and garlic for sale at a farmers' market in Havana's
Vedado neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But Aurelio Naranjo, a 74-year-old retiree, questioned whether
the agreement would have much of an impact because it bars both the
American government and U.S. banks from financing such sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big problem,'' he said as he bought 4 pounds of rice --
what he needs to get through the month before he receives a new
rice quota for July. ''We can buy it, but how?''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the agreement in Cuba was almost overshadowed by an
announcement Tuesday in the official daily Granma that Cuba's
government plans to limit consumption of fuel across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of oil coupled with the low price that sugar --
Cuba's main export -- is fetching on world markets left the
government no choice but to order a 5 percent reduction in
consumption of gasoline, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   Granma didn't say what sectors might be affected but reported
that the government had suffered net losses of dlrs 80 million to
dlrs 85 million in the first three months of 2000 because of the
price fluctuations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- New York manager Joe Torre was ejected from the
Yankees' game at Detroit on Tuesday for arguing a double-play call
against his team in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led 3-1 and had the bases loaded with one out when
Chris Turner hit a hard grounder that was stopped by second baseman
Damion Easley. Easley flipped to shortstop Deivi Cruz for one out,
and Cruz's relay to first was ruled in time by first base umpire
Jeff Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   Torre came out to argue the call briefly and returned to the
dugout. He returned after apparently looking at a replay, renewing
the argument before he was ejected by Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   Bench coach Don Zimmer then joined the argument before play
finally resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Replays indicated Turner beat the throw to first. The ejection
was Torre's first since June 12, 1999, at Florida.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Dickson Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Dickson, sidelined for the entire
1999 season after an operation on his right shoulder, had
arthroscopic surgery on the same shoulder Tuesday and will miss the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Dickson was 2-2 with a 6.11 ERA in six starts
and 28 innings this year. He originally was placed on the disabled
list because of soreness in his shoulder on April 30, then went on
the DL again May 19 when he continued to feel pain when he threw.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson was 13-9 with a 4.29 ERA for the Angels in 1997, his
first full season in the majors, and had a 10-10 record in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander had surgery for a torn labrum, the rim-shaped
structure in the shoulder joint, in March 1999. The arthroscopic
surgery on Tuesday revealed additional labrum damage, which was
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, who has a 24-23 career record and 4.90 ERA, is expected
to be ready to pitch again when the Angels report to camp next
spring, according to Angels physician Dr. Lewis Yocum.

   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Villagers in southern
Mexico mistook an 18-year-old man visiting his fiancee's parents
for a robber and beat him to death with clubs and stones, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin Lopez Lopez on Monday was leaving the house in
Tzontehuiwts village, 12 miles northwest of San Cristobal de Las
Casas, when he was attacked by a mob that claimed he had robbed a
store selling subsidized food, the local attorney general's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   The townspeople grabbed Lopez, tied him to a pole holding up a
basketball hoop and beat him.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office said Lopez was innocent of the
theft, and authorities were trying to track down the leader of the
mob.

Report: Airline Service Improving
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline customer service is improving but the industry
still has a long way to go before passenger dissatisfaction with delays, lost
luggage and overbooked flights goes away, federal investigators said today.
Carriers last year staved off legislative action by promising to treat customers
better and to be more forthright with passengers all the way through their
travel experience. Transportation Department inspectors checked earlier this
year to find out whether the airlines were living up to their pledge.
''Bottom-line results to date are mixed,'' they said in a preliminary report to
Congress by the department's inspector general.

Cubans Welcome Trade Ban Lift
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A senior Cuban official today criticized a U.S. congressional
plan that would allow the sale of American food to Cuba, saying the conditions
it appears to impose could worsen a trade embargo against his island. Ricardo
Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said news reports of the
agreement indicated it would impose conditions on the sale of food, such as
refusing U.S. financing for the purchases, and contained nothing about exports
of Cuban goods to the United States. Lawmakers reached an agreement early today
on a deal to allow direct sales of U.S. food to the Cuban government for the
first time in nearly four decades.

NTSB: Airplanes Have Slide Problems
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In more than a third of commercial aircraft evacuations,
at least one inflatable escape slide failed to work properly or at all,
according to a draft of a National Transportation Safety Board study released
today. ''A slide problem in 37 percent of the evacuations in which slides were
deployed is unacceptable for a safety system,'' said NTSB Chairman James Hall.
''It's time for the FAA, the manufacturers, the airlines, the aircraft crews and
the airports to take action to ensure that no one else dies because of poor
aircraft design, inadequate evacuation procedures, inadequate crew training or
inadequate emergency response.''

Bush Rejects Cuba Food Proposal
</SUBHEAD>

   WAYNE, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush rejected an effort by House Republicans
to allow American food into Cuba for the first time since the economic embargo
nearly 40 years ago, saying today that President Fidel Castro might block it
from reaching those who need it. ''I have opposed lifting the sanctions and I
still continue to do so,'' Bush said at a news conference after a welfare reform
event. ''I am very skeptical as to whether or not Fidel Castro will let food get
to his people.''

Justice Dept. Sues To Block Merger

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today sued to stop the merger of
the nation's second- and third-largest long-distance phone companies, saying the

millions of Americans paying more for less. The companies almost immediately
withdrew a merger notification filed with the European Commission but insisted
the proposal was still viable in the United States.

Court ruling on whether the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor would be allowed to
leave the United States. Unless the justices act, Elian could depart for Cuba as
early as 4 p.m. tomorrow. Today, Elian was joined by his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, at a 45-minute prayer service at the United Methodist Building across
the street from the U.S. Capitol, close to the Supreme Court where his fate was
being decided. Elian's Miami relatives have appealed to allow him to stay in the

<HEADLINE> Pirates 6, Cubs 0  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Todd Ritchie pitched a three-hitter to beat
Kerry Wood with his first career shutout, leading the Pittsburgh
Pirates over Chicago 6-0 Tuesday night and extending the Cubs'
losing streak to five.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that took just 2 hours, 5 minutes, Jason Kendall hit a
two-run double off Wood in a five-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles, critical of the Pirates' team chemistry during a
three-game weekend sweep by New York, homered and drove in two runs
as the Pirates won for only the fourth time in 13 games and avoided
what would have been a season-high fifth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   With trade talks continuing to swirl around Sammy Sosa, who
singled for his only hit in four at-bats, the Cubs (30-45) fell a
season-low 15 games below .500 with their sixth loss in seven games
during a 12-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie (5-4), who is being sought by several teams as the
Pirates conduct trade talks with a number of teams, won for the
third time in four decisions. He is 3-0 in five career appearances
against the Cubs, allowing only three runs in 24 1-3 innings over
three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Making his 42nd career start, Ritchie yielded a leadoff double
in the first inning to Eric Young, then cruised, allowing only one
more runner past first. Sosa singled in the seventh and took third
on Jose Nieves' double. but Ritchie stranded the runners by
striking out Henry Rodriguez and Damon Buford to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Wood (3-5) dropped to 0-3 against Pittsburgh, falling behind in
the second on Giles' 21st homer. Wood allowed six runs and five
hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Giles also drew a bases-loaded walk, one of three walks by the
wild Wood, as the Pirates batted around in the fifth inning. John
Vander Wal and Pat Meares singled ahead of Warren Morris' walk,
Kendall's double, two more walks and Kevin Young's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has walked 23 in 36 innings while winning only twice in his
last six starts. In two starts against the Pirates this season,
including an 11-3 loss May 7, he has allowed 13 runs in 8 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pirates are 4-0 against the Cubs. ... Pittsburgh had
lost its last three and eight of its last 12 at Three Rivers
Stadium. ... Brant Brown, who struck out 114 times in 341 Pirates
at-bats last season, struck out as a Cubs pinch-hitter in the sixth
inning. ... The Pirates didn't commit an error after making 10
during a 2-5 road trip to Montreal and New York. ... Beginning
Tuesday, the Pirates play their 12 games leading into the All-Star
break against teams with losing records. ... Sosa's next homer will
be his 150th since the start of the 1998 season. ... The Cubs are
11-24 away from Wrigley Field.

<HEADLINE> Dipoto Making Progress in Rehab  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The skies were darkening, and the Colorado
Rockies, already saddled with 21 games in 20 days before the
All-Star break, were worried that a rainout would worsen that
already overloaded schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no black cloud over the head of Rockies closer
Jerry Dipoto, who frankly couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   Dipoto, on the disabled list for most of this season with a
bulging disk in his neck, threw Monday for the first time since
having surgery May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Dipoto's workout consisted only of about 60 pitches thrown from
60 feet, but it represented a major step in his recovery. Expected
to miss the remainder of the season following his surgery, Dipoto
is ahead of schedule and now hopes to pitch again before the season
is out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ecstatic,'' a beaming Dipoto said. ''I had no pain at all.
My neck felt spectacular. I'll do this every other day and we'll
build up to 150, 180 feet. It's a matter of getting my arm strength
back to where it was. I think my neck has generally healed. My body
strength is good. Everything else is good. It's just a matter of
getting the arm going and of getting back in a pitching rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not having thrown for two months, it's kind of like I'm coming
out of the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The original diagnosis was that I wouldn't pitch again until
next year. So we're well ahead of schedule in that regard. A month
ago I was real down because of the fact I was missing out on a
season where the team was doing so well and I wanted to be a part
of it. Now I'm a little more optimistic that I'll be able to play
again this year. If you're there at the end, boy, you forget a lot
about the five months before.''
</P>
<P>
   Dipoto went to spring training expecting to be the Rockies
closer, a job he held for most of the 1997 and 1998 seasons. When
the disk injury surfaced and intensified, Jose Jimenez slipped into
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell said he was pleased with Dipoto's
limited progress but added, ''We're not going to hurry this thing.
We've got to make sure we do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Tom Probst said team physicians ''have told us that he's
healed very nicely and probably a little bit quicker than they had
thought originally. He has been doing his workouts with Mike Allen,
our physical therapist, and has been progressing very well.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Jose Vidro, Chris Widger and Lee Stevens homered
as the Montreal stopped Tom Glavine's 13-game winning streak
against the Expos, beating the Atlanta Braves 6-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (7-5), who hadn't lost to Montreal in 18 starts since
Aug. 25, 1992, allowed eight hits in six innings, including homers
to Vidro and Widger in the first and Stevens in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine hadn't allowed three homers in the same game since
allowing three to Pittsburgh on July 29, 1991. He gave up six runs,
including four in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also hit three doubles and went 4-for-4 to raise his
average from .251 to .263.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Tony Armas Jr. (3-5) allowed two hits -- including
Chipper Jones' 19th homer -- and one run in 5 1-3 innings before
leaving due to a blister on his right middle finger with a 2-0
count on Jones in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save in 10
chances, taking over the team lead from injured closer Ugueth
Urbina. It was Montreal's 1,000th win at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens doubled in the first, hit his 17th homer in the third --
the 99th of his career -- and doubled in the sixth. He is 23-for-74
(.310) against left-handers this season.
</P>
<P>
   He added a double off reliever Jason Marquis with in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro followed Wilton Guerrero's leadoff single in the first
with his career-high 13th homer, putting Montreal ahead 2-0. Widger
homered two outs later, then Stevens doubled and scored as Jones
threw wildly to first, his eighth error of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After Stevens' homer in the third, Jones' homer cut the lead to
5-1 in the fourth. Orlando Cabrera hit an RBI double in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner singled home a run in the three-run eighth that
also included Wally Joyner's RBI single, third baseman Mike
Mordecai throwing error, and Jones' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Glavine was 3-11 with a 4.92 ERA in 17 starts against
Montreal before beginning his winning streak with a 1-0 win over
the Expos at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on May 19, 1993. ...
Stevens tied the team record of three doubles in a game, previously
achieved 26 times.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Needs Up to 3 Months of Rehab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn will
need two to three months of rehabilitation after having surgery on
his left knee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove small pieces of
cartilage in his left knee joint and will be on crutches for about
four weeks, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors Dr. Jan Fronek and Dr. Steven Copp performed the
surgery at Green Hospital Scripps Clinic in La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has been bothered by inflammation in the knee off and on
this season, and has had to have it drained seven times since
spring training. When he was on the disabled list earlier this
season he had injections of a substance that stimulates bodily
fluid that lubricates the joint.
</P>
<P>
   He has little cartilage left in the joint after five previous
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 40, who reached the 3,000 hit mark last season, has
signed with the Padres through the end of the year with an option
for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-time NL batting champion, who has 3,108 hits in his
19-year career, was hitting .323 with 12 doubles, one homer and 17
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Wife Beats Husband in S.C. House  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The divorce court and the lawyers have
yet to divide up the property, but voters on Tuesday gave Shirley
Hinson her statehouse seat back.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter primary race that became entangled with their bitter
divorce, the two-term state representative, defeated her estranged
husband to win the GOP nomination for her suburban district about
20 miles from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled. I couldn't be happier. And I'm glad it's over,''
Shirley Hinson said. ''It says negative campaigning is not what the
people want. I have always run a positive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Hinson captured 52 percent of the vote in the runoff for
the Republican nomination. The win is tantamount to election
because Democrats did not offer a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Hinson said he would do whatever he could to
support his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had many years of a very good marriage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Hinson, a former school board member, said her husband's
aggressive election campaign was all about revenge. But Jimmy
Hinson, a retired school principal, said he was running to improve
education.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's well-known marital difficulties -- which includes
alleged death threats, rumors of infidelity, jail time and a
restraining order -- pushed aside most other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jimmy Hinson was charged with making a telephone
death threat to another GOP legislator, based on rumors that the
legislator and Shirley Hinson were having an affair. A grand jury
refused to indict Jimmy Hinson, though a private investigator
described nighttime meetings between Shirley Hinson and her fellow
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Both denied they were ever romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Hinsons ran in a three-way primary two weeks ago, neither
getting the more than 50 percent required to avoid a runoff.
Shirley Hinson got 42 percent of the primary vote; her husband got
32 percent. The rest went to a third-place candidate who later
endorsed Jimmy Hinson.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 11, Blue Jays 1  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Cox hit his first career grand
slam and Fred McGriff went 3-for-3 with three RBIs Tuesday night as
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat Toronto 11-1 to stop the Blue Jays'
five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel (6-7) allowed seven hits, struck out one and
walked four in five innings to win for the third time in four
decisions. He worked out of jams in each of the first three innings
and departed after throwing 103 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays pitchers halted the Blue Jays' club-record stretch of
23 consecutive games with at least one homer -- two shy of the major
league record. The Blue Jays' winning streak had vaulted them over
New York and Boston into the AL East lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado went 2-for-4, extending his career-high hitting
streak to 20 games, and Brad Fullmer drove in a run with a
third-inning sacrifice fly for the Blue Jays, who had hit multiple
homers in eight straight games -- one short of the major league
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Cox homered off Kelvim Escobar (6-9) during a seven-run fourth
inning. McGriff singled with the bases loaded to drive in two runs
in the first and also had a RBI single off Escobar in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff's perfect night gave him nine hits in his last 11
at-bats. He's 7-for-11 against Escobar, who allowed nine runs and
nine hits in 3 1-3 innings. Ozzie Guillen drove in Tampa Bay's last
two runs with a sixth-inning single off Matt DeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto stranded seven runners in the first three innings, yet
only trailed 2-1 before Tampa Bay broke open the game in the fourth
with help from an error by rookie shortstop Chris Woodward, subbing
for the injured Alex Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Smith singled, Jose Guillen doubled and Ozzie Guillen
walked to load the bases with no outs in the Devil Rays fourth.
After Escobar struck out Felix Martinez, the right-hander got Randy
Winn to hit a sharp grounder to shortstop that should have led to
an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward booted the grounder, allowing Smith to score. Two
pitches later, Cox homered to make it 7-1 and give Tampa Bay grand
slams in consecutive games for the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillen hit a grand slam in a loss to Texas on Sunday.
Cox's slam was the fourth by a Devil Ray this season, surpassing
the club record of three set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The first inning has been troublesome for Escobar. In seven
starts since May 19, 16 of the 30 runs he's allowed have come in
the opposition's first at bat ... McGriff's 57 RBIs are the second
most he's ever had at this point in a season. In 1996, he had 63 on
his way to a career-high 107. He's driven in 15 runs in his last 14
games ... Trachsel made his team-high 17th start for Tampa Bay. He
hasn't missed a scheduled turn on the mound since his ending his
only stay on the disabled list in August 1994. That was 180 starts
ago ... The Devil Rays have homered in seven straight games, tying
a club record accomplished twice last year.

<HEADLINE> United States 0, Brazil 0, Tie  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Brazil and the United States played to a
0-0 tie in the Women's Gold Cup on Tuesday night, then the
Americans won a coin toss that will probably help them avoid a
semifinal matchup with potent China.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly missed a penalty kick in the final minute after
Formiga was called for a foul in the penalty box when she undercut
Julie Foudy. Lilly short-legged the kick low and just to the left
of Brazilian goalkeeper Andreia, who easily made the save.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams finished 2-0-1 in group play and had already clinched
berths in the semifinals. Goal differential is the first
tie-breaker, but the teams had identical scores in their early
games, each beating Trinidad and Tobago 11-0 and Costa Rica 8-0 in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   So the teams tossed a coin to decide who would play the Group B
winner, most likely China. After the match, event organizer Jill
Fracisco tossed a coin at midfield; Brazil called tails, and the
coin came up heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese play Mexico on Wednesday; Canada plays Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   China has historically been one of the toughest opponents for
the United States, posting six wins and six ties in 23 meetings.
The Americans have won the biggest ones, though, beating China 2-1
in the gold medal game of the 1996 Olympics, and then on penalty
kicks to win the 1999 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 16,386 watched the teams play an uneventful and
scoreless first half, with the excitement rising in the second as
the United States dominated play.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's best chance came when Nildinha had a chance from the
left of the goal in the 75th minute. But she kicked it right into
Siri Mullinix's arms. Katia Da Silva had a chance just at the right
of the net in the 81st minute, but Mullinix deflected the shot
away.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Jacqueline Alvarez scored during injury time as
Costa Rica rallied from a two-goal deficit to tie Trinidad and
Tobago 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and Tobago took a 2-0 lead on goals by Delia De Silva
and Natalie Des Vignes. But Xiomara Briceno scored for Costa Rica
in the 83rd minute, and Alvarez tied it in the 90th.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Accord Deadline Passes  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying Fiji hostage-takers, the country's
military rulers said Wednesday they would appoint a civilian
government without consulting further with the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels holding Fiji's government hostage have demanded a
presence on the interim government before releasing their
prisoners, who include deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after a rebel leader, once an
officer in an elite British anti-terrorism unit, warned that the
captives will die if the army tries to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will die with the hostages,'' Maj. Ilisoni Ligairi told The
Associated Press Tuesday in an interview inside the parliamentary
compound where 27 members of the ousted government are being held
captive. ''Blood will be shed'' in any rescue attempt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fijians believe Ligairi is as powerful, or even more so,
than George Speight, the former insurance and timber executive who
has dominated headlines in recent weeks as the gunmen's loquacious
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Ligairi's tough talk came as Fiji's army issued issued an
ultimatum late Tuesday giving Speight 24 hours to agree to sign an
accord which paved the way for the hostages immediate release, and
set out procedures to appoint the new government.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight quickly rejected the military's ultimatum, saying
any attempt to appoint a new government without the rebels' input
''will invite the wrath of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said Wednesday
the deadline had passed without a positive response from the
rebels, and that the army would proceed to name the new government.
</P>
<P>
   He gave no further details, saying the army's position would be
outlined in a news conference later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke down between the gunmen and the military at the
weekend after Speight backed down and refused to sign the accord,
despite saying earlier he would do so, and issued new demands.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, the rebels stormed parliament and took the government
hostage, claiming to be acting on behalf of Fiji's indigenous
majority whose rights had been trampled upon by Chaudhry -- who was
the country's first prime minister of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels released their four remaining female hostages on
Sunday, but instead of easing tensions, the release was accompanied
by a renewed breakdown in talks to free the other 27 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rebels' demands to disenfranchise Fiji's Indians
have already been met, including the firing of Chaudhry and the
elimination of the country's 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff, now in its sixth week, has pitted Fiji's poor
indigenous majority against its relatively affluent Indian
minority, whose ancestors were brought to Fiji by English
colonialists over a century ago to work in the country's rich sugar
cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims to be acting on behalf of indigenous Fijians,
whose rights, the rebels say, were being trampled by Chaudhry. The
rebel raid has sent the economy into a tailspin and raised concern
in the international community that Fiji has descended into racism
and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Ligairi, 62, who served for more than two decades in Britain's
elite Special Air Service -- a top commando unit in charge of
hostage rescues -- said his captives will not be released until the
gunmen are assured of a presence in the interim government.
</P>
<P>
   He said the non-Christian hostages, including Chaudhry, a Hindu,
were being given lessons in Christianity because ''what we are
fighting for is a Christian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligairi ruled out allowing any Fijians of Indian descent
positions in the interim administration. ''If you really believe in
your teachings,'' he said, ''you can't let any other faiths come in
and run your house.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies 7, Brewers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling tossed eight shutout innings
and Desi Relaford drove in four runs including a bases-clearing
double as the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Milwaukee Brewers
7-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive strong outing for Schilling (3-4),
who allowed six hits, struck out six and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who retired nine batters in a row from the fourth
inning through the sixth, worked out of trouble in the seventh
after yielding consecutive singles to Charlie Hayes and Tyler
Houston. Schilling fanned Jose Hernandez and got Henry Blanco to
bounce into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia grabbed the momentum in the sixth when starter
Jimmy Haynes (7-7) unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, who allowed just a single to Schilling through the first
five innings, surrendered back-to-back doubles to Bobby Abreu and
Scott Rolen. He hit Mike Lieberthal and walked Mickey Morandini to
load the bases before Relaford drove in three with a double to
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The shortstop, who leads the majors with 19 errors, was benched
for three games on Philadelphia's just-completed road trip for his
defensive woes.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford's RBI double and a two-run double by pinch-hitter Rob
Ducey in the eighth, made it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes allowed four runs and four hits in 5 1-3 innings,
striking out five and walking five.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling got the first hit off Haynes in the fourth when he
bounced a ball up the middle just out of the reach of second
baseman Ron Belliard. The ball hit second base umpire Scott Packard
in the leg and dribbled into right field, allowing Schilling to
take second.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard and Marquis Grissom led off the first against
Schilling with consecutive singles and moved into scoring position
on a wild pitch. Schilling struck out Geoff Jenkins, got Jeromy
Burnitz to pop up and retired Charlie Hayes on a grounder to end
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling faced another second-and-third situation in the fourth
with two outs and got Jose Hernandez to pop out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phillies starter Robert Person, disabled since June 19, was
examined by Dr. Craig Morgan who confirmed a right shoulder strain.
Person, 5-2 with a 3.17 ERA in 14 starts, is expected to return to
the rotation following the All-Star break. ... Milwaukee pitchers
lead the majors in walks with 387. .... Milwaukee's Tyler Houston,
in just his eighth start at first base this season, made a great
diving stop to rob Schilling of a hit in the third. ... Phillies
catcher Mike Lieberthal has throw out 11 of 19 base stealers in his
last 24 games. He caught Grissom at second base in the third. ...
The Phillies are 14-9 in June, clinching their first winning month
this season.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kenny Lofton left the Cleveland Indians'
game against the Kansas City Royals in the seventh inning after
being hit in the right knee by a pitch from Brett Laxton on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton was hit by Laxton's first pitch with no outs and a runner
on first. He dropped to the ground and was helped from the field
without putting pressure on the leg. Lofton was replaced on the
bases by Jolbert Cabrera,
</P>
<P>
   The Indians led 4-1 at the time. Laxton, who had relieved Kansas
City starter Mac Suzuki with one out in the sixth inning, retired
the final two batters of the sixth before giving up a leadoff
single to Sandy Alomar before Lofton's at-bat.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Unveils Environment Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Under fire from environmentalists, the Coca-Cola
Co. said Tuesday that it would have in place new policies on the
use of hydrofluorocarbons in refrigeration by the time of the 2004
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental watchdog Greenpeace has targeted the Atlanta-based
company in Australia, accusing Coke of breaking ''Green Games''
environmental guidelines, including bans on HFCs, which have been
linked to global warming, at Olympic sites. The guidelines formed
an integral part of Sydney's bid to serve as host of the 2000
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement in Sydney and Atlanta, Coca-Cola chairman
Doug Daft detailed a new environmental policy for cold drink
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will intensify our efforts to support research and
innovation to accelerate the technological development of more
environmentally friendly equipment,'' Daft said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the initiative includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- By the Olympics in Athens four years from now, the company
will no longer purchase cold drink equipment using
hydrofluorocarbons as refrigerant gases or insulation when
cost-efficient alternatives are available.
</P>
<P>
   -- Between now and 2004, Coca-Cola will expand its research and
development program to identify and field test a variety of
alternative refrigeration methods.
</P>
<P>
   -- Suppliers will be required to announce schedules to use only
HFC-free foam insulation and refrigerant in all new cold drink
equipment by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   -- In accord with the international Kyoto Agreement on climate
change, the company is requiring suppliers to develop, by the end
of the decade, new equipment that is 40-50 percent more energy
efficient than today's.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists estimate Coca-Cola will have 1,700
refrigerators using HFCs in Sydney and only 100 coolers that comply
with the ''Green Games'' guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has said the cooling equipment to be used at Olympic
sites was a ''significant advance'' in energy efficiency and that
commercial drink coolers using alternative refrigerants were not
commercially available on a scale required for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Situation 'Deplorable'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Describing the situation in Afghanistan as
''deplorable,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Tuesday that
warring factions appeared to be preparing for a major offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In a written report to the Security Council and General
Assembly, Annan warned that the ruling Taliban militia -- which
controls 90 percent of Afghanistan -- still harbors ''hopes of a
military victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups who control parts of the north also believe
they ''can redress the balance of power through gains on the
ground,'' Annan said, appealing to both sides to return to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general welcomed the peace initiative sponsored by
the Organization of the Islamic Conference and supported by
neighboring Pakistan, seen as one of the main supporters of the
hardline Muslim Taliban, and Iran, which is believed to support the
northern-based alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Although outside interference in Afghanistan continues, Annan
said neighboring countries were beginning to realize that peace
would better serve their national interests than supporting one of
the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   But the OIC-sponsored agreement between the Taliban and the
opposition groups signed in March to exchange war prisoners,
refrain from attacking civilians, and ensure free access to
humanitarian aid, had not been implemented, the secretary-general
lamented.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a comprehensive strategy to achieve a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ''the situation of the Afghan people remains
deplorable,'' Annan said, stating that poverty in the country has
been further exacerbated by the worst drought to hit the region in
30 years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Congressman  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton paid tribute to the
environmental accomplishments of Rep. Bruce Vento, a Minnesota
Democrat who is retiring at the end of the year because of lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has steered into law more than 300 bills to protect our
natural resources,'' Clinton said Tuesday night at a dinner held in
Vento's honor, which raised more than $500,000 for a scholarship in
the congressman's name to help recruit science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I like even more about Bruce Vento is he cares about
people, especially people without a voice -- the homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that it was appropriate that the dinner was held
the day after scientists announced that they had mapped the human
genetic code. Vento was a science and social studies teacher before
he became a congressman 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bruce said, 'Well, that's exciting. Now we have to have find a
few science teachers to explain what it means,''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Vento had been a friend and trusted adviser
throughout his presidency. ''He never stopped being a teacher,'' he
said. ''Bruce, your influence will never stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Vento, 59, who represents St. Paul, said that one of the first
calls he got after announcing his retirement was from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday night, Clinton attended an annual conference that
Democratic Rep. Ruben Hinojosa holds for residents of his Texas
district. The event was closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also attended a fund-raiser for California state Sen.
Adam Schiff, a Democrat challenging GOP Rep. James Rogan in one of
the most closely watched races in Congress. Schiff's campaign
estimated the event at the Frederick Douglass Museum in Washington
raised $250,000 from about 150 people.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Rodriguez Accepts Demotion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Struggling Mets reliever Rich Rodriguez accepted
a demotion to Triple-A Norfolk on Tuesday and will spend the next
two weeks in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   New York recalled right-hander Eric Cammack from Norfolk to take
Rodriguez's place on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who signed a $1.5 million, two-year contract with New
York in the offseason, is 0-1 with a 7.67 ERA in 23 appearances. He
has mostly been used in mopup duty, but has struggled in that role.
</P>
<P>
   In his last appearance, Rodriguez entered with one out in the
eighth inning with a 10-3 lead. He allowed five of six batters to
reach, including two RBI singles, before being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives him a chance to get some work, get his rhythm back
and a chance to pitch,'' general manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, in his 11th season, had the right to refuse the
demotion but chose to take the opportunity. He will be recalled
July 13 after the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Bobby J. Jones recently accepted a 10-day
assignment to Norfolk and returned last week, beating Pittsburgh
8-1.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Joins Israel Gov't Talks  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Backed by U.S. muscle, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met with his coalition partners on Tuesday to persuade them
to back the far-reaching concessions he believes Israel will have
to make for a permanent peace treaty with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak brought Dennis Ross, the top U.S. envoy to the region,
with him to the meeting just hours before the arrival of Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who is attempting to convene an
Israeli-U.S.-Palestinian leadership summit to spur the peace
negotiations to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is trying to determine if the time is right for a
summit, but at this stage there is no basis for one, a senior U.S.
official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Clinton would
decide whether the time is right to convene a summit after Albright
flies home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross's presence was a rare occurrence at an internal Israeli
political meeting, and one that underscored the U.S. stake in
concluding a deal by the September deadline the sides have set for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the six parties in Barak's unwieldy coalition
have said they would pull out if Barak makes the far-reaching
concessions that have been leaked to the media in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   That could cripple Barak's ability to make peace, and the prime
minister apparently brought Ross to remind his partners of the
interest Israel's closest ally has in a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak acknowledged he needed the two parties -- the pro-Jewish
settlements National Religious Party and the Russian immigrant
Israel B'Aliya party -- if and when he convenes a summit with the
U.S. and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them with us the whole way, until a summit,'' he said
after the coalition briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, who heads Israel B'Aliya,
would not elaborate on Barak's presentation, except to say that if
Barak goes to a summit in Washington on the terms he outlined on
Tuesday, ''I'm out of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Likud opposition wasted no time in mocking Barak for
inviting an ''American Uncle'' as an enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   ''A senior U.S. official comes to a political meeting to help
the prime minister solve a political problem,'' Likud legislator
Danny Naveh told Israel television. ''That crosses a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Jewish settlers demonstrated in Jerusalem against
U.S. interference, gathering outside the hotel where Albright was
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators held up signs warning, ''Clinton, God will punish
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli radio stations reported that Barak told his coalition
partners that Israel would have to hand back at least 85 percent of
the West Bank, matching what some Palestinians have said is the
minimum required for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office immediately denied that numbers were raised at
the meeting. Palestinian officials, speaking off the record, have
said that Barak has in recent days offered 92 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak brought Ross to the meeting just hours ahead of Albright's
arrival in Jerusalem to discuss convening the summit between Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is reluctant to agree to a summit, fearing U.S. mediators
will side with Israel on many issues and that he will be pressured
into concessions during a summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not against the summit, but first negotiations should
be able to bridge the gaps so the leaders would only have to deal
with limited issues,'' one of his top advisers, Nabil Abourdeneh,
told The Associated Press. ''We are against going to a summit that
would fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants the top-level gathering, saying lower-level
negotiators have exhausted their options.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations with the Palestinians have reached a stage in
which the leaders ... have to take difficult decisions,'' Barak's
senior policy adviser, Danny Yatom, told Israel army radio.
</P>
<P>
   While the sides appear close on one of three crucial issues --
borders -- significant differences remain on the other two,
Jerusalem and refugees. Arafat wants nothing less than a capital in
east Jerusalem; Barak is reportedly offering only civil control of
Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The widest differences are over the descendants of Palestinian
refugees created by Israel's independence war in 1948: Palestinians
want at least a symbolic right of return; Israel sees even that as
undermining its legitimacy, and instead proposes international aid
to resettle Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also want Israel to carry out an additional West
Bank troop withdrawal and release Palestinian security prisoners
before a summit.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate Vows To Forge On  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Running a distant third in the polls,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas angrily rejected an offer Tuesday to join
forces with an opponent, turning down the opposition's last chance
to unite before Sunday's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, who is running
neck-and-neck with the ruling party's Francisco Labastida in the
polls, made an emotional plea last week for Cardenas to join him in
ending the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas -- making his third bid for the presidency in what
many see as his last hurrah -- denied in an interview with The
Associated Press that he would even consider throwing his votes to
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Fox wants an opposition victory, then he should stand
aside, he should go home, go back to his ranch and his businesses,
and get out of politics,'' Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, however, told hundreds at a rally Tuesday in the southern
Mexican city of Tapachula in the troubled state of Chiapas that he
is the only one who can topple the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the attacks by Cardenas, Fox said: ''Who is
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas? That subject doesn't interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, meanwhile, claimed his center-left Democratic
Revolution Party ''definitely'' still has a chance to win the
presidential race, despite the fact that almost all polls show him
with less than 20-percent support among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida was favored by 42 percent of likely voters, and Fox by
39 percent, in a poll released Friday by ACNielsen. The poll had a
margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas declined to say whether he thought the presidential
campaign had been fair to date. But he pledged that if Sunday's
vote is free of fraud, ''we will accept the results, whatever they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that ''if the process is not clean, we won't accept
any results at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Fox and Cardenas on an alliance broke down amid
bickering late last year. While election law bars any formal
alliance at this late date, candidates could still make de-facto
endorsements of each other. One of the smaller-party candidates
already has told his supporters to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas denied speculation that by focusing his criticism on
Fox instead of Labastida, he is actually paving the way for another
in a string of ruling-party victories stretching back to 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are more of the slander and lies which you people in the
media spread sometimes,'' he said. ''We had to respond to Fox, and
his lies. We are certain that if Fox wins, the country will go from
bad to worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Cardenas focused his fire on Fox, more evidence
emerged that the ruling party, known as the PRI, may be using
government resources to defeat the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Villahermosa, capital of the Gulf coast state of Tabasco,
employees of Mexico's state-run oil company said Monday that the
company and union officials were pressuring them to vote for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Pemex workers Jose Luis Rosas Munoz and Gilberto Quintero Reyes
showed reporters forms from the Union of Petroleum Workers in
Mexico that required members to give the number of their voting
credential and vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are obliged to sign these forms,'' Rosas said. ''If we
refuse, we run the risk of administrative officials refusing to
lend us money and give us a line of credit for living expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers also showed reporters an e-mail from the secretary
of management of Pemex Gas that encouraged workers to ''fill out
the form with the names of voters that you have secured.''
</P>
<P>
   The return addresses on the forms were of Pemex offices --
despite a law forbidding use of government installations for
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Pemex workers in Monterrey, capital of the northern state of
Nuevo Leon, voiced similar concerns Monday, saying company and
union officials had required them to vote for Labastida or risk
losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the company denied accusations of vote coercion -- but

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Double Gold Winner Retires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Danyon Loader, who won two gold
medals at the Atlanta Olympics, has retired from swimming after
failing in his first attempt to qualify for New Zealand's team for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Laing, who coached Loader to gold in the 200- and
400-meter freestyle in 1996, said it was clear his swimmer's
attitude had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't surprised,'' Laing said Wednesday. ''We discussed it
during the week in Christchurch and he didn't say he was going to
retire but I could almost read it in his mind. It was sad moment
when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Loader, 25, attempted to qualify for Sydney at last week's
Oceania championships in Christchurch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the youngest member of the New Zealand team at the 1990
Auckland Commonwealth Games and am now the oldest male, so I feel
the time is right to move on,'' Loader said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been swimming competitively since 1987, those 13 years
comprising half of my life, and the desire and incentive to race
has diminished.''

<HEADLINE> Nets Face Conundrum With Martin  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kenyon Martin sat in the corner of a hotel
conference room Tuesday, choosing his words carefully as he spoke
about the right leg he broke three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm walking around. I could shoot a little if I chose to,''
Martin said. ''I could probably do what I want -- no matter what the
doctors say.''
</P>
<P>
   But the doctors are telling Martin to sit tight, and he has
barely picked up a basketball since breaking his fibula in a
Conference USA tournament game. And if Martin, a power forward from
Cincinnati, is selected first overall in the NBA draft, some team
will be making a leap of faith that Martin's fractured fibula is
structurally sound.
</P>
<P>
   That huge piece of uncertainty was a major factor for the Nets
as the hours ticked down toward the draft. New Jersey owns the No.
1 pick, and new team president Rod Thorn spent the better part of
Tuesday trying to figure out whether to keep the pick or trade it.
The Orlando Magic were among the teams making a strong push to
acquire the pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night at 12:15 I got a call from a coach who made a very
interesting offer. We've gotten one more today that's never been on
the table before. I expect more offers,'' Thorn said. ''I've seen a
couple of things that have made be sit back and think.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots and lots of other trade rumors were floating around the
league, and the consensus was that there should be a significant
reshuffling of the decks before the last of the 58 draft picks are
made Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando holds picks No. 5, 10 and 13, making the Magic the first
team ever to have three lottery picks in a single draft. Orlando
also has about $16 million in salary cap room and would like to
clear about $3 million more in order to make an unfettered run at
two high-profile free agents.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to clear that much room, the Magic would need to
trade Derek Strong and two of the picks. And that's why all eyes
were on Thorn and Orlando general manager John Gabriel to see if
they would pull off a swap that would severely impact the draft
plans of other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls also were trying to clear extra cap room by
trading Hersey Hawkins and his $4.5 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   If no trades are made, the top of the draft is expected to go
like this: Martin to the Nets, LSU's Stromile Swift to Vancouver,
Iowa State's Marcus Fizer to the Los Angeles Clippers and high
school star Darius Miles to the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the next four picks belong to Orlando, Atlanta,
Chicago and Cleveland. The players expected to go in that range
include two centers, Texas' Chris Mihm and Minnesota's Joel
Przybilla, along with Fresno State guard Courtney Alexander and
Florida forward Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there's an interesting array of point guards, power
forwards and Eurocenters and a shortage of pure shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Most active of all the 29 teams will be the Bulls, who have
stockpiled draft picks and salary cap room. This will be one of the
most important days in the post-dynasty rebuilding being undertaken
by owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause, and
Chicago will have plenty of options with three first-round picks
(Nos. 4, 7 and 24) and three consecutive picks early in the second
round (Nos. 32-34).
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a bunch of options with trades and draft choices,''
Krause said Tuesday. ''We're listening, and the party's just
getting started. The NBA draft is traditionally a late-night party.
We've been doing a lot of talking, and I'm sure we'll be here late
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top players met with the media Tuesday afternoon,
and all of them had heard the multitude of rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was well aware of the talk about a Magic-Nets trade that
would send him to Orlando, although he wouldn't reveal his
preference for a future place of employment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not telling you. That's my honest answer,'' Martin said.
''I don't have a home. I'm a nomad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets ran a battery of tests on Martin's leg and had their
doctors take an extra close look at the injury. Martin also visited
Vancouver and Orlando, although he said the Magic's doctors did not
look at his leg.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus national player of the year, Martin is a 6-foot-9
forward who averaged 18.9 points while shooting 57 percent from the
field last season. He listed Kevin Garnett and Karl Malone as the
players he most respected; Garnett for his intensity and Malone for
his durability.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a bit undersized for the position, the Nets would
be expected to use him at center in place of Jayson Williams, whose
career is being brought to a premature end because of a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' injury, along with an injury that will keep Kerry
Kittles sidelined at the start of the season, is why the Nets might
be a little more skittish than most about picking a player coming
off such an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never missed a day of rehab,'' Martin said. ''I told myself
I was going to fight back from this no matter how long it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift, a 6-9 forward who averaged 16.2 points and shot 61
percent from the field last season as a sophomore, was surrounded
Tuesday by Vancouver media eager to hear from the rarest species of
player -- one who says he wouldn't mind playing in what is often
considered the NBA's Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying I want to go to Vancouver, but I wouldn't mind
playing there,'' Swift said. ''Most people have their own
perception of Vancouver and they've never been there. They're just
going by rumors. But I liked the city and the people, and I had fun
when I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, a 6-8 forward who averaged 22.8 points while shooting 58
percent from the field, seemed resigned to the likelihood that he's
headed to the Clippers, the league's perennial doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Michael Olowokandi and Lamar Odom before him, Fizer tried
to look at the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has to start somewhere,'' Fizer said. ''The Clippers
have had a bad rap, but if they get this player or that player, who
knows whether they'll turn around?''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, too, whether the Clips will pass on Fizer and take
Miles -- an event that could cause a whole other reshuffling for the
rest of the lottery teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers, Mavericks, SuperSonics, Trail Blazers and Raptors
have been trying to move up.

<HEADLINE> Polo Magazine May Ride Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Polo Magazine may yet ride again under its
old name.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lower-court
ruling denying the magazine the right to use the name ''Polo.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling orders the lower court to find a less drastic remedy
than forbidding the magazine all use of the Polo name.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a federal magistrate ruled the magazine, published by
Houston-based Westchester Media Co., caused consumer confusion with
New York fashion house Polo Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5th Circuit ruled there was no evidence of confusion,
and that the lower court erred in not allowing the magazine to
include a disclaimer that it was unrelated to Polo Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ''Westchester is happy that the court finally realizes that
Westchester has the right to publish a magazine called Polo,'' said
Tom Godbold, the company's attorney. ''The bottom line is we feel
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Polo Ralph Lauren representatives by telephone
were unsuccessful Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the bi-monthly magazine has been on hold since
October because of the legal wrangling. Godbold said Westchester
intends to resume publication, but he was unsure when.
</P>
<P>
   Polo Ralph Lauren asked Westchester to drop the Polo name in
1998 when it changed from a small polo-oriented publication into a
slick, lifestyle-oriented magazine producing 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester sued the clothier to protect the name it copyrighted
in 1992 as the official publication of the U.S. Polo Association.
</P>
<P>
   The court also chided Polo Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ''PRL products became famous by basking in the reflected glow of
an elegant sport. PRL now asserts that it, not the sport, is the
source of the glow,'' the court wrote. ''In a sense, PRL is biting
the hand that fed it.''

<HEADLINE> Counterfeits Cost Russia Millions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At least 40 percent of alcohol produced in Russia
is bootleg, contributing to millions of dollars of potential tax
revenues the government is losing annually to counterfeit goods,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From 40 to 50 percent of Russia's alcohol is not licensed, as is
35 to 45 percent of tobacco produced in Russia, said Vladimir
Samoilenko, who heads a tax and investment center for former Soviet
republics, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Samoilenko was speaking at an international conference in Moscow
on property rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government loses hundreds of millions of dollars
annually because of counterfeit goods, the director of Russia's
Patent Committee, Alexander Korchagin, was quoted as telling the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Korchagin said 1,000 criminal proceedings were instituted last
year over ownership rights, ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Russian officials claimed to be making progress on
stemming the illegal alcohol trade, bringing it down to 35 percent
of all alcohol production. But bootleg alcohol is still widely
available and inexpensive, and the poor quality contributes to
thousands of alcohol poisoning deaths every year.

<HEADLINE> Second suspect convicted in murder of elderly women  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - A 20-year-old man was convicted of
murder Tuesday, the second person linked to a burglary that ended
in the bludgeoning death of two elderly women.
</P>
<P>
   A jury deliberated 10 years before convicting George Johnson
Tuesday. The Schenectady man was convicted of 10 counts against him
including murder and burglary. He faces 15 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Matilda DiMaria Montenaro, 84, and her sister-in-law, Lois
DiMaria, 81, were found dead Dec. 16, 1998 in different rooms of
the city house they shared. A fire was set after the slayings, and
investigators discovered the women's bodies while responding to an
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   After the murders, upset community leaders and outraged citizens
raised a reward of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the crime is Terrence Travis Townsend, 19, of
Schenectady, charged with two counts of first-degree burglary.
Townsend was not charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said much of the evidence for Townsend's charges
came from testimony he and another suspect, Aaron Umber, gave at a
sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Umber, 22, has admitted to two counts of second-degree murder
and related charges of robbery, burglary and arson in exchange for
a maximum prison term of 40 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent L. O'Connor, 31, has not been charged in connection with
the killings but prosecutors are introducing evidence linking him
to the crimes in order to get him a maximum term of life in prison
as a persistent felony offender.

	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) - A small airplane lost power 15,000 feet
above Albany International Airport then made a forced crash landing
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the 10 p.m. crash landing on Runway 1 at the
airport, according to airport spokesman Doug Myers.
</P>
<P>
   The three men were en route from Rochester to Connecticut when
the Piper Malibu lost all power, Myers said. The pilot circled the
airport twice then approached the runway from the south.
</P>
<P>
   When he landed the plane, the nose gear was either still in the
raised position or collapsed upon impact, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Runway 1 was closed for about an hour but Myers said no flights
were delayed as a result of the crash.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers oppose patent extension for allergy drug Claritin  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers renewed
efforts Tuesday to block a patent extension for the allergy drug
Claritin, fearing that supporters will try to add the provision to
one of the spending bills now moving through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are sick and tired of this kind of wheeling and
dealing,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ''Who in the world are
we representing? The pharmaceutical companies that are making
obscene profits off the misery, illness and sickness of people? Or
are we representing the people back in our states?''
</P>
<P>
   Claritin now sells for up to $2.66 per tablet, a price so high
some health insurance companies have stopped paying for it. The
expiration of the patent would allow cheaper, generic versions of
the drug to be developed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough, which makes
Claritin, has sought legislation that would allow it to seek a
three-year extension of its patent, scheduled to expire in 2002.
Supporters of the provision have tried to add it to one of the
must-pass spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a supporter of
the extension, acknowledged that a draft with his name on it had
been circulated on Capitol Hill. But he said his staff had drafted
the provision without his knowledge or instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone is attempting to attach such legislation to an
appropriations bill, it is not me,'' said Hatch, who made use of
Schering-Plough's private jet during his presidential campaign last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The issue grew out of a 1984 bill, when Congress extended the
patents of future drugs by five years in recognition of the lengthy
approval process by the Food and Drug Administration. Drugs already
being reviewed by the FDA, like Claritin, got two-year extensions.
Because Claritin wasn't approved for another nine years,
Schering-Plough has argued that it should be allowed to seek an
additional three-year extension of its patent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a matter of Schering-Plough asking that they be given
an opportunity to have their day in court to prove they should be
treated like other drug companies who were granted a five-year
patent extension, instead of a two-year extension,'' said Linda
Daschle, a Schering-Plough lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle is married to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota. To avoid any conflict, she is lobbying only the
House, not the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another senator opposing the extension, Republican Jim Jeffords
of Vermont, said drug companies can't argue they don't want any
government interference, and then ask the government to extend
their patents.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't have it both ways,'' said Jeffords, who chairs the
Senate Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The group of lawmakers also criticized Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.,
for inserting a provision into an agriculture spending bill to help
Columbia University - his alma mater - win a patent extension on a
process for making some widely sold biotechnology drugs. The
patent, which nets Columbia up to $100 million a year in royalties
from companies using the procedure, is set to expire in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''These provisions are simply a giveaway by Congress to
patent-holders who don't deserve them,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> New Stduy Targets Drunken Drivers  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly four of every 10 alcohol-related
automobile fatalities involve drivers who had been previously
arrested for drunken driving or had a blood alcohol content well
above the legal limit, according to a government study released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those ''hard-core drinking drivers'' were responsible for 6,370
of the 15,794 highway deaths in 1998, the National Transportation
Safety Board said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   Though auto deaths involving alcohol have dropped steadily for
the years since the NTSB released its 1984 safety study dedicated
to repeat-offending drunken drivers, the current numbers still fall
short of a Transportation Department target set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''From 1983 through 1998, at least 137,338 people died in
crashes involving hard-core drinking drivers,'' the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB defined hard-core drinking drivers as those who had
prior drunken driving arrests or convictions as well as those who
have a blood-alcohol content of 0.15 percent or greater.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency says a 180-pound man would have to consume
six drinks within one hour on an empty stomach to reach a
blood-alcohol content of 0.15.
</P>
<P>
   The legal limit varies among states from 0.08 percent to 0.10
percent. A measure passed by the Senate this month would establish
a national standard of 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Every state has taken steps to address the problem, the report
said, but measures taken and degree of implementation vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   The study includes suggestions for a program to reduce hard core
drinking driving, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Frequent and well-publicized sobriety checkpoints, not limited
to holiday periods.
</P>
<P>
   --Penalties that include vehicle impoundment for repeat
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   --Legislation to require that repeat offenders maintain a zero
blood alcohol content while driving.
</P>
<P>
   --Higher penalties for blood alcohol content above .15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Restrictions on plea bargaining in drunk-driving cases.
</P>
<P>
   --Alternatives to jail time, such as house arrest or ''intensive
probation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 figures are the most recent available from the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

<HEADLINE> Tight Security Planned for Rocker  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If Atlanta relief pitcher John Rocker carries
out his threat to ride the subway to games between the Mets and the
Braves, there could be more cops on the train than purple-haired
punks, unwed mothers and AIDS patients combined.
</P>
<P>
   Security at Shea Stadium will be tight. And Mets fans itching to
taunt Rocker -- who angered New Yorkers with his politically
incorrect views on punks and foreigners riding New York subways --
may find their anger dulled by a two-beer limit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rocker told USA Today Baseball Weekly that he planned
to ride the No. 7 subway train through Queens during the
Braves-Mets series that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't be in a cab,'' he vowed. ''I won't be on the bus. I'll
be on that train.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Tuesday that Rocker can take the subway, which
passes through many immigrant communities. But he may have trouble
starting a meaningful dialogue with other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Rocker gets on the train, he'll be entirely surrounded by
police officers,'' police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, said Tuesday he thinks Rocker has
been persuaded not to take the subway,
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of people who have advised him not to take the No,
7 train is exceeded only by the number of people who take the No. 7
train,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Rocker gets to the stadium, he'll be protected by a sea of
blue. Mode said that in addition to the 60 officers usually
assigned to Mets games, there will be an extra 500 uniformed cops
plus an unspecified number of plainclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Police sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity told The Associated Press that officers will be on every
subway platform along the No. 7 line between Grand Central Terminal
in Manhattan and Shea in Queens, and any train Rocker boards will
become an express so that it picks up fewer passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A police source also said that an Atlanta police lieutenant
would travel with the team, wearing a Braves uniform at the games
to blend in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mets senior vice president David Howard said that
fans would be allowed to buy only two beers at a time during the
four-game series. The normal limit is four. Howard said beer sales
will stop after the sixth inning instead of the usual seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident New Yorkers will rise above the situation and
not stoop down to his level,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, in town to unveil the new World
Series championship trophy, said he had discussed security
arrangements with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, police officials and
Rocker, and was satisfied that all precautions have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to be prudent and smart,'' Selig said. ''The Mets
fans will be just fine and I don't think John will do anything to
incite anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker became a target of fan ire here when he told Sports
Illustrated during the offseason that he would rather retire than
play for a New York team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine taking the 7 train ... looking like you're (in) Beirut
next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS,
right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time,
right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids,'' he said.
''It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York are
the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and
not hear anybody speaking English. ... How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   The series this week will be the hurler's first trip to Shea
since the story appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Braves and Mets players had varying opinions on the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I'm thinking about is going up there and doing my job on
the mound,'' said Braves starter Kevin Millwood, who is scheduled
to pitch Friday. ''I think major league baseball and security at
Shea Stadium is smart enough to prevent having anything bad from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza said: ''I'm sure the crowd will be loud
and rowdy. That's what New York baseball is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And if ugliness does break out on the subway, the Mets will come
to the rescue -- in a comic book. The team has commissioned a
24-page comic book featuring a villain who wants to blow up a No. 7
train. The bad guy and his robotic henchmen are defeated by the
Mets' multiracial lineup, with reliever John Franco pounding the
villain, named Larcenous Vein, into outer space with his baseball
bat. The comic book will be handed out to fans 14 and under at
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The team said no similarity between Vein and Rocker was
intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a coincidence,'' said Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz. ''The
idea was conceived a long time ago.''

<HEADLINE> Official Probes Chavez Resignation  </HEADLINE>
Military officer under investigation after calling for Chavez to
resign
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's defense minister said
Tuesday he had ordered an investigation into comments by a military
officer claiming disgruntled members of the armed forces want
President Hugo Chavez to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Defense Minister Ismael Eliezer Hurtado came
one day after a videotape was released to the media of an interview
with Capt. Luis Garcia, a member of the national guard, who said
some officers want Chavez to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said a group of military officers had been meeting over
the last six months with the goal of seeking Chavez resignation and
made a direct appeal during the 10-minute interview with
Globovision, a Venezuelan television network.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be intelligent, Mr. President, and resign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense minister Hurtado said military officials were examining
the interview and considering what action, if any, to take against
Garcia. As a member of the armed forces, Garcia is prevented by law
from making political statements.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's comments come a month ahead of presidential elections
in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the left-leaning Chavez enjoying an advantage of up
to 20 points over Arias Cardenas, who has the support of the middle
and upper classes.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Help Fuel-Efficient Technology  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is offering what he
hopes will be a balm to drivers pinched by steep gas prices -- a
''no new taxes, no new bureaucracies'' energy policy that does
nothing about today's prices but aims to cut oil dependence in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year package Gore outlined Tuesday centered on $75
billion in tax incentives for the development and use of
fuel-efficient and nonpolluting technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will say to the nation's investors and entrepreneurs: If
you invest in these new technologies, America will invest in you,''
the Democratic presidential contender said.
</P>
<P>
   As Republican lawmakers were criticizing the Clinton-Gore
administration in Washington for not doing more to bring down
gasoline prices, Gore framed his energy strategy as a way ''to make
sure Americans will be free forever from the dominance of big oil
and foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried, in a round of satellite interviews with Midwest TV
stations, to place blame with his Republican presidential opponent,
George W. Bush. ''My opponent comes out of the oil industry. His
experience is as an oil company executive and he (once) called for
higher oil prices to boost the oil company profits,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, he called for the Federal Trade Commission to
hold public hearings, including consumer testimony, as part of its
price-gouging investigation into the summer spike in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, Gore said, ''We will prove once and for all that we
can clean up pollution, make our power systems more efficient and
more reliable and move away from dependence on others -- all with no
new taxes, no new bureaucracies and no onerous regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Democratic Party fund-raiser late Tuesday, Gore suggested
that today's sticker shock at the pump recalled the oil crisis of
1979-80. ''We're going through an echo of that now, but it's
nothing compared to what it was then,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, tried to turn the spotlight back on
President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president seems to forget who's been in office for
seven years ... and the price of gas has risen steadily since
they've been in office,'' the Texas governor said in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   As alternatives to crude oil, Bush promoted natural gas and
increased domestic exploration. He also said that as president he
would ''work with my friends'' in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to convince them to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting into a punishing Philadelphia sun, Gore delivered what
his campaign billed as a major address on energy policy with his
back to the natural-gas pipelines and smokeless stacks of Trigen, a
cleaner-burning power plant serving the Center City neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   His TelePrompTer malfunctioned and was removed just before he
took the stage to the tune of Steve Winwood's ''Higher Love.''
Often criticized as a halting speaker, Gore has recently begun to
use the machine for daily policy speeches in these weeks leading up
to his crucial address to the Democratic National Convention in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made Pennsylvania, a targeted battleground for the
November election, a fixture on his schedule. On Wednesday, Gore
was going to Columbus, Ohio, to detail proposed tax incentives for
consumers to buy environmentally friendly goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the $75-billion package proposed Tuesday -- $68
billion -- would go toward, as a press release described it, ''a
menu of financial mechanisms such as tax incentives, loans, grants,
bonds or other financial instruments to those power plants and
industries that come forward with projects that promise to
dramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest amounted to little more than proposed extensions of
current policy, including doubling the tax credit for producers who
make electricity from wind, biomass and landfill methane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed allowing businesses to take accelerated tax
deductions for investments in clean technology.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Washington for an $850,000 pair of
Democratic National Committee fund- raisers, Gore spoke to 6,000
members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees and asked them to help keep Bush -- ''that other fellow''
-- out of the White House.

<HEADLINE> Ump Throws Out Angels' Belcher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Anaheim Angels starter Tim Belcher and manager
Mike Scioscia were ejected in the second inning against the Seattle
Mariners on Tuesday night after Belcher was called for a balk that
brought home a run.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third and Mike Cameron batting,
Belcher faked a throw to third, but his foot came toward the plate,
making it a balk.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher walked toward home plate umpire Mike DiMuro after Joe
Oliver scored from third to put the Mariners ahead 3-0 and was
ejected after an animated argument. Scioscia came out and got
between Belcher and DiMuro, and was thrown out after Belcher was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher gave up a home run to David Bell to lead off Seattle's
second.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher made his third start after coming off the disabled list
on June 17. He underwent surgery on his right flexor muscle Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It was Scioscia's second ejection this season and Belcher's
first.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo OK Colombia Emergency Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading lawmakers agreed Tuesday to the
outlines of an emergency bill financing Colombia's battle against
drug traffickers, U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo and recovery from
storms, fires and other domestic disasters, one participant said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, declined to provide an exact figure but said it would be
between $9 billion and the $12 billion limit that House and Senate
leaders set for the measure last week. That would make the package
double the $5.2 billion President Clinton requested at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders hope to work out final details on Wednesday and push the
entire bill through Congress by week's end, when lawmakers are due
to begin a one-week July 4 recess. Republicans want to finish the
bill quickly to avoid blame for any problems the Pentagon might
face as it juggles money to pay for U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be a bill that would be acceptable to House
and Senate'' leaders and the White House, Young said after he and
other lawmakers ended a closed-door bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the measure would include $1.3 billion to help
Colombia's embattled government fight drug traffickers who control
broad swaths of the country, along with their leftist guerrilla and
right-wing paramilitary allies. Included is money for purchasing
helicopters and other supplies and training Colombian troops.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a victory for Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., who have pushed for the aid as a way to combat
drug use in the United States. Colombia supplies most of the
cocaine used in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is whether to include compromise language
struck Tuesday that would lift the four-decade-old U.S. food
embargo against Cuba. There is strong opposition to that deal among
some senators, and Young indicated it might be left for inclusion
in some later bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and lawmakers had said earlier that to keep the bill
acceptable to Clinton, they would avoid including controversial
provisions changing laws.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would therefore omit a provision pushed by
Schering-Plough Corp. to win an extension of its patent for
Claritin, the popular and profitable allergy drug. Also left off
the bill was language by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., aimed at
extending a lucrative patent his alma mater, Columbia University,
has on a process its scientists invented for making some widely
sold biotechnology drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those measures could end up on other bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want a veto of the bill,'' said Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, when
bargainers held a brief public session.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
had discussed a tentative compromise of about $5.5 billion, said
participants speaking on condition of anonymity. That was abandoned
as unrealistically low.
</P>
<P>
   Lott had criticized earlier, larger versions of the package for
being too costly and containing unnecessary items, and Senate work
on the measure virtually halted for two months. The House approved
$13 billion in March, mostly by adding extra money for the
Pentagon, while the Senate approved roughly $9 billion last month.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, participants said that as part of the final package,
the House and Senate would each get a $100 million kitty for
various lawmakers' home-district projects.
</P>
<P>
   Young would reveal few details of the bill. But earlier,
participants said that besides money for Colombia, the compromise
would include $2.05 billion to repay the Pentagon for the costs of
5,700 American troops serving with the NATO peacekeeping team in
Kosovo; at least $660 million for rebuilding from the
government-set fires that ravaged Los Alamos, N.M.; and $250
million to help North Carolina and other states recover from last
September's Hurricane Floyd and other agricultural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aides have said that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittee that oversees
foreign aid, had been trying to keep the Colombia money out of the
emergency package.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving it in the regular foreign aid bill could increase
pressure on Clinton to sign it. Lott nevertheless indicated that in
the name of completing the emergency bill quickly, McConnell seemed
ready to let the Colombia money be included.

<HEADLINE> Indians 12, Royals 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jim Thome homered twice, went 4-for-4
and drove in four runs and Richie Sexson also had four RBIs as the
Cleveland Indians defeated the Kansas City Royals 12-1 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson and Sandy Alomar also homered for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley (6-5) allowed one run through five innings, but
threw 111 pitches. He allowed runners in four of his five innings,
stranding six.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki (3-2) allowed four runs in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The game capsulized the trouble the Royals have had all season.
Kansas City has allowed 128 home runs, the most in the majors this
season. The Royals also lead the American League with 329 walks --
issuing five Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' 120 home runs are third best in the American League
and fourth most in the majors. Cleveland has received 302 walks,
the third most in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians took the lead in the second when Thome hit his 22nd
home run of the season, a 435-foot blast to right-center. Sexson
then added a two-run homer in the fourth to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Zaun cut it to 3-1 in the fifth with a leadoff home run
that just cleared the fence in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson got his third RBI in the sixth, driving home David
Justice with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the end for Suzuki, who was relieved by Brett
Laxton. Laxton gave up four earned runs on one hit, two walks and a
hit batter in just one inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got three more in the eighth to take an 11-1 lead on
Alomar's two-run home run and an RBI single Omar Vizquel. Thome's
second homer in the ninth closed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thome has hit 17 of his 23 home runs with the bases empty.
It was his 13th career multihomer game. ... Finley improved his
career mark to 15-10 against the Royals, including 9-4 in Kansas
City. ... Rey Sanchez played in his 50th consecutive game without
an error, two shy of the club record for a shortstop, set by Greg
Gagne in 1993. ... Kenny Lofton was hit below the right knee by a
pitch with one out in the seventh. Lofton, who has a bruised shin,
was taken to the hospital for precautionary X-rays. Roberto Alomar
left the game with a sore left ankle. ... The Royals have allowed
43 percent of their runs on home runs (198 of 462).

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Waive Hershiser  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Orel Hershiser wanted to be the link between
the Dodgers' last World Series title in 1988 and their next one.
</P>
<P>
   But the team's pitching hero during much of the 1980s was waived
Tuesday, a day after he gave up eight runs in the second inning of
a 9-5 loss to San Diego. The inning was one of the worst of his
18-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand and support the club's decision of giving me my
release after the way I performed,'' Hershiser said in a statement.
''I am grateful that I was given the opportunity to play for the
Dodgers this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, the 1988 NL Cy Young winner and World Series MVP,
struggled after rejoining the club as a free agent last winter. His
ERA was 13.14 in 10 appearances that included six starts but just
24 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was totally committed to baseball and the Dodgers and
helping us win, and to have it end this way ...'' said manager
Davey Johnson, his voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though he struggled, I loved having him out there,''
Johnson said. ''It's probably one of the toughest things I've been
associated with, and I've been associated with a bunch of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, now the team's senior vice
president, had an emotional visit with Hershiser after Monday
night's debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We both cried, and he was really broken-hearted,'' Lasorda
said. ''I told him, 'You're the same with the Dodger fans in this
city as (Sandy) Koufax and (Don) Drysdale.' They were role models
to a lot of youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, had voluntarily gone to the minors last month
before rejoining the team. He said he plans to take a few days to
think about his future, but his major league pitching career could
be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad to see him go down like this,'' said bullpen coach
Rick Dempsey, who caught Hershiser during the Dodgers' championship
season in '88. ''I hope it's over with, that he doesn't have to go
back out there. He's got nothing to prove to anybody anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser pitched a major league record 59 consecutive scoreless
innings in 1988 and had a 23-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it'll ever be matched in my lifetime,'' Dempsey
said of the 59 scoreless innings. ''He did things I've never seen a
pitcher able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was given the nickname ''Bulldog'' by then-manager
Lasorda during his first stint with the Dodgers from 1983-94,
because Lasorda said no batters would be intimidated by a pitcher
named Orel.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Daly, the team's managing partner, and general manager Kevin
Malone both realized while watching Hershiser on Monday night that
a change was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be in a situation where you're eight runs behind in
the second inning of a game. We have to have the best 25 men on the
roster. It was a tough call,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was frustrating and disappointing for me and Bob when we
were sitting together watching the game,'' Malone said. ''I felt
bad for Orel but I also understand the predicament that Davey's in
with our bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are shorthanded in the bullpen because of injuries,
and aches and pains have plagued others on the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right-hander Eric Gagne was recalled from Triple-A
Albuquerque to start Wednesday night's game against San Diego. He
was optioned to Albuquerque when Hershiser was recalled from his
self-imposed minor-league stint.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who pitched 353 career games in Los Angeles, briefly
recaptured some of his former glory when he won the Dodgers' home
opener this season, beating Cincinnati 8-1. But he went into a
severe tailspin and lost his last five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He developed control problems and hasn't won since the home
opener. He matched a modern major league record, hitting four
batters in a 10-3 loss to Houston on April 19. Hershiser did it in
just 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing one pitch five feet over the catcher's head
Monday night, Hershiser hit the next batter, Ryan Klesko, with a
pitch that bounced and hit his left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that he doesn't in his heart believe that it's over
with, and he won't for a long time,'' Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now he's wondering to myself whether it's really over
with, he doesn't know. He thinks he can come back from this and
maybe pitch for a couple more years. Under certain circumstances, I
wouldn't bet against him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time All-Star, Hershiser has a career record of 204-150
with a 3.48 ERA. He was with Cleveland, San Francisco and the New
York Mets before returning to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are responsible for paying Hershiser's entire $2
million salary this year and a $500,000 buyout of next year's $2
million option. The buyout is deferred at 5 percent interest,
payable on July 1 each starting in 2001.

Arkansas political science professor who was a longtime friend and
adviser to President Clinton, died Monday. She was 61 and had
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's friendship with the president and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton dated to the early 1970s when both Clintons taught
at the University of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she was a member of the national Democratic Platform
Committee in the convention that nominated Clinton to run against
President Bush, and she served as senior researcher during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When he took office the following year, Clinton appointed her to
the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. She was
elected chairman of the panel in 1997, serving the maximum two
years as leader.
</P>
<P>
   She was noted for her 1988 book ''Arkansas Politics and
Government: Do the People Rule'' that is still in use in courses at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   When she married James B. Blair in 1979, then-Gov. Clinton
performed the ceremony. The Blairs' relationship with the Clintons
drew scrutiny after it was reported that in the late '70s James
Blair, a lawyer for Tyson Foods, led Hillary Rodham Clinton to
profit greatly from a small commodities investment.

Larry Kelley
</P>
<P>
   HIGHTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- Larry Kelley, the second winner of the
Heisman Trophy, died Tuesday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley won the Heisman, college football's highest individual
honor, in 1936 after an All-America season as a receiver at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, 1934, Yale recorded one of its greatest upset wins
when Kelley made a one-handed grab of a 49-yard pass from
quarterback Jerry Roscoe, scoring the only touchdown in a 7-0
victory that snapped Princeton's 15-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Kelley became the second Heisman Trophy winner to
auction his prize to the public. The trophy sold for $328,110 --
$100,000 more than the price paid for O.J. Simpson's Heisman in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley had suffered a stroke six months earlier and said he
wanted to raise money for his 18 nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was elected to the National Football Hall of Fame in
1969.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Pflimlin
</P>
<P>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) -- Pierre Pflimlin, former president of
the European Parliament and the European Council and longtime mayor
of Strasbourg, died Tuesday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Pflimlin, a lawyer whose political career spanned four decades,
had vast experience in government and believed strongly in a
unified Europe. He was Strasbourg's centrist mayor from 1959 to
1983, was active in regional politics and represented the Bas-Rhin
region in the French National Assembly from 1946 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He became European Council president in 1955, and went on to
become finance minister and cooperation minister. A member of the
European Parliament from 1979-89, Pflimlin was vice president of
the assembly until 1984 before becoming president until 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he published his memoirs, ''Memoirs of a European under
the Fourth and Fifth Republic.''
</P>
<P>
Gerald Whitrow
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Gerald Whitrow, an influential astrophysicist
whose books studied the mathematical, cosmological, historical,
biological and psychological implications of time, died June 2. He
was 87.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most important works was the 1960's ''The Natural
Philosophy of Time.'' His 1972 book ''What is Time?'' and 1988's
''Time in History,'' explored such concepts as how time originated;
biological clocks; the relations between time, gravitation and the
universe; and whether time can be said to have a beginning and an
end.
</P>
<P>
   He felt time was unfairly eclipsed as a subject in modern
science.
</P>
<P>
   Whitrow graduated from Oxford University, and served as an
applied maths lecturer at London's Imperial College for 50 years.
He retired with the title of emeritus professor in 1979, though he
remained actively involved as a senior research fellow almost up
until his death.

<HEADLINE> OAS To Resolve Peru Crisis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Police used tear gas to disperse about 300
female protesters -- dressed in black and carrying cardboard coffins
-- late Tuesday who were awaiting the arrival of an Organization of
American States delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS mission, led by OAS General Secretary Cesar Gaviria and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, was due to arrive in Lima
shortly before midnight for a three-day round of meetings with
government and opposition officials to help improve Peru's
democracy in the wake of President Alberto Fujimori's tainted
re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS refused to monitor last month's runoff, saying the
election was ''far from what could be considered free or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 34-member body later rejected calls from the United
States to question the legitimacy of Fujimori's win or consider
collective sanctions. Instead it decided to send Gaviria and
Axworthy to help resolve Peru's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The women had planned a vigil outside the luxury hotel where the
delegation is scheduled to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to protest against the dictatorship. We are tired of
Fujimori after 10 years,'' said Maria Arela Melo, a 53-year-old
grandmother of two. ''There is no freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   They were forced to disband by hundreds of riot police who
blocked side streets in a six-block radius around the hotel.
Throughout the evening the police fired tear gas at any protesters
who tried to reassemble.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has promised to revamp Peru's democratic institutions
after claiming an unprecedented third five-year term in a May 28,
presidential runoff, which followed a campaign riddled with
irregularities and allegations of government fraud.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, Alejandro Toledo, who boycotted the election, is
demanding a new ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's foes contend that the autocratic leader plans
cosmetic changes to appease the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's National Intelligence Service is accused of waging a
campaign of dirty tricks and intimidation against his opposition.

<HEADLINE> Wife Defeats Husband in S.C. House  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The divorce court and the lawyers have
yet to divide up the property, but voters on Tuesday let Shirley
Hinson keep her statehouse seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter primary race that became entangled with their bitter
divorce, the two-term state representative, defeated her estranged
husband to win the GOP nomination for her suburban district about
20 miles from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled. I couldn't be happier. And I'm glad it's over,''
Shirley Hinson said. ''It says negative campaigning is not what the
people want. I have always run a positive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Hinson captured 52 percent of the vote in the runoff for
the Republican nomination. The win is tantamount to election
because Democrats did not offer a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Hinson said he would do whatever he could to
support his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had many years of a very good marriage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Hinson, a former school board member, said her husband's
aggressive election campaign was all about revenge. But Jimmy
Hinson, a retired school principal, said he was running to improve
education.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's well-known marital difficulties -- which includes
alleged death threats, rumors of infidelity, jail time and a
restraining order -- pushed aside most other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jimmy Hinson was charged with making a telephone
death threat to another GOP legislator, based on rumors that the
legislator and Shirley Hinson were having an affair. A grand jury
refused to indict Jimmy Hinson, though a private investigator
described nighttime meetings between Shirley Hinson and her fellow
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Both denied they were ever romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Hinsons ran in a three-way primary two weeks ago, neither
getting the more than 50 percent required to avoid a runoff.
Shirley Hinson got 42 percent of the primary vote; her husband got
32 percent. The rest went to a third-place candidate who later
endorsed Jimmy Hinson.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 6, Red Sox 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Charles Johnson hit a two-run homer in a five-run
10th inning as the Baltimore Orioles ended a nine-game losing
streak Tuesday night with a come-from-behind 6-3 win over the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Harold Baines started the inning by lining a single
off the right arm of Derek Lowe (2-3). Johnson jumped on a 3-2
pitch and drove his 16th homer of the season high over the
left-field wall, his 10th in his last 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore loaded the bases on an error, a walk and a single,
scored two runs on Jeff Conine's single and another when Cal Ripken
reached on a fielder's choice when third baseman Manny Alexander's
throw to second to get Conine was late.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who entered with a 1-0 lead in the ninth, blew a save for
the third time in 20 chances as Boston lost for the eighth time in
10 games. Baltimore is only 2-14 in its last 16 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra hit his eighth homer, a two-run shot off Alan
Mills in the bottom of the 10th. After Mike Stanley's single, Buddy
Groom relieved for his third save in nine chances.
</P>
<P>
   Boston wasted a chance to in the bottom of the ninth after
loading the bases with two outs on a single by Morgan Burkhart, an
intentional walk to Scott Hatteberg and a walk to Darren Lewis.
Mike Trombley (3-2) retired Jose Offerman on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe started the ninth by striking out Mike Bordick before
Delino DeShields doubled, Albert Belle then singled to center for
his 31st RBI in his last 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who entered with a .233 batting average, had broken up
a scoreless game between Mike Mussina and Pete Schourek with a
run-scoring single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg opened the inning with a single and took second
on Alexander's sacrifice bunt. Curtis Pride struck out before
Offerman came through.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a liner to right in front of Belle, and Hatteberg scored
as Conine cut off the throw. After Hatteberg crossed the plate,
Offerman was tagged out by Conine in a rundown.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, 3-1 in his previous four games, struck out a
season-high 10 batters. Schourek, 0-3 in seven starts since his
last win on May 15, allowed four hits, struck out four and walked
two. Each pitched seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RF Trot Nixon was placed on Boston's 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to Saturday, with a strained right hamstring. ...
Burkhart, who had 17 homers and 54 RBIs for Pawtucket of the
International League, was called up Tuesday to replace Nixon on the
roster. He singled in his first major-league at bat and went
2-for-4 with a walk. ... B.J. Surhoff extended his hitting streak
to 20 games, one short of his career high, with a single in the
seventh. ... The Orioles' 11-31 road record is the worst in
baseball. ... Baltimore sent only three batters to the plate in the
third, fourth, sixth and eighth innings despite putting runners on
base in each inning. Two runners were erased on double plays and
Conine and DeShields were caught stealing.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Face Tigers and Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE HOUSEHOLDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The New York Yankees came to Detroit on Tuesday
and got to see the player they didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative trade for Juan Gonzalez collapsed a day earlier
when he wouldn't accept a $12.5 million, one-year contract
extension, and the Yankees demanded the Tigers renegotiate the
3-for-1 deal if the outfielder was traded while remaining eligible
for free agency after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad Juan is in the lineup tonight and I look forward to
playing with him for a long time,'' Tigers first baseman Tony Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have turned their interests elsewhere, discussing
possible trades for Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, Moises Alou of
the Houston Astros, B.J. Surhoff of the Baltimore Orioles and Ellis
Burks of the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people familiar with the talks, no deals
were close.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been crazy with the rumors,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if something happened. It wouldn't
surprise me if nothing happened. We haven't kept things sane. There
are a lot of distractions when you play in New York. Since I've
been here, this is the craziest it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who went 3-for-4 with an RBI-triple in a 13-2 win over
Cleveland on Monday, had little to say prior to Tuesday's game,
offering only a ''No comment'' in the clubhouse and ignoring
reporters' questions during pre-game stretching.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won 7-6 Tuesday in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a tremendous player and I would be sorry if they traded
him, but you know, it's a crazy game,'' Detroit outfielder Bobby
Higginson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, making his first appearance in Detroit since the trade
talks between the teams developed, was met with a mixture of cheers
and boos when his name was announced prior to his first inning
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The boos grew louder throughout the game as Gonzalez went
0-for-6 and left seven runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   New York agreed to a tentative deal last Thursday that would
have sent outfielder Ricky Ledee to Detroit along with two minor
leaguers: third baseman Drew Henson and pitcher Randy Keisler.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees wanted to lower their offer if Gonzalez came
only as a three-month rental. The Tigers said no.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, who was the Yankees' designated hitter Tuesday, went
1-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit manager Phil Garner said his team has kept things in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not been that big of a deal for the team,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 4, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. had already homered twice when
he came to bat in the eighth inning, pants legs turned up for good
luck, with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   One pitch later, he headed back to the dugout with his pants
legs still high but the Cincinnati Reds headed for yet another low.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey drove in all of Cincinnati's runs with a pair of homers,
but the St. Louis Cardinals got two of their own and got Junior to
hit into a double play in the eighth to preserve a 4-3 victory
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds hit a solo homer and Edgar Renteria had a three-run
shot to overcome Griffey's big night and put the Cardinals ahead.
Dave Veres held the lead by getting Griffey to ground into a
short-to-first double play with runners on first and third in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, I think he swung at a ball. He might have reached for
it,'' Veres said. ''Thank goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   The win evened the series between the NL Central's top teams at
a game apiece and put the Reds even farther out of reach, 8&AMP;frac12; games
behind. It matches the Cardinals' biggest lead of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed it as a team and we came up big,'' said Darryl Kile
(11-4), who became the majors' third 11-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has failed to win consecutive games since it
completed a three-game sweep of Minnesota on June 4 and moved into
first by a half-game. Since then, the Reds have lost 15 of 20,
leaving them desperate to make up ground during the four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, Barry Larkin and Pokey Reese wore their pants legs just
below the knee for good luck on Monday, and Griffey hit a two-run
homer in the first inning of a 3-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Aaron Boone joined the other three in sporting the
lucky look Tuesday, and Griffey hit another two-run homer in the
first as the Reds got a good start on repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also hit a solo shot off Kile in the sixth, his third
hit of the game and his 25th homer of the season. He's 5-for-8
career off the right-hander with three homers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a mistake and he didn't miss it,'' Kile said. ''I made
three, in fact, and he hit 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the 12 runs in the series have scored on homers -- three
by St. Louis, four by Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit a solo homer, his 22nd, with one out in the third
off Steve Parris (3-11), who has lost seven of his last eight
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Parris walked Kile, a .111 hitter, with two outs in the fourth
and gave up a single to Placido Polanco. Renteria's ninth homer to
right-center on a slider away put the Cardinals ahead 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to hit the ball to right field all the time,'' Renteria
said. ''I'm not trying to hit a home run. I'm trying to hit the
ball to the gap in right field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile gave up eight hits, didn't walk a batter and struck out
four in 7 1-3 innings, throwing 88 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Veres gave up a single to Dmitri Young that left runners on
first and third for Griffey, who had homered off him in their only
previous matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Veres' first pitch was a sinker away and Griffey hit it directly
to Renteria for the easy double play. Veres induced another double
play in the ninth for his 14th save in 18 chances.
</P>
<P>
   His pitch to Griffey rescued the Cardinals from a situation that
made their hearts race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't thumping, it just stopped,'' manager Tony La Russa
said. ''I was comatose. You can't like that situation -- men on
first and third with Griffey up. But Veres is a tough character. He
does not scare.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's third multihomer game of the season extended his
hitting streak to a season-high 11 games. He's 15-for-42 during the
streak with seven homers.
</P>
<P>
   While Griffey stayed hot, Mark McGwire went 0-for-4, ending a
10-game hitting streak that included five homers. He struck out
twice, popped out, walked and grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has been the Cardinals' hottest hitter against the Reds
this season. He's 6-for-9 in this series and 13-for-22 with two
homers in five games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals made their first error since June 19, a span
of 77 innings. St. Louis has the most homers in the NL (128) and
the fewest errors (41). ... The Reds decided that reliever Elmer
Dessens will start Wednesday against St. Louis. He hasn't started
since September 1998. ... Pete Harnisch will be activated off the
disabled list and start Friday at Arizona. ... Griffey has 423
homers, ranking 27th on the career list. Billy Williams is 26th
with 426. McGwire is seventh with 550. ... Parris' 11 losses are
the most by a Reds pitcher since Mike Remlinger lost 15 games in
1998. ... Dante Bichette grounded into his 14th double play, most
in the NL.

<HEADLINE> Fed Agency to Fund AIDS Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four new partnerships were announced by a
federal health agency Tuesday to provide funding to groups
attempting to bring an AIDS vaccine to market.
</P>
<P>
   These partnerships, called HIV vaccine design and development
teams, were prompted by a presidential directive to increase
public-private cooperation in developing vaccines to major
diseases, according to the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, the section of the National Institutes of
Health that set up the deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many vaccines in use today resulted from both
government-sponsored and private research,'' said Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, director of NIAID.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are incentive-based, aimed at teams that have a
vaccine in development but have not yet reached human testing. The
teams will receive funds as they achieve preset goals.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. companies -- Advanced BioScience Laboratories in
Kensington, Md.; Chiron Corporation in Emeryville, Calif.; and
Wyeth Lederle Vaccines and Nutrition in Pearl River, N.Y. -- as well
as a consortium of Australian universities led by the University of
New South Wales all have different tactics on how to create a serum
that will protect humans from HIV infection, which causes AIDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bobby Higginson scored on Robert Fick's slow
grounder to shortstop in the 11th inning Tuesday night, giving the
Detroit Tigers a 7-6 win over the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In another listless performance by the two-time World Series
champions, David Cone was hit hard again, Mariano Rivera lost and
defense proved costly -- but this time, Derek Jeter was the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre and bench coach Don Zimmer were ejected in the
fifth inning for arguing after an umpire appeared to blow a call on
a key play. It all added up to the Yankees' eighth loss in 11
games, the 25th in their last 40.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really tough, frustrating,'' Torre said. ''But that's
how a lot of this stuff has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginson singled off Rivera (2-3) leading off the 11th and
Shane Halter hit a smash to shortstop that Jeter booted. Higginson,
who fell as he rounded second, just made it to third ahead of left
fielder Shane Spencer's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter then threw home on Fick's roller, and Higginson collided
with catcher Chris Turner, jarring the ball loose. But the runner
went back to the plate and touched it, just before Turner was able
to grab the ball and attempt a tag with his bare hand.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Cruz (1-0) pitched one inning of one-hit relief as the
Tigers won their fourth straight at home and improved to 4-0
against New York at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, still with Detroit after a proposed trade to the
Yankees fell through Monday, was 0-for-6 and stranded seven
runners, including five in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer hit Detroit's first grand slam of the season and
Tony Clark also homered for the Tigers, who outhit New York 17-15.
The Yankees had rallied to tie in the eighth on Paul O'Neill's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed six runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings, and is
winless in 11 starts since beating Toronto on April 28. Tigers
starter Hideo Nomo allowed three runs, nine hits and five walks in
5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit trailed 3-1 when singles from Luis Polonia and Brad
Ausmus set up Higginson's RBI single to start the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who hit a solo homer in the fourth, walked to load the
bases before Palmer sent Cone's 2-1 pitch into the left-field seats
for his eighth career slam, the Tigers' first since Fick connected
last Sept. 27 in the final game at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   New York had the bases loaded and one out in the fourth when
Turner hit a hard grounder that second baseman Damion Easley
stopped with a dive before flipping to shortstop Deivi Cruz for a
force.

   Turner was called out on Cruz's throw to first by umpire Jeff
Kellogg.

<P>
   Torre came out to argue the call briefly and returned to the
dugout. He came back after Zimmer was ejected, renewed the argument
with Kellogg and was tossed, too.

<P>
   ''I came back out because he threw him out,'' Torre said. ''He
never cursed. It's this God-like atmosphere these guys throw
around.''

   Replays indicated Turner beat the throw to first.

   New York closed within a run in the seventh on RBI groundouts by
Spencer and Turner off C.J. Nitkowski.

Kosovo OK Colombia Emergency Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading lawmakers agreed Tuesday to the outlines of an
emergency bill financing Colombia's battle against drug traffickers, U.S.
peacekeepers in Kosovo and recovery from storms, fires and other domestic
disasters, one participant said. Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, declined to provide an exact figure but said it would
be between $9 billion and the $12 billion limit that House and Senate leaders
set for the measure last week. That would make the package double the $5.2
billion President Clinton requested at the beginning of the year. Leaders hope
to work out final details on Wednesday and push the entire bill through Congress
by week's end.

135 Vieques Protesters Are Detained

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters hurled iron bars at U.S. sailors at
sea and crept under ''no trespassing'' fences on land, the U.S. Navy said, as
more than 130 demonstrators intensified their fight to oust the Navy from the
Vieques island training range where it practices bombing and shelling. The
protesters insisted that the Navy bombed and shelled the range while activists
were still at large, and said they had had no news of Independence Party vice
president Fernando Martin and five others.

Fiji Rebel Accord Deadline Passes

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying Fiji hostage-takers, the country's military rulers
said Wednesday they would appoint a civilian government without consulting
further with the gunmen. The rebels holding Fiji's government hostage have
demanded a presence on the interim government before releasing their prisoners,
who include deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. The announcement came a
day after a rebel leader, once an officer in an elite British anti-terrorism
unit, warned that the captives will die if the army tries to rescue them.

Cubans Welcome Trade Ban Lift
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A senior Cuban official Tuesday criticized a U.S.
congressional plan that would allow the sale of American food to Cuba, saying
the conditions it appears to impose could worsen a trade embargo against his
island. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said news
reports of the agreement indicated it would impose conditions on the sale of
food, such as refusing U.S. financing for the purchases, and contained nothing
about exports of Cuban goods to the United States. Lawmakers reached an
agreement early Tuesday on a deal to allow direct sales of U.S. food to the
Cuban government for the first time in nearly four decades.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four new partnerships were announced by a federal health
agency Tuesday to provide funding to groups attempting to bring an AIDS vaccine
to market. These partnerships, called HIV vaccine design and development teams,
were prompted by a presidential directive to increase public-private cooperation
in developing vaccines to major diseases, according to the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the section of the National Institutes of
Health that set up the deals.

New Study Targets Drunken Drivers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly four of every 10 alcohol-related automobile
fatalities involve drivers who had been previously arrested for drunken driving
or had a blood alcohol content well above the legal limit, according to a
government study released Tuesday. Those ''hard-core drinking drivers'' were
responsible for 6,370 of the 15,794 highway deaths in 1998, the National
Transportation Safety Board said in its report. Though auto deaths involving
alcohol have dropped steadily for the years since the NTSB released its 1984
safety study dedicated to repeat-offending drunken drivers, the current numbers
still fall short of a Transportation Department target set in 1995.

Tigers Beat Yankees 7-6
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bobby Higginson scored on Robert Fick's slow grounder to
shortstop in the 11th inning Tuesday night, giving the Detroit Tigers a 7-6 win
over the New York Yankees. In another listless performance by the two-time World
Series champions, David Cone was hit hard again, Mariano Rivera lost and defense
proved costly -- but this time, Derek Jeter was the culprit. Manager Joe Torre
and bench coach Don Zimmer were ejected in the fifth inning for arguing after an
umpire appeared to blow a call on a key play. It all added up to the Yankees'
eighth loss in 11 games, the 25th in their last 40.
