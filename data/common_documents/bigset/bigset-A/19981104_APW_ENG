	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The remnants of
one-time Hurricane Mitch regained strength and veered toward
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
	   Mitch, which dissipated after raging through the Caribbean and
Central America, reached 45 mph (72 kph) winds and became a
tropical storm as it coursed through the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday
afternoon.
	   Forecasters predicted the storm could batter the northern
Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida later in the week with heavy
rains, though it was not expected to reach the 180 mph (289 kph)
winds it generated last week.
	   Mitch already has killed at least five people in the southern
state of Chiapas, officials said Tuesday. In neighboring Honduras,
Nicaragua and Guatemala, the storm left an estimated 9,000 people
dead.
	   By late Tuesday, the storm was located just off the port city of
Campeche, 550 miles (885 kilometers) east of Mexico City, and was
moving east-northeast at 10 mph (16 kph), the U.S. National
Hurricane Center reported.
	   About 200 people were evacuated from a low-lying neighborhood in
Campeche, according to local media reports. Several hundred people
were evacuated in the southernmost tip of Mexico on Monday due to
rivers swollen by the storm.
	   Deputy State Attorney General Jorge Espinosa said five people
were killed Monday in Chiapas when their car was carried away by
the flooded Cacaluta River about 50 miles (80 kph) northwest of the
Guatemalan border.
	   He said the driver tried to cross the usually small river across
a temporary road put in place after massive flooding earlier this
year knocked out a bridge.
	   But rains from Mitch had flooded the river again, washing away
the road base, and the car was carried away.

	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Hundreds upon hundreds of bodies are
buried in the mud that cascaded down Casitas volcano, some with
their hair and limbs entangled in the sugar cane stalks.
	   During a two-hour walk out of the Posoltega town center and into
the sugar cane fields, 22 of the bodies were seen in plain,
gut-wrenching view _ bloated, scratched and crammed in trees, cane
stalks and mud.
	   The tragedy here occurred Friday morning following pounding
rains brought by Hurricane Mitch. Part of the volcano's crater
collapsed and the lake inside formed a deluge down the slope.
	   ``It is full, full of bodies,'' Ariel Mendoza, a 26-year-old
construction worker said, pointing at the volcano. ``From where the
mud starts, down to the sea.''
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega, the largest city near the
disaster area, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that 1,950
corpses had been recovered in villages below the volcano.
	   Other officials gave lower, but still ghastly calculations of
the death toll here: The Red Cross said 1,250, while the
president's office said 1,338.
	   ``We have buried some in mass graves, others we have buried one
by one,'' Zeledon said, as she hitched a ride on the back of a
tractor to where a relief helicopter was landing.
	   ``There are still survivors in the hills,'' she said. ``Four
hundred have walked out and we believe there are another 450 alive
up there _ most of them children.''
	   Zeledon said rescue workers burying and burning bodies to
prevent the spread of disease had run across survivors in the
hills, and had informed the military. But she didn't know if
soldiers had gone back to get them.
	   ``If they don't get them out, those people will die because
there is no water, no food,'' she said. ``It would be one more
massacre.''
	   Local Red Cross coordinator Ramiro Gallo said officials do not
have the equipment to reach survivors in the hills.
	   ``It has been four days and people are still there with mud up
to their waist,'' he said.
	   Nicaragua's Health Ministry said it was dispatching medical
brigades to help recover and bury bodies and to fumigate the
region.
	   Villagers said they found about 200 bodies at the San Pablo
sugar cane plantation, just outside of town.
	   Amid the crushed cane stalks lie muddy shoes, purses, tires, a
colander.
	   The stench of death crops up every few hundred yards (meters)
where a body lies: A little girl with her hair braided into the
cane stalks by the slide. A man still wearing boots, but nothing
else. A boy, perhaps 8, snuggled under a tree trunk. Or just an arm
sticking out of the mud.
	   The government urged people living near Casitas and eight other
nearby volcanos to evacuate their homes Tuesday for fear of new
mudslides. More heavy rain has been falling in recent days.
	   Also Tuesday, just 22 miles (35 kilometers) from Casitas, a
3,300-foot (1,005 meters) volcano erupted, spilling lava and
spewing ash, Nicaraguan authorities said. There were no immediate
reports of damage or casualties from the Cerro Negro volcano, and
the largest town of any size, Malpaisillo, is 7.5 miles (12
kilometers) away.
	   Another small mudslide on the northern slope of the Casitas
volcano wiped out 34 houses Monday night, but there were no
apparent casualties, Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said.
	   Residents ``must be mindful of the situation and look for
refuge,'' President Arnoldo Aleman said.
	   Central American officials say more than 9,000 people died in
floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the strongest
hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.
	   Ricardo Donaires, 34, his wife, and their baby boy spent three
days in the open on a hilltop in the village of Rolando Rodriguez
before hiking to safety on Monday.
	   ``We suffered without eating and without drinking water for
three days,'' Donaires said, now at a schoolhouse converted into an
emergency shelter in Posoltega.
	   At first, soldiers struggled to bury bodies where they lay. But
with the fear of epidemics growing, civilian volunteers set out
from the nearby community of Chichigalpa to burn bodies.
	   ``We need the government to send us gasoline if they want to
avoid an epidemic,'' said Robert Lopez Marcia, a member of
Chichigalpa's emergency commission.
	   At an improvised shelter at a Chichigalpa elementary school,
doctors were in desperate need of medicine, antibiotics and
bandages, and there was little clean water or food. Children lay on
desks with bloody bandages on their heads.
	   Along the Pan American Highway, thousands of people walked in
the pouring rain, some leaving the disaster area, others going in
to search for family members.
	   ``The only thing the federal government does is ask us for a
number every half hour _ how many dead, how many injured,''
complained Chichigalpa Mayor Elijio Palacio. ``But they don't send
us anything.''

Report: Singapore insurers hurt by economic downturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore insurance companies have been badly
hurt by dwindling sales of new policies and increasing forfeits of
existing coverage because of the economic crisis, a news report
said Wednesday.
	   The number of single-premium policies sold by Singapore's top
dozen insurers shrunk 66 percent to 5,354 during the third quarter
from 15,549 in the same period last year, according to The Straits
Times.
	   Premiums collected from such policies, which require an initial
one-time payment, plunged 196 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 121
million) to 102 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 63 million) from
July to September compared to the same months in 1997.
	   New annual-premium policies slumped 9.4 percent, with
corresponding revenues falling 31 percent to 119 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 73 million), in the third quarter.
	   The latest figures are part of a continuing trend of bad times
for the sale of insurance in this affluent city-state.
	   From January through September, total new single-premium
policies declined 64 percent and new annual-premium policies
dropped 16 percent against the same period in 1997, before the
regional economic slowdown began to grip Singapore.
	   Prudential chief executive officer Tan Suee Chieh told the
newspaper that the insurance business is expected to worsen during
the rest of the year, but might register some growth next year.

Report: Courts lift seizure order of assets owned by alleged mob
</HEADLINE>
boss &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Hong Kong court has thrown out a police order
seizing over U.S. dlrs 20 million in assets of reputed Hong Kong
mob boss ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   Cheung's relatives won a lucrative legal victory Tuesday when
the court ordered the return of properties, cars, and cash that had
been confiscated, the South China Morning Post said.
	   Cheung, on trial in mainland China, is awaiting verdicts that
could carry the death sentence. He has been charged with the
killing of a Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed
robberies, and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, according to
media who have covered his closed trial in Guangzhou.
	   In a closed hearing in Hong Kong, the Court of First Instance
ruled that police had insufficient evidence to justify the seizure
of Cheung's assets _ which allegedly included proceeds from
kidnappings never reported to Hong Kong police, the Post said.
Police could not prove where the money came from, the Hong Kong
Standard reported.
	   Sixteen relatives of Cheung also won a court order requiring the
government to pay unspecified legal costs in the squabble over his
money, the Post said.
	   The case in Guangzhou against Cheung and 35 alleged members of
his gang wrapped up last week, with the defendants now awaiting
verdicts and sentences.
	   Cheung's common-law wife, Law Yim-fong, recently succeeded in a
separate Hong Kong legal battle that lifted restraint orders on her
assets, while dropping bail conditions that were set when she was
arrested in August on suspicion of laundering money for Cheung.
	   Cheung's trial in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160 kms) north of the
border, was off limits to journalists.
	   The news blackout was met with a variety of unconfirmed reports
on the case by Hong Kong's aggressive media, riveted by one of the
most dramatic gang trials in Hong Kong history that also raised
questions about mainland and Hong Kong legal jurisdictions.

Report: China executes seven in huge heroin case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Seven heroin traffickers have been
executed in Shanghai's biggest group of drug cases to date, and
three people received suspended death sentences, an official
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Police seized a total of 81.85 kilograms (180 pounds) of heroin
in the nine related cases, the Liberation Daily newspaper said. It
did not say when the seizures took place or give other details.
	   The executions were conducted after sentencing Tuesday by the
Shanghai Intermediate People's Court, the newspaper said. It
identified two of those executed as Ma Yuchuan and Chen Lutai but
did not give names of the others.
	   Death sentences for three convicts were suspended for two years,
the newspaper said. That period is intended to let prisoners show
contrition, and the death sentence may be converted to a prison
term.
	   Three other convicts received life prison terms and four were
sentenced to nine to 12 years, the newspaper said.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ One man was killed and eight other people
were injured in a war-era grenade blast in southern Vietnam, the
provincial army command said Wednesday.
	   The incident took place Saturday in An Giang province when
Nguyen Thanh Binh, 19, dropped the grenade he had found and it
exploded.
	   The command said Binh was killed and eight others standing
nearby were injured.
	   Hundreds of people are killed each year by explosions of
leftover Vietnam War-era ordnance. Many victims are children or
scrap-iron collectors who risk their lives to make a little money.

Honduras' doctors cope with a disaster, fear a catastrophe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Unable to bear the strain any
longer, the acting chief of Honduras' largest hospital burst into
tears as he considered the disaster Hurricane Mitch has made of his
country's health care system.
	   ``Forgive me,'' Dr. Manuel Carrasco Villela begged, wiping his
tired eyes. ``Forgive me. It's been seven days of this. We are
completely dismembered in this country. ... The health system is
dismembered. This is going to get worse.''
	   The toll of Hurricane Mitch grew to an estimated 9,000 dead
Tuesday. Some 7,000 deaths occurred in Honduras, Col. Rene Osorio
of the country's national emergency commission said late Tuesday in
a telephone interview.
	   At the 1,100-bed Teachers Hospital (Hospital Escuela) in the
capital of Tegucigalpa, much of the staff for days have been on
nearly round-the-clock duty, coping with shortages of blood,
medicines and food and knowing the worst is to come.
	   Those who can get home for a few brief hours each night have to
deal with an overnight curfew imposed to quash vandalism, looting
and robberies by criminals wearing police uniforms. Many, however,
stay in the cavernous building of fading paint, missing elevators
and doors, and run-down corridors.
	   ``I've been here since Friday. The trauma has been
overwhelming,'' said paramedic Jose Isais Funez Cruz. ``They told
me, `You work in a hospital. Your duty is to attend the people
until the country collapses.'''
	   Like most of the city of 800,000, the state-owned Teachers
Hospital has been without water since Saturday. No drinking water
for its 600 patients, no washing of clothes and soiled cloths. On
Tuesday, staff got the pump that drives the hospital's well working
again, only to find the hurricane had damaged the pipes.
	   For now, doctors rely on tanker trucks to bring water from
cisterns on a nearby mountain, Carrasco explained. But the wait is
agonizingly long _ the trucks are mired in traffic jams caused by
destroyed bridges and roads _ and the 4,000 gallons (15,141 liters)
each delivers is quickly used up.
	   ``You can live in a house without water. But a hospital?'' Funez
Cruz said.
	   Other essentials are running out: canned food, powdered milk for
infants and mothers, analgesics, antibiotics, antiinflammatories.
	   As the scale of the disaster becomes better known and
transportation is restored in the days ahead, doctors anticipate
more patients and the threat of malaria, bronchial and intestinal
infections, Funez Cruz said.
	   The flood-swollen Choluteca River, which cut this city in half
and destroyed most of its bridges, savaged the second-floor blood
bank at the nearby Social Security Hospital and seriously damaged
blood banks run by the Red Cross. Its patients were tranferred to
the Teachers Hospital.
	   ``We need blood,'' Carrasco said glumly. ``We need serum.''
	   Its rampage fed by Mitch, the Rio Chiquito plowed through the
city morgue, forcing workers to move bodies to a refrigerated
trailer lent by a local businessman and parked in a lot outside the
hospital.
	   On Tuesday, 18 flood victims were inside the trailer, wrapped in
black plastic bags. More victims are expected. The morgue itself
now consists of a tiny hospital faculty office and a small
staircase leading to the parking lot; each day, hundreds of people
visit, looking for missing loved ones.
	   ``We're wondering how we'll get another morgue,'' said Dr.
Arturo Alvarez, chief of the public ministry's judicial morgue.
``That's my title, but I don't have a morgue any more. We're
homeless as well.''
	   Alvarez watched a family stoically place a wooden casket
containing the body of Jose Reynaldo Zuniga into a pickup truck and
drive into the darkness before the 8 p.m. curfew fell. Zuniga, 52,
had been shot and killed during a prison riot as floodwaters
swirled into the central penitentiary next to the old morgue.
	   ``We've been left with nothing,'' Alvarez said.

	   Overwhelmed by the enormity of death and destruction and
stretched by meager resourses, Nicaraguan officials were beginning
to be criticized for their handling of the disaster.
	   ``Murderer!'' a crowd screamed Tuesday at Nicaraguan President
Arnoldo Aleman in Leon, the largest city near the monstrous
mudslide. ``You are starving us to death!''
	   ``We're hungry! We're hungry!'' they chanted at the president,
who had traveled to Leon to meet with church officials about
disaster relief.
	   Leon is a stronghold of the leftist Sandinistas, who ruled the
country during the 1980s and now form Nicaragua's second-largest
political force. They have accused the conservative president of
minimizing and being slow to respond to the tragedy.

	   LAS CRUCES, New Mexico (AP) _ Senior Charles Gosa scored 21
points to lead New Mexico State to an 80-77 win over Sakalai,
Lithuania, in an exhibition college basketball game Tuesday night.
	   The Aggies erased a 43-41 halftime lead by Sakalai behind the
scoring of Gosa, Gerard Moore and Billy Keys. Moore and Keys, who
transferred to NMSU from Northeastern Illinois after that school
dropped its basketball program at the end of last season, added 15
and 13 points respectively.
	   Rolandas Jarutis led Sakalai with 20 points. Ramunas Siskauskas
scored 19.
	   Both teams had trouble finding the range from behind the 3-point
arc. New Mexico State hit just 4 of 22 3s, while the Lithuanias
were 1-for-9.
	   NMSU's defense forced Sakalai into 21 turnovers.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's sacked
deputy prime minister, asked police to intimidate witnesses in a
sexual misconduct investigation against him, a witness testified
Wednesday at Anwar's corruption trial.
	   The dramatic trial entered its third day with prosecutors
offering more testimony to prove that Anwar had used his influence
as deputy prime minister and finance minister to mask sexual
misdeeds.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eliminate his challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year rule.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, the former chief of the Special Branch,
Malaysia's top police intelligence unit, resumed his testimony
after being called Tuesday as the first of 52 prosecution witnesses
expected to take the stand.
	   Mohamed told the court that Anwar had ordered him to arrest two
people who had made allegations against the former No. 2 and obtain
retractions from them.
	   Mohamed had immediately told police officers to act on it. ``I
told them they had less than 24 hours to obtain a retraction of the
allegations,'' Mohamed said.
	   Anwar had also ``wanted us to ensure that there was no
publicity,'' Mohamed said.
	   On Tuesday, he said the Special Branch had launched an
investigation into sexual misconduct by Anwar in 1992, a year
before he was named to his Cabinet posts.
	   In August 1997, the investigation turned serious with a letter
and a sworn statement that accused Anwar of adultery and sodomy.
	   The statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other, by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the
sister of Anwar's private secretary, said her brother's wife had
sex with Anwar.
	   Both statements were also sent to Mahathir, who at first wrote
them off as poison-pen letters.
	   Mohamed said Anwar repeatedly met with police late at night to
learn more about the authors of the letters. He said Anwar ``urged
me to find them quickly and to interview them. He used the word
`gempar.'''
	   The Malay word caused a buzz through the courtroom and debate
over its meaning in English. Mohamed then said: ``That word means
to surprise them and to put fear in them.''
	   Mohamed testified that Anwar resisted police advice that he file
a police report looking into the letters. When he finally did,
Azizan and Ummi were detained and questioned.
	   ``He wanted us to question them deeply as to why they wrote the
letters,'' Mohamed said.
	   Anwar scribbled furiously on a legal pad during the hearing
Wednesday.
	   Defense lawyers were expected to argue that the charges against
Anwar were based on flimsy poison-pen letters and a government
conspiracy against him.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit to run the Southeast Asian
nation and dumped him on Sept. 2, after conducting his own
investigation into the sex charges.
	   The defense opened its case Monday saying Mahathir should be
held in contempt of court for tainting the trial by saying publicly
that Anwar should be convicted to preserve harmony in the Southeast
Asian country.
	   Tens of thousands of Malaysians have openly expressed solidarity
for Anwar, participating in street protests since he was arrested
on Sept. 20. One of those demonstrations turned into a full-scale
riot 12 days ago when police fired tear gas and water cannons at
stone-pelting protesters.
	   It was the first clash between police and typically placid
Malaysians in nearly three decades.
	   Armed riot police guarded the street outside the federal
courthouse Wednesday and a water cannon truck was parked a few
hundred meters (yards) away.
	   Several international observers, who had failed to gain entry
into the courthouse during the opening of the trial, were allowed
in Wednesday. Still, an opposition politician who wanted to watch
the trial was barred. Bailiffs told Fadzil Noor, president of the
Parti Islam SeMalaysia, there was no room in the court.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, as Malaysia hosts 20 world leaders in the capital
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. When the trial
resumes, the fifth graft charge and the five sex charges will be
heard.

Cup winner aims for Europe

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Chris
Munce wants to cash in on his success by lining up a riding stint
in Britain or Europe.
	   Munce rode favorite Jezabeel to victory in the 3,200-meter
Melbourne Cup on Tuesday following a massive betting plunge on the
New Zealand mare.
	   Munce said Wednesday he had a four-month contract lined up in
Hong Kong early next year and wished to broaden his horizons after
that.
	   ``I've got a club contract from next February but I could stay
longer depending on how I go and what opportunities arise,'' Munce
said Wednesday. ``But I would love to ride in England and Europe.
It's always been in my mind to give it a go over there.''
	   Munce said he had watched races in Europe and liked what he saw.
	   ``I haven't had any offers or anything like that yet but I'd
love to try it for the experience if nothing else,'' Munce said.
	   Munce saw off the challenge of five British horses and two from
Singapore in the field of 24 to win the Cup from fellow-Kiwi mare
Champagne.
	   ``Australian riding is the most competitive in the world,''
Munce said. ``It's a lot tighter and definitely harder here than
any other place in the world.''

Chinese dissident arrested, two others reported missing

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A former Tiananmen Square student leader who
recently tried to form an opposition party has been detained in the
eastern city of Hangzhou and two others have been reported missing,
a human rights group said Wednesday.
	   Police took Wang Youcai from his home on Monday and contacted
his family a day later advising that he had been detained for
allegedly leaving home without police permission, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   The police did not say how long Wang would be held, the Hong
Kong-based group said. Wang was released on Aug. 30 after spending
seven weeks in detention following his attempt to form a political
party to challenge the Communist Party's monopoly on power.
	   As a condition for his release, police told Wang he could not
leave home without their permission.
	   The Information Center reported that two other dissidents who
had returned to China from overseas exile disappeared Monday in
Hangzhou and possibly were in police custody along with Wang
Youcai.
	   Wang Ce and Li Li, who had returned to Hangzhou from Spain and
France, respectively, had told activist colleagues their purpose in
returning to China was to promote political change, the center
said.
	   No details on their whereabouts were available.
	   Wang Youcai and other activists announced the formation of the
China Democracy Party on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill
Clinton arrived on a visit. After Clinton's departure, police
detained Wang and 11 others in connection with the party.
	   Police have since detained or interrogated many of those
connected with the group and government officials have rejected
repeated attempts by dissidents to register the group as required
by law.
	   In 1989, after the military quelled democracy demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square, Wang was on the list of 21 most-wanted student
leaders. He was caught and sentenced to prison, but released early
in late 1991.

Somali asylum seeker seeks new hearing in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A man who says his father and
brother were killed in Somalia and whose sister was raped there
asked Australia's High Court Wednesday to overturn a decision to
expel him from the country.
	   The man, whose identity has been suppressed by the court, is
seeking refugee status and has been held at the Maribyrnong
Detention Center since he arrived in Australia in October last
year.
	   His lawyers asked the court to freeze a ruling by the
government's Refugee Review Tribunal, which found that he should be
repatriated to the Somalian capital of Mogadishu. They also
petitioned the court to give the man a new refugee application
hearing.
	   High Court judge Kenneth Hayne granted a stay until Monday, when
the parties in the case will return to court for further argument.
	   Debbie Mortimer, a lawyer for the man, described her client's
painful history in Somalia, including the deaths of relatives and
the repeated rape of his sister by an opposing clan.
	   ``If that is not harassment specific enough to constitute
persecution, then I don't know what is,'' Mortimer said.
	   Charles Gunst, representing Minister for Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs Philip Ruddock, said the government wanted to
fly the man to Johannesburg, South Africa accompanied by
immigration officials.
	   The officials would ensure he then traveled onward to Somalia.

Report points finger at military involvement in Indonesia's riots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with comment from military commander
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ With the tarnished armed forces facing
new accusations, Indonesia's military commander on Wednesday chided
a fact-finding team that said military security agents helped
incite deadly riots in May.
	   The violence resulted in gang rapes of ethnic Chinese women and
led to the resignation of former President Suharto after 32 years
of authoritarian rule in the nation of 200 million people.
	   The military chief, Gen. Wiranto, did not directly comment on
the accusations by a government-backed panel that some of his
troops took part in the mayhem apparently designed to destabilize
the government.
	   ``The team was asked only to find facts from people, to get
testimony and to report to the Cabinet ministers who had assigned
them, '' Wiranto said.
	   ``They were not supposed to announce an analysis of what they
found,'' he told reporters before a Cabinet meeting.
	   However, the official Antara news agency quoted Wiranto as
saying he would follow recommendations of the team, including more
probes of the riots, prosecution of suspects, and security for
witnesses and victims who testify.
	   After three months of investigation, a panel set up by Suharto's
successor, President B.J. Habibie, said some members of the
military urged crowds to loot and burn across the capital, Jakarta,
and elsewhere.
	   Others simply let mobs go wild during the May 13-15 riots, it
said.
	   The unrest, sparked by economic hardship and the killings of
four student protesters by the military on May 12, left 1,200
people dead.
	   The report, released late Tuesday, is a further blow to the
armed forces, now caught between widespread allegations of human
rights abuses under Suharto and a new role as a promoter of
democratic reform promised by Habibie.
	   It comes as the military prepares a huge security operation to
protect a government assembly that will cast guidelines next week
for general elections in 1999. Student activists, who earlier
opposed Suharto, plan big protests again, saying Habibie's
government is not moving fast enough on political reform.
	   ``The riots in Jakarta can be described as an effort to topple
the power unconstitutionally,'' said Marzuki Darusman, chairman of
the panel that includes human rights activists, senior police
officers, lawyers, bureaucrats and community leaders.
	   Some government opponents have alleged military hard-liners
provoked the riots because they wanted an excuse to crack down on
dissidents, a charge that the military has vehemently denied.
	   The report disputes military claims that no mass sexual attacks
were committed during the riots, concluding instead that 66 women
were raped and another 10 women were assaulted.
	   ``Not all the victims of sexual violence were from the ethnic
Chinese (group)...but the majority were,'' Darusman said at a news
conference.
	   Many of the rapes were committed by gangs as crowds watched, he
said.
	   Darusman acknowledged that much of the unrest was triggered by
anger over price increases amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in decades.
	   He did not speculate on whether military involvement in the
riots was approved by top commanders.
	   Without elaborating, he said infighting between political
leaders also helped provoke the riots.
	   He urged the military to court-martial former Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto who was fired from his post as
commander of Indonesia's special forces after admitting to
involvement in the kidnapping of nine political activists during
the final months of Suharto's rule.
	   Darusman also said the government should investigate Maj. Gen.
Syafrie Sjamsuddin, an ally of Prabowo who was head of the Jakarta
military at the time of the riots.

Australia warns more needs to be done to protect marine ecosystems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The future of Australia's fisheries
industry may be threatened unless action is taken to reduce the
human impact on marine ecosystems, a government report released
Wednesday found.
	   Federal Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Minister Mark Vaile
released the report, which he said was the most comprehensive
review of Australian fisheries ever undertaken.
	   The Fisheries Habitat Review represented the culmination of a 2
1/2-year survey of scientific studies of Australia's marine
environment coordinated by the Fisheries Research and Development
Corp.
	   It identifies the research priorities for the protection of
fisheries ecosystems.
	   ``With commercial activity in the fishing industry generating
some Australian dollars 2 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion) each year
and trade revenue now growing at an annual rate of 15 percent, the
future of Australia's fifth most valuable rural industry is
dependent on safeguarding our fisheries habitat,'' Vaile said.
	   The review found that Australia was a world leader in developing
ocean, coastal and estuary habitat management, protection and
conservation policies.
	   But more action was needed to rehabilitate degraded habitats and
reduce the impact of humans on ecosystems, the report said.
	   It called for further coordinated research and development to
overcome gaps in existing knowledge and to ensure ongoing
ecologically sustainable management of fisheries ecosystems.
	   Strategic planning and management between federal, state and
industry agencies should also be integrated into an overall
national strategic plan.
	   ``It is appropriate that Australia, with one of the world's
largest exclusive economic zones and rich and varied fish habitats,
should lead the world in identifying practices to ensure their
continuing health and safe harvests,'' Vaile said.

Report: Mobs torture and beat to death suspected killer in
</HEADLINE>
Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers tortured and beat a man to
death after they suspected him of being involved in a wave of
mysterious murders, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The reported killing was the latest by vigilantes who have taken
to the streets on the main island of Java after the murders of
dozens of Muslim clerics and others accused of practicing black
magic.
	   The newspaper Kompas said a crowd attacked Achmad Sobari, 36, in
Bojonggede, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Jakarta, after
he asked for directions to get to a local Muslim preacher's house.
	   The paper said he became nervous when a crowd gathered and asked
him why he wanted to go there.
	   They killed him after accusing him of planning to murder the
clergyman.
	   Fear prevails in many small towns, where mobs have lynched
people suspected of carrying out the murders. In many areas,
mentally ill people have become scapegoats.
	   Muslim leaders have warned they will deploy their own civilian
security forces if the military is unable to restore order.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ ``Star Wars'' is finally catching up

	   After 21 years at the center of the universe he created for his
blockbuster movie series, Lucas says he is only now discovering the
impression he has made on millions of viewers.
	   ``When you're in the center of something like this you don't see
it very much,'' Lucas said. ``The one thing I regret just a little
bit is that I am on the inside not the outside so (it is hard) for
me to understand what the impact is for everybody else.
	   ``I'm beginning to see it, through my five-year-old son. He's a
Star Wars fanatic now and wants me to buy all the toys. I'm
beginning to see what most people have been going through.''
	   Lucas' comment came Wednesday during a news conference he used
to announce that his company, Lucasfilm Ltd., and Fox Studios
Australia will make the next two films in a three-part prequel to
the ``Star Wars'' trilogy in Australia.
	   Filming for the first movie in the new series, ``Star Wars:
Episode I The Phantom Menace,'' was completed in Britain last year
and is due for release in the United States in May 1999. The film
stars British actors Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, as a young Ben
Kenobi.
	   Lucas said the new series _ he is still writing the script for
``Episode II'' _ will tell the tale of the characters introduced in
the Star Wars trilogy before filmgoers first met them in 1977. The
original ``Star Wars'' is episode four of a series conceived in the
1970s and which Lucas says he is releasing in chapters.
	   ``Think of it as a little television mini-series, made over 40
years,'' he said.
	   Plot details are still largely under wraps, but Lucas said the
new films will include the tale of how the evil Darth Vader became
the villain of the piece, including how he came to wear the
trade-mark black mask.
	   Lucas said technological advances made since the last in the
current trilogy, 1983's ``Return of the Jedi,'' represented a major
breakthrough in special effects for the new movies.
	   ``I spent nine years doing `Star Wars,' the first trilogy, and
basically I was tired of doing it and didn't want to go back before
I had the technology which would allow me to broaden the scope,''
Lucas said.
	   ``The digital revolution we are going through is going to have a
major impact on the way we tell stories. One of the biggest
problems I've had in the past is that most of the characters had to
be made out of latex. It is very hard to direct around a large
rubber thing that can't move very well.''
	   Experiments with digital technology helped produce the slug-like
character Jabba the Hut for a reissued special edition of the
original films. So Lucas said the new films will have more digital
characters.
	   ``The big advance ... is that I've got digital characters which
can actually walk and talk with live action characters and do a
performance,'' he said.
	   The new films will be largely shot on a soundstage in Fox's
complex in Sydney, with post-production at Lucas' headquarters in
San Francisco.
	   ``Episode II,'' is expected to begin shooting in April 2000, and
``Episode III'' in 2003, Fox Studios Australia chief executive Kim
Williams said.
	   Fox Studios Australia is a 50-50 joint venture between media
magnate Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Lend Lease Corp.
	   News Corp. company 20th Century Fox will have worldwide
theatrical and video distribution for the upcoming films.

Hong Kong monetary head urges China to back loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chief of Hong Kong's de facto central bank
has urged China to back shaky loans that Hong Kong commercial banks
arranged for a provincial lending institution shut by regulators,
it was reported Wednesday.
	   But the governor of the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong,
apparently has only reiterated China's willingness to honor loans
that were registered with the appropriate mainland authorities _ a
stance that could put many loans from Hong Kong in jeopardy.
	   Any guarantee of foreign loans made to the failed Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., or other troubled
``Itics,'' as the provincial Chinese lenders are known, is a
delicate issue now under discussion by top officials from Hong Kong
and Beijing.
	   Much of the foreign lending was set up through Hong Kong
subsidiaries of the Itics and not legally registered in China,
bypassing the mainland's rules for disclosure and loan guarantees.
	   The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph
Yam, has been in Beijing, reportedly seeking assurances that bad
loans at the Guangdong lender, known as ``Gitic,'' won't become too
much of a problem for Hong Kong banks.
	   Yam reportedly argued that China should recognize the validity
of the loans if they were made properly in Hong Kong _ despite any
lack of registration in China.
	   Yam cited China's ``one country, two systems'' policy that
allows for conflicting laws to exist in Hong Kong and the mainland
following Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese sovereignty
last year, according to the respected Hong Kong Economic Journal.
	   Yam and a delegation of 17 Hong Kong bankers reportedly met
Tuesday with Liao Hui, China's top official handling dealings with
Hong Kong. The bankers reportedly planned to meet Wednesday with
the Chinese central bank governor, Dai.
	   The Associated Press was unable to obtain official confirmation
of what has been discussed. HKMA officials did not immediately
respond to a reporter's telephone inquiries.
	   When Gitic was closed last month, Hong Kong bankers became
worried about problem loans emerging at other Chinese Itics. Many
are saddled with billions of dollars of debt that may be difficult
to repay. Gitic alone reportedly has debts equaling U.S. dlrs 2
billion.
	   The settlement of Gitic's debts will influence how other similar
loans are repaid, Yam reportedly told the mainland Chinese
officials.
	   People's Bank of China officials said in October that the
central bank would repay at least some creditors, giving priority
to debts registered in China. That left bankers with unregistered
debt wondering whether they have any chance of getting their money
back.
	   The central bank governor, Dai, reiterated this policy Tuesday
in an interview with Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese-language Hong Kong
daily known for authoritative coverage of mainland affairs.
	   While backing the Itic creditors, Yam was quoted by the Hong Kog
Standard as saying banks should be more careful in their future
lending.

New Japan economic stimulus measures may exceed proposed amount
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of Obuchi comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ New government spending measures to boost Japan's
sagging economy may exceed the 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion)
promised by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Japan's economic planning
chief said Wednesday.
	   The government is expected to announce the fresh stimulus steps
on Nov. 16, and Cabinet ministers held an emergency meeting
Wednesday to discuss the plan.
	   Economic Planning Agency Director General Taichi Sakaiya told
reporters after the meeting that any new economic steps must
trigger an immediate boost in domestic demand in order to ensure a
return to economic growth next year.
	   ``Right now, the economy is in an extremely severe condition,''
Sakaiya said. ``The government's economic steps shouldn't be
limited to the 10 trillion yen framework.''
	   Japan has been mired in a deep recession, and the government is
struggling to come up with a strategy to prevent the economy from
shrinking in fiscal 1999 for a third consecutive year.
	   The government estimates gross domestic product will contract by
1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends next March.
	   During Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, Obuchi reaffirmed his
determination to restore economic growth to Japan in one to two
years, and called for drastic measures to bring that about, Kyodo
News reported.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan may
provide financial assistance to Brazil after the country finishes
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for an estimated
dlrs 30 billion aid package.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper reported Wednesday that
the Japanese government would commit up to dlrs 1 billion in aid
for the struggling Latin American giant.
	   Brazil has been the latest country to be rocked by global
financial turbulence, and experts fear that a sharp economic
downturn in South America could seriously damage the already
vulnerable U.S. economy.

Philippine Muslim guerrillas seek government recognition of
</HEADLINE>
territories

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim guerrillas said Wednesday they
will seek government recognition of 46 of their camps in the
southern Philippines as rebel territories to avoid accidental
clashes with government troops.
	   Al Haj Murad, vice chairman for military affairs of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, said the issue will be discussed in peace
talks with Philippine officials in the southern Islamic city of
Marawi between Wednesday and Friday.
	   The government has already agreed in principle to grant such
recognition under a cease-fire accord signed in August last year,
Murad said.
	   He said the recognition would not signify rebel ownership, but
control of the lands, so that government forces would be required
to seek permission before entering.
	   ``The best way is to identify these areas where we have our
troops so we can avoid accidental clashes,'' Murad said.
	   He said the MILF has given government negotiators the locations
of 13 major and 33 minor MILF camps in the southern Mindanao region
and asked that they be recognized as rebel territories.
	   Presidential Assistant Manuel Yan has said the government has
begun an inventory of the MILF camps.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim guerrilla groups still at
war with the government to establish an independent Islamic state
in the southern Philippines.
	   The government signed a peace accord in 1996 with the largest
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, and then opened
peace negotiations with the MILF, which controls large hinterland
areas in Mindanao.
	   The MILF maintains its main camp in Maguindanao, about 880
kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Manila.

Voters send Clinton mixed messages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Election Roundup
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As the final votes were being tallied,
Republicans expressed bitter disappointment. Democrats, survivors
of a year of White House scandal, predicted with some authority
that Tuesday's national elections would slow the push toward
impeachment.
	   Gleefully interpreting voters' intentions, Democratic Party
chairman Roy Romer declared, ``They said `No' to the party that
said `We're going to investigate the president.'''
	   The message sent by voters was not so clearcut.
	   A thin majority said they want the Monica Lewinsky inquiry of
Clinton dropped and that they approve of the president's job
performance. Nearly two-thirds expressed disapproval with the way
Republicans have handled the pre-impeachment proceedings, according
to surveys of voters at polling booths across America.
	   Yet two-thirds of the voters questioned said they believe the
Lewinsky inquiry has hurt Clinton's ability to lead, about the same
percentage of people who expressed a low opinion of him as a
person.
	   Victories over Republican Sens. Alfonse D`Amato of New York and
Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, two strong critics of Clinton,
lifted the spirits of a Democratic Party battered by last-minute
Republican advertising efforts to make an issue of the Lewinsky
inquiry.
	   Republicans, meanwhile, struggled to maintain their House
majority, a bitter development for party leaders who had predicted
big gains.
	   Democrats defeated two Republican southern governors, David
Beasley of South Carolina and Fob James of Alabama, scored an upset
victory in Iowa and won the single biggest race of the year: the
California governorship.
	   All this provided a strong measure of solace for the fact that
Democrats lost control of the House, the Senate and America's
statehouses under Clinton.
	   House Speaker Newt Gingrich claimed a minimalist victory, saying
his leadership team was the first in 70 years to win the House
three times in a row for Republicans.
	   ``Every chairmanship will be Republican,'' he said, as if that
should be enough to satisfy his party's rank-and-file membership.
	   It may not be.
	   Conservatives believe Gingrich compromised too often in the
budget process. His eleventh-hour gamble to pour millions of
dollars into an anti-Clinton ad campaign didn't pay off; it might
have helped turn out Democratic voters.
	   ``Republicans tried to win on anti-Clinton sentiment, while
Democrats had an agenda of issues such as Social Security and
education,'' said Randy Tate, director of the Christian Coalition,
a conservative group.
	   Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said he was ``a bit
saddened by our failures throughout the country and I think we're
going to have to go back to the messages of Ronald Reagan and Teddy
Roosevelt.''
	   Gingrich, a man whose White House aspirations now hang in the
balance, was criticized by fellow Republicans with presidential
ambitions.
	   ``I think it's inevitable now that the leadership will be
challenged in both chambers of Congress, and a lot of Republicans
across the country will be cheering those changes,'' said Gary
Bauer, a conservative activist who plans to run for president.
	   Gingrich countered with promises that tax cuts he failed to
secure this time will be the first order of business in January.
	   As for Clinton, his supporters hoped that Republicans will
quickly end the House inquiry _ perhaps with a presidential
censure, but no impeachment.

Se Ri Pak leaves hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Golfer Se Ri Pak left a hospital
Wednesday to rest at her home in the Seoul suburbs after being
treated for exhaustion and a cold.
	   ``I am happy to leave the hospital. I would like to have some
free time for the next few days, hanging around with my friends and
doing what I want,'' Pak said.
	   Her corporate sponsor, Samsung, accepted at least some of the
blame for driving her to exhaustion with an unending round of
promotional events since she returned to South Korea last Tuesday.
	   ``We cannot avoid the blame because we set up her schedule,''
said Kim Dong-suk, a Samsung spokesman. ``But it wasn't just us.
Everybody wanted her.
	   ``I wouldn't call it pressure, but there were some requests from
the press and other organizations that we could not reject,'' Kim
added.
	   Pak became ill late Saturday after playing in chilly, rainy
weather in the second round of the Korea LPGA and was admitted to
Seoul's Samsung hospital.
	   The 21-year-old rookie will stay at her home until she leaves
for the United States on Saturday for the Tour Championship, the
last LPGA event of the year.
	   Pak has won four LPGA tournaments, including the U.S. Women's
Open and the LPGA Championship, in the best rookie year since Nancy
Lopez' debut in 1978.
	   But she has only a slim chance of beating Annika Sorenstam in
the Player of the Year points race. A victory at the Tour
Championship is worth 60 points and Pak is about 40 points behind
Sorenstam.

Report: Mobs torture and beat to death man in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Edits overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers tortured and beat a man to
death after they suspected him of being involved in a wave of
mysterious murders, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The reported killing was the latest by vigilantes who have taken
to the streets on the main island of Java after the murders of
dozens of Muslim clerics and others accused of practicing black
magic.
	   The newspaper Kompas said a crowd attacked Achmad Sobari, 36, in
Bojonggede, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Jakarta, after
he asked for directions to get to a local Muslim preacher's house.
	   The paper said he became nervous when a crowd gathered and asked
him why he wanted to go there.
	   They killed him after accusing him of planning to murder the
clergyman.
	   Fear prevails in many small towns, where mobs have lynched
people suspected of carrying out the murders. In many areas,
mentally ill people have become scapegoats.
	   Muslim leaders have warned they will deploy their own civilian
security forces if the military is unable to restore order.

Astros make offer to Johnson; Cordero let go by White Sox
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Houston Astros are making an offer to Randy
Johnson. That's no surprise.
	   The Chicago White Sox are letting Wil Cordero go. That's no
surprise, either.
	   Johnson, one of the top two pitchers available as a free agent,
along with Kevin Brown, went 10-1 for Houston after the Astros
acquired him from Seattle on July 31. General manager Gerry
Hunsicker disputed a report in The Houston Chronicle that they
proposed a three-year deal worth dlrs 33 million to dlrs 36
million, but confirmed an offer was made.
	   Johnson's short list of teams includes the Astros, Anaheim
Angels, Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers.
	   Diamondbacks general manager partner Jerry Colangelo visited
Johnson on Sunday, speaking with him, his wife Lisa and agents
Barry Meister and Alan Nero.
	   Cordero, a first baseman and designated hitter, batted .267 with
13 homers in 96 games. After pleading guilty to spousal abuse last
year, Cordero was let go by the Boston Red Sox. The White Sox
signed him to a dlrs 1 million, one-year contract last spring.
	   ``We have absolutely no hard feelings toward the organization,''
agent Jeff Moorad said. ``We can only hope that Wil's next team is
as supportive as the Sox have been.''
	   Cordero was among six players filing for free agency Tuesday,
raising the total to 130. Up to nine more are potentially eligible
to file by Thursday's deadline.
	   Also filing Tuesday were Boston pitcher Dennis Eckersley and
outfielder Darren Lewis, Cleveland catcher Pat Borders and San
Francisco pitcher Danny Darwin.
	   David Cone and the New York Yankees continued discussions about
a possible extension. Cone, a 20-game winner for the first time
since 1988, agreed last week to extend until midnight EST tonight
the deadline for a decision on his dlrs 5.5 million player option.
	   If the Yankees don't agree to an extension, Cone is expected to
decline the option.

Report: Another Salinas brother investigated by Mexican
</HEADLINE>
authorities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Another brother of former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari has sought court protection from arrest,
believing prosecutors have named him in a new warrant against the
eldest of the brothers Raul Salinas, local media reported.
	   Sergio Salinas sought a court injunction Tuesday to avoid the
possibility of being arrested on supposed charges of illicit
enrichment, family lawyers told the government news agency Notimex
on Tuesday.
	   Federal authorities reportedly presented a new arrest warrant
last week against Raul _ who is already in a maximum-security
prison near Mexico City _ and his younger brother, Salinas family
attorney Raul Cardenas is quoted as saying.
	   Federal prosecutors were unavailable to comment.
	   Raul Salinas is imprisoned and on trial on charges of illicit
enrichment and masterminding the 1994 murder of a political rival.
Carlos Salinas, who left office in 1994, has never been charged
with a crime.
	   Arrest warrants also were issued against Raul Salinas'
accountant, Juan Manuel Gomez Gutierrez and his assistants,
Maricela Arias and Juan Manuel Gomez Caro, according to the report.
	   Swiss authorities last month ordered the seizure of more than
dlrs 100 million in Raul Salinas' offshore accounts, saying the
funds constituted in part the criminal proceeds of protection
payoffs.
	   Former President Carlos Salinas is believed to be living in
Ireland in self-imposed exile.

Injured Muralitharan out of Sharjah tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka will be without its ace
off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for the upcoming Coca Cola Trophy
tournament in Sharjah, the cricket board announced Wednesday.
	   Muralitharan injured his right shoulder during a semifinal match
against South Africa in the Mini-World Cup in the Bangladeshi
capital Dhaka last week. He is expected to be fit next week, and
may join the team then.
	   All-rounder Thilan Samaraweera is in the 14-member squad, which
also includes spinners Kumar Dharmasena and Upul Chandana.
	   The pace attack is led by the experienced Chaminda Vaas and the
lanky Nuwan Zoysa who impressed in the last tournament. Veteran
fast bowler Pramodya Wickremasinghe is also in the squad as backup.
	   Sri Lanka's batting lineup, which proved to be woefully out of
form in Bangladesh, remains unchanged. Dashing Sanath Jayasuriya
and wicket keeper Romesh Kaluwitharana will open, with Marvan
Atapattu at number three, followed by Aravinda de Silva and captain
Arjuna Ranatunge.
	   Hard hitting batsman Avishka Gunawardana, who was impressive
during the recent Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lampur, is also in
the squad.
	   India and Zimbabwe are the other two teams in the tournament
which begins on Friday.

Police chief warns of Tamil rebel attack in Colombo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police are asking hotel owners to
report new arrivals to authorities and to be careful about renting
rooms to strangers following reports that Tamil Tiger rebels were
planning bomb attacks in the capital, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The Island newspaper said the alert from Inspector General of
Police Lucky Kodituwakku came after sleuths from the anti-terrorism
department arrested two rebels who under interrogation revealed
plots to attack Colombo. When contacted by The Associated Press,
Kodituwakku's staff said he was busy in a meeting and declined to
take calls.
	   Thousands of visitors come to the Sri Lankan capital daily. A
sizable number are ethnic Tamils.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is the main rebel group
fighting a 15-year-old separatist war in the north and east of this
island nation off India's southern coast. They often attack targets
in Colombo either to dramatize their homeland campaign or to cause
economic losses to the government.
	   The LTTE was blamed for the March 5 bus bomb attack at a busy
Colombo intersection that killed 43 people. A month earlier, a
rebel suicide bomber blew herself up at the gates of air force
headquarters in downtown Colombo, killing eight other people.
	   The rebels say they want an independent homeland where the
country's 3.3 million Tamils can prosper, saying they are
discriminated against in Sinhalese majority Sri Lanka. Sinhalese
account for 76 percent of the people. More than 56,000 people have
died in the insurrection.

WIndies cricketers arrive in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies cricket team
arrived Wednesday in South Africa without captain Brian Lara and
vice captain Carl Hooper, who are angry over their fees for the
tour here.
	   Just seven of the 16-member squad arrived, with the whereabouts
of pacemen Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose also still a mystery.
	   Walsh was supposed to have arrived Monday, Ambrose on Tuesday.
	   The West Indies Cricket Board said it has called an emergency
meeting for Wednesday at its headquarters on the Caribbean island
of Antigua, and invited Lara and Hooper, who went to London instead
of Johannesburg.
	   The West Indies Players' Association said the board had turned
down its request for a meeting in London. Instead Lara, vice
president of the association, and Hooper, the players'
representative, would meet with association president Courtney
Walsh and other team members currently in the British capital, the
players' union said in Barbados.
	   ``Everything is dependant on the outcome of the talks,'' said
West Indies team manager Clive Lloyd.
	   Lloyd said he had not been in contact with Lara since the Wills
ICC knock-out tournament in Bangladesh over the weekend.
	   ``Whether the tour goes on, without or without Lara, would be
entirely up to the West Indies Board,'' he said.
	   South African captain Hansie Cronje said he only heard about the
dispute on arriving at the airport from Bangladesh. Cronje led his
men to a decisive five-wicket win over the Windies in the Wills
final.
	   ``We actually had lunch with the West Indians the day after the
final in Dhaka,'' he said. ``There was absolutely no mention of any
problems. Personally I think it will all be sorted out. I am pretty
sure the tour will go ahead on schedule.''
	   The first meeting between the teams is set for Tuesday.
	   Cronje pointed out that his men had been confronted with a
similar situation at the start of their tour of Australia last
year, but in the end the dispute was resolved.
	   ``Obviously we would prefer to play a full strength West Indian
side, but whatever happens we have got to remain focused on what we
are doing and not allow ourselves to be sidetracked by what's
happening in their camp,'' he said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived
Wednesday in Kuwait for a brief visit to talk with the Kuwaiti
government on the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over
weapons inspectors.
	   Cohen is expected to meet the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah, for discussions on Iraq's decision Saturday
to end all cooperation with disarmament monitors.
	   Cohen flew from Saudi Arabia, where he arrived Tuesday on his
first stop of a tour of the Middle East aimed at drumming up
support for possible U.S. military action against Iraq. Cohen will
leave later Wednesday for Qatar, the news agency said.
	   There have been different accounts of the talks in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh. The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi
backing in the event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi
official _ speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told
Cohen that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks on
Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
over weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab
states in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   On Tuesday night, however, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense
ministry said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between
the United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   Several thousand U.S. troops and their weapons are stationed in
Kuwait under a 10-year defense pact that Kuwait signed with
Washington after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation.

Singapore business cost-cutting to improve competitiveness only
</HEADLINE>
slightly &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Imminent government measures to reduce business
costs will probably have greater success slowing Singapore's rise
in unemployment than improving competitiveness and luring
investment, economists say.
	   Singapore is expected to unveil a host of cost-cutting moves
later this month to aid businesses in the increasingly beleaguered
city-state, which just posted its first quarterly contraction in
gross domestic product since a recession in the mid-1980s.
	   The steps are almost certain to include a major cut in company
contributions to Singapore's mandatory state-run pension fund and
other wages, reductions in many government fees and charges, and
possibly a trimmed corporate tax rate.
	   ``The whole exercise in cost-cutting is to reduce layoffs,'' JP
Morgan Singapore economist Ong Sin Beng said in a Dow Jones
Newswires report Wednesday. But whether the measures will restore
external competitiveness ``remains to be seen,'' he added.
	   Paribas Asia Equity analyst Tara Ocborough agreed that ``the
government is using these measures to address not only wage
competitiveness, but also unemployment.''
	   But while cost-cutting during the last recession ``was aimed at
re-engineering an export recovery,'' said Ong, ``it's hard to do
the same when the region is in a slump.''
	   Singapore will find it difficult to match its regional
competitors, whose falling labor costs, relatively weaker
currencies and falling asset prices make those countries
increasingly attractive for foreign investments.
	   ``Singapore's cost-reduction drive may impress in absolute
terms, yet have only a limited impact on relative unit business
costs,'' which take local currency strength into account, explained
Ong.
	   Compared to its key export competitors, the Singapore dollar has
gained about 18 percent in value against the U.S. dollar, he said.
	   Government officials have ruled out competitive depreciation of
the Singapore dollar to boost exports, concentrating instead on
business operations.
	   Lowering business costs should stem rising unemployment, which
has doubled to 4.5 percent since June, though economists warn that
the measures will likely curtail already dampened domestic
spending.
	   While a pension fund cut ``will result in higher savings for
companies, it will have a contractionary effect on the domestic
economy because consumers will feel poorer and cut back spending,''
said Rajeev Malik, regional economist at Jardine Flemming Singapore
Securities.

would stop doing so, Canadian Television reported.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy was expected to comment
on the report later Wednesday.
	   In a statement released Tuesday night the government said:
``Minister Axworthy takes these assertions very seriously. He has
instructed his officials to immediately review the claims made in
the ... report.''
	   But Leslie Lewis, a dual Canadian-Israeli citizen who moved from
Vancouver to Israel in 1991, said Canadian authorities do not
appear to be too concerned.
	   Ottawa's ambassador to Israel, David Berger, insists the
Israelis are keeping their promise.
	   But Lewis, 55, told the CTV news magazine W-Five in a report
broadcast Tuesday night that he informed Canadian authorities the
Mossad approached him as recently as last February about getting
its hands on a Canadian passport.
	   Lewis's involvement with the Mossad began in 1996, when he
turned over his expired Canadian passport after the spy agency told
him ``they wanted to get oppressed Jews in oppressed countries out
of these countries.''
	   In September 1997, Israeli agents were caught after a bungled
assassination attempt of a prominent Palestinian militant leader in
neighboring Jordan. The agents were carrying doctored Canadian
passports, causing a major diplomatic flap between Canada and
Israel.
	   In November 1997, then Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
promised Axworthy that Israel would not use Canadian passports
again.
	   Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also told his secret
service that Canadian passports were off-limits.
	   But within weeks, Lewis told W-Five that the Mossad asked him
again for his new passport, a request he refused. And last
February, he said the agency asked yet again, this time about
getting his daughter to apply for a Canadian passport so she could
turn it over.
	   Lewis told W-Five he also knew of a case in which the Mossad
approached another Canadian in April and was given a passport.
	   He said he reported the incidents to the Canadian embassy.

US Defense Secretary Cohen arrives in Kuwait for talks on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived
Wednesday in Kuwait for a brief visit to talk with the Kuwaiti
government on the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over
weapons inspectors.
	   Cohen is expected to meet the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah, for discussions on Iraq's decision Saturday
to end all cooperation with disarmament monitors.
	   Cohen flew from Saudi Arabia, where he arrived Tuesday on his
first stop of a tour of the Middle East aimed at drumming up
support for possible U.S. military action against Iraq. Cohen will
leave later Wednesday for Qatar, the state-run Kuwait News Agency
reported.
	   There have been different accounts of the talks in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh. The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi
backing in the event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi
official _ speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told
Cohen that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks on
Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
over weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab
states in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   On Tuesday night, however, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense
ministry said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between
the United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack, while U.S. officials maintained they were
privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that Cohen
was told that Arab leaders would support an attack only if it was
guaranteed to remove President Saddam Hussein.
	   Several thousand U.S. troops and their weapons are stationed in
Kuwait under a 10-year defense pact that Kuwait signed with
Washington after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation.

14-year-old arrested for allegedly coercing girlfriend into
</HEADLINE>
prostitution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion
that he coerced his girlfriend into prostitution to obtain money to
repay his computer game debts, Tokyo police said Wednesday.
	   By threatening to leave her, the boy forced the 14-year-old
girl, a student at the same junior high school, to have sex with a
39-year-old man at a hotel in late August, a police spokesman said.
	   The boy owed an unspecified amount of money from losses in
playing computer games at a game shop, said the spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Kyodo News agency said police also were preparing to turn the
39-year-old man's case over to prosecutors. It said the man, a
teacher at an elementary school near Tokyo, had sex with the girl
several times, paying 20,000 to 30,000 yen (dlrs 174 to dlrs 260)
each time.
	   Kyodo said police learned of the case from a friend of the girl.
	   Violators of Japan's Child Welfare Act can be sentenced to up to
10 years in prison or fines up to 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,300) if
convicted.
	   Because he is under age 16, the boy cannot be sent to prison
under Japan's juvenile laws. His name and the girl's were both
being withheld because of their ages.
	   Last year, police took into protective custody a total of 300
teen-age girls involved in prostitution across the country, down
from 562 in 1996, according to National Police Agency figures.

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar's Trial &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESHWARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Representatives of international
human rights and jurist groups were allowed Wednesday into the
trial of Malaysia's leading dissident.
	   The move came after harsh criticism at home and abroad over High
Court Judge Augustine Paul's ruling Monday against observer
privileges at the trial of the ousted deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   An opposition leader welcomed the move, but said it should have
come earlier. Dozens of foreign observers have been clamoring to
get into the courthouse since the trial began Monday.
	   ``We shouldn't open the doors after we have been criticized by
the whole world,'' said Syed Husin Ali, leader of the Malaysian
People's Party.
	   Several opposition leaders was still denied entry. Court
bailiffs told Fadzil Noor, president of the main Muslim party,
Parti Islam SeMalaysia, and other members of a new anti-government
coalition that there was no room.
	   PAS is part of a pro-Anwar coalition outlawed last week after it
organized a series of meetings to campaign for an end to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   The leader of a group of Filipino legislators in town for the
trial said a global network of human rights activists was being
organized to monitor Anwar's case.
	   There were already 40 jurists and rights campaigners from around
the world in Kuala Lumpur, said Heherson Alvarez.
	   Only a few observers had managed to gain entry into the
courtroom Monday and Tuesday. Even when most got in Wednesday, they
sat in the public gallery and were not afforded official observer
status, which would allow them to report on the trial and give
advice to the judge.
	   On Monday, Paul called it an ``insult'' on their part to assume
the court needed their assistance.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir accused the observers Tuesday of
believing they were superior.
	   ``These observers appear to be here not to watch the trial. They
want to put the court and the judge on trial ... as if they are so
superior that they know better on how justice is administered,'' he
told reporters.
	   Meanwhile, Justice International, a lawyers group that promotes
human rights, complained that Anwar was still being treated harshly
in prison.
	   ``Anwar's human rights continue to be denied in prison, where he
is kept in solitary confinement and deprived of any facilities,
including a watch,'' the group said in a statement. ``He complains
of (a) hearing impediment as a result of beatings in detention and
is rapidly losing weight.''
	   The group also said Anwar was not being allowed enough time with
his lawyers so that he could discuss his defense after reading
prosecution documents.
	   Anwar's case sparked worldwide concern after the 51-year-old
former No. 2 leader showed up for his arraignment with a black eye
and bruises on his neck and body. He alleged he was beaten on the
first night of custody on Sept. 20.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eliminate his challenge to Mahathir.

Attackers storm city in northern Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Several hundred armed militants
raided a city in northern Tajikistan early Wednesday, battling
government troops and seizing several administrative buildings,
officials said.
	   Authorities believe the attackers are led by Makhmud
Khudoberdyev, a former army colonel who turned against President
Emomali Rakhmonov last year and then fled to neighboring
Uzbekistan.
	   The assailants seized police and security service headquarters
in the city of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
the capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport,
said Tajik government officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The authorities wouldn't give any immediate information on
casualties, but the ITAR-Tass news agency said at least 10 people
were killed during the fighting that raged for several hours.
	   The president chaired an emergency government session to discuss
the crisis and ordered all troops be put on alert. Russia's 201st
motorized infantry division, deployed in Tajikistan to support the
government, has also been put in combat readiness.
	   The attackers didn't pose any immediate demands.
	   Khudoberdyev broke away from the government after it signed a
peace deal with the mostly Islamic opposition in the summer of
1997.
	   The agreement formally ended a five-year civil war, but the
impoverished former Soviet republic continues to suffer from
frequent outbursts of violence. Many opposition warlords and
government commanders have refused to acknowledge the peace deal.

	   CEBU, Philippines (AP) _ Police arrested four suspects in the
kidnapping of a wealthy businessman just hours after he was
released, the chief of a Philippine anti-crime task force said
Wednesday.
	   The four include a 15-year-old boy, who allegedly picked up the
5 million peso (dlrs 125,000) ransom Monday from the family of
kidnap victim Regan King near a mall in central Cebu City.
	   Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson, head of the Presidential
Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, told reporters in Cebu that the
alleged leader of the gang, Ronald Peleno, was arrested about one
hour after the ransom payment was made.
	   The boy and two other members of the gang were arrested Tuesday.
	   The boy and the two men denied any role in the kidnapping when
interviewed by reporters. The boy said the bag that he had carried
contained marijuana, which police officers later recovered.
	   Lacson said a woman and three other men who are also members of
Peleno's gang are still at large.
	   Lacson said the King family, one of the wealthiest in Cebu, had
refused to cooperate with police in helping solve the kidnapping,
although police monitored the family's negotiations with the
kidnappers.
	   The family, however, decided to help police prosecute the
suspects and will file kidnapping and serious illegal detention
charges against them.
	   King, manager of his father's heavy equipment company, was
seized Oct. 21 from his office.
	   The kidnappers initially demanded a 50 million peso (dlrs 1.25
million) ransom and then settled for 5 million pesos (dlrs
125,000). Police had reported Tuesday that only 2 million pesos
(dlrs 50,000) was paid.
	   Lacson said the police recovered guns and 3.5 million pesos
(dlrs 87,500) from the suspects' hideout in the town of Compostella
north of Cebu City.
	   King was released unharmed Monday near a drug store in Mandaue
City near Cebu and took a taxi home without informing police,
Lacson said.
	   Many people believe that police are involved in kidnap gangs.
	   President Joseph Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign
against kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the
rescue of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors
in Manila.
	   Estrada promised upon taking office in June to end the
kidnappings within six months.
	   About dlrs 3 billion in capital has been taken out of the
Philippines by investors threatened by ransom kidnappings, which
peaked last year, administration officials say.
	   An anti-crime citizens' group reported that 249 people were
kidnapped last year and 306.4 million pesos (dlrs 7.6 million) in
ransom was paid.
	   The group reported kidnappers had seized 146 people as of
September this year and collected 96.2 million pesos (dlrs 2.4
million) in ransom.
	   Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz-Araneta said Tuesday the
kidnappings have scared away tourists from Taiwan.
	   Taiwanese tourist arrivals in August declined 39 percent to
14,954 from 24,509 in July. The number was down 45 percent from
27,267 in August 1997, according to official tourism department
records.

Cup challengers semis may be expanded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The America's Cup challenger series
semifinals may be contested between six boats instead of four next
year in a bid to have the best boat tackle New Zealand's defender.
	   Marcus Hutchinson, a spokesman for the challenger Louis Vitton
Cup series, said the option was being considered because Auckland
has dramatic climate changes between October and February.
	   ``A boat that's very fast in the early round-robins in strong
winds could walk through to the final, but that may not be the
fastest boat to sail Team New Zealand in February's lighter
conditions,'' Hutchinson said Wednesday. ``The challengers want to
keep a bigger spread of boats in the game for as long as possible.
A light-airs boat, which didn't do well early on, may come
through.''
	   The eventual tack taken by the challengers will be decided when
the number of challengers is known.
	   In the 1995 cup series off San Diego, the defender final was
extended to a three-boat race, allowing Team Dennis Conner to
escape certain elimination and eventually win through to sail
against Team New Zealand.
	   Part of the design challenge for the 1999-2000 series will be
deciding which end of the windscale to build the boat. Off Auckland
the wind can fluctuate from five knots to 30 in a matter of
minutes.
	   At a challengers meeting in Bermuda last week, a wind limit was
settled for the round-robins. Racing will be called off if the wind
blows consistently over 18 knots for five minutes.
	   A wind limit has not been set for the America's Cup match. But
the call is likely to be on the water by the officer of the day,
determined by the wind direction and the state of the sea.

southern suburb of Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of
Harare, and burned an army truck.
	   Witnesses said police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in
the suburb on Wednesday.
	   Witnesses in eastern Harare said rioters carrying sticks and
metal bars ran through an industrial park and hurled stones through
factory windows.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   Reinforcements of riot police were seen headed through western
Harare, where shop owners barricaded their stores and panicked
crowds ran from stone-throwing bands of youths.
	   State radio said several people were arrested overnight but gave
no further details.
	   Unrest erupted after private taxi vans and buses blocked
entrance routes to Harare and refused to carry commuters into the
city center.
	   Commuters were angered by taxi vans that were still operating
doubling their fares to about 10 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 0.27) for a
single trip.
	   Police appeared determined to stop demonstrators reaching the
main shopping center of downtown Harare. Mobs surrounded one
suburban shopping center and a wholesale warehouse.
	   One factory owner, whose building and cars were stoned, said
only about 30 of his 120 workers arrived for work Wednesday.
	   The disturbances follow similar unrest in the second city of
Bulawayo on Monday. Police said 27 people were arrested and 20
injured in those disturbances.
	   On Saturday the government announced a 67 percent increase in
the price of gasoline.
	   The increase was expected to have a ripple effect through an
economy already facing soaring inflation and unemployment as health
and education services deteriorate.
	   The government said the gasoline increases were forced by a 80
percent slide in the value of the Zimbabwe dollar against the U.S.
currency in the past year.
	   The depreciation of the currency has been blamed on poor
economic management, foreign and domestic speculation and the
impact of the decline of Asian economies on developing countries.
	   Earlier this year, six people died in the nation's first food
riots, triggered by a 25 percent increase in the price of corn
meal, the staple food.
	   Since then, food prices have increased further. Last week, bread
and meat prices went up by 30 percent.

Japan considers removing secrecy surrounding executions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with confirmation from Justice Ministry and
background; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan may partially lift a veil of secrecy
surrounding its capital punishment practices by confirming when
executions have been carried out, the Justice Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura has ordered a review of the
government's longstanding policy of refusing to disclose
information about the execution of death row inmates, said a
ministry spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   Civic and human rights groups have criticized the existing
secrecy, in which the ministry routinely rebuffs all inquiries
about executions. It says it does so out of respect for to the
survivors of crimes and the families of those put to death.
	   The ministry's Criminal Affairs Bureau will now consider
announcing the date and number of executions, but only after they
have taken place, the spokesman said. The names of those executed
and the places where executions are administered will continue to
be withheld, he said.
	   Currently, the only information released by the Justice Ministry
about executions comes in an annual report that gives the total
number of death sentences carried out during the previous year.
	   The ministry said four people were executed in 1997.
	   In June this year, Japanese media cited unnamed sources as
saying three convicted murderers were hanged. The ministry declined
comment on the reports.
	   Prisoners on Japan's death row are believed to be held in
solitary confinement for years, then told of their impending
execution just hours beforehand. The lawyers and families of those
executed are usually informed shortly afterward.
	   Some legal experts view Japan's death penalty as excessively
cruel and secretive. For years, the Japan Bar Association has
appealed for a suspension of executions.
	   Last month, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Committee
expressed frustration with Japan's refusal to reduce the number of
crimes for which capital punishment can be prescribed in line with
committee recommendations.
	   Yet most Japanese appear to support capital punishment. A 1994
government survey found 73.8 percent of respondents favored
retaining the death penalty, the highest percentage since such
polling began in 1956.
	   The executions were stopped for a brief period from November
1989 until March 1993. Since then, Japan has carried out death
sentences on 28 criminals.
	   Fifty-four people currently await execution in Japan, according
to Amnesty International.

Bombed Planet Hollywood quietly reopens in Cape Town

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ In marked contrast to the usual
fanfare and glitz, a Planet Hollywood branch reopened here in
low-key style on Wednesday after a bomb in August killed two
people.
	   Sitting in front of cardboard cut-outs of movie stars, Cape Town
Mayor the Rev. William Bantom said a short prayer and welcomed the
Hollywood-themed diner back to the city.
	   ``None of us can forget the terrible tragedy that occurred here
a couple of months ago, but we have to put this behind us,'' he
said ``We hope nothing like that will ever happen again.''
	   No one has been caught for the Aug. 26 blast that ripped through
the crowded bar area of one of Cape Town's most popular eating
spots for tourists. A caller to a local radio station initially
claimed it was the work of an extremist Islamic group, but the
organization later denied responsibility.
	   The restaurant, which has been refurbished at a cost of 4
million rand (dlrs 700,000), has beefed up security.
	   Visitors will pass through metal detectors at the doors,
security cameras will record 24 hours day and there will be regular
sweeps by sniffer dogs.
	   ``We are confident that the restaurant will pick up to what it
was,'' said the chain's South African manager Bradley Michael. ``We
have done our best on the security side.''

Healy aiming past 400
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ World record holder Ian Healy wants
to stay on as Australia's wicketkeeper for ``another four or five
years.''
	   Healy passed fellow Australian Rod Marsh's record of 355
dismissals in the recent first test against Pakistan and moved his
tally to 362 ahead of the coming five-test Ashes series against
England.
	   Although 34, Healy said he had no plans of handing over the
gloves to likely heir Adam Gilchrist.
	   ``I'm keeping really consistently,'' said Healy, who is looking
to push his tally towards 400 against England and then the West
Indies. ``It's a great feeling to know you are going into a game at
top of your form and I'm able to do that game in and game out now.
I've never kept better. I don't think age is a factor unless you
lose enthusiasm or form.''
	   Healy is averaging close to 10 tests a season and 3.4 dismissals
a test.
	   If he keeps playing as long as he wants he could conceivably
reach the 500-mark for test dismissals and even overtake Allan
Border's world record of 156 tests in 16 seasons. Healy has played
106 tests, 50 less than Border.
	   ``If I'm going to play as long as I want, 400 will be nothing,''
Healy said. ``I've got five tests this summer and four in the West
Indies; that's nine more tests. I'll be very close to 400 by the
end of this summer and I'd like to go a lot further than that.''

Malaysia's treatment of Anwar could hurt region: Thai minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's foreign minister fears that
Malaysia's treatment of sacked Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
could damage the bargaining power of Southeast Asia with the rest
of the world, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Malaysia put Anwar on trial this week on charges of abuse of
power and illicit sex. Critics say he is being victimized after
losing a power struggle with his one-time mentor, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan was quoted by the newspaper
The Nation as saying the trial had far-reaching implications for
the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to which
both Malaysia and Thailand belong.
	   ``Several nations have expressed their concerns over the issue,
which could possibly affect ASEAN's unity and image,'' Surin was
quoted as saying.
	   The paper said he added: ``Malaysia's action is hindering ASEAN
unity, which could decrease the group's bargaining power in
international negotiations.
	   ``ASEAN is working hard to prevent the impact of the ongoing
economic crisis from affecting ASEAN unity in an attempt to
preserve our capacity to negotiate.
	   ``I want to insist that my opinion is based on good faith, and
it must be clear that we are expressing ourselves in good faith for
the sake of ASEAN.''
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul told The Associated
Press that Surin felt he was misquoted and that the trial by itself
could not affect ASEAN unity.
	   ASEAN has a long tradition of refusing to criticize the internal
affairs of member states, but the old rules have been cracking
recently as the region grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   Surin has pushed for a review of the non-interference policy,
noting that the problems of member states often have effects on
their neighbors.
	   The proposal has been supported only by the Philippines. The two
countries are considered ASEAN's most democratic and open. Other
ASEAN states include Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore
and Vietnam.
	   Anwar faces five charges of corruption and five of illegal sex
acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Among other things, the men had been divided over the best
course to minimize the impact of the economic crisis.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest. Tens of thousands of
Malaysians have joined street protests to support him.

Netanyahu says he won't carry out agreement if promises are broken
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Wednesday that he will walk away from the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians if he believes they are not keeping
all their promises.
	   The warning came as Netanyahu traded accusations with
Palestinian negotiators over the fate of 30 Palestinian fugitives
whom Israel wants arrested by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The latest dispute is holding up implementation of the 12-week
plan under which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for a series of Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu said he would only convene his Cabinet to ratify the
peace agreement _ a necessary step ahead of implementation _ if he
gets written assurances from the United States on a key Palestinian
security pledge.
	   Netanyahu did not mention the Palestinian fugitives
specifically, but his defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, has said
Israel was holding out for a time table for the arrest of the 30.
	   Asked by Israel radio if he was creating a crisis over a minor
issue, Netanyahu said: ``I just want to establish the principle ...
We are not reopening the agreement. We are insisting that the
agreement be honored to the letter.''
	   Netanyahu also said he would not put up with Palestinian
violations of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he said.
``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''
	   The Palestinians have said they have done what they promised,
including handing a detailed security work plan to the United
States. U.S. officials also said the Palestinians met their
obligations. It was unclear how the crisis would be resolved.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive Thursday in the
region to oversee implementation.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said U.S. officials were ``astounded''
by what they considered an Israeli attempt to change the agreement.
	   The daily said Israel and the Palestinians agreed verbally that
the fugitives would be arrested by the Palestinian Authority and
that Israel was making a new demand by seeking a written guarantee.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Netanyahu of seizing
a pretext in order to dismantle the accord.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) is inventing new agreements. He does not want
to honor anything,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   An Israeli Cabinet meeting was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. (1130
gmt) Wednesday. However, Netanyahu said he would only convene the
ministers if he received the written U.S. guarantees by then.
	   The clock on the 12-week agreement was to have started ticking
Monday, with the first Israeli troop pullback to take place Nov.
16. It was unclear whether the current delays would disrupt the
time table or whether the two sides would be able to catch up.
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will created
during last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in
Maryland has dissipated and that the United States will be called
in as referee throughout the implementation process.
	   Commenting on the confusion that has accompanied the first days
of the agreement, Israeli journalist Hemi Shalev wrote in the
Maariv daily: ``There were many in Israel who expected a moving
drama and others who expected a horrible tragedy, but no one
thought that this `historic' week would of all things be a comedy
of errors.''

Larkham and Wilson share award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Stephen Larkham's transition from
fullback to fly-half won recognition from his Australian teammates
Wednesday when he won a share of the player of the year award.
	   Larkham shared the players' poll award with flanker David
Wilson. Larkham and Wilson had 251 votes, 53 clear of fullback
Matthew Burke.
	   Larkham was put in the crucial fly-half role by coach Rod
Macqueen this season and performed well after it had proved a
trouble spot for Australia.
	   ``I started a little bit shakily I guess,'' Larkham said. ``I
had a few doubts in my mind whether I could actually play the
position.''
	   He thanked his teammates and said he was not yet the finished
article.
	   ``A lot of the players around me really helped out, especially
Tim Horan and George Gregan, they deserve a lot of the credit, they
took me under their wings and told me where to stand and what to do
and what calls to make,'' Larkham said. ``I guess I've progressed a
little bit throughout this season, but there's still a little bit
of a way to go before I'm really totally comfortable.''

Taiwan weighing repatriation of Chinese hijacker pilot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Still puzzled over the case of a Chinese
pilot who hijacked his own flight and landed in Taiwan, officials
met Wednesday to discuss whether to break with previous practice
and send him to the mainland to face Chinese justice.
	   Published reports suggested a quick repatriation of Air China
captain Yuan Bin was being considered _ a possibility that prompted
Yuan to stage a brief hunger strike after his arrest Oct. 28.
	   Yuan, 30, said he diverted the Boeing 737-300 from its scheduled
route from Beijing to the southwest Chinese city of Kunming because
he was frustrated over pay and working conditions at the state-run
Chinese carrier. None of the 104 people aboard was injured in the
hijacking, which ended when Yuan surrendered peacefully.
	   Taiwanese authorities are still investigating the case. They
also detained Yuan's wife, 27-year-old Xu Mei, who was aboard the
flight. Authorities have not said whether she would be charged with
anything.
	   Officials of the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top body on
China policy, were leading a high-level meeting on the case
Wednesday and said they would issue a statement later in the day.
	   The Taiwanese were giving serious thought to sending Yuan back
to China to be prosecuted, the United Daily News reported.
	   Taiwanese media have reported that Yuan hijacked the jet in the
belief that he could remain in Taiwan after spending a few years in
prison.
	   The issue of repatriating hijackers has been a sticking point
between Taiwan and China as they seek to improve relations.
	   Taiwan used to greet hijackers from China as heroes, but began
in the 1980s to prosecute them as tensions eased between the rival
governments. Still, Taiwan has not yet sent any hijackers back to
China for prosecution.
	   Last year, China returned a man who committed the rare act of
hijacking a jet from Taiwan to the mainland.
	   Liu Shan-chung was a Taiwanese journalist who diverted a
jetliner to China by threatening to set himself on fire. Liu was
returned by Chinese authorities to Taiwan for prosecution a month
after the incident in what was seen as a gesture of good faith.
	   Liu claimed his colleagues had harassed him because he was born
in China and wasn't able to speak the Taiwanese dialect.
	   Taiwan sentenced Liu to life in prison _ a tougher penalty than
it has given to people convicted of hijacking jets from China to
Taiwan.
	   During a string of air piracies in 1993 and 1994, Taiwan
arrested 16 Chinese hijackers and gave them sentences of up to 12
years.
	   Two were paroled and sent back to China last year. But China
refused to reveal their fates in the mainland, and Taiwan has since
declined to repatriate six others who have been paroled.

</HEADLINE>

Beijing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Authorities in China's political and
financial capitals have executed 14 people for heroin trafficking
and robbery, official media reported Wednesday.
	   Police in Shanghai arrested 17 traffickers and seized 81.85
kilograms (180 pounds) of heroin in nine related drug cases, the
Liberation Daily and the Xinhua News Agency reported. They did not
say when the arrests and confiscations occurred.
	   Seven of the defendants were executed after sentencing Tuesday
by the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court, the newspaper said. It
identified two of those executed as Ma Yuchuan and Chen Lutai but
did not give names of the five others.
	   Another three were sentenced to death but with two-year
suspensions, the newspaper said. That period is intended to let
prisoners show contrition, and the death sentence may be converted
to a prison term.
	   Three others received life prison terms and four were sentenced
to 9 to 12 years, the newspaper said.
	   Meanwhile, seven people were executed Tuesday in Beijing for
robbery, including three people who stole a car and two vans and
killed their drivers, the Beijing Morning Post said.
	   The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court ordered the
executions to deter auto thefts, the newspaper said. It said the
other four people also were executed for robbery but it gave no
details.

Fraser defends English tactics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ England veteran Angus Fraser defended
the tourists Wednesday after they copped a blast for an uninspiring
start to the Ashes cricket tour of Australia.
	   England's batsmen failed to chase a target of 282 off 63 overs
in the first class match against Western Australia on Tuesday,
drawing criticism from home captain Justin Langer.
	   ``What's the point of playing a game if you don't play a game to
win,'' Langer said after England made 192 for four. ``I hope
England play with the same attitude throughout the summer because
if they do it will be long summer for them.''
	   Fraser said he understood Langer's frustrations but that it more
important for England to prepare itself for the five tests ahead
rather than try to beat Western Australia.
	   ``We have got to get out the game what we can and we did, all
our top batsmen spent some time at the crease and all the bowlers
had a good bowl,'' Fraser said Wednesday. ``We could have
recklessly chased the target and lose some 30 runs short and
everyone would be saying `here we go again.'''
	   Fraser said England wanted to win the leadup games but was
entirely setting itself for the first test in Brisbane from Nov.
20.
	   ``We want to win the games we play before the test match but we
have to use them to our advantage,'' Fraser said. ``It's not just
up to us to have a game of cricket.''
	   England plays two more four day games before the first Test,
against South Australia in Adelaide from Saturday and against
Queensland in Cairns from Nov. 13.

Russia launches U.S. communications satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia successfully launched a U.S. communications
satellite on Wednesday from its space center in the Central Asian
nation of Kazakstan, a news report said.
	   The PanAmSat 8 satellite blasted off from the Baikonur launch
center atop a Russian Proton rocket, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The launch marked the second time that PanAmSat has used the
Russian center to send up a communications satellite. The company's
PanAmSat 5 satellite was sent into orbit in August of last year
from Baikonur.
	   It was Russia's fourth commercial launch of a foreign satellite
aboard a Proton rocket this year. Russia does not disclose how much
it charges for the launches, but media reports have put the figure
at about dlrs 70 million.

Australians have room for improvement says new psychologist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Australia's test cricket team is ranked
No.1 in the world but Sandy Gordon believes there is plenty of room
for improvement.
	   Gordon has a vested interest in the gap between Australia's
present form and their potential, having just signed on as the
team's sports psychologist. He will work with the Aussies on a
part-time basis over the next two years.
	   Gordon said he interviewed a number of Australian players at
length recently, including getting them to rate themselves on a
scale of one to 10 in several areas.
	   The results showed a number of areas in which players can be
mentally strengthened, Gordon said.
	   ``I conducted a profiling, assessment and discussion session
with 21 players in Brisbane before they went to Kuala Lumpur for
the Commonwealth Games,'' said Gordon. ``There are areas every
individual reported himself to be down on and not one player rated
himself 10 out of 10 on every one. There is room for improvement on
a number of things.''
	   Gordon said he would concentrate on keeping the players in a
positive frame of mind on a number of issues, which should in turn
produce better on-field results.
	   ``Within the team, there are issues of discipline, consistency
and areas related to keeping a perspective on life,'' he said.
``It's a hard slog and keeping a balanced perspective of what they
are doing inside and outside of cricket is important. I'll also be
talking to the wives and families. It's a fairly broad spectrum
approach.''

Ethnic Albanian leader sees destruction firsthand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported clash.
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Venturing into the countryside for
the first time in nine years, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader
found evidence of refugee returns but said more needs to be done to
ensure the safety of villagers going back home.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' Ibrahim Rugova said afterward. ``It's a beginning of
the process to return. But for a more massive return, more safety
is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central
Kosovo on Tuesday. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who
is trying to persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream
of Kosovo's independence from Serbia and settle for some form of
self-rule.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital
Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
set up a huge police presence.
	   But with no major fighting in Kosovo for weeks and many Serb
forces withdrawn under an Oct. 12 peace agreement, he visited
villages that were on the front line of fighting between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas last month.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians
from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   Reporting Wednesday on a clash the previous day, the Serbian
Media Center _ which spreads the official view _ said ``Albanian
terrorists'' machine-gunned two vehicles carrying coal miners to
Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Pristina, wounding
three of them. Belgrade's private B-92 radio said ensuing fighting
between Serbian police and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army trapped nine workers inside the mine compound for two hours.
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more
confidence and stability.
	   ``It's frankly shocking to see the amount of damage that has
been done _ house after house without roofs, many burned-out homes
and many crops that weren't harvested this year,'' he said.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that they are not prepared to
compromise their goal of outright independence.

French Foreign Minister glad Lewinsky saga did not hit Democrats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Foreign Minister on Wednesday welcomed the
outcome of the U.S. elections, saying it was ``a good thing for
democracy'' that the Democrats did not suffer a backlash from the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
	   Hubert Vedrine, in an interview with radio station RTL, said
President Bill Clinton's party had performed well ``despite the
pressures on him, despite the attacks which really resembled
McCarthyism.''
	   ``Generally, it's a good thing for democracy that this type of
attack doesn't weigh on the voters' choices.''
	   Republicans retained control of the U.S. House for another two
years but failed to obtain the sizable increases the party's
leaders had sought to reinforce their agenda to impeach Clinton.
	   Vedrine said stability was positive in terms of foreign policy.
	   ``We know well the foreign policy of Clinton and (U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine) Albright,'' Vedrine said. ``So we know where we
stand.''

Hurt by Northwest strike, Dutch carrier takes earnings hit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by the turbulent global
economy and a pilot strike at U.S. partner Northwest, KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines on Wednesday posted a 25 percent drop in earnings.
	   KLM said operating profit for the second quarter ending Sept. 30
declined to 377 million guilders (dlrs 201 million). It said the
decline would have been only 11 percent if the figures included
results from its subsidiary, Martinair.
	   KLM had issued a profit-warning in which it said second-quarter
results would be hurt by the global financial turmoil and by extra
costs related to the strike at Northwest Airlines.
	   The Dutch carrier said it took a one-time hit of more than 50
million guilders (dlrs 26.7 million) from the 15-day September
strike.
	   Citing the deterioration of the global economic outlook in
recent months, KLM said it doesn't expect any improvements during
the remainder of its fiscal year. KLM said it also was hurt by the
dollar's drop.
	   Looking ahead, the airline said it was working to improve
performance and would take steps to make sure flights leave and
arrive on time.

Parliament asks Yeltsin's doctors to report on his health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and other hardliners in the Russian
parliament sought an official report on Boris Yeltsin's health
while the president continued to recuperate at a Black Sea resort
Wednesday.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, asked the presidential
doctors to give a detailed account of Yeltsin's condition. The
lawmakers are expected to follow up Thursday, when they consider a
bill that would require the president to undergo a medical exam,
with the results passed on to parliament.
	   However, the bill faces an uphill battle because Yeltsin would
have to approve it before it becomes law, and he's almost certain
to veto the measure.
	   Yeltsin has ignored opposition attacks and insisted he will
serve out his term that lasts until the middle of the year 2000.
The president and his doctors say he has no serious health
problems, and his current ailment is described as fatigue and
high-blood pressure.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted that a medical
inspection would reveal that the president was incapable of
performing his duties.
	   Meanwhile, presidential aide Oleg Sysuyev said on Wednesday that
Yeltsin would outline his ``new political role'' in an address to
the parliament early next year.
	   Sysuyev, who is currently in France, reiterated that the
president would concentrate on political issues and allow his
Cabinet to deal with economy matters, the Interfax news agency
reported.

Officials fear growing hunger in devastated Central America

	   TRUJILLO, Honduras (AP) _ With 7,000 people feared dead in
Honduras alone, rescue workers warned that many more will die of
starvation or illness if the country's shattered bridges and
washed-out roads are not quickly rebuilt.
	   Hurricane Mitch, which killed an estimated 9,000 people
throughout Central America, has turned Honduras' largest cities
into virtual islands accessible only by air.
	   Transportation also remains difficult across neighboring
Nicaragua, where despair over the lack of food and water prompted a
crowd to hurl insults at their president Tuesday.
	   Rural communities are even more isolated; many have had no
communication with the outside world since the storm began nearly a
week ago. With fuel in short supply, few areas can keep power
plants running _ and that means no electricity for water pumps.
	   ``We have food,'' Lt. Col. Jose J. Barahona said as 8,800 pounds
(3,99 kilos) of supplies were being unloaded from a U.S. Air Force
cargo plane Tuesday in the northern city of Trujillo. ``The problem
is the areas that are only reachable by helicopter _ and we don't
have enough.''
	   Floods and mudslides caused by Mitch were blamed for deaths
across a broad, 500-mile (805 kilometers) corridor from Nicaragua
into southern Mexico, from Honduras' Atlantic Coast to the Pacific.
	   The scope of the disaster across Central America overwhelmed
relief efforts. Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman was jeered
Tuesday by flood victims during a visit to Leon, 55 miles (88
kilometers) north of Managua. Up to 1,950 people were believed to
have been killed nearby when a mudslide crashed down the flanks of
a volcano after days of torrential rains.
	   ``Murderer! We're dying of hunger!'' the refugees shouted.
Administration officials claimed political opponents orchestrated
the incident to embarrass Aleman.
	   Preliminary estimates indicate that 7,000 people died in
Honduras _ a number that could rise as more reports from isolated
areas come in, Col. Rene Osorio of the national emergency
commission said.
	   In addition, Osorio said 11,100 people were missing and 2
million had lost their homes or possessions.
	   The Honduran and Nicaraguan ambassadors to the United States
said Tuesday that at least 70 percent of the infrastructure in
their countries was destroyed. Roads, bridges, telephone lines and
almost every other means of communication have been wiped out by
flooding and mudslides.
	   Barahona, an emergency official in the Honduran province of
Colon, said workers so far have been unable to reach up to 12,000
of the area's 100,000 residents because of damaged roads.
	   Some Trujillo residents said the food isn't getting to those who
need it most.
	   ``There's nothing here,'' said Luisa Argentina Aguilar, who was
left homeless with her two children, mother and sister when the
storm blew the roof off her house.
	   She suspected that food packages were going first to influential
families. ``They're not giving them to the poor people,'' she said.
	   The devastated infrastructure also is impeding fuel distribution
_ important to keeping aid trucks, planes and helicopters moving.
	   ``We have enough fuel to last about five or six days,'' Col.
Alfredo San Martin, the Honduran Air Force chief of staff, said in
Tegucigalpa.
	   U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Ricardo Aguilar said a Blackhawk
helicopter had planned to fly to the Pacific port of Amapla, to
examine road conditions near an oil refinery. Poor weather forced
it to turn back.
	   ``The key is getting the fuel into the cities,'' he said. ``If
we don't get fuel in the cities, it will be utter chaos.''
	   Along with emergency supplies, the United States sent more than
two dozen military aircraft and 500 military personnel to assist
with air surveillance and rescue missions.
	   Chaos reigned in northern Nicaragua, where a mudslide Friday
from the Casitas volcano buried hundreds of people under tons of
mud and rocks.
	   Rescuers saw four men buried up to their chests screaming for
help late Monday on the slopes of Casitas, where bodies littered
wide fields of mud. The rescuers could not reach the men _ blocked
by 200 yards of quaking, unstable mud.
	   As if all this wasn't enough, new natural disasters struck
Tuesday. Just 22 miles away from Casitas, the Cerro Negro volcano
began erupting, and Mitch re-formed as a weak tropical storm in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   Mitch moved over the Yucatan peninsula late Tuesday and was
forecast to head toward Florida later this week, although its 40
mph winds were but a shadow of the 180 mph gusts last week.
	   In the volcanic eruption, lava flowed down Cerro Negro's nearly
3,300-foot (1,005-meter) northern face into an apparently
unpopulated area.
	   Elsewhere, Guatemala had 157 dead, 100,000 homes damaged and at
least 30 highways blocked after Hurricane Mitch swept through. El
Salvador reported 225 dead, 135 missing and 50,000 homeless. Six
people died in Mexico and 31 were missing from a schooner in the
Caribbean.

Finance minister urges banks to cut lending rates further
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda
urged local commercial banks Wednesday to cut lending rates further
to help ease debt burdens and stimulate the recession-hit economy.
	   Thai commercial banks have slashed interest rates offered on
fixed-term deposit accounts by more than 5 percentage points since
August, while prime rates have fallen by only 1 to 1.5 percentage
points.
	   ``Deposit rates have been dropping for quite a long while,''
Tarrin said. ``It's time banks cut lending rates so as to be in
line with lower deposit rates.''
	   At present, minimum lending rates at local banks stand at 13.75
to 15.25 percent, while fixed deposit rates stand at 6.75 to 8
percent.
	   Tarrin said the central bank will hold a meeting with local
banks next week to discuss prospects for more cuts in lending
rates.
	   Given the baht stabilizing and lower-than-expected inflation, he
said: ``I believe interest rates can drop further.''
	   Tarrin said previously that prime rates could drop to less than
13 percent by December.
	   Thailand's year-on-year consumer price index inflation rate fell
from a high of 10.7 percent in June to 5.9 percent in October.
	   The baht has been hovering at around 36 to the U.S. dollar since
last Thursday, its highest level in 12 months. The currency
plummeted from about 25 to the dollar when floated in July 1997 and
hit a low of 58 to the dollar in January.
	   Separately, the Finance Ministry is considering issuing
baht-denominated bonds for sale to the public ``as an alternative
for the public seeking higher returns on their savings,'' Tarrin
said.
	   Some Thais have complained that deposit rates have fallen too
fast and returns on their savings are minimal when considering the
prevalent inflation rate. Three months ago, fixed deposit rates at
local banks stood at 10 percent to 16.5 percent.

US Defense Secretary Cohen leaves Kuwait for Bahrain

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen left here
Wednesday after brief talks with the Kuwaiti government on the
standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons
inspectors.
	   Cohen was expected to land in Bahrain later Wednesday for talks
with its government, the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait said.
	   Cohen met the Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the
crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah,
for discussions on Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation
with disarmament monitors, an embassy spokesman said.
	   Cohen did not speak to reporters during his Kuwait visit.
	   The defense secretary began a Middle Eastern tour on Tuesday in
Saudi Arabia where he held talks with the government on drumming up
support for possible U.S. military action against Iraq.
	   There have been different accounts of the talks in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh. The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi
backing in the event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi
official _ speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told
the defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard
for attacks on Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the world body over
weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states
in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   But on Tuesday night, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry
said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between the
United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack on Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they
were privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that
Cohen was actually told that Arab leaders would support an attack
on Iraq only if it was guaranteed to remove President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Several thousand U.S. troops and their weapons are positioned
here under a 10-year defense pact that Kuwait signed with
Washington after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation.

Hong Kong shares finish higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices closed higher Wednesday
for the fourth consecutive session, driven by buying in British
banking giant HSBC Holdings and property companies.
	   But many companies with strong ties to China fell on what
traders called a technical correction after days of strong gains.
	   The blue chip Hang Seng Index gained 149.73 points, or 1.4
percent, to 10,508.25, adding to Tuesday's gain of 1.9 percent. It
was the index's highest finish since May 6.
	   Turnover was strong, hitting 13.58 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.74 billion), up from 12.12 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.55 billion) Tuesday.
	   HSBC Holdings, the largest capitalized stock on the market, rose
2.7 percent, ending at 189.00 Hong Kong dollars, a gain of 5.00.
	   ``I think this share was behind the market'' and investors
started piling in, said Francis Wu, a trader at South China
Brokerage Ltd.
	   Hang Seng Bank, an HSBC affiliate, rose 75 cents to 68.26.
	   Some investors also snapped up property shares, betting that a
recent rise in residential housing prices can be sustained, said
Frederick Tsang, head of research at DBS Securities Ltd.
	   Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. soared 4.2 percent, or 2.25 Hong
Kong dollars, closing at 55.25. Rival developer Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Ltd. rose 1.8 percent, or 1.00, to 55.00.
	   Among companies with strong ties to the mainland, China
Resources Enterprise Ltd. lost 4.5 percent, or 60 cents, closing at
12.70, and Shanghai Industrial Holdings fell 4 percent, or 85
cents, to 20.40.

Companies to build heating plant at Chernobyl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Several companies have signed a deal to
build a dlrs 10.5 million, U.S.-funded steam plant to provide heat
at the Chernobyl nuclear power station while it is being closed
down, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The tender for building the plant was won by four companies
based in the town of Slavutych near Chernobyl, and a Kiev
construction company would carry out the works, the independent
UNIAN news agency reported.
	   The deal was signed Tuesday in Slavutych, it said.
	   The power station currently uses its own power for heating. But
Ukraine has promised to fully close Chernobyl _ the site of the
world's worst nuclear accident _ by 2000. As the plant shuts down,
it will need an alternative heating source.
	   Construction of the plant will be funded by the United States as
part of an effort to help Ukraine increase safety at its nuclear
power plants.
	   Government officials have said recently that Chernobyl's closure
may take longer unless Ukraine receives the funds needed to
complete two new reactors to compensate for Chernobyl's lost energy
production.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers tortured and beat a man to
death out of suspicion that he was involved in a wave of mysterious
murders, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Tuesday's reported killing was the latest by vigilantes who have
taken to the streets on the main island of Java after the murders
of dozens of Muslim clerics and others accused of practicing black
magic.
	   The newspaper Kompas said a crowd attacked Achmad Sobari, 36, in
Bojonggede, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Jakarta, after
he asked for directions to a local Muslim preacher's house.
	   The paper said he became nervous when a crowd gathered and asked
him why he wanted to go there.
	   They killed him after accusing him of planning to murder the
clergyman.
	   In another report, Kompas said police shot and injured four
suspects in the killing last week of three police officers on
Madura Island, off Java's northeastern coast.
	   It said 42 other suspects including two women were also
arrested.
	   Fear prevails in many small towns, where mobs have lynched
people suspected of carrying out the murders. In many areas,
mentally ill people have become scapegoats.
	   Muslim leaders have warned that they will deploy their own
civilian security forces if the military is unable to restore
order.

Villagers plan answer to ``Bandit Queen'' movie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Villagers portrayed as the upper-caste
enemy in the celebrated 1994 film ``Bandit Queen'' want to tell
their side of the story in their own movie.
	   In the 1994 movie, low-caste bandit leader Phoolan Devi was
shown killing 21 men, 18 from the high warrior caste of Thakurs, in
Behmai, the nondescript village 360 kilometers (223 miles)
southeast of New Delhi nestled in the arid ravines in the
southwestern part of India's Uttar Pradesh state.
	   According to the movie makers, the men were killed to avenge her
alleged rape by them in 1980. Devi, whose trial is pending, denies
any part in the killings. However, she claims to have robbed
upper-caste landlords and landowners she accuses of exploiting the
poor. She has made a political career out of her reputation as a
champion of low-caste Indians.
	   ```Bandit Queen' ... gave only Phoolan's version. And Phoolan's
version was a pack of half truths and lies. She portrayed herself
as a wronged woman in order to justify her misdeed,'' Behmai
headman Raja Ram said Wednesday in an interview in the Uttar
Pradesh state capital of Lucknow. ``We decided to try to finance
another film which puts things in their proper perspective.''
	   The Behmai villagers say their men did not rape Devi and insist
she was a common criminal whose victims included Indians of all
castes.
	   With the help of the Thakur Samaj, a caste association, the
villagers have raised 600,000 rupees (dlrs 14,285) and hired
scriptwriters from the Bombay film industry. They hope to have a
completed script by March and then begin looking for a director and
more financing to begin shooting.
	   Devi surrendered in 1983 and spent 11 years in jail awaiting
trial on charges including mass murder before she was released on
bail. She entered politics and was elected to India's lower house
of parliament in 1996. She lost a re-election bid earlier this
year.
	   ``Bandit Queen'' was applauded at international film festivals
in Cannes and Toronto. Its director, Skekhar Kapur, is now being
praised for his new film ``Elizabeth,'' the story of the early
years of the 16th-century British monarch.

Sri Lankan army says it killed 13 Tamil rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan troops killed 13 Tamil
Tiger rebels in five battles in the northeast, where the guerrillas
are fighting for a homeland for the minority Tamils, a military
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The battles Tuesday also wounded two policemen aiding the army,
said Maj. Kumara Dewage. There were no army casualties.
	   Most of the fighting centered around Mankulam, where in
September government forces supported by warplanes and helicopter
gunships drove out the rebels. The rebels recaptured the larger
town of Kilinochchi, which they had lost in 1996, and regrouped in
small bases around Mankulam.
	   Tamil rebels claim Sri Lanka's Tamil minority is discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese, who control the government and
the military. More than 55,000 people have died in 15 years of
fighting.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's sacked
deputy prime minister, asked police to intimidate witnesses in a
sexual misconduct investigation against him, a witness testified
Wednesday at Anwar's corruption trial.
	   The trial entered its third day with prosecutors offering more
testimony to prove that Anwar had used his influence as deputy
prime minister and finance minister to mask sexual misdeeds.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eliminate his challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year rule.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, the former chief of the Special Branch,
Malaysia's top police intelligence unit, resumed testimony begun
Tuesday. He was the first of 52 prosecution witnesses expected to
take the stand.
	   Mohamed told the court that Anwar had urged him to arrest two
people who had made allegations against the former No. 2 and obtain
retractions from them.
	   Mohamed said he had immediately told police officers ``they had
less than 24 hours to obtain a retraction of the allegations.''
	   Anwar had also ``wanted us to ensure that there was no
publicity,'' Mohamed said.
	   On Tuesday, he said the Special Branch had launched an
investigation into sexual misconduct by Anwar in 1992, a year
before he was named to his Cabinet posts.
	   In August 1997, the investigation turned serious with a letter
and a sworn statement that accused Anwar of adultery and sodomy.
	   The statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other, by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the
sister of Anwar's private secretary, said her brother's wife had
sex with Anwar.
	   Both statements were also sent to Mahathir, who at first wrote
them off as poison-pen letters.
	   Mohamed said Anwar repeatedly met with police late at night to
learn more about the authors of the letters. He said Anwar ``urged
me to find them quickly and to interview them. He used the word
`gempar.'''
	   The Malay word caused a buzz through the courtroom and debate
over its meaning in English. Mohamed then said: ``That word means
to surprise them and to put fear in them.''
	   The retired intelligence chief said Anwar demanded full
retractions in writing.
	   ``He wanted Ummi and Azizan to fully declare that he was not
involved in any sex scandal,'' Mohamed testified.
	   Mohamed secured the retractions, which were forwarded to
Mahathir.
	   Anwar scribbled furiously on a legal pad during the hearing
Wednesday. When the hearing adjourned, Anwar approached his family.
His 14-year-old daughter, Nurul Nuha, said, ``I don't want to be a
lawyer.''
	   Anwar then pointed to the prosecutors: ``You see, those are the
lousy guys. You should see my guys in action.''
	   Defense lawyers were expected to argue that the charges against
Anwar were based on flimsy poison-pen letters and a government
conspiracy against him.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit to run the Southeast Asian
nation and dumped him on Sept. 2, after conducting his own
investigation into the sex charges.
	   The defense opened its case Monday by saying Mahathir should be
held in contempt of court for tainting the trial by saying publicly
that Anwar should be convicted to preserve harmony in the Southeast
Asian country.
	   Tens of thousands of Malaysians have openly expressed solidarity
for Anwar, participating in street protests since he was arrested
on Sept. 20. One of those demonstrations turned into a full-scale
riot 12 days ago when police fired tear gas and water cannons at
stone-throwing protesters.
	   It was the first clash between police and typically placid
Malaysians in nearly three decades.
	   Armed riot police guarded the street outside the federal
courthouse Wednesday and a water cannon truck was parked a few
hundred meters (yards) away.
	   Several international observers, who had failed to gain entry
into the courthouse for earlier sessions, were allowed in
Wednesday.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, as Malaysia plays host to 20 world leaders in the
capital for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. When the
trial resumes, the fifth graft charge and the five sex charges will
be heard.

Ethnic Albanian leader sees destruction firsthand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported clash. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serb government on Wednesday
reported clashes between Serbian police and the ethnic Albanians
near the coal-mining town of Belacevic _ a day after Kosovo's top
ethnic Albanian leader said he found evidence of refugees returning
to their homes but said more needs to be done to ensure their
safety.
	   The Serbian Media Center, which spreads the official view, said
``Albanian terrorists'' machine-gunned two vehicles carrying coal
miners to Belacevac, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Pristina,
wounding three of them Tuesday.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, who toured the countryside Tuesday for the first
time in nine years, said he saw ``huge destruction, but we met many
people who have begun returning. It's a beginning of the process to
return. But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes as he accompanied U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying to persuade the ethnic
Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo's independence from
Serbia and settle for some form of self-rule.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital
Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
set up a huge police presence.
	   With no major fighting in Kosovo for weeks and many Serb forces
withdrawn under an Oct. 12 peace agreement, Rugova visited villages
that were on the front line of fighting. Sporadic violence
continues, along with intimidation by Serb police intended to
prevent ethnic Albanians from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   Belgrade's private B-92 radio said Wednesday that ensuing
fighting between Serbian police and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army trapped nine workers inside the mine compound in
Belacevac for two hours a day in earlier.
	   Hill, trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and Serbs
on a political agreement for a three-year interim period of
self-rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more confidence
and stability.
	   ``It's frankly shocking to see the amount of damage that has
been done _ house after house without roofs, many burned-out homes
and many crops that weren't harvested this year,'' he said.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that they are unprepared to
compromise their goal of outright independence.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla hideouts in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts and infiltration trails in southern Lebanon
Wednesday in the fourth air assault in three days, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two jets fired at least two missiles at targets in Zillaya
valley, 12 kilometers (seven miles) southwest of the southern town
of Rashaya, the officials said.
	   The air strike came hours after guerrillas attacked an Israeli
position in the occupied zone, some four kilometers (2.5 miles) to
the south.
	   There was no word on casualties from the 11:15 a.m. (0915 GMT)
air strike or the earlier attack.
	   Guerrillas are known to have hideouts in the valley and to cross
it on their way to attack the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Israeli aircraft raided the same area twice on Monday. There
were no reports of casualties from those raids.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust
some 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
occupied zone which Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
attacks.

Malaysia's APEC representative: Crisis will top agenda at forum's
</HEADLINE>
summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asia-Pacific leaders will focus on restoring
financial stability and economic growth to the region at their
summit later this month, Malaysia's ambassador to the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum told a newspaper Wednesday.
	   ``The summit must send a strong signal that the grouping remains
a cohesive and coherent body and is working closely to strengthen
cooperation,'' Noor Adlan told The Straits Times.
	   Noor, who is also the executive director of the APEC
secretariat, said the actions of the leaders would be critical in
restoring confidence to the region, hit by the worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   Growth this year for APEC economies is expected to slide to 1.5
percent, from 3.5 percent last year, but recover modestly to 2
percent in 1999, according to an APEC outlook report that will be
presented at the summit Nov. 17-18 in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
capital.
	   Noor said he expected the region's leaders to push for greater
trade liberalization to boost recovery, adding that APEC members
have not resorted to protectionism as a way out of the crisis.
	   Malaysia has recently divorced itself from the world's financial
community by imposing capital and currency controls, a move its
leaders believe will restore the country's economy.
	   Commenting on the scheme, Noor said it was not a protectionist
step and it must be seen in the context of curbing currency
speculation.
	   ``There has been manipulation of the markets which has affected
the Malaysian currency and our stock markets. So we have taken this
very selective and specific action, which in no way reflects our
efforts to pursue trade liberalization,'' Noor said.
	   APEC has set the goal of achieving free and open trade in the
region by 2010 for industrialized members and by 2020 for
developing nations.
	   Noor also said that the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank should retain the central role in any APEC rescue
package.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join at this summit.
	   About 1,500 businessmen will also converge in the Malaysian
capital for a three-day APEC business summit Nov. 14-16.

Taliban jailed for defacing Buddha, soldiers guard statues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban soldiers have been deployed to
protect Afghanistan's ancient statues of Buddha, one of which was
damaged when a ``miscreant'' Taliban soldier shot at the
archeological treasures, the director of planning and foreign
relations said Wednesday.
	   ``We are trying to preserve our historical monuments,'' Mohammed
Naeem Sufi told The Associated Press in the beleaguered capital,
Kabul. ``It is not the policy of the Taliban to destroy our
cultural heritage.''
	   Sufi's comments followed reports that a Taliban soldier fired a
tank shell at a 35-meter (105-foot) Buddha during a battle in
September between the Taliban army and their Shiite Muslim enemies
for control of Bamyan province, home to two giant Buddha statues.
	   Several separate witnesses, who fled the fighting, said the
damage to the statue was a gaping hole in the face and in the groin
area.
	   ``When the Taliban captured Bamyan, one of the miscreants fired
his pistol at the statues,'' said Sufi. '''When the higher
authorities learned about it, he was arrested and now we have
deployed guards to save the statues.''
	   Two years ago, front line Taliban commanders threatened to
destroy the statues, including a 55 meter (165-foot) Buddha, the
world's tallest-standing Buddha. Both statues are believed to be
about 2,000 years old.
	   The threats riled both Muslim and non-Muslim countries, and the
Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar issued an order
that the statues were to be protected.
	   ``We are Muslims and it is against our religion to have statues,
but those statues are part of our history and we don't want to
destroy them,'' Sufi said.
	   Residents of the area say the smaller statue, clad in a veil
that covers most of its body, depicts the Buddha in female form.
They say the taller sculpture is a male image.
	   In life, Buddha was the son of a wealthy family who renounced
material comforts to live as a wandering ascetic in search of
truths about death and human suffering.
	   Strict Muslims believe images are contrary to Islam, and in the
90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban photographs and
photography are banned. Centuries ago, Muslim invaders who
converted the region to Islam hacked away the faces of both statues
in the belief that images were sacrilegious.
	   The opposition, which largely represents minority ethnic and
religious groups, rules in the remaining 10 percent of the country.

Hong Kong monetary head urges China to back loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES time element of Dai interview, 13th graf, RECASTS
2nd graf to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chief of Hong Kong's de facto central bank
has urged China to back shaky loans that Hong Kong commercial banks
arranged for a provincial lending institution shut by regulators,
it was reported Wednesday.
	   But the governor of the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong,
apparently has only expressed China's willingness to honor loans
that were registered with the appropriate mainland authorities _ a
stance that could put many loans from Hong Kong in jeopardy.
	   Any guarantee of foreign loans made to the failed Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., or other troubled
``Itics,'' as the provincial Chinese lenders are known, is a
delicate issue now under discussion by top officials from Hong Kong
and Beijing.
	   Much of the foreign lending was set up through Hong Kong
subsidiaries of the Itics and not legally registered in China,
bypassing the mainland's rules for disclosure and loan guarantees.
	   The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph
Yam, has been in Beijing, reportedly seeking assurances that bad
loans at the Guangdong lender, known as ``Gitic,'' won't become too
much of a problem for Hong Kong banks.
	   Yam reportedly argued that China should recognize the validity
of the loans if they were made properly in Hong Kong _ despite any
lack of registration in China.
	   Yam cited China's ``one country, two systems'' policy that
allows for conflicting laws to exist in Hong Kong and the mainland
following Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese sovereignty
last year, according to the respected Hong Kong Economic Journal.
	   Yam and a delegation of 17 Hong Kong bankers reportedly met
Tuesday with Liao Hui, China's top official handling dealings with
Hong Kong. The bankers reportedly planned to meet Wednesday with
the Chinese central bank governor, Dai.
	   The Associated Press was unable to obtain official confirmation
of what has been discussed. HKMA officials did not immediately
respond to a reporter's telephone inquiries.
	   When Gitic was closed last month, Hong Kong bankers became
worried about problem loans emerging at other Chinese Itics. Many
are saddled with billions of dollars of debt that may be difficult
to repay. Gitic alone reportedly has debts equaling U.S. dlrs 2
billion.
	   The settlement of Gitic's debts will influence how other similar
loans are repaid, Yam reportedly told the mainland Chinese
officials.
	   People's Bank of China officials said in October that the
central bank would repay at least some creditors, giving priority
to debts registered in China. That left bankers with unregistered
debt wondering whether they have any chance of getting their money
back.
	   The central bank governor, Dai, reiterated this policy in an
interview published Wednesday in Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese-language
Hong Kong daily known for authoritative coverage of mainland
affairs. Dai gave the interview on Oct. 20 _ about two weeks after
Gitic was closed.
	   While backing the Itic creditors, Yam was quoted by the Hong
Kong Standard as saying banks should be more careful in their
future lending.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla hideouts in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts and infiltration trails in southern Lebanon on
Wednesday in the fourth air assault in three days, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two jets fired at least two missiles at targets in Zillaya
valley, 12 kilometers (seven miles) southwest of the southern town
of Rashaya, the officials said.
	   The air strike came hours after guerrillas attacked an Israeli
position in the occupied zone, some four kilometers (2.5 miles) to
the south.
	   There was no word on casualties from the 11:15 a.m. (0915 GMT)
air strike or the earlier attack.
	   Guerrillas are known to have hideouts in the valley and to cross
it on their way to attack the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Israeli aircraft raided the same area twice Monday. There were
no reports of casualties from those raids.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust
some 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
occupied zone which Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
attacks.

Chinese police arrest two for inciting protest: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two villagers in eastern Jiangsu province have
been arrested for inciting a protest by 200 people in a city
government office, the official newspaper Workers Daily reported
Wednesday.
	   The report said Yang Jinbao and Yang Fuqing were accused of
having organized the July 6 demonstration in the Jiangsu city of
Xuzhou to protest actions that had ``hurt farmers' interests.''
	   The villagers traveled to the city on motorbikes, barged into
city hall, disrupted business, and fought with police who tried to
expel them, damaging public property and adversely affecting social
order, the report said.
	   It said that on Oct. 13, police had arrested the two ``in
accordance with the law.''

Ukrainian lawmakers seek to pass 1999 budget in December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The president and the parliament still have
differences over next year's draft budget, but lawmakers hope to
adopt the plan in December, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Communists are the leading faction in parliament, the Verkhovna
Rada, and some lawmakers want the budget to include more money for
social programs than President Leonid Kuchma has proposed.
	   In mid-November, parliament will hear Finance Minister Ihor
Mytyukov's presentation of the draft, the independent UNIAN news
agency said.
	   Under a schedule approved in parliament on Tuesday, legislators
plan to hold their first vote on the budget Dec. 2, followed by the
second vote Dec. 15 and the final third vote Dec. 23. Parliament
committees are now studying the draft, submitted by the government
late last month, UNIAN reported.
	   In September, parliament rejected the previous draft, arguing
that the devaluation of the national hryvna currency in the wake of
economic turmoil in neighboring Russia made many of the document's
figures unrealistic.
	   The latest draft forecasts a deficit of 0.6 percent of Ukraine's
gross domestic product, revenues of 22.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.56
billion) and expenditures of 23.18 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.76
billion), as well as a 1 percent growth of the country's GDP.
	   The International Monetary Fund has also criticized the draft,
saying that the government's revenue forecast was overly optimistic
and needed to be revised.
	   The IMF official, John Odling-Smee, said Ukraine's financial
markets have been harmed by the economic crisis in Russia, and
Ukraine's economy is expected to slow, and possibly even shrink.

Indonesia's military vows to protect assembly meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name for Wiranto, Suharto correct &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Riot Investigation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military said Wednesday
it would take stern action to prevent protesters from disrupting a
special session of the country's top legislative body next week.
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto said his troops would
protect the Nov. 10-13 session of the 1,000-member People's
Consultative Assembly while it debates proposed democratic reforms
promised ahead of planned parliamentary elections next May.
	   Democracy activists have criticized the assembly, saying it is
dominated by supporters and appointees of autocratic former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit office in May after
student protests and riots.
	   They say the assembly is unlikely to support truly democratic
reform.
	   Before Suharto stepped down, thousands of students invaded and
occupied the national Parliament building.
	   The assembly is to convene at the Parliament building next
Tuesday. Protest organizers say thousands will take to the streets
again.
	   They complain that the government is not moving fast or far
enough on political change. A series of protests in recent weeks
has been peppered with calls for Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, to resign as well.
	   Speaking to reporters at the state palace in Jakarta, Wiranto
said any group that attempts to disrupt the assembly would be
acting undemocratically and would be in violation of the law and
the constitution.
	   Therefore, the military would ``take stern action'' against
them, Wiranto said.
	   ``The meeting will decide the future of the nation, will decide
the people's welfare and other good interests,'' Wiranto said.
	   The government has said that 30,000 police, soldiers and
civilian volunteers will be deployed to safeguard the assembly.
	   Wiranto's declaration of support for the legislature's reform
work came one day after a government-appointed fact-finding team
accused members of the military of helping to incite May's riots,
which left about 1,200 people dead.

Kabila to hold talks with Mugabe on Congo war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila
arrived in Harare Wednesday to meet with President Robert Mugabe,
Mugabe's office said.
	   Kabila was expected to discuss military developments in his vast
mineral-rich country, where Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops, and be
briefed by Mugabe on his talks Tuesday with senior American
diplomats seeking a cease-fire in the three-month Congo war.
	   The U.S. mission, led by Susan Rice, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for African affairs, has been criticized by both
Kabila and Mugabe.
	   Rice was scheduled to meet in Rwanda Wednesday with President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Maj. Gen Paul Kagame, who is the vice
president, minister of defense and chief architect of Rwanda's
policy in Congo.
	   Rice then visits Uganda.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of mobilizing troops on
Congolese territory to back rebels fighting to topple him.
	   Rwanda accuses Kabila of hating ethnic Tutsis and failing to rid
the border of the former Hutu soldiers and militias responsible for
the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.
	   Zimbabwe and its southern African allies, Angola and Namibia,
have vowed to launch an offensive against rebel strongholds in the
dense jungles of eastern Congo.

China to act against `severe' crime problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's 2 1/2-year-old anti-crime campaign, which
already has seen thousands executed, should be extended to squash
persisting crime, a senior legislator was quoted Wednesday as
saying.
	   Even though public order has improved somewhat under the
``Strike Hard'' crackdown, ``the situation is still severe,'' Cao
Zhi, a vice chairman of the national legislature, reportedly told
fellow lawmakers Tuesday.
	   The campaign has given police liberties to use neighborhood
dragnets, late night checkpoints and other measures and encouraged
judges to apply the death penalty and longer prison sentences.
	   Police handled 834,000 criminal cases in the first half of 1998,
up 21.6 percent from the same period last year, official newspapers
said.
	   Speaking to the National People's Congress's executive
committee, Cao called for continuing ``Strike Hard,'' the Beijing
Morning Post reported.
	   Officials launched the anti-crime drive in 1996 in response to
public fears about rising crime and worries that social changes
brought on by economic reforms had edged society beyond government
control.
	   The number of people executed jumped to at least 4,367 in 1996
as the campaign took hold. In 1997, the number of executions fell
to at least 1,876 _ a more normal level by Chinese standards but
still more than the rest of the world combined, according to
Amnesty International.
	   Drug-related offenses and crimes by organized gangs were
growing, the Beijing Morning Post said. It also suggested that
repeated efforts to tackle China's widespread and blatant
prostitution problem, as well as pornography, had proved
ineffective.
	   ``When the wind of punishment picks up, a few illegal elements
take cover temporarily, only to pop up again when the wind blows
past,'' the newspaper said.
	   Crimes involving young people and migrants were also
``prominent,'' the newspaper added.
	   Young people make up some 50 percent of detained criminal
suspects, and 50 to 70 percent of criminal cases in some provinces
involved migrants, it said.
	   Meanwhile, court authorities in Beijing told reporters Wednesday
they were working to clear more than 80 percent of a backlog of
9,882 cases whose verdicts have not been carried out.
	   Two months into the four-month effort, more than 4,300 of the
backlogged cases have been wrapped up, said Zhou Zhiyong, deputy
head of the Beijing Higher People's Court.
	   Many of the cases appeared to be civil and commercial disputes.
Some cases were cleared by auctioning off people's property, Zhou
said.
	   Difficulties in enforcing court verdicts is a common problem for
China's spotty legal system.

Man behind Hyundai deals named to guide North Korea's policy toward
</HEADLINE>
South &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The man who helped North Korea strike
multimillion-dollar business deals with South Korea has been named
to guide the communist state's policy toward Seoul.
	   He is Kim Yong Sun, 64, a close confidant of leader Kim Jong Il
and a leading proponent of opening up the isolated North to outside
investment, South Korean officials said Wednesday.
	   He was named chairman of North Korea's Committee for the
Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland, which is in charge of
overall relations with South Korea. Its top post had been vacant
since 1991.
	   Kim already is a ruling Workers' Party secretary and head of the
Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, a party organ that deals with South
Korean businesses hoping to invest the North.
	   This month, he successfully negotiated a number of business
ventures with Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate,
including a dlrs 906 million tourism project.
	   ``North Korea appears to make Kim the sole contact point for the
South and become more consistent in dealing with the South,'' said
Kim Young-joon, a Seoul government analyst.
	   Kim's new appointment was revealed by Naewoe Press, which is run
by South Korea's intelligence agency and closely monitors North
Korean news media.
	   North Korea rarely makes public its political appointments.
Outside observers watch its news media for clues to any change in
the reclusive state's government lineups.
	   Hyundai's tourism project allows it to send several thousand
tourists a week for a five-day tour of Diamond Mountain, a major
attraction on the North's east coast, beginning Nov. 18.
	   The sightseeing project would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and capitalist South in 1945.

agreement with the Palestinians if he believes they are not keeping
all their promises.
	   The warning came as Netanyahu traded accusations with
Palestinian negotiators over the fate of 30 Palestinian fugitives
whom Israel wants arrested by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The latest dispute is holding up implementation of the 12-week
plan under which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for a series of Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu said he would only convene his Cabinet to ratify the
peace agreement _ a necessary step ahead of implementation _ if he
gets written assurances from the United States on a key Palestinian
security pledge.
	   Shortly after noon, Israel radio reported that the Cabinet
session tentatively scheduled for 1:30 p.m. (1130) gmt would not
take place. If confirmed, this would mark the third time in a week
that Netanyahu postponed a Cabinet session called to ratify the
accord.
	   Netanyahu did not, 5th graf pvs.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Bands of armed militants raided a
city in northern Tajikistan early Wednesday, battling government
troops and seizing several administrative buildings in heavy
fighting, officials said.
	   The attackers are led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against President Emomali Rakhmonov last year
and then fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
	   The assailants seized all administrative buildings in the city
of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport, said
Rakhmonov's spokesman Zafar Saidov.
	   At least 10 government troops were killed in fighting, and the
attackers also seized some 30 police officers as hostages, Saidov
said in a telephone interview. The local police chief was badly
wounded in the battle.
	   The president chaired an emergency government session to discuss
the crisis and ordered all troops be put on alert. Russia's 201st
motorized infantry division, deployed in Tajikistan to support the
government, has also been put in combat readiness.
	   The attackers didn't pose any immediate demands.
	   Khudoberdyev broke away from the government after it signed a
peace deal with the mostly Islamic opposition in the summer of
1997.
	   The agreement formally ended a five-year civil war, but the
impoverished former Soviet republic continues to suffer from
frequent outbursts of violence. Many opposition warlords and
government commanders have refused to acknowledge the peace deal.
	   ``The attack is aimed at thwarting the peace process in the
republic,'' Saidov said.

French Foreign Minister glad Lewinsky saga did not hit Democrats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-5 with further reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Foreign Minister on Wednesday welcomed the
outcome of the U.S. elections, saying it was ``a good thing for
democracy'' that the Democrats did not suffer a backlash from the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
	   Hubert Vedrine, in an interview with radio station RTL, said
President Bill Clinton's party had performed well ``despite the
pressures on him, despite the attacks which really resembled
McCarthyism.''
	   ``Generally, it's a good thing for democracy that this type of
attack doesn't weigh on the voters' choices.''
	   Jack Lang, head of the National Assembly's foreign affairs
committee, said the result was ``a victory for democracy and good
judgment.''
	   Lang, a former culture minister, congratulated Clinton in a
press release, saying he was pleased ``that the American people
stood up against the heinous campaign that has been orchestrated
against you by ultraconservatives for too long.''
	   Republicans retained control of the U.S. House for another two
years but failed to obtain the sizable increases the party's
leaders had sought to reinforce their agenda to impeach Clinton.
	   Vedrine said stability was positive in terms of foreign policy.
	   ``We know well the foreign policy of Clinton and (U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine) Albright,'' Vedrine said. ``So we know where we
stand.''

North Korean man defects to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A North Korean man arrived in Seoul
Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger-stricken
homeland, government officials said.
	   Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a ``third
country'' since fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade said.
	   The ministry generally uses the term ``third country'' to avoid
naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to
return defectors to their homeland.
	   The ministry described Kim as a former athlete, but said details
of his background and his method of escape from North Korea were
not available.
	   About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years, including 60 so far this year. All complained about
severe food and fuel shortages in their country.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought the Korean War in 1950-53 and
never signed a formal peace treaty.

Parliament asks Yeltsin's doctors to report on his health
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zyuganov's comments in new garfs 6-8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and other hardliners in the Russian
parliament sought an official report on Boris Yeltsin's health
while the president continued to recuperate at a Black Sea resort
Wednesday.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, asked the presidential
doctors to give a detailed account of Yeltsin's condition. The
lawmakers are expected to follow up Thursday, when they consider a
bill that would require the president to undergo a medical exam,
with the results passed on to parliament.
	   However, the bill faces an uphill battle because Yeltsin would
have to approve it before it becomes law, and he's almost certain
to veto the measure.
	   Yeltsin has ignored opposition attacks and insisted he will
serve out his term that lasts until the middle of the year 2000.
The president and his doctors say he has no serious health
problems, and his current ailment is described as fatigue and
high-blood pressure.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted that a medical
inspection would reveal that the president was incapable of
performing his duties.
	   Zyuganov has spoken about Yeltsin's drinking habits in extremely
blunt language in the last few days, and he kept up his attacks
Wednesday.
	   ``You would consider me mad if I suggest that you board a plane
with a drunk and incapacitated first pilot,'' Zyuganov said at a
news conference on Wednesday. ``I feel pity for him (Yeltsin), he
destroyed his health with his own hands.''
	   Yeltsin has denied opposition claims that he has a drinking
problem.
	   Meanwhile, presidential aide Oleg Sysuyev said on Wednesday that
Yeltsin would outline his ``new political role'' in an address to
the parliament early next year.
	   Sysuyev, who was in France, reiterated that the president would
concentrate on political issues and allow his Cabinet to deal with
economic matters, the Interfax news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ It took Luke less time to become a Jedi
than it took director George Lucas to grasp the impact Star Wars
had on moviegoers.
	   ``When you're in the center of something like this you don't see
it very much,'' Lucas said Wednesday, 21 years after his
blockbuster trilogy began. ``I'm beginning to see it, through my
5-year-old son. He's a Star Wars fanatic now and wants me to buy
all the toys. I'm beginning to see what most people have been going
through.''
	   The filmmaker's company, Lucasfilm Ltd., and Fox Studios
Australia announced Wednesday that the next two films in a
three-part prequel to the Star Wars trilogy of the 1970s and 1980s
will be made in Australia.
	   Plot details remain largely under wraps, but Lucas said the new
films will include the tale of how Anakin Skywalker, father of Luke
and Princess Leia became Darth Vader, the villain behind a black
mask.
	   Filming for the first movie in the new series, ``Star Wars:
Episode I The Phantom Menace,'' was completed in Britain last year
and is due for release in the United States in May 1999. The film
stars British actors Liam Neeson as as a Jedi master and Ewan
McGregor as a young Ben Kenobi.
	   ``One of the biggest problems I've had in the past is that most
of the characters had to be made out of latex,'' Lucas said. ``It
is very hard to direct around a large rubber thing that can't move
very well.''
	   After experiments with digital technology with the slug-like
character Jabba the Hutt for a reissued special edition of the
original movies, Lucas said the new films will have more digital
characters.
	   ``I've got digital characters which can actually walk and talk
with live action characters and do a performance.''
	   The new films largely will be shot on a soundstage in Fox's
complex in Sydney, with post-production at Lucas' headquarters in
San Francisco.
	   ``Episode II,'' was expected to begin shooting in April 2000,
and ``Episode III'' in 2003, said Kim Williams, chief executive of
Fox Studios Australia.

Eritrean President in Yemen following end to island dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki arrived
here Wednesday for talks with Yemen's president on defining the two
counties' maritime borders after they resolved a dispute over three
Red Sea Islands.
	   Afwerki's meeting with President Ali Abdullah Saleh follows
Eritrea's withdrawal from a disputed island it had controlled in
line with last week's ruling by an international arbitration panel.
	   During his three-day trip, Afwerki will discuss maritime borders
and the flow of shipping in the Red Sea, said a government
spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. He is
accompanied by his foreign and trade ministers.
	   The three islands involved in the dispute sit across one of the
world's major shipping lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.
	   Afwerki also is expected to ask Saleh to close offices of
Eritrean opposition groups based in the Yemeni capital San`a, said
an African diplomat, insisting on anonymity.
	   The Eritrean leader plans to discuss the possibility of Yemeni
mediation between Eritrea and Sudan, said the diplomat. Relations
between Sudan and Eritrea are tense following accusations by Sudan
that Eritrea is aiding separatist rebels in southern Sudan.
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9, the International Court of Arbitration based in The
Hague, Netherlands, awarded all three islands to Yemen and said its
decision should be honored within 90 days. The court's decisions
are legally binding.
	   On Sunday, Eritrea withdrew its troops from Greater Hanish.
	   The decision leaves Yemen free to develop three islands for
tourism, scuba diving, oil and other enterprises.

Two security officials killed in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two security officials in breakaway Chechnya have
been killed in what the government suspects was retaliation for a
crackdown on crime and kidnappings, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Chechnya's security forces have been waging a campaign to bring
order to the violent region, but the attempt has also produced a
spate of attacks against security officials.
	   Security Ministry officials said two of their staff in capital
Grozny have been found with their throats cut, the Interfax news
agency reported. The ministry said the killings were an attempt to
thwart the anti-crime campaign.
	   Late last month, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, Shadid
Bargishev was killed in a car bomb explosion.
	   Officials said Bargishev was targeted because he had promised to
launch a major offensive against hostage-takers, and he had
recently succeeded in securing the release of several captives,
including a British couple.
	   Chechnya has been plagued by kidnappings for ransom since its
1994-1996 independence war with Russia. About 100 people are still
held, including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk.
	   Meanwhile, opponents of Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov
have resumed demands for his resignation, saying he has been unable
to bring order to the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Shamil Basayev, who served as acting prime minister for the
first half of this year, accused Maskhadov of being unable to run
Chechnya, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Maskhadov's resignation ``will be useful both for Chechen
security and for the strengthening of the independent Chechen
state,'' Basayev said in a television appearance Monday night.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent, but no country has
recognized its independence, and Moscow insists the territory is
part of Russia.

Peruvian novelist Bryce Echenique wins Spain's Narrative prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Peruvian novelist Alfredo Bryce Echenique
has been awarded Spain's National Narrative Prize for his latest
book 'Reo de Nocturnidad '(Nocturnal Prisoner).
	   Describing the award as a ``golden touch'' to end his stay in
Spain, Bryce Echenique was announced the winner of the prize
Tuesday.
	   Awarded annually by the Culture Ministry, the prize carries a
cash gift of 2.5 million pesetas (dlrs 180,000) which the
59-year-old writer told reporters he would use to pay off debts.
	   Bryce Echenique, who was born in Lima, Peru, but also possesses
Spanish nationality since 1988, said his book `Reo de Nocturnidad'
deals with advantages and disadvantages of insomnia in the
relationship between a man and a woman. The novel was published
last year.
	   The author, who has spent the last three decades living between
Peru, France and, most recently, Spain, plans to return to Lima
early next year to live.
	   The National Narrative Prize is awarded to works written in any
of Spain's four official languages, Castilian Spanish, Basque,
Catalan or Galician.

Police reveal they have `great secret' to coerce statements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar's Trial &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior Malaysian police officer
revealed Wednesday that intelligence police have a ``great secret''
to force people to retract statements and even to change their
political views.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, former chief of the Special Branch,
Malaysia's top police intelligence unit, said police used the
technique last year, allegedly at the behest of ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mohamed, who was testifying at Anwar's trial on corruption
charges, said his officers had used the method called ``Operation
Turning Over'' to force two people who had alleged sexual misdeeds
by Anwar to retract their statements.
	   ``Basically we do a quick assessment on our target, so we know
how possible it is for us to turn them over,'' he told prosecutors
during the third day of the trial.
	   ``If it is a certain political stand, we may neutralize the
stand if it is a security threat,'' he said.
	   When trial Judge Augustine Paul asked Mohamed to elaborate, he
said: ``My Lord, this is a Special Branch secret. It is a great
secret.''
	   Among the 10 charges Anwar faces, four relate to alleged misuse
of his influence as deputy prime minister to force police to tamper
with evidence about his alleged sex acts.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2
and arrested 18 days later. He denies all the charges.
	   Of the two retractions referred to in court Wednesday, one was a
statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, who said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times.
	   The other was by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's private
secretary, who said her brother's wife had sex with Anwar.
	   Mohamed said that during the interrogation of the two, police
came to question whether the allegations were true.
	   ``Despite that, I directed them to go ahead and neutralize
them,'' Mohamed said.

Russian lawmakers urge political asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a
terrorist organization.
	   Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,
who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The conflict
has killed an estimated 37,000 people.
	   Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seeking
asylum for Ocalan.
	   ``This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people,'' he said.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, supported
Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish
government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that
Turkey withdraw its troops.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear. Turkey says he recently left
Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm
that he is in the country.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in
the Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran
and Syria.

Government offers bailouts as Taiwan business troubles spread

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Three state-run banks took over a troubled
finance company Wednesday as the government pledged help to
businesses facing difficulties in the economic slowdown.
	   The banks will manage Central Bills Finance Co. for six months
in an attempt to resolve serious cash-flow problems, Vice Finance
Minister Sean Chen said.
	   ``The main problem now is to restore investor confidence and
stabilize the money market,'' Chen told a news conference.
	   Investor confidence seemed in short supply Wednesday, as the
share price of four companies damaged by a busted stock purchase
plunged 7 percent, dropping by the maximum amount allowed under
Taiwanese securities law for the second day in a row.
	   All of the troubles helped push Taiwan blue chip shares down by
another 2 percent, following similar losses in Tuesday's dealings.
	   The crisis erupted at Central Bills after the company failed to
pay back an estimated 4 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 123
million) worth of loans that had come due.
	   Hit by Asia's financial crisis, Taiwan's economy has slowed and
domestic consumption has slumped, leaving many companies struggling
to pay off debts that they ran up when times were better.
	   Several customers of Central Bills have recently run into
financial troubles that eventually caught up with Central Bills, a
finance group that guarantees bonds issued by its clients when they
raise money to operate their own businesses.
	   Fearing that Central Bills could be dragged down by the economic
mess, creditors began clamoring last week for repayment of their
debts, while customers demanded that the company make good on its
business contracts.
	   Among Central Bills' customers is the conglomerate New
Magnitude, which together with the Panvest business group had
failed Tuesday to come up with cash to settle stock deals worth a
combined 760 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 23 million) _
spreading negative sentiment through the market.
	   Traders say three New Magnitude subsidiaries and one Panvest
subsidiary were trying to prop up other members of their respective
conglomerates through share purchases, but they eventually were
unable to keep buying. Shares in all four subsidiaries fell as far
as the law allowed both Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Property shares, which have been weak lately, plunged further
amid concerns about the property interests of New Magnitude and
Panvest.
	   Finance Minister Paul Chiu predicted the financial turmoil would
be short-lived because the government was developing a bailout
plan.
	   Early Wednesday, Premier Vincent Siew pledged government help to
financial institutions that are sound but facing short-term
problems with cash flow.
	   Siew ordered government agencies to help troubled business
groups improve their financial structures.
	   Officials said the government will initially set up a fund of
1.2 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 million) to provide loans
to small businesses.

Eritrean President in Yemen following end to island dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki arrived
Wedneday in Yemen for talks with the president on defining the two
countries' maritime borders after they resolved a dispute over
three Red Sea Islands.
	   Afwerki's meeting with President Ali Abdullah Saleh follows
Eritrea's withdrawal from a disputed island it controlled in line
with last week's ruling by an international arbitration panel.
	   During his three-day trip, Afwerki also will discuss the flow of
shipping in the Red Sea, said a government spokesman, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity. He is accompanied by his foreign
and trade ministers.
	   The three islands involved in the dispute sit across one of the
world's major shipping lanes, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.
	   Afwerki also is expected to ask Saleh to close offices of
Eritrean opposition groups based in the Yemeni capital San`a, said
an African diplomat, insisting on anonymity.
	   The Eritrean leader plans to discuss the possibility of Yemeni
mediation between Eritrea and Sudan, said the diplomat. Relations
between Sudan and Eritrea are tense following accusations by Sudan
that Eritrea is aiding separatist rebels in southern Sudan.
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9, the International Court of Arbitration based in The
Hague, Netherlands, awarded all three islands to Yemen and said its
decision should be honored within 90 days. The court's decisions
are legally binding.
	   On Sunday, Eritrea withdrew its troops from Greater Hanish.
	   The decision leaves Yemen free to develop three islands for
tourism, scuba diving, oil and other enterprises.

Singaporeans to test new rules by dancing to Latin rock star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singaporeans will test new, more relaxed rules
for public concerts later this month by dancing to the tunes of
Latin American pop star Ricky Martin, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   What concert-goers throughout the world take for granted _
dancing or standing up from their seats during the performance _
until recently was illegal in conservative Singapore.
	   Since last month, police have relaxed rules for public concerts
and other entertainment events, and will tolerate dancing in the
audience as long as it isn't violent or offensive.
	   Taking advantage of the new rules, promoters for Martin are
selling about 700 standing tickets at 55 Singapore dollars (dlrs
32) each for his show on Nov. 25.
	   ``In the past under the old rules, it was almost impossible to
get approval for such a thing,'' Michael Hosking of Midas
Promotions told The Straits Times.
	   The Puerto Rican heart-throb is best known for his France '98
World Cup theme song, ``The Cup of Life,'' which became an
international hit in Spanish, English and French versions.
	   Though the new rules allow performers to mingle with the crowd
during the concert, Singaporeans should not hold their breath to
take a closer look at Martin.
	   ``If we let him go off the stage, we may not get him back,''
Hosking said.

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbs were wounded after a car
was raked with gunfire by separatist ethnic Albanians, police said
Wednesday. The violence highlighted the continuing potential for
bloodshed in Kosovo despite last month's peace agreement.
	   Serb police at a checkpoint near Sipitula, about 15 kilometers
(nine miles) west of Pristina, said Albanian guerrillas opened fire
on two vehicles from the nearby Belacevac coal mine Tuesday
evening.
	   They said an ensuing gunfight between police and the attackers
lasted an hour.
	   Three miners in the car were injured and taken to Pristina
hospital, according to police. The cars, still sitting at the
checkpoint Wednesday morning, had several bullet holes or marks in
the windshields and chassis.
	   Villagers said Serb police began shooting at the village at
about the same time police said the gunfight began. The villagers
said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or homes of
friends and relatives.
	   A few who returned Wednesday morning said police routinely
attack the village and force them to flee.
	   ``They aren't withdrawing their forces'' as called for in the
Oct. 12 agreement, complained one man, Fatmme Mjeku.
	   Alluding to the police threat to Albanian refugees before the
attack, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader said more needs to be
done to ensure the safety of refugees going back home.
	   Ibrahim Rugova spoke Tuesday after venturing into the
countryside for the first time in nine years.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the process to return.
But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central
Kosovo. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying
to persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo's
independence from Serbia and settle for some form of self-rule.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital
Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
set up a huge police presence.
	   But with no major fighting in Kosovo for weeks and many Serb
forces withdrawn under the Oct. 12 peace agreement, he visited
villages that were on the front line of fighting between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas last month.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians
from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more
confidence and stability.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that they are not prepared to
compromise their goal of outright independence.
	   On Wednesday, they announced they are holding two politicians
from Rugova's party who went missing Oct. 30 in Malisevo, southwest
of Pristina. The two, Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku, were
conducting an anti-KLA campaign and ``coaxed people to turn in
their arms,'' said a KLA statement printed in the daily Koha
Ditore.

US Defense Secretary Cohen arrives in Bahrain

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
arrived here Wednesday on a brief visit for talks with the Bahraini
government, the official Gulf News Agency said.
	   The agency did not give the substance of the talks, but Cohen is
touring the Middle East to drum up for possible U.S. military
action against Iraq.
	   Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with disarmament
monitors has been condemned by the U.N. Security Council as a
``flagrant violation'' of the country's agreements with the world
body.
	   Earlier Wednesday Cohen flew to Kuwait where he discussed the
Iraqi situation with the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and
the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said in Kuwait.
	   Cohen did not speak to reporters during his Kuwaiti visit.
	   The defense secretary began his tour Tuesday with a visit to
Saudi Arabia. There have been different accounts of the talks in
the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured
of Saudi backing in the event of military action against Iraq, but
a Saudi official _ speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King
Fahd told the defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a
springboard for attacks on Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the world body over
weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states
in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   But on Tuesday night, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry
said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between the
United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack on Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they
were privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that
Cohen was actually told that Arab leaders would support an attack
on Iraq only if it was guaranteed to remove President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Several thousand U.S. troops and their weapons are positioned
here under a 10-year defense pact that Kuwait signed with
Washington after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation.

Asian crisis pushes Thai business closures up 35 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Commerce Ministry said Wednesday
that business closures in crisis-stricken Thailand in this year's
first 10 months were up 35.5 percent over the same period last
year, a total of 10,175 companies.
	   The closures were a stark indication of the damage wrought to
the Thai economy since last year's flotation of the currency, the
baht, triggered a regional economic meltdown and sent the country
into its worst recession in decades.
	   The ministry said that of the total, 9,502 companies voluntarily
shut their operations. Another 50 companies went bankrupt between
January and October, and 623 had their trade registration removed
from records after having suspended operations for several years.
	   Thai officials say the economy has not yet hit rock-bottom,
though the currency and stock markets have recently strengthened.
The economy is still expected to shrink 7 percent this year. An
estimated 1.5 million Thais have lost their jobs.

Man jailed for being Shiite Muslim begins hunger strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Shiite Muslim detained under a
security law for spreading his brand of Islam began a hunger strike
Wednesday demanding immediate release.
	   Kamaruzaman Ismail, 45, in a signed statement from his detention
camp, also called for the release of seven other Shiites arrested
last November under the Internal Security Act, which allows for
indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   ``We were arrested for believing in a different Islamic creed,''
Kamaruzaman said in the statement issued by a leading human rights
group, SUARAM.
	   The government's department of Islamic affairs and the home
ministry declined comment.
	   The government of Malaysia _ a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation
_ considers Shiite teachings a threat to national security, saying
they could harm Muslim unity. More than half of Malaysia's 22
million people are Sunni Muslims.
	   ``This action which clearly violates human rights is another
pretext of the ruling regime for silencing opposition voices,''
said Kamaruzaman, who was a member of the Islamic opposition party,
Parti Islam SeMalaysia.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has come under unprecedented
attack by anti-government protesters since he fired his deputy,
Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2.
	   Protesters have called for Mahathir's resignation and the repeal
of the ISA, under which Anwar was arrested. Anwar's trial began
Monday on 10 counts of corruption and sodomy, all of which he
denies and has called politically motivated.
	   Last November, a group of 10 people including professors, social
activists and religious scholars were arrested for spreading Shiite
beliefs, the branch of Islam popular in Iran. Three were released.
	   The government treats Shiite tenets as deviant. Allowing such
pluralism in Islam, it reckons, will divide the Muslims in
Malaysia.
	   A few years ago, the government banned a Muslim group known as
Al-Arqam that flourished in some areas, saying the group's
teachings deviated from the true faith.
	   ``It shows the government is quite intolerant of religious
differences,'' said Elizabeth Wong of SUARAM.

Israeli jets strike south Lebanon after bomb kills 3 militiamen

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES and RECASTS with casualties, new attacks; CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon Wednesday after three
pro-Israeli militiamen were killed.
	   In the air strike, the fourth in three days, two jets fired at
least two missiles at targets in Zillaya valley, 12 kilometers
(seven miles) southwest of the southern town of Rashaya, Lebanese
and Israeli officials said.
	   About 15 minutes earlier, guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
under an armored vehicle of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army,
killing three militiamen, Lebanese officials said.
	   A fourth militiaman was wounded in the bombing, which occurred
near Jezzine, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northwest of Zillaya.
	   The SLA admitted three dead and one wounded in a statement
carried by its radio station.
	   Another roadside bomb exploded as Lebanese civil defense workers
were putting out a bush fire sparked by the first bombing in the
area. A fire engine was damaged but there were no casualties, the
Civil Defense Department said in Beirut.
	   The Iranian-backed guerrilla group Hezbollah claimed
responsibility for the first roadside bomb in a statement issued in
Beirut.
	   Earlier Wednesday, guerrillas fired mortar bombs at an Israeli
position in the occupied zone, some four kilometers (2.5 miles)
south of Zillaya.
	   There was no word on casualties from the 11:15 a.m. (0915 GMT)
air strike or the mortar attack.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli military said their
planes had attacked ``terrorist targets'' in Zillaya.
	   Guerrillas are known to have hideouts in Zillaya valley and to
cross it on their way to attack the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Israeli aircraft raided the same area twice on Monday. There
were no reports of casualties from those raids.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other guerrillas are fighting
to oust some 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the

Israeli jets strike south Lebanon after bomb kills three militiamen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with casualties, new attacks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon on Wednesday after three
pro-Israeli militiamen were killed in a roadside bombing.
	   Two jets fired at least two missiles at targets in Zillaya
valley, 12 kilometers (seven miles) southwest of the southern town
of Rashaya, in the fourth air strike in three days, Lebanese and
Israeli officials said.
	   About 15 minutes earlier, guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb
under an armored vehicle of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army,
killing three militiamen, Lebanese officials said. A fourth
militiaman was wounded in the bombing near Jezzine, 15 kilometers
(10 miles) northwest of Zillaya.
	   The SLA admitted three dead and one wounded in a statement
carried by its radio station.
	   Another roadside bomb exploded as Lebanese civil defense workers
put out a bush fire sparked by the first bombing. A fire engine was
damaged but there were no casualties, the Civil Defense Department
said in Beirut.
	   The Iranian-backed guerrilla group Hezbollah claimed
responsibility for the first roadside bomb in a statement issued in
Beirut.
	   Earlier Wednesday, guerrillas fired mortar bombs at an Israeli
position in the occupied zone, some four kilometers (2.5 miles)
south of Zillaya.
	   There was no word on casualties from the 11:15 a.m. (0915 GMT)
air strike or the mortar attack.
	   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli military said their
planes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in Zillaya.
	   Guerrillas are known to have hideouts in Zillaya valley and to
cross it on their way to attack the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   Israeli aircraft raided the same area twice Monday. There were
no reports of casualties from those raids.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other guerrillas are fighting
to oust some 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
occupied zone which Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
attacks.

UEFA decision on Fiorentina incident expected by Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA expects to decide by Monday how to
deal with an incident which caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup
match between Fiorentina and Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the
European governing body said Wednesday.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg match after a Belgian
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device hurled
from the stands.
	   There will be no replay of the match Wednesday, UEFA said in a
statement. A decision will be taken by UEFA's control and
disciplinary body.
	   ``We need to know the details'' before deciding what action to
take, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonella said.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of
its Franchi stadium as a result of its fans misbehavior during a
Cup Winners Cup game against Barcelona in 1997.
	   Although playing away from home Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans behavior in Salerno.
	   ``We behaved in accordance with the rules,'' the Swiss sports
agency SI quoted Grasshoppers sport director Erich Vogel as saying.
``Now we're waiting for the UEFA decision.''
	   The injured official, Philippe Flament, was taken to hospital
with a right knee injury. The incident occurred as players and
officials were walking to the dressing rooms at the end of the
first half.
	   Draws for third-round games of the European competition are
scheduled on Friday.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify. The Italian club was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes of the
second leg.

Asian markets close mostly higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian shares continued their strong runs
Wednesday, with blue chips in the top three markets _ Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Singapore _ finishing sharply higher amid perceptions that
the recent rallies can be sustained.
	   Foreign investors leaped into the Tokyo market after an
influential Wall Street strategist said Japanese stocks were
undervalued.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average soared 575.06
points, or 4.12 percent, closing at 14,527.81 _ its highest finish
since Sept. 10.
	   The Nikkei had climbed 388.24 points, or 2.86 percent, on
Monday, before closing Tuesday for a national holiday.
	   Barton Biggs, the global strategist for U.S. investment bank
Morgan Stanley, sparked buying interest by calling Tokyo shares a
decent bet.
	   ``Japan could be the next great trade,'' Biggs said. ``Everyone
believes Japan is beyond redemption, but the Japanese market is
truly cheap and Japan is at exactly the opposite end of the
economic, market and sentiment cycle as the U.S.''
	   Still, many analysts predicted Japan's bleak prospects for an
economic recovery would soon take the steam out of the rally by the
Nikkei.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought 116.64 yen in the late
afternoon, higher than Tuesday's level of 115.33 yen in New York.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Index closed 3 percent
higher at 1,301.05, climbing above the psychologically important
1,300-point level.
	   Recent interest rate cuts in Singapore encouraged investors.
After the market closed Wednesday, Overseas Union Bank Ltd.
announced it was slashing its prime leading rate, following the
lead of two other banks earlier this week.
	   In Hong Kong, strong interest in the shares of the British
banking giant HSBC Holdings and property developers drove the blue
chip Hang Seng Index higher for the fourth consecutive session.
	   The index gained 149.73 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,508.25,
its highest finish since May 6.
	   In Indonesia, speculative buying of blue chips sent the key JSX
Index surging 4.2 percent to 330.46, with shares in PT Indofood
Sukses Makmur surging 33 percent on perceptions that it might be
heading to corporate restructuring and team up with a strategic
partner.
	   But in the Philippines, a streak of gains in the key PSE index,
which began Oct. 21 and totaled 333.95 points, or 23 percent,
finally snapped in what traders called a technical correction. The
index fell 4.9 percent to 1,714.09.
	   The market recently had surged on a stronger value of the local
currency, the peso.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Falling domestic interest rates, higher potential
returns of shares and a more stabilized stock market encouraged
local fund managers to scoop up shares. The key Composite Index
closed at 431.70 points, up 2.3 percent.
	   BANGKOK: The key SET index closed 3.2 percent higher at 354.11
as buying in small banks led to a rally in the broader market. A
U.S.-based bank was buying aggressively into Bank of Asia and Thai
Danu Bank, two small Thai banks that have been taken over by
foreign strategic partners, dealers said.
	   SYDNEY: Australia's key All Ordinaries index closed slightly
higher at 2,679.9, up 4.3 points, buoyed by the strong gains in
Tokyo.
	   SEOUL: The Kospi index ended 1.4 percent higher at 413.47
points, driven by buying by local small investors.
	   TAIPEI: The key Weighted Price Index dropped 2.4 percent to
6,905.32 amid financial troubles at two big corporations, New
Magnitude Group and Panvest Group.
	   WELLINGTON: The key NZSE-40 capital index finished higher for
the fourth day, rising 5.83 points to 1,965.81.

	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the

was to go into effect on Monday.
	   As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16.
	   Netanyahu has said implementation would not begin until the
agreement is approved by the Cabinet and by Israel's parliament.

 &UR; US Defense Secretary Cohen arrives in Bahrain &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with arrival in Bahrain. DROPS byline. No
pickup.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
arrived Wednesday in Bahrain on a brief visit for talks with the
government, the official Gulf News Agency said.
	   The agency did not give the substance of the talks, but Cohen is
touring the Middle East to drum up for possible U.S. military
action against Iraq, which decided Saturday to end all cooperation
with disarmament monitors. The U.N. Security Council has condemned
Iraq's action as a ``flagrant violation'' of agreements with the
world body.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Cohen was in Kuwait, where he discussed the
Iraqi situation with the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and
the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said in Kuwait.
	   Cohen did not speak to reporters during that visit.
	   Cohen began his tour Tuesday with a visit to Saudi Arabia. There
have been different accounts of the talks in the Saudi capital,
Riyadh. The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in
the event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi official _
speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told the
defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for
attacks on Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
over weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab
states in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   On Tuesday night, however, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense
ministry said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between
the United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack, while U.S. officials maintained they were
privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that Cohen
was told that Arab leaders would support an attack only if it was
guaranteed to remove President Saddam Hussein.
	   Several thousand U.S. troops and their weapons are based in
Kuwait under a 10-year defense pact that Kuwait signed with
Washington after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation.

Taiwan weighs repatriation of Chinese hijacker pilot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over but no decision announced &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Still puzzled over what to do about a
Chinese pilot who hijacked his own flight and landed in Taiwan,
officials grappled Wednesday with the question of whether they
should send him to the mainland to face Chinese justice.
	   Such a move would break with Taiwan's previous practice of
trying and sentencing Chinese hijackers itself _ and the government
apparently was unable to come up with any quick answers in the case
of Air China captain Yuan Bin.
	   Yuan, 30, said he diverted the Boeing 737-300 from its scheduled
route from Beijing to the southwest Chinese city of Kunming because
he was frustrated over pay and working conditions at the state-run
Chinese carrier.
	   Officials of the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top body on
China policy, led a high-level discussion on the Yuan affair
Wednesday, but they finished without offering any clues about what
they will do.
	   Published reports suggested a quick repatriation of Yuan was
being considered _ a possibility that prompted Yuan to stage a
brief hunger strike after his arrest Oct. 28. His diversion of the
flight ended peacefully when he surrendered, with no injuries to
any of the 104 people aboard the jet.
	   Taiwanese authorities also detained Yuan's wife, 27-year-old Xu
Mei, who was aboard the jet. Authorities have not said whether she
would be charged with anything.
	   Taiwanese media have reported that Yuan hijacked the jet in the
belief that he could remain in Taiwan after spending a few years in
prison.
	   The issue of repatriating hijackers has been a sticking point
between Taiwan and China as they seek to improve relations.
	   Taiwan used to greet hijackers from China as heroes, but began
in the 1980s to prosecute them as tensions eased between the rival
governments. Still, Taiwan has not yet sent any hijackers back to
China for prosecution.
	   Last year, China returned a man who committed the rare act of
hijacking a jet from Taiwan to the mainland.
	   Liu Shan-chung was a Taiwanese journalist who diverted a
jetliner to China by threatening to set himself on fire. Liu was
returned by Chinese authorities to Taiwan for prosecution a month
after the incident in what was seen as a gesture of good faith.
	   Liu claimed his colleagues had harassed him because he was born
in China and wasn't able to speak the Taiwanese dialect.
	   Taiwan sentenced Liu to life in prison _ a tougher penalty than
it has given to people convicted of hijacking jets from China to
Taiwan.
	   During a string of air piracies in 1993 and 1994, Taiwan
arrested 16 Chinese hijackers and gave them sentences of up to 12
years.
	   Two were paroled and sent back to China last year. But China
refused to reveal their fates in the mainland, and Taiwan has since
declined to repatriate six others who have been paroled.

Official: Ukraine may stop sending spent nuclear fuel to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine might stop sending spent nuclear
fuel from its power plants to Russia for reprocessing, and instead
keep the waste in domestic storage containers, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   Russia, which provides Ukraine with fuel rods for its nuclear
plants, reportedly is planning to raise its tariffs for the
transportation, reprocessing and storage of spent Ukrainian fuel
starting next year.
	   Currently, Russia charges Ukraine dlrs 280 per kilogram (2.2
pounds) of uranium, about one-half of what it charges Hungary for
similar services, Nur Nigmatullyn, chief of Ukraine's state
Energoatom company, said Tuesday.
	   This year, Ukraine will have to pay Russia dlrs 83.2 million for
handling spent nuclear fuel. So far, dlrs 45.5 million has been
paid, Nigmatullyn said in comments carried by the independent
Ukrainian News and UNIAN news agencies.
	   If Russia raises the tariffs, it would make more sense for
Ukraine to keep spent fuel in special containers at nuclear power
plants, where storage costs are dlrs 30 to dlrs 40 per kilogram,
Nigmatullyn noted.
	   Three such containers, designed by the U.S. companies Duc
Engineering and Services and Sierra Nuclear, are presently being
constructed at Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, Ukrainian
News said.
	   A total of 380 containers are eventually planned, each capable
of holding 24 fuel rods for as long as 50 years. Ukraine needs to
dispose of some 600 fuel rods a year, according to Ukrainian News.
	   In Moscow, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Ministry said
Ukraine is not obliged to return spent fuel, a potential source of
materials for nuclear weapons.
	   New Russian environmental protection laws heavily restrict
Moscow in the lucrative but dangerous nuclear fuel reprocessing
business. Russia can carry out existing contracts or conclude new
deals that will require Cabinet approval, he said.

JERUSALEM: the agreement.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Netanyahu of seizing
a pretext in order to dismantle the accord before it has begun.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) is inventing new agreements. He does not want
to honor anything,'' an angry Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will created
during last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in
Maryland has dissipated and that the United States will be called
in as a referee throughout the implementation process.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region on
Thursday to oversee implementation.
	   At issue in the latest dispute is Israel's demand to receive
written U.S. guarantees that the Palestinians will arrest 30
Palestinians, most of them suspects in the killings of Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan acknowledged that during the Wye negotiations, the two
sides settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would
arrest the 30 suspects. However, he said Israel believed it would
receive written assurances on the issue from the United States
before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would only convene his
Cabinet at 1:30 p.m. (1130 gmt), as tentatively scheduled, once he
he had the U.S. guarantees in hand. Minutes before the meeting was
to begin, Bar-Illan said it had been postponed indefinitely.
	   Asked by Israel radio if he was creating a crisis over a minor
issue, Netanyahu said: ``I just want to establish the principle ...
We are not reopening the agreement. We are insisting that the
agreement be honored to the letter.''
	   Netanyahu also said that he would not put up with Palestinian
violations of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he said.
``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''
	   Commenting on the confusion that has accompanied the first days
of the agreement, Israeli journalist Hemi Shalev wrote in the
Maariv daily: ``There were many in Israel who expected a moving
drama and others who expected a horrible tragedy, but no one
thought that this `historic' week would of all things be a comedy
of errors.''

European defense ministers united against Iraqi defiance
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Claiming Europe's united backing,
Britain's defense minister demanded Wednesday that Iraq back down
from its defiance of U.N. weapons inspections or ``face the
consequences.''
	   George Robertson, speaking at a one-day gathering of European
Union defense ministers, said the 15 ministers had ``one voice'' in
demanding that Iraq resume cooperating with weapons inspectors.
	   ``There is one signal to Baghdad: that compliance with the U.N.
is the only alternative for Saddam Hussein at this time,''
Robertson told reporters after speaking to the conference.
	   Allowing Saddam to ignore U.N. Security Council resolutions
would set a dangerous precedent, he said, insisting on full
compliance.
	   ``If that does not happen, then Saddam must face the
consequences,'' he said.
	   The defense ministers met to discuss how their 15 member states
can act more swiftly and effectively in future European conflicts
like the ones that have ravaged Bosnia and Kosovo.
	   Britain has taken the lead in urging that the EU take a bigger
defense role without having to rely on U.S.-led NATO. Prime
Minister Tony Blair said last month that the union needs ``fresh
thinking'' about developing a defense capability.
	   ``We don't intend to undermine NATO, or to duplicate it, because
NATO exists and is a cornerstone, the foundation stone of the
European state,'' Robertson said. ``Nor is there any appetite for a
single European army.
	   ``But there is a desire to make sure that Europe can be what it
wants to be: effective, efficient and able to deal with the sort of
crises that can come in the future.'
	   Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend of Austria, which holds the
rotating EU presidency, said Europe must draw lessons for the
future from the disasters in Bosnia and Kosovo.
	   ``We Europeans simply have to be willing and able to get to
grips with European crises and conflicts, if necessary also by our
own efforts _ before hundreds of thousands of people have been
killed and millions have been driven from their homes,'' he told
the ministers.

 &UR; Eds: Gullikson returning as captain of U.S. Davis Cup Team &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WHITE PLAINS, New York (AP) _ Tom Gullikson is coming back as
captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team.
	   Gullikson, who has been captain since 1994, was reappointed
Tuesday for 1999. He led the American squad to the title in 1995
when it beat Russia, and into the finals last year when it was
beaten by Sweden. This year, the team made it into the semifinals
before being eliminated by Italy in a surprise.
	   Gullikson's overall record as Davis Cup coach is 12-4.
	   ``The U.S. is like the New York Yankees of Davis Cup tennis,''
he said. ``We have the talent to make a major impact next year.''
	   A major reason for the loss to Italy was the absence of Pete
Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and Jim Courier.
	   John McEnroe recently offered one reason he would never take
Gullikson's job: ``I guess I'd have to get on my knees and beg
Sampras to play. I can't imagine bending that low.''

One Indonesian soldier killed in disputed East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Suspected guerrillas shot and killed a
soldier and wounded one government worker in the disputed territory
of East Timor, the military said Wednesday.
	   Armed men stopped a bus carrying the victims Tuesday near
Baucau, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dili, the capital of the
former Portuguese colony, said Col. Supadi, military chief of staff
in East Timor.
	   The attack was the latest in a long-running rebel war that broke
out when Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975. Separatist forces
want a referendum on independence, but Jakarta is unwilling to
relinquish sovereignty, offering instead a measure of autonomy.
	   The Indonesian military, meanwhile, denied that it had secretly
replaced troops who pulled out of East Timor in a gesture designed
to promote peace talks.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto also denied recent allegations that
the number of Indonesian troops in East Timor is 21,000. The
government has said there are 15,000 soldiers, one-third of them
involved in humanitarian work.
	   ``Now there is an uproar that ... a small troop withdrawal was
replaced by a bigger batch. That is not true,'' the official Antara
news agency quoted Wiranto as saying.
	   ``There is no increase of troops at all,'' he said. ``What is
happening is a gradual reduction and that is what we have done.''
	   Indonesia is currently engaged in peace talks with Portugal, the
former colonial master of the disputed territory. The United
Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule in East Timor.
	   Meanwhile, Lt. Gen. Mohammad Yunus Yosfiah, currently the
information minister, denied involvement in the slayings of five
foreign journalists in East Timor in 1975.
	   Yosfiah was a commanding officer in East Timor when the two
Britons, two Australians and one New Zealander were killed. Last
month, Australian television alleged he was involved.
	   ``I never met the five victims and never saw them anywhere in
East Timor when I was stationed there,'' Yosfiah said.

Plan to ease EU ban on British beef exports is blocked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Veterinary officials from five European
Union countries on Wednesday blocked a plan to significantly ease
the 1996 EU ban on British beef exports, an EU official said.
	   Veterinary officials from Germany, France, Spain, Italy and
Austria opposed a plan to allow the export of beef from British
cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996, the official said.
	   The plan, put forward by the EU Commission in June, will now go
to EU farms ministers, who meet Nov. 23-24.
	   Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely said the Commission will ask
for a decision by the farm ministers at that meeting.

UEFA confirms Yugoslavia-Ireland match in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ A European Championship qualifying
match between Yugoslavia and Ireland will go ahead in Belgrade Nov.
18, UEFA confirmed Wednesday.
	   Originally scheduled for Oct. 10 in Belgrade, it was postponed
by UEFA because of the threat of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
	   ``Following the recent political developments in Yugoslavia,''
the game can be played at Red Star Belgrade's stadium, the European
governing body said in a statement.
	   The Irish soccer association said Tuesday the match was on for
Belgrade.
	   UEFA said another qualifier between Albania and Greece,
postponed to Nov. 18 because of political turmoil in Albania, can
go ahead in the country as the political situation there ``is now
more relaxed.''
	   The venue for that match will be confirmed by the end of the
week, it said.

Last two Singapore major banks cut prime lending rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The last of Singapore's four major banks
announced cuts in their prime lending rates Wednesday in the third
round of such reductions recently, and market watchers said they
expect further cuts to follow.
	   Both Overseas Union Bank and Oversea-Chinese Bank Corp. cut the
rate they charge their best customers to 6.5 percent from 7
percent, following identical moves by United Overseas Bank and
Development Bank of Singapore earlier in the week.
	   The credit easing, which began in early September, has slashed a
total of 1 percentage point from the prime rate and is expected to
aid local businesses and retail customers in need of capital.
	   Singapore's stock market has reacted jubilantly to the latest
round of cuts, with the benchmark Straits Times Index rising 3
percent Wednesday, breaching the pyschologically important
1,300-point level.

	   Bar-Illan acknowledged that during the Mideast negotiations, the
two sides settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would
arrest the 30 suspects. However, he said Israel believed it would
receive written assurances on the issue from the United States
before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would only convene his
Cabinet at 1:30 p.m. (1130 gmt), as tentatively scheduled, once he
he had the U.S. guarantees in hand. Minutes before the meeting was
to begin, Bar-Illan said it had been postponed indefinitely.

violations of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he said.
``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''
	   Commenting on the confusion that has accompanied the first days
of the agreement, Israeli journalist Hemi Shalev wrote in the
Maariv daily: ``There were many in Israel who expected a moving
drama and others who expected a horrible tragedy, but no one
thought that this `historic' week would of all things be a comedy
of errors.''

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu postponed a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that was
to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the ministers would
not be convened until Israel receives guarantees from the United
States that 30 Palestinian fugitives will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the original 12-week time table, which
was to go into effect on Monday.
	   As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16.
	   Netanyahu has said implementation would not begin until the
agreement is approved by the Cabinet and by Israel's parliament.
	   The decision to postpone the Cabinet session also was likely to
increase friction between the Netanyahu government and the United
States, which has said the Palestinians have lived up to their
obligations and have presented a satisfactory anti-terror plan.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said U.S. officials were ``astounded''
by what they considered an Israeli attempt to change the agreement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Netanyahu of seizing
a pretext in order to dismantle the accord before it has begun.
	   ``He is inventing new agreements. He does not want to honor
anything,'' an angry Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will created
during last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in
Maryland has dissipated, and the United States will probably be
called in as a referee throughout the implementation process.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region
Thursday to oversee implementation.
	   At issue in the latest dispute is Israel's demand to receive
written U.S. guarantees that the Palestinians will arrest 30
Palestinians, most of them suspects in the killings of Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan acknowledged that during the Wye negotiations, the two
sides settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would
arrest the 30 suspects. However, he said Israel believed it would
receive written assurances on the issue from the United States
before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would only convene his

	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he said.
``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''

he wrote.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Clean-up work continued Wednesday
along the Rhine and Mosel rivers as water levels receded, and
police in North Rhine-Westphalia state reported recovering the body
of a toddler who had fallen into a rain-swollen river over the
weekend.
	   The 2-year-old boy slipped into the fast-moving Holzbach stream
in Overrath, in northwest Germany, Sunday afternoon. Rescue workers
recovered the body Tuesday afternoon downriver at the confluence
with a small river.
	   Firefighters in Koblenz, where the Mosel meets the Rhine, were
finishing clearing the streets of mud left behind by receding flood
waters.
	   Ship traffic on the Mosel was still suspended, while
restrictions on parts of the Rhine were expected to be lifted
entirely by Thursday night.

Hong Kong monetary head urges China to back loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to show that Yam met with China's top
central banker, adding analyst doubts that China will back all the
Itic loans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's monetary chief met with China's top
central banker Wednesday amid reports he was urging the mainland
government to back shaky loans that Hong Kong commercial banks
arranged for a defunct Chinese lending institution.
	   The governor of the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, has
previously only expressed China's willingness to honor loans that
were registered with the appropriate mainland authorities _ a
stance that could put many loans from Hong Kong in jeopardy.
	   One prominent analyst suggested that the high-level lobbying by
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
would likely come up short, although neither the mainland Chinese
nor the Hong Kong bankers made any immediate public comment on
their talks.
	   ``I don't think the Chinese government is in a position to pay
off everybody,'' said Andy Xie, an economist who follows China for
Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd.
	   Any guarantee of foreign loans made to the failed Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., or other troubled
``Itics,'' as the provincial Chinese non-bank lenders are known, is
a delicate issue under discussion by top officials from Hong Kong
and Beijing.
	   Much of the foreign lending was set up through Hong Kong
subsidiaries of the Itics and not legally registered in China,
bypassing the mainland's rules for disclosure and loan guarantees.
	   Yam led a delegation of 17 top Hong Kong bankers to Beijing
beginning Tuesday, reportedly to seek assurances that bad loans at
the Guangdong lender, known as ``Gitic,'' won't become too much of
a problem for Hong Kong banks.
	   Yam reportedly has argued that China should recognize the
validity of the loans if they were made properly in Hong Kong _
despite any lack of registration in China.
	   Yam cited China's ``one country, two systems'' policy, which
allows for conflicting laws to exist in Hong Kong and the mainland
following Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese sovereignty
last year, according to the respected Hong Kong Economic Journal.
	   Yam met Wednesday with Dai, after a reported session Tuesday
with Liao Hui, China's top official handling dealings with Hong
Kong.
	   When Gitic was closed last month, Hong Kong bankers became
worried about problem loans emerging at other Chinese Itics. Many
are saddled with billions of dollars of debt that may be difficult
to repay. Gitic alone reportedly has debts equaling U.S. dlrs 2
billion.
	   The settlement of Gitic's debts will influence how other similar
loans are repaid, Yam has reportedly told mainland officials.
	   People's Bank of China officials said in October that the
central bank would repay at least some creditors, giving priority
to debts registered in China. That left bankers with unregistered
debt wondering whether they have any chance of getting their money
back.
	   The central bank governor, Dai, reiterated this policy in an
interview published Wednesday in Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese-language
Hong Kong daily known for authoritative coverage of mainland
affairs. Dai gave the interview on Oct. 20 _ about two weeks after
Gitic was closed.
	   While the government probably would repay most of Gitic's
registered loans, it would set a bad example for it to pay
unregistered loans, Xie said.
	   While backing the Itic creditors, Yam was quoted by the Hong
Kong Standard as saying banks should be more careful in their
future lending.

Aussie 'keeper signs record 6 1/2-year deal with 'Boro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ Australian goalkeeper Mark
Schwarzer has signed a club record 6 1/2-year contract to stay with
English Premier League side Middlesbrough until 2005.
	   The deal, announced Wednesday, ends speculation linking the
26-year-old Schwarzer with moves to Manchester United and
Liverpool.
	   The former Bradford 'keeper's contract is the longest ever
signed by a Middlesbrough player.
	   ``That shows how highly we rate Mark,'' 'Boro manager Bryan
Robson said. ``We think he can challenge to be one of the best
goalkeepers in the country for years to come. We are delighted Mark
feels that the ambition of the club matches his own. He is a great
asset.''
	   Schwarzer has been capped five times by his country, having
started his European career in Germany with Dynamo Dresden and
Kaiserslautern. He joined 'Boro from Bradford for 1.25 million
pounds (dlrs 2 million) in February 1997.
	   ``I am more than happy at Middlesbrough,'' he said. ``You only
need to see the new training ground to realize the ambition of the
club, and I am looking forward to many successful years here.''

Attackers storm city in northern Tajikistan

 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Bands of armed militants raided a
city in northern Tajikistan early Wednesday, battling government
troops and seizing several buildings in heavy fighting, officials
said.
	   At least 10 government troops were killed, and the attackers
also took some 30 police officers hostage, said Zafar Saidov,
spokesman for President Emomali Rakhmonov.
	   The assailants seized all administrative buildings in the city
of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport,
Saidov said.
	   Despite a 1997 peace agreement that formally ended a civil war,
the former Soviet republic continues to be plagued by outbursts of
violence involving groups that do not recognize the deal.
	   The attackers were led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against Rakhmonov last year and then fled to
neighboring Uzbekistan, authorities said.
	   The president chaired an emergency government session to discuss
the crisis and ordered all troops be put on alert. Russia's 201st
motorized infantry division, deployed in Tajikistan to support the
government, has also been put in combat readiness.
	   The Interfax news agency put the number of attackers at 1,000.
	   Tajikistan's government and mainstream opposition
representatives conferred Wednesday to discuss the situation, it
said. The government demanded the attachers surrender.
	   ``Otherwise, the republic's government reserves the right to use
against them all available means, including complete
annihilation,'' the statement said, according to Interfax.
	   The attackers didn't make any immediate demands.
	   Khudoberdyev broke away from the government after it signed a
peace deal with the mostly Islamic opposition in the summer of
1997.
	   ``The attack is aimed at thwarting the peace process in the
republic,'' Saidov said.
	   The government also blamed Khudoberdyev supporters for staging a
triple bombing in western Tajikistan on Monday night, killing one
man.
	   ``These anti-government forces in Tajikistan have as their
purpose a change of the country's course toward national
reconciliation,'' a government statement said. ``They will stop
neither at terror nor at effectively declaring war own their own
people.''

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Signaling a fresh start in relations between
the two squabbling neighbors, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong will visit Malaysia Thursday and meet with his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad, Goh's office said.
	   The surprise visit by Goh was also confirmed late Wednesday by
the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
capital.
	   Goh's visit to Kuala Lumpur will be the first top-level meeting
between the two countries since their ordinarily testy relations
started to deteriorate rapidly in August.
	   The neighbors have argued over location of a border post, a
cancellation of automatic flyover rights for Singaporean military
aircraft in Malaysian air space, Malaysia's withdrawal from
military exercises, and trading of Malaysian stocks and currencies
in Singapore. Tiny Singapore also imports most of its water from
Malaysia, which suggested the contracts may not be renewed.
	   The strained relations between Singapore and Malaysia have
increased the pressure on the region, already suffering from the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   But in recent days, both leaders have hinted that ties could be
mended.

Prosecutor insists right to investigate in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The chief prosecutor of the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal insisted Wednesday that Yugoslav
authorities are legally bound to let her investigate alleged
atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``There have been numerous allegations specific and credible
enough to require further investigations,'' Louise Arbour of Canada
told reporters.
	   She said the allegations included claims of summary executions,
reprisal killings and the wanton destruction of villages.
	   Arbour is due to lead a team of U.N. investigators to Belgrade
and then into Kosovo on a week-long mission starting Friday.
However, Belgrade authorities still have not issued visas clearing
the way for the visit to the troubled Yugoslav province, Arbour
said Wednesday.
	   Yugoslav ministers have repeatedly asserted that the U.N.
tribunal does not have the authority to carry out investigations in
Kosovo.
	   Last Friday, Yugoslav Justice Minister Zoran Knezevic was quoted
by local media as saying the tribunal ``has no jurisdiction over
Kosovo, not according to any international document.''
	   Knezevic said ``The Hague tribunal has no place in Kosovo,''
because ``conflicts there were caused by terrorist actions of
Kosovo Albanians.''
	   But on Wednesday, Arbour, the tribunal's most senior prosecutor,
once again hammered home the court's assertion that it is legally
empowered to investigate in Kosovo.
	   ``The tribunal has jurisdiction over a wide range of offenses
that may have occurred in Kosovo,'' she said.
	   She cited the 1993 Security Council resolution which set up the
court, giving it a mandate to investigate any breaches of
international humanitarian law anywhere in the former Yugoslavia
since 1991.
	   Arbour declined to say what the tribunal would do if Yugoslav
authorities continue to refuse to issue visas for investigators.
	   ``It is my expectation that visas will be granted because the
law requires that they be granted and that I and my investigators
be granted access,'' Arbour said. ``This is clearly not a matter of
discretion. It is a legal requirement.''
	   Arbour also stressed that the tribunal mission would investigate
alleged atrocities by both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
	   Hundreds of people, Serbs and ethnic Albanians, have been killed
during seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, fled their homes in the province, which is ethnically 90
percent Albanian.

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with U.S. officials now saying
they are seeking clarification on some security issues, quotes from
Palestinian negotiator &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that
was to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the ministers would
not be convened until Israel receives written guarantees from the
United States that 30 Palestinian fugitives will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the 12-week time table that was to go
begin Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due
Nov. 16 _ in exchange for Palestinian security steps.
	   Netanyahu has said implementation would not begin until the
agreement is approved by the Cabinet and by Israel's parliament.
	   The U.S. position in the dispute was not clearcut.
	   U.S. State Department and White House officials said earlier
that the Palestinians have lived up to their obligations, but the
spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Larry Schwartz, said
Wednesday that ``there are some security issues where additional
clarification is being sought.''
	   U.S. officials are discussing the issue with both sides,
Schwartz said, adding that ``we expect that this process will be
completed shortly.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Netanyahu of seizing
a pretext in order to dismantle the accord before it has begun.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) is inventing new agreements. He does not want
to honor anything,'' an angry Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will created
during last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in
Maryland has dissipated and that the United States will be called
in as a referee throughout the implementation process.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region on
Thursday to oversee implementation.
	   At issue in the latest dispute is Israel's demand to receive
written U.S. guarantees that the Palestinians will arrest 30
Palestinians, most of them suspects in the killings of Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said that during the Wye negotiations, the two sides
settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would arrest
the 30 suspects. He said Israel was given to understand that it
would receive written assurances on the arrests from the United
States before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would only convene his
Cabinet at 1:30 p.m. (1130 gmt), as tentatively scheduled, once he
he had the U.S. guarantees in hand. Minutes before the meeting was
to begin, Bar-Illan said it had been postponed indefinitely.
	   However, Bar-Illan said he believed that after two phone
conversations between Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the United States moved closer to the Israeli
position. ``They now understand that this link is missing and
without it we cannot proceed,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Erekat accused the United States of being inconsistent. ``In one
statement, they say the Palestinians honored the agreement. In the
other they say certain sentences must be clarified,'' he said.
	   Asked by Israel radio if he was creating a crisis over a minor
issue, Netanyahu said: ``I just want to establish the principle ...
We are not reopening the agreement. We are insisting that the
agreement be honored to the letter.''
	   Netanyahu also said that he would not put up with Palestinian
violations of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he said.
``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''
	   Commenting on the confusion that has accompanied the first days
of the agreement, Israeli journalist Hemi Shalev wrote in the
Maariv daily: ``There were many in Israel who expected a moving
drama and others who expected a horrible tragedy, but no one
thought that this `historic' week would of all things be a comedy
of errors.''

Britain's highest court to decide on Pinochet arrest

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The crimes committed during Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's rule in Chile, including the murders of children and
torture for its own sake, are beyond legal immunity, lawyers for
British and Spanish prosecutors argued Wednesday.
	   The lawyers spoke at the start of an appeal in Britain's highest
court, the House of Lords, against a ruling last week that the
former dictator's Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was illegal.
	   To the dismay of victims, England's High Court had decreed that
Pinochet, as a foreign former head of state, has immunity from
prosecution for acts committed during his 17-year rule. The present
Chilean government says some 3,000 political opponents were killed
or disappeared during his tenure.
	   ``We invite your lordships' house decisively to reject the
repugnant notion, offensive to all ideas of human rights ... that a
person has immunity from such crimes,'' said Alun Jones, the lawyer
representing a Spanish magistrate, the Spanish government and
British prosecutors.
	   The hearing, expected to last two days, opened Wednesday before
five judges at the House of Lords.
	   Only legal arguments are allowed during the hearing, but human
rights organizations _ including Amnesty International and the
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch _ submitted affidavits arguing that
the High Court was wrong.
	   ``A growing number of states are willing to apply international
law at home,'' wrote Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch executive
director. ``It's high time for Britain to do the same. The House of
Lords needs to be on the right side of history.''
	   With moves under way in seven European countries to extradite
the 82-year-old Pinochet, the judges could decide to quash his
arrest and send him straight home, beyond the reach of outside
prosecution.
	   Legal experts say other extradition moves and the warrant _
issued by a Spanish magistrate investigating human rights abuses
after Pinochet seized power in 1973 _ will become irrelevant if the
House of Lords throws out the arrest.
	   The panel, headed by Lord Justice Gordon Slynn of Hadley, was
not expected to rule immediately after the hearing.
	   If Pinochet does fly home _ in the special medically equipped
jet waiting at an air base north of London _ it could be to more
trouble.
	   In Chile on Tuesday, a coalition of center-left parties that
support President Eduardo Frei appointed a legal panel to examine
the possibility of Pinochet standing trial in his native land. As a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, he has so far had
immunity from prosecution in Chile.
	   Chilean senators also said they will seek a constitutional
amendment allowing members of congress to resign their seats. The
constitution now bans lawmakers from quitting. The move appeared a
clear invitation to Pinochet to leave politics once he returns
home, as suggested by the government.
	   France and Switzerland also want to extradite Pinochet, and
Chilean exiles in Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed
criminal complaints they hope will lead to extradition.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested while
recuperating from back surgery at a central London hospital. A
British judge granted him bail Oct. 30 and he was moved to another
hospital, Grovelands Priory in north London, but remains under
police guard.

US Defense Secretary Cohen arrives in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
lobbied Gulf states Wednesday for support of possible military
action against Iraq but _ at least publicly _ he appeared to be
winning little backing.
	   On Tuesday, after Cohen arrived in the Gulf, a Saudi Arabian
government official said the kingdom could not be used for a strike
against Iraq, and a Kuwaiti spokesman said the emirate was not
involved in the U.N.-Iraq dispute.
	   Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with disarmament
monitors has been condemned by the U.N. Security Council as a
``flagrant violation'' of the country's agreements with the world
body.
	   Cohen arrived in Bahrain late Wednesday for talks with its
government, the official Gulf News Agency said. Earlier in the day
he had talks with Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and
the crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said in Kuwait.
	   On Tuesday, Cohen began his tour with talks with King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia. There have been different accounts of what
transpired.
	   The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi official _
speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told the
defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for
attacks on Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the world body over
weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states
in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   But on Tuesday night, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry
said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between the
United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack on Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they
were privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that
Cohen was actually told that Arab leaders would support an attack
on Iraq only if it was guaranteed to remove President Saddam
Hussein.
	   Several thousand U.S. troops and their weapons are positioned in
Kuwait under a 10-year defense pact that Kuwait signed with
Washington after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation.

Parma 5-1 favorites for UEFA Cup title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Parma was listed as 5-1 favorite to win the UEFA
Cup after advancing to the third round with a 3-2 aggregate victory
over Polish side Wisla Krakow.
	   British bookmakers Ladbrokes on Wednesday installed another
Italian club, Roma, as second favorite at 6-1. Roma advanced 1-0 on
aggregate after Tuesday night's goalless draw at Leeds.
	   Atletico Madrid, which beat CSKA Sofia 1-0 to advance 5-2 on
aggregate, is next at 7-1.
	   Fiorentina, whose match against Grasshoppers of Switzerland was
abandoned after an off-field official was injured by the explosion
of a device hurled from the stands in Salerno, was provisionally
listed at 7-1. UEFA said it will decide by next Monday how to deal
with the incident.
	   Other odds: Marseille and Monaco (8-1), Liverpool (10-1),
Bologna and Bordeaux (14-1), Celta Vigo and Glasgow Rangers (20-1).

European Union would consider aiding Indonesian election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The European Union will help Indonesia
conduct the first elections of the post-Suharto era next year if
asked, an EU official said Wednesday.
	   ``We will react positively if Indonesia asks us for help,''
Georg Znidaric, the Austrian ambassador to Thailand, told
journalists at an EU briefing. ``Political peace leads to economic
prosperity.''
	   Austria currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has called elections under
pressure to open the country to more democracy after Suharto, faced
with violent protests fueled by a crashing economy, resigned this
year as Asia's longest-serving leader.
	   Znidaric noted that the EU was the main financial contributor,
donating about dlrs 11 million, to Cambodia's elections in July and
sent a large contingent of observers.
	   The EU's efforts were criticized in some quarters for appearing
to ignore allegations of violence and tampering by strongman Hun
Sen, the victor.
	   But EU officials have maintained that the election, even if
flawed, marked an important step forward for Cambodian democracy.
	   ``What would have been an alternative to what we have done?''
Znidaric said. ``I think the EU decision to step in was the right
one.''
	   Cambodia's rival political parties have been unable to form a
government. Znidaric said the EU was looking forward to helping the
country with economic assistance once the deadlock is sorted out.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian shares continued their strong runs
Wednesday, with blue chips in the top three markets _ Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Singapore _ finishing sharply higher amid perceptions that
the recent rallies can be sustained. Foreign investors leaped into
the Tokyo market after an influential Wall Street strategist said
Japanese stocks were undervalued. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average soared 575.06 points, or 4.12 percent, closing at
14,527.81 _ its highest finish since Sept. 10. Meanwhile, the U.S.
dollar bought 116.64 yen in the late afternoon, higher than
Tuesday's level of 115.33 yen in New York. In Singapore, the key
Straits Times Index closed 3 percent higher at 1,301.05, climbing
above the psychologically important 1,300-point level. In Hong
Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index higher gained 149.73 points, or
1.4 percent, to 10,508.25, its highest finish since May 6. In
Indonesia, speculative buying of blue chips sent the key JSX Index
surging 4.2 percent to 330.46. But in the Philippines, a streak of
gains in the key PSE index finally snapped in what traders called a
technical correction. The index fell 4.9 percent to 1,714.09.

	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with depleting fish stocks and alarmed by the
potential damage to their economies, more than 80 nations have
approved a voluntary agreement to limit fishing worldwide. Under
the accord, nations also pledged to protect sharks and seabirds
from being accidentally caught in nets. The document was adopted
Tuesday at a weeklong conference at the Rome-based Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and has been
submitted to the agency's fishing committee for final approval,
expected in February. ``In most cases, the greatest risk is not the
extinction of fish species but the extinction of economies,'' said
Serge Garcia, director of FAO's Fisheries Resources Division. The
world ocean catch is valued at about dlrs 80 billion a year, and
fish farming adds another dlrs 42 billion. Fisheries employ about
200 million people worldwide. Garcia said that too many fish are
being caught every year, preventing many species from reaching
reproduction age and causing the number of fish in the ocean to
drop. (UN-SAVING FISH)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Three state-run banks took over a troubled
finance company Wednesday as the Taiwanese government pledged help
to businesses facing difficulties in the economic slowdown. The
banks will manage Central Bills Finance Co. for six months in an
attempt to resolve serious cash-flow problems, Vice Finance
Minister Sean Chen said. ``The main problem now is to restore
investor confidence and stabilize the money market,'' Chen told a
news conference. Investor confidence seemed in short supply
Wednesday, as the share price of four companies damaged by a busted
stock purchase plunged 7 percent, dropping by the maximum amount
allowed under Taiwanese securities law for the second day in a row.
All of the troubles helped push Taiwan blue chip shares down by
another 2 percent, following similar losses in Tuesday's dealings.
(TAIWAN-BUSINESS TROUBLES)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's monetary chief met with China's top
central banker Wednesday amid reports he was urging the mainland
government to back shaky loans that Hong Kong commercial banks
arranged for a defunct Chinese lending institution. The governor of
the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, has previously only
expressed China's willingness to honor loans that were registered
with the appropriate mainland authorities _ a stance that could put
many loans from Hong Kong in jeopardy. Any guarantee of foreign
loans made to the failed Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Corp., or other troubled ``Itics,'' as the provincial
Chinese nonbank lenders are known, is a delicate issue under
discussion by top officials from Hong Kong and Beijing. Much of the
foreign lending was set up through Hong Kong subsidiaries of the
Itics and not legally registered in China, bypassing the mainland's
rules for disclosure and loan guarantees. (HONG KONG-CHINA-BANKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Latin America has hit economic bottom and is
ripe for reinvestment, according to an investment report by a
Citigroup subsidiary. ``For the first time in quite a while we are
recommending buying into a rally instead of selling in Latin
fixed-income markets,'' said the report by the fixed-income
research group at Citibank. The report was being released late
Tuesday. United States investors have been wary about Latin America
since mid-summer, when huge economic problems came to light in
Japan, the rest of Asia and Russia. Venezuela is already in
recession and several other countries including Brazil are
vulnerable. Investors worried that it was a short hop from problems
in Latin America to serious economic trouble in the United States.
But Citibank changed its own opinion on Latin America after support
for an International Monetary Fund plan to provide loans to
countries before foreign investors begin fleeing and after seeing
Brazil's proposed austerity plan that the country hopes will enable
it to receive a dlrs 30 billion aid package from the IMF. (US-LATIN

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Republicans retained control of both Houses of
Congress Wednesday, but surprise Democratic victories gave comfort
to President Bill Clinton as he faced the threat of impeachment.
Democratic victories held Republicans to their 55-45 Senate
majority. Clinton's party won or led enough House races during vote
tallying Wednesday morning to cut the Republican majority to 12,
down from 22. Democrats scored major Senate election victories in
New York and California but the first black woman senator lost her
seat in Illinois. Democrats also captured the governorship of
long-Republican California, and the southern states of Alabama and
South Carolina. In Hawaii, incumbent Democrat Ben Cayatano, the
country's highest-ranking Filipino-American officeholder, won by a
razor-thin margin. A possible 2000 presidential contender, George
W. Bush, easily won re-election as governor of Texas, while another
son of former President George Bush, Jeb, won his second try at
becoming governor of Florida. (US-ELECTION ROUNDUP)
	   TRUJILLO, Honduras (AP) _ With 7,000 people feared dead in
Honduras alone, rescue workers warned that many more will die of
starvation or illness if the country's shattered bridges and
washed-out roads are not quickly rebuilt. Hurricane Mitch, which
killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America, has
turned Honduras' largest cities into virtual islands accessible
only by air. Transportation also remains difficult across
neighboring Nicaragua, where despair over the lack of food and
water prompted a crowd to hurl insults at their president Tuesday.
Rural communities are even more isolated; many have had no
communication with the outside world since the storm began nearly a
week ago. With fuel in short supply, few areas can keep power
plants running _ and that means no electricity for water pumps.
Floods and mudslides caused by Mitch were blamed for deaths across
a broad, 500-mile (805 kilometers) corridor from Nicaragua into
southern Mexico, from Honduras' Atlantic Coast to the Pacific.
(MITCH)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Officials warned U.S. citizens overseas of
possible anti-American violence as Defense Secretary William Cohen
sought support from Gulf allies for any military action against
Iraq. Cohen met Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah on
Tuesday before heading on to Kuwait Wednesday, and there were
conflicting reports on what success he had in gaining Saudi
cooperation in the event of an attack on Iraq. A Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told The Associated Press that Cohen that Fahd
pledged the kingdom would continue ``to support U.S. efforts to
preserve regional security and stability.'' But a Saudi official in
Riyadh, insisting on anonymity, said the king said he wouldn't
approve using territories as a springboard for attacks on Iraq if
Washington decided to attack, over Iraq's refusal to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors. (US-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu postponed a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that was
to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the ministers would not
be convened until Israel receives guarantees from the United States
that 30 Palestinian fugitives will be arrested. The new delay makes
it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the Palestinians will
stick to the original 12-week timetable, which was to go into
effect Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank. The decision to postpone the Cabinet
session also was likely to increase friction between Netanyahu's
government and the United States, which has said the Palestinians
have lived up to their obligations and have presented a
satisfactory antiterror plan. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ With moves under way in seven European countries
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court will
decide whether to quash his arrest at a London hospital and send
the former Chilean dictator straight home. Five judges, sitting
round a horseshoe shaped table in a committee room at the House of
Lords, will start hearing an appeal by British prosecutors on
Wednesday against a High Court ruling last week that Pinochet's
Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was illegal. To the dismay of
victims, the High Court said that Pinochet, as a foreign former
head of state, has immunity from prosecution for acts committed
during his 17-year rule. The present Chilean government says some
3,000 political opponents were killed or disappeared. The hearing
on whether the 82-year-old general should be extradited to face
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping was scheduled to last two
days. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbs were wounded after their
car was raked with gunfire by separatist ethnic Albanians, police
said Wednesday. The violence highlighted Kosovo's continuing
potential for bloodshed despite last month's peace agreement.
	   Serb police at a checkpoint near Sipitula, about 15 kilometers
(nine miles) west of Pristina, said Albanian guerrillas opened fire
on two vehicles from the nearby Belacevac coal mine Tuesday
evening.
	   They said an ensuing gunfight between police and the attackers
lasted an hour.
	   Three miners in one of the cars were injured and taken to
Pristina hospital, according to police. The cars, still sitting at
the checkpoint Wednesday morning, had several bullet holes or marks
in the windshields and chassis.
	   Villagers said Serb police began shooting at the village at
about the same time police said the gunfight began. The villagers
said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or homes of
friends and relatives.
	   A few who returned Wednesday morning said police routinely
attack the village and force them to flee.
	   ``They aren't withdrawing their forces'' as called for in the
Oct. 12 agreement, complained one man, Fatmme Mjeku.
	   In the Netherlands, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal locked horns with the Yugoslav government over the
tribunal's jurisdiction in Kosovo.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in The Hague that her court
has been given U.N. authority to investigate war crimes in any part
of Yugoslavia. She was responding to assertions by Yugoslav
government officials that Kosovo is off limits to tribunal
investigations.
	   Arbour said Yugoslav authorities still not have issued visas for
a week-long tribune mission to Belgrade and Kosovo, scheduled to
start Friday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's

suspended a nearly eight-month crackdown in the province that left
hundreds dead _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of
thousands others homeless.

French justice minister says Pinochet should not go unpunished
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's justice minister said Wednesday she would
not hesitate to ask for the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
saying the former Chilean dictator's crimes ``should not go
unpunished.''
	   Elisabeth Guigou said she will ``immediately'' ask for
Pinochet's extradition if, as expected, she receives a request to
do so from a judge handling the cases of three French citizens who
disappeared after Pinochet took power in 1973.
	   A French court on Tuesday sent a temporary arrest warrant for
Pinochet to British authorities, accusing him of ``sequestration
followed by torture.''
	   It was the final step necessary before France can officially ask
for his extradition.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested on a Spanish warrant in a central
London hospital Oct. 16 after undergoing back surgery. He has been
granted bail, but remains under police guard at another hospital in
north London.
	   Five judges at the House of Lords will start hearing an appeal
Wednesday by British prosecutors arguing against last week's High
Court ruling that his arrest was illegal.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.

Official: Almost 10,000 businesses privatized in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine has privatized almost 10,000 large
and medium-sized businesses since launching a 1992 drive to put
state enterprises in private hands, an official said Wednesday.
	   Throughout the first nine months of the year, 1,481 state-run
businesses and other properties were privatized, said Yuriy
Gryshan, deputy chief of the State Property Fund.
	   Gryshan, whose fund is in charge of privatization, said regional
authorities have often been slow in preparing state properties for
privatization, according to the independent Ukrainian News and
UNIAN news services.
	   Privatization efforts in the former Soviet republic have moved
relatively slowly, and were complicated this year by the economic
crisis in Russia and the exodus of foreign investors from Ukraine's
own shaky financial market.
	   The State Property Fund has raised only about one-third of the 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million) the government expected from
privatization this year, and is expected to provide only half of
the sum by the end of 1998, officials say.
	   Gryshan also lashed out at the opposition-dominated parliament,
where Communists and other leftists have sought to halt
privatization efforts. The parliament, or Verkhovna Rada, may
debate a moratorium on privatization Thursday.
	   Such a moratorium could have harsh consequences for Ukraine,
cutting off a planned source of revenue for the government and
undermining investors, Gryshan said.
	   He vowed, however, that the government would step up
privatization efforts. Ukraine made the pledge to the International
Monetary Fund in negotiating a dlrs 2.2 billion loan.

Arafat meets king for talks on new peace accord with Israel

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with
King Juan Carlos in Madrid on Wednesday for talks on the new
land-for-security agreement he signed with Israel.
	   Arafat who arived late Tuesday, was to meet Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes later in the day.
	   The Palestinian leader was invited to Spain by Matutes, who was
present when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
signed the peace agreement Oct. 23 in Maryland.
	   The Wye Plantation accord calls on Israel to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on Moslem extremists who oppose peace with
Israel.
	   But Israel said Tuesday it would not carry out the agreement
until it gets assurances that the Palestinian Authority headed by
Arafat will arrest 30 Palestinian fugitives.

EU clears Texaco-Chevron venture; Sees no competition problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission gave the
go-ahead Wednesday to a joint venture of Texaco and Chevron saying
the move posed no threat to fair competition in the European Union.
	   Creation of Fuel and Marine Marketing LLC, ``did not give rise
to any competition concerns (and is) compatible with the common
market'' across the 15 EU states, the Commission said in a
statement.
	   Although the two companies are American corporations they
require EU approval to do business in Europe. Under EU law, the
European Commission can reject joint ventures, mergers and other
corporate undertakings if it finds these violate EU fair trade
laws.
	   Texaco will hold 69 percent and Chevron 31 percent of the shares
in Fuel and Marine Marketing LLC which will handle the Texaco and
Chevron activities in producing and distributing marine lubricants
and residual fuels.
	   Texaco and Chevron notified the European Commission of their
joint venture plans on Sept. 29.

Germany reports terrorist threat against U.S. embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German police raided offices near Bonn
after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S.
Embassy, but no arrests were made, officials said Wednesday.
	   Police checked several suspects during the raid at a mall
outside Bonn on Tuesday but found no evidence they were planning an
attack, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office in Karlsruhe.
	   The agency's probe into the reported threat is continuing, she
said.
	   ``We had indications that an attack was being planned,'' she
said. She refused to elaborate.
	   Further details were not immediately available. The U.S. Embassy
in Bonn had no comment.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi
dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those
attacks.
	   A suspected top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is
jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request, raising
concern about reprisals on German soil.
	   U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm
members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   In September, German police stepped up security at the U.S.
consulate in Hamburg after receiving a tip about a possible threat.

Republicans fail to win impeachment mandate from voters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now Republicans face the dilemma of how to
deal with impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton
that most voters don't want, after elections that broke the
patterns of history in favor of Democrats.
	   The White House said Clinton was encouraged by the midterm
elections in which Democrats held their lines and may yet add a
seat or two to their congressional minorities.
	   The president may also be relieved.
	   The impeachment momentum could be slowed by the balloting that
rebuffed Republican expectations of midterm gains _ even though a
majority of voters interviewed outside polls said the Monica
Lewinsky matter didn't affect their decisions.
	   Republican reinforcements in the House would have added impetus
to the impeachment proceedings. But none were coming.
	   And 61 percent of voters in exit polling Tuesday said they
disapproved of the way Republicans in Congress have handled the
Lewinsky scandal, with almost as many saying impeachment should be
dropped.
	   With the better-than-even break the Democrats won, the
atmosphere has changed, just as the impeachment investigation is
about to begin. There's no detailed program yet. Hearings are
expected to open the week after next in the House Judiciary
Committee. Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman, has set a goal but no
guarantee of finishing by year's end.
	   Democrats gained most of the upsets and high-visibility
takeovers in the House, Senate and state elections. Overall, the 34
Senate elections apparently produced a standstill, a Republican
majority of 55 seats to 45 Democrats.
	   With a handful of House contests to be settled, the trend
pointed to a small gain for the Democrats, something that hasn't
happened for the president's party at midterm since 1934.
	   In non-presidential, midterm elections since World War II, the
White House party has absorbed an average of 27 seats lost in the
House, four in the Senate. And this time there was the added
handicap of the Clinton sex scandal, his admitted lies and the
impeachment investigation.
	   Democratic leaders read the results as evidence that people want
the impeachment process settled.
	   ``I think it's got to take some of the steam out of it,'' said
Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader.
	   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said
impeachment should be handled expeditiously now, settled in this
Congress before the newly elected one takes over next year. Vice
President Al Gore said that was the message of Democratic successes
in the elections.
	   And there were sure to be Democratic suggestions that the
outcome is grounds enough to settle short of impeachment, perhaps
on censure or rebuke.
	   The next move is up to Republicans. They've got their own
problems, heard in conservative complaints about the congressional
leadership that settled with Clinton on a budget the party's right
wing called a cave-in. Those same conservatives are insistent on
impeachment; they want the full case pressed against Clinton.
	   Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, early and ardent for impeachment, said
the election returns won't deter him. Barr, who sits on the
Judiciary Committee, said he'll keep doing what he's been doing _
pressing the case against Clinton.
	   Republican leaders once had talked of major gains in Congress;
they wound up claiming success in having held control. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said it was the first time in 70 years
Republicans had held control for a third straight Congress, and
that should be considered ``a fairly big deal.''
	   But not a big enough deal to silence his critics on the right.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Signaling a fresh start in relations between
the two squabbling neighbors, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong will visit Malaysia Thursday and meet with his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad, Goh's office said.
	   The surprise visit by Goh was also confirmed by the Singapore
High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.
	   The one-day visit was initiated at Mahathir's invitation, Goh's
office said in a statement late Wednesday.
	   Goh's visit to Kuala Lumpur will be the first top-level meeting
between the two countries since their ordinarily testy relations
started to deteriorate rapidly in August.
	   The neighbors have argued over location of a border post, a
cancellation of automatic flyover rights for Singaporean military
aircraft in Malaysian air space, Malaysia's withdrawal from
military exercises, and trading of Malaysian stocks and currencies
in Singapore. Tiny Singapore also imports most of its water from
Malaysia, which suggested the contracts may not be renewed.
	   The strained relations between Singapore and Malaysia have
increased the pressure on the region, already suffering from the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   But in recent days, both leaders have hinted that ties could be
mended.

Robber ties up wife of Hong Kong bank boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A lone thief climbed into the home of a top
Hong Kong banker while he was away on business, tied up his wife
and made off with 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12,800) in
jewelry and cash early Wednesday, police said.
	   Police were searching for the man who threatened the woman,
identified by her husband's bank as Anthea Strickland, before tying
her up with an electrical wire, shutting her in a bathroom and
stealing a diamond ring, a gold necklace, cash and credit cards.
	   Mrs. Strickland freed herself after the thief left and pressed
the security alarm to notify police. Her husband is John
Strickland, the chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
Ltd.
	   The robbery at the Strickland home in Hong Kong's exclusive Peak
neighborhood is the latest in a spate of crimes against Hong Kong's
rich.
	   In March, three thieves tied up another woman and stole 6
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 770,000) in cash and jewelry
from her mansion. The alleged kidnappings of two prominent Hong
Kong tycoons also featured prominently in a mobster trial across
the border in mainland China.

France distances itself from NATO officer accused of aiding Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in grafs 5-7 with context, in 9th with Le Monde saying
Bunel passed secrets to Yugoslav diplomat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French officials on Wednesday sought to distance
themselves from a French officer accused of supplying sensitive
information on planned NATO airstrikes to Serbs during the October
standoff over Kosovo.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, in an interview with LCI
television, said the matter was ``extremely regrettable'' but ``in
no way'' would harm France's role in the NATO alliance.
	   ``What happened is in no way linked to our policies which are
totally clear,'' Vedrine said. ``And our partners are well aware of
that.''
	   Pierre Bunel, a 46-year-old French army official posted in
Brussels, was arrested last week and faces 15 years in jail for
supplying ``intelligence to a foreign power.''
	   It was the second incident this year involving a French officer
allegedly compromising NATO activities in the former Yugoslavia.
	   French authorities earlier this year recalled Maj. Herve
Gourmelon from duty in Bosnia following reports his contacts with
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic led NATO to abort a mission to
arrest Karadzic so he be tried at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
in The Hague.
	   The French government long has been considered by its Western
allies of being sympathetic to the Serbs. It is a relationship
dating back to World War I when France along with Britain helped
set up an independent Yugoslavia after the Ottoman Empire
collapsed.
	   Judicial sources in France, who requested anonymity, said Bunel
allegedly gave Serbian officials a list of areas that NATO was
targeting for airstrikes. He has been placed under formal
investigation _ one step short of being charged.
	   The Le Monde daily reported Wednesday that Bunel had met four
times between July and October with Jovan Milanovic, a Yugoslav
diplomat stationed in Brussels who also worked for Yugoslav
intelligence and allegedly received the secret NATO list of
targets.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
respect an Oct. 12 agreement to withdraw police and military forces
in Kosovo to levels before a February crackdown on Albanian
separatists.
	   Vedrine said Wednesday ``at first glance'' it seemed Bunel
hadn't given away important information.
	   The newspaper Liberation cited unidentified French diplomats as
saying Bunel would not have had a target list at his disposal.
	   Former U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Philippe Morillon,
said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien that the affair
was ``fortunately an exception.''
	   ``It would be awful if an act of treason like this were to lead
the public to doubt for a second the loyalty of all our soldiers to
their missions in Yugoslavia,'' Morillon was quoted as saying.
	   ``If this officer is guilty he will be punished. But for the
others, there's no cause for unease.''

Report: Terrorist suspect visited Albania in 1994
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, sought
by the United States for two deadly embassy bombings, met with
Albanian officials in April 1994 as a member of a Saudi Arabian
delegation, local media reported Wednesday.
	   The daily ``Gazeta Shqiptare'' quoted a former minister saying
that bin Laden was presented to him as a businessman who would
finance the building of several apartment blocks and a health care
center in an Albanian village.
	   ``We needed investments ... and I wouldn't become suspicious of
a member of an official delegation who signed in the name of a
charity organisation,'' said the former minister, who the paper
said did not want to be identified.
	   Government officials said they could not confirm the report
because it focused on events before their time in office of which
they had no knowledge.
	   Bin Laden is suspected of involvement in the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa in August that killed more than 200
people and wounded thousands.
	   The United States launched a retaliatory cruise missile attack
Aug. 20 on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan said
run by bin Laden.
	   Wednesday's report was the second in recent months linking
Albania to Mideastern radicals.
	   Five suspects believed to be Egyptian nationals were reported
arrested and spirited out of Albania with the help of American
agents this summer.
	   Four of them were sought in the 1993 assassination of Rifat
el-Mahgoub, the speaker of the Egyptian parliament, and an abortive
attempt several years later to blow up the Khan Khalili public
market in Cairo.
	   A sixth suspect, Salah el Saied, was killed in October 24, in a
shoot-out with Albanian special police in a Tirana suburb.
	   According to Albanian sources he was wanted by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency for threatening the U.S. Embassy in Tirana in
August.
	   Workers of several Arab charity organizations left Albania after
the first arrests took place.
	   Current officials of the Albanian National Information Service
have accused Bashkim Gazidede, the former head of the secret
service, of involvement in activities of Islamic terrorists
operating in Albania.
	   When riots started last year after the collapse of pyramid
schemes, Gazidede left Albania and is believed to be hiding in
Syria.
	   On Aug. 17, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines tightened security at
the American diplomatic compound in Tirana after U.S. officials
said they received credible evidence of a plan to attack the U.S.
mission.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Declaring that finding peace in Congo was
a continuing challenge, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan
Rice on Wednesday appeared to achieve little in persuading Rwandans
to disengage from the three-month Congolese war.
	   After three hours of talks with President Pasteur Bizimungu and
Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president and chief architect of
Rwandan policy in Congo, the Rwandan government again denied having
troops in Congo and distanced itself from the crisis.
	   ``We believe the Congolese people are the principal in this
conflict, therefore the Congolese government, the rebels and other
political organizations in Congo must find a way to negotiate a
political settlement,'' Minister of State Patrick Mazimhaka said.
	   Rice was scheduled to meet Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
later Wednesday in Entebbe, her final destination.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila has so far refused to
negotiate directly with the rebels, accusing them of being the
puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. On Wednesday, Kabila flew to Harare,
Zimbabwe, for consultations with President Robert Mugabe, who has
sent 6,000 troops and an air force to prop up his Congolese ally.
	   Angola and Namibia, too, sent troops and tanks to help stop
rebel advances.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already visited South Africa,
Angola, Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe, had a hard time convincing the
countries supporting Kabila of U.S. impartiality in the conflict.
	   Both Kabila and Mugabe insisted the United States put pressure
on Rwanda and Uganda to withdraw their support for the rebels
before any deal could be reached.
	   A Rwandan official, speaking on condition of anonimity, said a
meeting between Rice and the rebels was possible later on
Wednesday. Rice and the U.S. Embassy refused to comment.
	   In Kigali, Rice acknowledged Rwanda's security concerns in
Congo, and said any settlement must address the border security and
an end to ethnic killings _ a reference to anti-Tutsi persecution
in Congo.
	   The anti-Kabila rebellion has already embroiled troops from as
many as eight countries, including Rwanda, which accuses Kabila of
genocide and failing to rid the common border of Rwandan rebels.
	   ``We have heard the desire of all sides for peace. Every
government that we have spoken to has made a clear preference for
peace,'' Rice said. ``I think the challenge is how to get there.
We'll continue our efforts to try to search for peace.''
	   ``Our aim is to move the peace process forward. We see our role
as one of support to regional efforts to achieve a negotiated
settlement to Congolese conflict,'' she said.
	   Rice denied reports that Angola had promised to withdraw troops
from Congo, saying such discussions had never taken place.

U.S. officials praise Vietnamese cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ U.S. officials on Wednesday praised
Vietnamese cooperation over the last decade in helping to account
for American troops still missing from the Vietnam War.
	   ``We are very happy with the results we have achieved,'' said
Bob Jones, deputy assistant secretary of defense for prisoners of
war and missing personnel affairs. ``It's a very emotional issue,
something that's very close to the hearts of the American people.''
	   Last week, Jones participated in a one-day conference to assess
the program that finds and excavates remains, tracks down cases
where an American was last seen alive during the war and pursues
allegations that American POWs are still alive.
	   ``That was a very successful discussion'' that included U.S.
Ambassador Pete Peterson and several high-ranking Vietnamese
government officials, Jones told a news conference.
	   Since 1973, the remains of 505 U.S. servicemen have been
identified and returned to their families. Another 2,078 are still
listed as missing in Southeast Asia, including 1,549 in Vietnam.
	   Jones will participate in a repatriation ceremony Thursday for
three sets of remains that were found during the most recent round
of digging. A team of 101 military specialists arrives at the same
time for a 30-day operation that could excavate up to 10 sites.
	   So far, more than 200 investigations into alleged sightings of
live POWs have failed to yield any evidence that Vietnam still
holds any Americans a quarter-century after the end of the war.
	   Jones said Vietnamese cooperation on the sensitive subject
``clearly demonstrates ... the willingness of the government to
open doors to all areas.''
	   But he was not willing to rule out that a POW might emerge
someday.
	   ``There is always hope that there is a live American
somewhere,'' he said, pointing to recent cases in which an American
veteran returned from North Korea after living there since the
Korean War and Japanese POWs were freed from a Russian gulag.
	   The cases of Last Known Alive _ when Americans were seen alive
and in the proximity of North Vietnamese forces _ have shrunk from
196 to 43, with 35 sets of remains returned and enough information
to determine that others were dead.
	   Jones said he hopes that the governments of Laos, Cambodia and
Vietnam will meet soon and agree to allow better cross-border
access.
	   U.S. officials often try to interview former Vietnamese soldiers
and take them to their former battlegrounds, but in some cases,
those were in Laos or Cambodia, and border crossings are limited to
established posts.
	   Jones said he also would like to see Laos raise its limit of 40
Americans being allowed to visit at once for excavations, and
Vietnam provide even more war-related documents. At least week's
conference, the Vietnamese turned over two documents relating to
air losses.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to account for 300,000 Vietnamese MIAs have
been aided by U.S. documents, which already have helped uncover 850
sets of remains, and Jones is offering access to military archives
on military units and operational and intelligence logs.
	   Overall, the Defense Department spends dlrs 55 million a year on
MIA recovery efforts from World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam
War and the Cold War. Jones said officials are looking at the
program and how best to maintain it amid shrinking returns.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The rate of pregnancy-related deaths
remains high among Kenyan women at 650 per 100,000 births, the
Health Ministry said.
	   Hemorrhage, infections, abortion, high blood pressure and anemia
are to blame for most deaths, Health Minister Jackson Kalweo said
Tuesday.
	   Malaria, tuberculosis and the AIDS virus also contribute to the
high death rate, he said.
	   ``It is estimated that 40 percent of pregnant women in Kenya
suffer temporary or permanent disabilities resulting from
complications of pregnancy and childbirth,'' Kalweo said.
	   Although most women visit pre-natal clinics, only 56 percent of
deliveries were assisted by a trained professional, he said.
	   While Africa accounts for 10 percent of the world's population,
40 percent of the reported pregnancy-related deaths occur on the
continent, according to Population Action International, which
promotes family planing around the world.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The Constitutional Court held
a special session Wednesday to pay tribute to anti-apartheid Judge
John Didcott, a member of the panel who died on Oct. 20 after a
long illness.
	   The sitting was attended by the full bench of the nation's
highest court, Chief Justice Ismail Mahomed, 30 High Court judges,
lawyers and family members.
	   The top court's president, Judge Arthur Chaskalson, praised
Didcott as a jurist who was dedicated to justice for the oppressed
during the apartheid era.
	   Chaskalson said Didcott was courageous in his condemnation of
apartheid's unjust laws.
	   ``We miss him more than I can say,'' Chaskalson said.
	   Didcott, who is survived by his wife Pam and his children, died
at the age of 67.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Sweden is contributing dlrs 10 million
dollars into Mozambique's debt fund, an initiative set up by the
government about two years ago as a safer way of collecting donor
contributions to relieve the country from its huge foreign debt.
	   The announcement was made during a visit to the country by the
Swedish royal couple.
	   The government considers Mozambique's foreign debt a major
obstacle to development.
	   --
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ University professors
have joined a teachers' strike that entered its second month this
week as schools and post-secondary institutions around the country
were closed.
	   In an open letter addressed to the government, the instructors
have asked authorities to pay up a year's back wages.
	   Primary school teachers began the strike Oct. 1, saying their
requests to be paid had been unanswered.
	   --
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A Washington-based human rights
group for refugees has called for international support to Sierra
Leonean traditional hunters fighting rebels in the country's
interior.
	   In a statement received here on Tuesday, the non-governmental
group Refugees International called for training and support to
Sierra Leone's Civil Defense Force, also called the Kamajors.
	   The Kamajors, mostly untrained traditional hunters, often fight
with machetes, slingshots and other crude weapons although a few
have machine guns and rocket launchers.
	   They are battling a rebel alliance that was ousted from Sierra
Leone's capital of Freetown in February by a Nigerian-led West
African intervention force.
	   The rebels have launched a revenge campaign of mass killings,
maimings and rapes of defenseless civilians.
	   --
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A three-person Ukrainian delegation was
accosted by armed bandits while trying to secure the release of
four Ukrainian sailors held for ransom for more than a year,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The delegation arrived in Nigeria several days ago and acquired
a court order to gain the sailors' release. But a group of some 150
armed men surrounded them on Monday in the southeastern town of
Sapele.
	   The armed men told them that any attempt to release the detained
men would result in bloodshed, a Nigerian official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The sailors are being held by Nigerian oil firm owner and
traditional chieftain H.I.S. Idisi, who has accused the sailors'
Ukrainian employers of losing dlrs 1 million worth of cargo
belonging to Idisi's oil firm, Lonestar Drilling.
	   Intervention by the Ukrainian government led to the release of
24 other sailors in July, although Idisi has vowed to keep the
other four until he is paid.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Health Ministry officials have
destroyed over 1.5 tons of illegal heart medications, birth control
pills and other prescription drugs following a crackdown on street
vendors.
	   ``After three years of education, it's time to move to the
stamping out stage,'' Ivory Coast's Health Minister Maurice Kacou
Guikahue said, putting a torch to the huge pile of assorted
medicines on Tuesday.
	   For years this West African country has battled a massive influx
of illegal medications from regional neighbors including Nigeria
and Ghana.
	   The drugs are often below safety standards and are sold at
one-fifth of regular pharmacy prices.
	   Ivory Coast has one of the best health systems in West Africa.

Social worker claims a solution to South Korea's crowded

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Dear Aunt Dorothy remembered you in
her will and you want to remember her always. How about wearing her
around your neck in the form of beads?
	   A South Korean social worker says he's found a way to turn human
remains into ornamental, crystalline beads as a means of solving
the country's growing graveyard shortage.
	   ``You can keep them anywhere,'' said Kim Sang-guk, 44. ``They
are just like jewels, like greenish jades. The beads sometimes come
out in light blue or milky color.''
	   Kim suggests the beaded remains of loved ones could be kept,
say, on your desk, in your closet or worn as a necklace or
fashioned into a bracelet or brooch.
	   Kim's patented method consists of taking cremated remains and
reheating them at a temperature of 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632
degrees Fahrenheit), which crystallizes them.
	   Kim and other members of the Han Wool Spiritual Cultural, a
Seoul-based charity group, have sought for six years to find a way
to encourage cremation in South Korea, which is running out of
burial sites.
	   With 200,000 new graves added each year, the government warns
that the nation's 242 public cemeteries will run out of space in
less than 10 years. As in Hong Kong, many people are rushing to
secure their graves long before they die.
	   Despite a government campaign to encourage more cremations, most
people in this Confucian-oriented society consider the idea
repugnant. Only about 20 percent of Koreans are cremated, mostly
Christians.
	   ``People find human ashes very unpleasant. When the remains are
cremated and the ashes are scattered, people also feel they have
lost a link with their ancestors,'' Kim said. ``It is of paramount
importance for many Koreans to have something to remember their
ancestors.
	   ``I believe my idea will help make cremation more popular,'' he
added.
	   One set of human ashes can be turned into two or three cups of
beads at a cost of 1 million won (dlrs 770), Kim said. That means
that almost every surviving family member, even in the largest of
families, can have at least one bead.
	   Kim said he got his idea from Buddhist sarira, small beads of
bone recovered after cremations of Buddhist monks and kept in stone
pagodas.
	   Millions of Koreans take to the highways during major holidays
to pay tribute to ancestral tombs dotting the countryside, causing
bumper-to-bumper traffic jams throughout the nation.
	   So far, only 10 people have agreed to have the remains of their
deceased family members turned into beads _ a few of them North
Korean natives who wished to keep them long enough for burial in
their homeland when the two Koreas are reunified.
	   But Kim is confident his idea will catch on.
	   ``If people are so eager to visit their dead parents, why don't
they keep them at home?'' he asked.

Holland shocked by Pakistan but still leads table
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A young Pakistan side shocked world and
Olympic title-holder Holland 5-3 Wednesday, handing the Dutch their
first defeat in the Champions Trophy field hockey tournament.
	   But Holland still leads the points table in the six-team
competition with nine points.
	   With two draws and a defeat on the points chart, the relatively
inexperienced Pakistan forwards showed a much better combination
against the strong Dutch defense and scored four field goals.
	   Anis Ahmed scored twice and Atif Bashir and Muhammad Sarwar
found the targets with angular shots. Sohail Abbas netted
Pakistan's fifth goal off a penalty corner in the 53rd minute.
	   ``It's a great feeling to beat such a strong team as Holland,''
said captain Muhammad Usman.
	   ``We played as a well-knit unit and availed our chances,'' said
Usman, whose team now has five points from four games with a match
against Germany to play.
	   Holland, which enforced penalty corner specialist Bram Lomans,
could score only two goals from 10 short corners while Marten
Eikelboom was on target once.
	   The match started off at a fast pace with Eikelboom's strong
reverse flick smartly stopped by Pakistan custodian Muhammad Qasim
in only the third minute.
	   Pakistani forwards had their chances too, but were lost by
Bashir and Anis. Bashir finally drove home when he calmly placed
the ball to the left of goalkeeper Ronald Janssen in the 21st
minute.
	   Three minutes later, Anis doubled the lead with a diving effort
from the right, once again defeating Dutch captain Janssen under
the crossbar.
	   However, in a counterattack, Eikelboom scored on an accurate
pass by Remco van Wijk and Pakistan led 2-1 at half-time.
	   Sarwar's powerful shot from the top of the circle put his team
3-1 ahead three minutes into the second half while Lomans converted
his team's sixth short corner into a goal in the 41st minute.
	   Pakistan went up 4-2 in the 61st minute when Abbas scored off
the short corner while Anis scored his second goal in the 61st
minute off a brilliant field effort from the right.
	   Holland could snatch only one more goal through Lomans' 64th
minute strong push off his team's 9th short corner.
	   Result: Pakistan 5 (Atif Bashir (21st min), Anis Ahmed (24th
min, 61st min), Muhammad Sarwar (38th min), Sohail Abbas (53rd
min); Holland 3 (Marten Eikelboom (25th min), Bram Lomans (41st
min, 64th min).
	   Teams: Pakistan: Muhammad Usman (captain), Aamir Saleem, Babar
Abdullah, Sohail Abbas, Ali Raza, Imran Yousuf, Waseem Ahmed,
Haider Hussain, Muhammad Sarwar, Kamran Ashraf, Naveed Iqbal, Anis
Ahmed, Muhammad Qasim, Asad Ali Qureshi, Atif Bashir.
	   Holland: Bram Lomans, Danny Bree, Erik Jazet, Peter Windi,
Sander van der Weide, Jacques Brinkman (captain), Piet Hein Geeris,
Marten Eikelboom, Sander van Heeswijk, Jeroen Delmee, Ronald
Janssen, Teun de Nooijer, Remco van Wijk, Jaap Derk Buma.

Saudis say bin Laden not responsible for Saudi bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden was not directly
responsible for bombings in Saudi Arabia that left 26 dead, Saudi
Arabia's interior minister said in an interview published
Wednesday.
	   The United States suspects bin Laden of financing several
terrorist strikes around the world, including the June 1996 bombing
of Khobar Towers, a U.S. military complex in the Saudi city of
Dhahran. Nineteen U.S. servicemen were killed and about 500 people
were injured in that blast.
	   U.S. officials are still investigating whether bin Laden was
behind a November 1995 blast in Riyadh that left five American
servicemen and two Indian nationals dead.
	   ``It has been reported and said the bombing in Khobar and ...
Riyadh were masterminded by bin Laden, but this is not true,''
Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz told Al-Siyassah daily.
	   Price Nayef, however, said it was possible that the attacks were
carried out by others who ``adopted his ideas.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire, was exiled from his
homeland in 1994. He now lives in Afghanistan.
	   Washington has said he is the prime suspect in the Aug. 7
bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. The blasts killed 224 people and injured thousands.

<TEXT>
	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbs were wounded after their
car was raked with gunfire by separatist ethnic Albanians in the
restive Kosovo province, police said Wednesday. The violence
highlighted continuing potential for bloodshed in the southern
Serbian province despite last month's peace agreement.
	   Serb police at a checkpoint near Sipitula, about 15 kilometers
(10 miles) west of Pristina, said ethnic Albanian guerrillas opened
fire on two vehicles from the nearby Belacevac coal mine Tuesday
evening. They said an ensuing gunfight between police and the
attackers lasted an hour.
	   Three miners in one of the cars were injured and taken to
Pristina hospital, according to police. The cars, still sitting at
the checkpoint Wednesday morning, had several bullet holes or marks
in the windshields and chassis.
	   Villagers said they fled when Serb police began shooting at the
village and spent the night in nearby fields or homes of friends
and relatives. A few who returned Wednesday morning said police
routinely attack the village and force them to flee.
	   ``They aren't withdrawing their forces'' as called for in the
Oct. 12 peace agreement, complained one man, Fatmme Mjeku.
	   The peace agreement, wrested from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, suspended an eight-month crackdown in the province that
left hundreds dead _ most of them ethnic Albanian civilians _ and
hundreds of thousands others homeless. Kosovo is in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Alluding to the police threat to Albanian refugees before the
attack, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader said more needs to be
done to ensure the safety of refugees going home.
	   Ibrahim Rugova spoke Tuesday after venturing into the
countryside for the first time in nine years.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the process to return.
But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central
Kosovo. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying
to persuade ethnic Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo's
independence from Serbia and settle for some form of self-rule.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital,
Pristina, since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
set up a huge police presence.
	   But with no major fighting in Kosovo for weeks and many Serb
forces withdrawn since the October peace agreement, Rugova visited
villages on the front line of last month's fighting between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians
from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more
confidence and stability.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that they are not prepared to
compromise their goal of outright independence.
	   On Wednesday, they announced they are holding two politicians
from Rugova's party who went missing Oct. 30 in Malisevo, southwest
of Pristina. The two, Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku, were
conducting an anti-KLA campaign and ``coaxed people to turn in
their arms,'' said a KLA statement printed in the daily Koha
Ditore.
	   In the Netherlands, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal locked horns with the Yugoslav government over the
tribunal's jurisdiction to investigate war crimes in Kosovo.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said Yugoslav authorities still
not have issued visas for a weeklong mission to Belgrade and
Kosovo, scheduled to start Friday.

Official: Singapore to merge equities and futures markets in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said Wednesday the country will merge its equities and futures
exchanges next year.
	   Lee, speaking at the 25th anniversary dinner of the Stock
Exchange of Singapore, said the equity exchange and the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange will be brought together under a
government-created holding company.
	   The government will give 40 to 50 percent of the shares in the
holding company to current members of the two exchanges and offer
the remaining shares to institutional investors, fund managers and
listed companies, Lee said.
	   The company wouldn't immediately be publicly listed, but is
expected to make an initial public offering within five years, he
said.
	   Lee said the combined exchange will remove controls on the level
of commissions brokers can charge, and will offer ``fully open
access'' to the two markets. Commissions on SIMEX are already
unregulated.
	   ``Open access means that any institution which meets standard
requirements, such as capital and competence, will be admitted to
trade on the exchange, regardless of local or foreign ownership,
and without any quota on the number of seats,'' he said.
	   He said the process should be completed by January 2002.
	   The shake-up of Singapore's two exchanges is part of a larger
effort to reform the city-state's financial markets and create a
center to rival Hong Kong and Tokyo.
	   Over the past year, Lee, who is also chairman of the Monetary
Authority of Singapore, the country's effective central bank, has
announced a series of measures targeting banking regulation, asset
management and capital markets.
	   ``The new exchange needs to develop a range of Singapore and
Asian equity products and equity-linked derivatives, in order to
become `the' equity center in the Asian time zone,'' Lee said.
	   He added: ``Only then can we attract Asian investors, as well as
G-7 investors wanting exposure to the Asian cash and derivatives
markets.''
	   G-7 is the Group of Seven leading industrial nations _ the
United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
	   The financial community applauded the merger, saying it will
lead to greater efficiency and transparency.
	   ``I think the merger of the two exchanges is a logical step,''
Lim Hua Min, executive chairman of Philip Securities Pte. Ltd.,
told reporters. ``You have the derivatives and the underlying
instrument. I can't see one should be separate from the other.''
	   He said that since the merged entity will act as a monopoly
entity, it will be subject to greater scrutiny and therefore be
more transparent.
	   Robert Cox, managing director of Goldman Sachs Futures Pte.
Ltd., said the merger is ``a very bold and courageous move,
continuing the program of financial deregulation for Singapore at a
time when other regional governments are talking about more
regulations and controls.''

Estrada says Philippine Airlines, Cathay likely to forge deal soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Wednesday that Philippine Airlines may soon forge a deal with
Cathay Pacific Airways, which wants to buy into the ailing
Philippine flag carrier.
	   The question of who should manage PAL is the only major issue to
be resolved before a deal can be reached, Estrada said.
	   ``On a scale of 1 to 10, it may have already reached 6,'' the
president said.
	   He added that the likely entry of Cathay Pacific into PAL is a
``good sign because it shows that foreign businessmen still
consider the Philippines as a viable investment site.''
	   Estrada said the government will wait for the outcome of the
negotiations before deciding whether to sell government shares in
the airline.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debt. It was devastated by a pilots' strike in
June and by Asia's currency crisis, which came shortly after it
launched an ambitious modernization and expansion program.
	   The airline has been negotiating with prospective foreign
investors that could infuse badly needed capital.
	   Last week, a Cathay Pacific official said the Hong Kong-based
company has completed a study of PAL and is negotiating the terms
of a buy-in that would give it management rights.
	   Cathay Pacific country manager Alex Shum said it wants
management control over PAL, but will not bring in a large number
of its own managers.
	   He said Cathay Pacific plans to submit a formal offer to PAL
very soon but initially has proposed ``options'' for its possible
role in the financially troubled carrier.
	   Under Philippine law, a foreign company can buy up to 40 percent
of PAL's stock.
	   Northwest Airlines of the United States also has expressed an
interest in buying into PAL, and its chairman visited the
Philippines several weeks ago to meet with PAL chairman Lucio Tan.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of collective
bargaining in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international
flights last week.
	   A union leader, Abel Capili, said Wednesday that PAL officials
have informed them of a plan to retrench about 200 workers this
month as part of efforts to rehabilitate the airline.
	   Capili said PAL workers might consider staging a strike to
oppose the plan. PAL officials were not immediately available for
comment.

Kiriyenko criticizes Russian economic plan, says it threatens aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has squandered its prospects for
international aid by approving a vague and contradictory economic
plan, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Wednesday.
	   ``There is no chance of receiving money from the West,''
Kiriyenko told the Interfax news agency. ``Credits will be provided
only for a clear, concise, consistent plan of action that would
show that the Russian budget can receive more money than it
spends.''
	   The International Monetary Fund has held up approval of the next
installment of its loan to Russia, saying it wanted to see a clear
plan of action that met its criteria.
	   Kiriyenko said the current government's plan is unclear _ in
fact, he charged, it is intentionally murky as part of a strategy
of encouraging political stability by taking pains not to offend
any faction.
	   Kiriyenko was fired in August after he effectively devalued the
national currency, the ruble, and placed a moratorium on repaying
foreign loans, tipping an already troubled economy over the edge
into crisis.
	   He has consistently defended his government's actions, and has
been increasingly outspoken in criticizing his successor, Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Primakov's Cabinet approved an economic plan last weekend that
proposes greater government intervention in the economy, while
still promising to hew to a path of market-oriented reform.
	   On Wednesday, an official with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development was quoted as saying the EBRD
doesn't plan to loan any money to restructure the Russian banking
system this year. There had been speculation that it might.
	   Neil Parison, head of the bank's office in Moscow, told Interfax
that any assistance from the EBRD, the Group of Seven
industrialized nations or the World Bank would depend on the
Russian Central Bank's program to restructure the system.

 &UR; US Defense Secretary Cohen arrives in Qatar
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrival in Qatar graf 5; troop figures final
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied
Gulf states Wednesday for support of possible military action
against Iraq but _ at least publicly _ he appeared to be winning
little backing.
	   On Tuesday, after Cohen arrived in the Gulf, a Saudi Arabian
government official said the kingdom could not be used for a strike
against Iraq, and a Kuwaiti spokesman said the emirate was not
involved in the U.N.-Iraq dispute.
	   Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with disarmament
monitors has been condemned by the U.N. Security Council as a
``flagrant violation'' of the country's agreements with the world
body.
	   Cohen arrived in Qatar late Wednesday for talks with its
government, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Doha said on
condition of anonymity. He was scheduled to hold talks with the
emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and spend the night on the
peninsula.
	   The defense secretary is expected to stop briefly in the United
Arab Emirates on Thursday and travel to Egypt for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak later in the day.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Cohen held talks with Bahrain's crown prince,
Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, in Manama and with Kuwait's emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in Kuwait City. He did not speak to
reporters after the meetings.
	   On Tuesday, Cohen began his tour with talks with King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia. There have been different accounts of what
transpired.
	   The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi official _
speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told the
defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for
attacks on Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the world body over
weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states
in opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   But on Tuesday night, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry
said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between the
United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack on Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they
were privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that
Cohen was actually told that Arab leaders would support an attack
on Iraq only if it was guaranteed to remove President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, more than 20 warships
including the carrier USS Eisenhower, and about 170 warplanes and
helicopters in the Gulf region, according to the Pentagon.

Illegal immigrants line up to ask for work permits as amnesty gets
</HEADLINE>
under way &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of illegal immigrants lined up at police
stations Wednesday to apply for the 38,000 work permits the
government plans to issue under a limited amnesty decree.
	   To qualify for a permit immigrants need to prove they entered
the country prior to March 27, the day the amnesty decree was
adopted, as well as have a job and place to stay. Many immigrants
are hired without proper papers.
	   Citing the large influx of ethnic-Albanian refugees fleeing
violence in Kosovo, and the thousands that fled uprisings in
Albania last year, Italy promised to give at least 3,000 permits to
Albanians.
	   Under agreements signed earlier this year, Italy also pledged to
accept a minimum of 1,500 immigrants each from Morocco and Tunisia.
	   Illegals have until Dec. 15 to apply for the permits, which
would allow them to live and work in Italy for two years.
	   This is the first time Italy has set quotas for immigrants. It
previously granted permits on a case-by-case basis to those who
could prove they were victims of persecution at home or had a job
awaiting them in Italy.
	   Many businesses, especially in the agricultural sector,
currently rely on illegal immigrants for seasonal jobs such as
tomato picking. The legalization of 38,000 immigrants is in part
intended so that employers have the workers they need for jobs
Italians won't take, despite the country's 12.5 percent
unemployment rate.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants have reached Italy's long
coastline on boats in the past year, fleeing violence in the
Balkans or abandoning northern Africa in search of a better life.

Thai legal framework in place for debt restructuring: Bank chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor said
Wednesday that debt restructuring by financial institutions should
speed up since a framework for tax-cut incentives is now in place.
	   ``Debt restructuring can now go full steam because all legal
requirements needed for enforcing the incentives have been
implemented,'' Chatu Mongol Sonakul said.
	   Debt restructuring is a key mechanism for commercial banks to
cut their mounting bad debts, now estimated at about 37 percent of
their total outstanding loans.
	   In September, the central bank and the private sector launched a
program for corporate debt restructuring in which the government
provides tax-cut incentives for financial institutions and
borrowers.
	   Chatu Mongol said the government has issued a decree, a set of
ministerial regulations and other announcements to provide a legal
basis for the incentives.
	   Lenders are allowed to write off the portion of loans that
borrowers will not repay. Borrowers will get a tax exemption for
the portion of a loan they cannot repay.
	   The government also allows financial institutions to cut lending
rates for debt-ridden borrowers, and has cut the fee charged for
transferring property assets under the program.
	   Only debt restructuring taking place between Jan. 1, 1998, and
Dec. 31, 1999, is eligible for the incentives.

Plan to ease EU ban on British beef exports is blocked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A plan to significantly ease the 1996
European Union ban on British beef exports was blocked by EU
veterinary officials Wednesday, but is likely to be approved later
this month, officials said.
	   Opposition by veterinary officials from five of the 15-EU
nations Wednesday was enough to at least postpone a plan to allow
the export of beef from British cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996.
	   Exports of British beef were banned in March 1996 after Britain
announced a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease in British
beef and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
	   British exports were banned over two years ago, after an
outbreak of ``mad cow disease''
	   The plan, put forward by the EU Commission in June, will now go
to EU farms ministers, who meet Nov. 23-24. A simple majority will
suffice there to approve the measure.
	   In Wednesday's veterinary committee, eight EU countries endorsed
the beef export plan and two countries abstained. The two countries
were the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Germany, France, Spain, Italy
and Austria opposed the plan and formed a ``blocking minority'' in
the committee.
	   The National Farmers' Union said the decision in Brussels would
help inject confidence into the farming community.
	   The British farm sector was not downcast after Wednesday's block
since a lifting of the ban now became a realistic possibility.
	   Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, called the
vote ``great news which puts us on track for the lifting of the
beef ban before Christmas.''
	   The date-based British beef export plan follows a Commission
decision in May to allow the export from June 1 of beef from
Northern Ireland certified to be free of ``mad cow'' disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
	   The significantly broader date-based scheme would allow the
export of British beef from animals born after Britain banned the
use of cattle and sheep remains in animal feed and prohibited farms
from holding those remains. BSE is believed to have spread through
BSE-infected animal feed.
	   Britain has reported the vast majority of BSE cases in Europe.

Philippines' PLDT confirms negotiations on buy-in by Southwestern
</HEADLINE>
Bell &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., the country's largest telecommunications company, confirmed
rumors Wednesday that a second foreign corporation, U.S.-based
Southwestern Bell, is interested in purchasing a large stake in it.
	   PLDT officials said Southwestern Bell has recently completed an
initial evaluation of PLDT, but a formal offer has not yet been
made.
	   Hong Kong-based holding group First Pacific Co., which announced
early this week an acquisition of an undisclosed amount of PLDT
shares, has said it is willing to explore talks with another
investor group to facilitate a buy-in of PLDT, as long as First
Pacific gets management control.
	   PLDT Senior Vice President Antonio Samson said the company has
not entered an agreement with any group on issues related to
ownership or management structure.
	   ``There is too much speculation going on now about PLDT's
future, but there is still nothing conclusive on this,'' he said.
	   He said PLDT will make an announcement about a buy-in or its
ownership and management structure ``at the appropriate time.''
	   First Pacific said it had bought a ``strategic stake'' in PLDT,
but did not disclose the exact amount of shares or from whom they
were purchased.
	   It has stressed that it is after management control of PLDT to
strengthen its goal of intensifying its presence in Southeast Asia.
	   First Pacific's Philippine subsidiary, Smart Communications
Inc., already operates the largest cellular phone network in the
Philippines, as well as basic telephone lines.
	   Standard and Poor's, meanwhile, said Wednesday it has placed
PLDT on CreditWatch with negative implications.
	   The CreditWatch status reflects the possibility of a change in
controlling shareholding interests at PLDT in the near future, the
credit rating agency said. This may lead to changes in operating
and financial strategies, it said.
	   While the integration of PLDT and Smart's networks offers the
possibility of advantages for both companies, Standard and Poor's
said it was concerned that a change in operational direction and
aggressive use of debt to develop PLDT's business may weaken its
financial position and lead to downward pressure on ratings.
	   The ratings agency said PLDT has already experienced a
significant increase in debt burden in recent years, with
debt-to-capital rising to 67 percent as of June 30, 1998, from 42
percent in 1993.
	   Standard and Poor's previous ratings for PLDT were ``BB-plus''
for its long-term foreign currency corporate debt, ``BB-plus'' for
its senior debt ratings, and ``BB-minus'' for its preferred stock.
	   Standard and Poor's said it will review PLDT's ratings once
developments in the company become more definite.
	   PLDT shares closed 40 pesos, or 3.9 percent, lower Wednesday at
970 pesos.

Tractors and drought slow trading at world's largest camel market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MCCONNICO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUSHKAR, India (AP) _ Plagued by years of drought and a sour
economy, the world's largest camel bazaar is suffering from slow
trading.
	   The Pushkar Camel Fair, which began Oct. 23 and ends Wednesday
night, still drew more than 30,000 camels to this Hindu holy town
at the edge of the Thar Desert in the western Indian state of
Rajasthan.
	   The camels, which sell for anywhere between 5,000 rupees (about
dlrs 125) to 42,000 rupees (dlrs 1,000), are checked by traders for
stance, stride, condition of teeth and most important, head
position. A camel that holds its head high is good for riding. One
which bows its head is used for pulling.
	   The camel is still the work horse of the Indian desert, where
they lumber through fields and along any highway, pulling loads of
sugar cane, hay or firewood stripped from the precious few trees.
	   But many traders said they feared a centuries-old way of life
might be fading away.
	   ``Why use camels when a tractor can do the work of seven?'' said
Preladh Singh, 68, who shepherded eight camels on a seven-day walk
from Chitughar in the nearby state of Madhya Pradesh.
	   After a week camping out at the fair, he still hadn't sold a
single camel. He planned to try his luck elsewhere rather than
return home empty-handed.
	   While Singh left his family behind, other traders' wives and
daughters went through Pushkar's sprawling outdoor market, haggling
for the colorful clothing and jewelry. Members of the Rabari tribe,
who often live in remote villages, use the bazaar as an annual
meeting place to find marriage partners for their children.
	   The fair, which coincides with a Hindu festival, also draws
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from throughout India. They come
to bathe in the holy waters of Pushkar Lake, believed to have the
power to cleanse a lifetime of sins.

Radical Basque party says no to representing gunmen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The leader of a party closely linked with
the armed Basque separatist group ETA on Wednesday welcomed the
government's first move toward talks to resolve the Basque conflict
but rejected suggestions that it might represent the gunmen.
	   Arnaldo Otegi of the Herri Batasuna group said the initiative
for talks made public Tuesday represented a ``positive change in
attitude'' given the government has long rejected any talks with
ETA.
	   But, speaking on a Basque radio station, Otegi denied
suggestions his group could act as spokesmen for the armed
organization.
	   ``If the government wants to talk to Herri Batasuna, let it do
so. If it wants to talk to ETA, then it should talk to ETA,'' Herri
Batasuna leader Arnaldo Oregi told a Basque radio station. ``We're
not going to represent ETA in any manner or in any talks.''
	   On Tuesday, conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he
had authorized talks with groups linked to ETA in what was his
two-year-old government's first step toward negotiating an end to
the 30-year conflict.
	   The move by Aznar, who was the target of an ETA car-bomb attack
in 1995 when he was opposition leader, came just under two months
after the organization, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, began its first ever open-ended truce Sept. 18.
	   Otegi's Herri Batasuna has long been considered the political
wing of ETA. As part of the pro-independence coalition Eukal
Herritarrok, the party won 16 seats in the 75-seat Basque
parliament in regional elections on Oct. 25.
	   He said his party had not had any contact so far with the
government.
	   On Wednesday, the daily ABC cited unidentified government
sources as saying one of the government's conditions was that the
political side of any possible talks would be handled by Herri
Batasuna and, or, Euskal Herritarrok.
	   The paper said the government was also seeking guarantees that
ETA would keep its gunmen under control and that it would dismantle
its infrastructure, particularly its bomb-making facilities, in
France and Spain.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
an independent state of Basque areas in northern Spain and
southwestern France.
	   The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when
Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist party was in office. The talks broke
down and the violence resumed.
	   Following the latest truce, Aznar initially rejected talks until
ETA gave further proof of its peaceful intentions. The premier,
however, has come under pressure from other political parties to
respond to the cease-fire before it is too late.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the proposed contacts were
``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to give up violence
for good.''
	   The move was welcomed by political parties and media analysts
across the board.
	   Recent news reports said ETA decided to go for a truce because
the organization had been seriously weakened by arrests and police
infiltration in recent months. In addition, there has been an
increasing number of mulititudinous demonstrations against its
actions in recent years.
	   ETA and its supporters were also influenced by developments in
the north of Ireland where the Irish Republican Army and other
paramilitary groups have upheld cease-fires that paved the way for
peace talks.
	   No date or location has been set for any eventual talks on the
Basque problem.

Swatch Group sells Smart Car stake to Germany's Daimler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Swatch Group said
Wednesday it has sold its stake in the Smart Car project to German
car giant Daimler-Benz, its partner in the venture.
	   The tiny two-seater Smart Car was developed by Micro Compact Car
AG, a joint venture between Daimler-Benz and Swatch Group, the
Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch wristwatch.
	   Swatch's decision to sell its 19 percent stake in the venture
gives Daimler full control of Micro Compact Car.
	   The car went on sale across Europe last month following a
six-month delay after it flunked the so-called ``moose test,''
mimicking a driver swerving to avoid an unexpected obstacle.
	   It is on sale in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland,
Austrian, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in special
``Smart Centers,'' which bypass normal auto dealers.
	   The 2.5-meter (yard) long Smart Car takes up around half of a
standard parking spot. With its bright yellow and red colors,
mix-and-match replaceable parts and all-plastic body, it is aimed
at a young market.

Iranians burn flags to mark anniversary of U.S. Embassy seizure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of protesters burned American
flags and effigies of Uncle Sam outside the former U.S. Embassy
Wednesday to mark the 19th anniversary of its takeover by Islamic
militants.
	   But the atmosphere outside the former embassy compound in the
heart of Tehran was like that of a carnival and most protesters
behaved more like they were out for a day of fun than making a
political statement.
	   Most of the 20,000 demonstrators were high school students who
were given the day off to mark the anniversary, a turning point of
Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   The anti-American sentiments that have been a cornerstone of
Iranian police have lost their resonance since the election last
year of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who has
encouraged ties with Americans.
	   Cheered on by fellow demonstrators, some in the crowd threw
handfuls of palm-sized fliers into the air every few minutes. The
yellow, blue and green fliers were emblazoned with ``Death to
America'' and ``Death to Israel.''
	   Thick plumes of black smoke rose from the midst of the crowds
from burning effigies of Uncle Sam or U.S. flags that were set
ablaze every few minutes.
	   Few people listened as Mohsen Rezaei, a member of a powerful
government body and former commander of the Revolutionary Guards,
denounced the United States.
	   ``Many of the people who say today, `why doesn't Iran establish
ties with America,' mainly emphasize the short-term reasons behind
the incident,'' said Rezaei.
	   ``There were long-term reasons for the takeover of the den of
spies,'' he said, using a term popular during the revolution to
describe the embassy.
	   Ahmad Reza Mahdavi, a 17-year-old high school student wearing a
T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Titanic star Leonard DiCaprio,
said he harbored no hatred against the United States.
	   ``I don't dislike America too much, but we must accept that the
American government is not fair to Iran,'' said Mahdavi.
	   ``The United States remains close to countries that are
undemocratic, violators of human rights, and worse in every way
compared to us. But all we get from them is criticism, accusations
and blame,'' said Mahdavi.
	   On Monday, the student leaders who seized the embassy in 1979
invited their former hostages to return to the country where they
spent 444 days in captivity.
	   No American flags were burned at that demonstration as a
courtesy to the American people.
	   All but about a half-dozen of the students who were once zealous
supporters of the Islamic Revolution and its leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, are now considered moderates who back Khatami's
call for dialogue with the American people.

Britain pledges aid to hurricane-stricken nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In response to appeals, Britain pledged 500,000
pounds (dlrs 825,000) of emergency aid Wednesday for Central
American countries coping with the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Mitch has killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central
America, about 7,000 of them in Honduras alone.
	   Floods and mudslides caused by Mitch were blamed for deaths
across a broad, 500-mile (805 kilometers) corridor from Nicaragua
into southern Mexico, from Honduras' Atlantic Coast to the Pacific.
Many survivors have been left homeless and without food or power.
	   ``The main countries to benefit are Honduras, Nicaragua and El
Salvador,'' said a spokeswoman for the Department of International
Development, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.

French parliament blocks attempt to nix gay couples bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After a marathon debate, leftist lawmakers defeated
a conservative bid Wednesday to block a bill that would give legal
status to homosexuals and other unmarried couples.
	   The National Assembly voted against the move by rightist
politicians to quash the bill at 3:35 a.m. (0135 GMT), but the
decision came after members of parliament nearly came to blows over
the controversial measure.
	   The uproar arose as Christine Boutin, one of the bill's most
outspoken opponents in parliament, denounced the proposal in a
speech that lasted more than five hours.
	   Boutin, a member of the Union for French Democracy, and other
critics have equated the bill with gay marriage and say they fear
it could open the door to adoptions by homosexual couples.
	   Debate on the proposal, which was initially scuttled by rightist
politicians Oct. 9, will continue Saturday. A vote on the revised
bill has been set for Tuesday.
	   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said it
has made only minor changes to the bill, known as the Civil
Solidarity Pact, or PACS.
	   The revised measure would allow two unrelated people to conclude
a union that would, among other things, allow them to file joint
tax returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the
other's social security coverage.

Some 1.5 million dishes expected to be served during Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ It's a big order for a big continent _
at least 1.5 million dishes of food will be prepared for athletes
during the Asian Games.
	   Thamnoon Wanglee, president of Thai Airways International, the
caterer for the Olympic-style event, described it Wednesday as
``the most challenging, the biggest assignment we have ever
undertaken.''
	   The sporting competition, involving 43 countries and some 8,000
athletes, is being staged in Bangkok Dec. 6-20. The airline will
try to live up to Thailand's reputation for food.
	   Thamnoon estimated that four meals a day would be served to the
athletes and officials, with about 15 items to choose from each
time, meaning the kitchens need to prepare 1.5 million dishes.
	   That comprises 60 tons of vegetables, 40 tons of fruit, 70 tons
of meat, 15 tons of rice and 300,000 eggs. Meat will be certified
halal for Muslims. Pork-based dishes will be prepared in a separate
kitchen to avoid religious contamination.
	   Thamnoon said no menu would be repeated.

Russia, US mulling over plan for food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States is offering Russia food aid to
see the country through the long winter, but both sides are still
mulling over the terms of the deal, officials said Wednesday.
	   A delegation from the U.S. Agriculture Department has been in
Moscow this week to discuss the aid package. U.S. officials
confirmed that the sides were still in contact Wednesday, and more
discussions were expected before any agreement was reached.
	   The office of Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who
heads the Russian side in the talks, also said no imminent
agreement was planned. The Americans have asked to take a
``timeout'' to consider the terms, Kulik said Tuesday.
	   A deal is considered likely, but the sides are still working out
some of the details, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
unidentified Russian officials.
	   Some of the food is expected to be wheat that will be provided
for free, and some is to be sold to Russia on favorable long-term
credit terms. Russia is also looking to buy corn and soybean
mixture to feed livestock, Kulik said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis and an ensuing drop in imports, which
came on top of the worst grain harvest in 40 years, have led to
serious concerns about possible winter food shortages.
	   Since the crisis hit in August, food prices have risen sharply,
but plenty of food has remained on store shelves. The government
has said Russia should have sufficient food supplies, but it has
created an emergency food reserve and began talking with the
Americans to ensure supplies would be sufficient.
	   The government is worried that poor Russians may go hungry
because they won't be able to afford to enough food. Prices have
risen close to 50 percent since the country's economic crisis hit.
	   Also, the government is often late in paying wages and pensions
to millions of state workers and retirees, who depend on the
payments to buy food.
	   Food shortages are also possible in Russia's remote northern
regions which rely on outside deliveries for food to get them
through the winter. But deliveries have been delayed in some
instances, and rivers and roads are now frozen over for the winter.
	   Russia's Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said last
week that 22 of Russia's 89 regions suffer ``acute shortages of
grain.''
	   He has said that the government was trying to develop pork and
chicken production in the near future. He said that with proper
support, the industries can turn out an extra 250,000 tons to

Saudi minister says bin Laden not responsible for Saudi bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Islamic militant Osama bin Laden was not directly
responsible for bombings in Saudi Arabia that left 26 dead, Saudi
Arabia's interior minister said in an interview published
Wednesday.
	   The United States suspects bin Laden of financing several
terrorist strikes around the world, including the June 1996 bombing
of Khobar Towers, a U.S. military complex in the Saudi city of
Dhahran. Nineteen U.S. servicemen were killed and about 500 people
were injured in that blast.
	   U.S. officials are still investigating whether bin Laden was
behind a November 1995 blast in Riyadh that left five American
servicemen and two Indian nationals dead.
	   ``It has been reported and said the bombing in Khobar and ...
Riyadh were masterminded by bin Laden, but this is not true,''
Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz told Al-Siyassah daily.
	   Price Nayef, however, said it was possible that the attacks were
carried out by others who ``adopted his ideas.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire, was exiled from his
homeland in 1994. He now lives in Afghanistan.
	   Washington has said he is the prime suspect in the Aug. 7
bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. The blasts killed 224 people and injured thousands.

Chechen warlord sentenced to prison _ in absentia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with Supreme Court sentencing
warlord. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Supreme Court of secessionist Chechnya
sentenced a rebellious warlord to four years in prison Wednesday
for attempting a coup against President Aslan Maskhadov.
	   The court, which relies on Islamic law, sentenced Salman Raduyev
in absentia. The warlord, who remains at large in Chechnya, said he
had ``no intention of surrendering to the Supreme Shariah Court,
because its sentence was handed out under pressure from the
president,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Raduyev and his forces captured the main television center in
Grozny, the Chechen capital, on May 21, killing the national
security chief. That was apparently the basis for the charge
against him.
	   Raduyev, a field commander in the 1994-96 war for independence
with Russia, has lately been rallying the country's opposition
around a demand that Maskhadov resign. The president has so far
stood firm, and said Sunday that Raduyev and two other opposition
figures had proposed a compromise.
	   In September, Maskhadov had told a rally of his followers that
Raduyev should be publicly executed in the central square in
Grozny.
	   Raduyev and other opponents have accused Maskhadov of failing to
restore order in the breakaway republic after the war with Russia.
	   Shamil Basayev, a former prime minister, went on television
Monday night to say that Maskhadov's resignation ``will be useful
both for Chechen security and for the strengthening of the
independent Chechen state.''
	   Even the government acknowledges that Chechnya has been plagued
by violence and kidnappings. Chechen security forces have lately
been waging a campaign to bring order, although the campaign itself
has led to a spate of attacks against security officials.
	   A news report Wednesday said two security officials were killed
in what the government suspects was retaliation for the crackdown.
	   Security Ministry officials said two of their staff in Grozny
have been found with their throats cut, Interfax reported. The
ministry said the killings were an attempt to thwart the anti-crime
campaign.
	   Late last month, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, Shadid
Bargishev, was killed in a car bomb explosion.
	   Officials said Bargishev was targeted because he had promised to
launch a major offensive against hostage-takers, and he had
recently succeeded in securing the release of several captives,
including a British couple.
	   About 100 people are believed still held in Chechnya, including
three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent, but no country has
recognized its independence, and Moscow insists the territory is
part of Russia.

Reigning champion Cuba loses first set, but beats Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cuba, the reigning world and Olympic champion,
rebounded from an early surprise to beat Bulgaria 13-15, 15-6,
15-8, 15-8 Wednesday in the preliminary round of the 16-nation
Women's World Volleyball championships.
	   Together with Cuba, Japan, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, China
and South Korea remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   Playing before 1,000 spectators at Tokuyama, western Japan,
Bulgaria, led by Antonina Zetova's 13 points, took a 6-2 initial
lead and went on to win the first set. But Cuba then took control
of the one-hour, 32-minute match.
	   Anal Fernandez Valle led the Cuban team with seven points,
including five attack points.
	   ``We had a very hard time today. We have not fought against
Bulgaria for a long time, and we never expected that they were such
a strong team,'' said Cuban captain Regla Bell McKenzie.
	   Bulgarian captain Emilia Pashova said, ``Cuba was just too
strong for us. However, we are very satisfied with the result of
the match today.''
	   In another Group B match, Simona Rinieri scored 11 points,
leading Italy to a 15-7, 15-4, 15-3 victory over the United States,
which placed sixth in the previous world championship in San Paulo,
Brazil, in 1994.
	   The Americans had lost to Cuba on the opening day Tuesday.
	   Allison Weston led the U.S. team with four points, including
three attack points.
	   ``We didn't play well today. Probably it was our worst play in a
long time. As a team, we were confident enough, and I think our
serves were good today. However, our offensive running and
attacking went really bad,'' said U.S. team captain Salima
Davidson.
	   Japan, led by Miki Sasaki's six points, beat Kenya 15-5, 15-4,
15-2 at Yoyogi Stadium in downtown Tokyo.
	   The Japanese shared the Group A lead at 2-0 with the
Netherlands, which needed only 64 minutes to defeat Peru 15-3,
15-6, 16-14. Elles Leferink scored 10 points, including three
attack points and six serve points.
	   Peru and Kenya are winless.
	   In Group C, Russia, the 1994 bronze medalist, beat Germany 15-8,
15-4, 15-6 and silver medalist Brazil downed the Dominican Republic
15-1, 15-4, 15-4 at Matsumoto, northwest of Tokyo.
	   Russia led the group with two victories against no defeats.
Brazil and the Dominican Republic were 1-1, and Germany, eighth in
the 1996 Olympics, was winless.
	   Olympic silver medalist China edged Croatia 9-15, 15-5, 15-4,
12-15, 15-11 and led Group D with South Korea.
	   South Korea scored its second victory by beating Thailand 15-0,
15-11, 15-10.
	   Croatia and Thailand both were 0-2.
	   The top three teams in each of the four-team groups, playing in
four different Japanese cities, will advance to the quarterfinal
round Nov. 7-9 in Nagoya and Fukuoka. The semifinals and finals
will be played Nov. 11-12 in Osaka.
	   The world championship for men will be played in Japan Nov.
13-29.

 &UR; US Defense Secretary Cohen arrives in Qatar &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATES with arrival in Qatar; new troop

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied
Gulf states Wednesday for support of possible military action
against Iraq but _ at least publicly _ he appeared to be winning
little backing.
	   On Tuesday, after Cohen arrived in the Gulf, a Saudi Arabian
government official said the kingdom could not be used for a strike
against Iraq, and a Kuwaiti spokesman said the emirate was not
involved in the U.N.-Iraq dispute.
	   Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with disarmament
monitors has been condemned by the U.N. Security Council as a
``flagrant violation'' of the country's agreements with the world
body.
	   Cohen arrived late Wednesday in Qatar for talks with its
government, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Doha said on
condition of anonymity. He was scheduled to hold talks with the
emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and spend the night on the
peninsula.
	   The defense secretary is expected to stop Thursday in the United
Arab Emirates and then travel to Egypt for talks with President
Hosni Mubarak.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Cohen held talks with Bahrain's crown prince,
Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, in Manama and with Kuwait's emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in Kuwait City. He did not speak to
reporters after the meetings.
	   On Tuesday, Cohen began his tour with talks with King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia. There have been different accounts of what
transpired.
	   The Pentagon has said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq, but a Saudi official _
speaking on condition of anonymity _ said King Fahd told the
defense secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for
attacks on Iraq.''
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the world body over
weapons inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states
in opening its airbases to American and British warplanes.
	   But on Tuesday night, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry
said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between the
United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed attacking Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they were
privately assured of support. Arab newspapers reported that Cohen
was actually told that Arab leaders would support an attack on Iraq
only if it was guaranteed to remove President Saddam Hussein.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, more than 20 warships
including the carrier USS Eisenhower, and about 170 warplanes and
helicopters in the Gulf region, according to the Pentagon.

Angolan official says army back at war with rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A senior Angolan official said Wednesday
his government was waging an undeclared, low-intensity war against
the former rebel group UNITA, which he accused of failing to
respect the country's 1994 peace accord.
	   Jorge Chicote, Angola's deputy foreign minister, said the army
and police were engaging in clashes in rural areas of the southwest
African country with marauding bands of UNITA guerrillas.
	   ``There is already a war going on in Angola,'' Chicote said in
an interview with Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   He said UNITA never fully disbanded its army after signing the
United Nations-brokered peace deal which ended a two-decade civil
war between the government and rebels.
	   The peace accord is verging on collapse. The government last
month severed all contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi because
he has refused to surrender control of his central highland
strongholds to the government.
	   UNITA has rearmed and in recent months has attacked outlying
villages and towns in the vast country, according to Chicote.
	   ``The government has a responsibility to ensure the security and
stability of the Angolan people, to destroy all illegal military
concentrations,'' Chicote said from Austria where he was attending
a meeting.
	   But a UNITA spokesman in Lisbon denied the claims, saying the
recent skirmishes were between police and gangs of bandits made up
of demobilized troops from both sides' armies.
	   ``UNITA can't fight because it doesn't have an army any more,''
Rui Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   Oliveira said the government recently attacked villages in Uige
and Malanje provinces where the local population was loyal to UNITA
and had resisted the imposition of government control.
	   There has been no independent verification of the fighting.
	   The United Nations, which after the peace accord stationed more
than 7,000 troops in Angola to monitor its implementation, has
scaled down its presence to a few hundred staff.
	   Some 500,000 people were killed in the war which broke out
following independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year when UNITA,
a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, rejected its defeat in the country's first
democratic elections.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A plan to significantly ease the 1996
European Union ban on British beef exports was blocked by EU
veterinary officials Wednesday but is likely to be approved later
this month, officials said Wednesday.

nations was enough to postpone, for now, a plan to allow the export
of beef from British cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996.
	   Exports of British beef were banned in March 1996 after Britain
announced a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease in British
beef and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
	   Separately, the commission delayed a decision to ban export of
beef and cattle from Portugal because the text of that decision was
not ready. The commission said it will impose the ban within days
after its legal service has examined the small print.
	   The commission has proposed the export ban due to a sharp rise
in Portuguese cases of ``mad cow'' disease.
	   British exports were banned over two years ago, after an
outbreak of ``mad cow disease''
	   The plan to resume British sales, put forward by the EU
Commission in June, now goes to EU farms ministers, who meet Nov.
23-24. A simple majority will suffice there to approve the measure.
	   At the veterinary committee meeting, eight EU countries endorsed
the beef export plan. The Netherlands and Luxembourg abstained.
Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Austria opposed the plan and
formed a ``blocking minority.''
	   The National Farmers' Union said a decision to resume sales
would help inject confidence into the farming community.
	   The British farm sector was not downcast after Wednesday's block
since a lifting of the ban now became a realistic possibility.
	   Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, called the
vote ``great news which puts us on track for the lifting of the
beef ban before Christmas.''
	   The date-based British beef export plan follows a Commission
decision in May to allow the export from June 1 of beef from
Northern Ireland certified to be free of ``mad cow'' disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
	   The significantly broader date-based scheme would allow the
export of British beef from animals born after Britain banned the
use of cattle and sheep remains in animal feed and prohibited farms
from holding those remains. BSE is believed to have spread through
BSE-infected animal feed.
	   Britain has reported the vast majority of BSE cases in Europe.

Malaysia's treatment of Anwar could hurt region: Thai minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Malaysian foreign minister's reaction, grafs 2,
10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's foreign minister fears that
Malaysia's treatment of sacked Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
could damage the bargaining power of Southeast Asia with the rest
of the world, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Malaysia's foreign minister replied that such a suggestion is
illogical.
	   Malaysia put Anwar on trial this week on charges of abuse of
power and illicit sex. Critics say he is being victimized after
losing a power struggle with his one-time mentor, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan was quoted by the newspaper
The Nation as saying the trial had far-reaching implications for
the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to which
both Malaysia and Thailand belong.
	   ``Several nations have expressed their concerns over the issue,
which could possibly affect ASEAN's unity and image,'' Surin was
quoted as saying.
	   The paper said he added: ``Malaysia's action is hindering ASEAN
unity, which could decrease the group's bargaining power in
international negotiations.
	   ``ASEAN is working hard to prevent the impact of the ongoing
economic crisis from affecting ASEAN unity in an attempt to
preserve our capacity to negotiate.
	   ``I want to insist that my opinion is based on good faith, and
it must be clear that we are expressing ourselves in good faith for
the sake of ASEAN.''
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul told The Associated
Press that Surin felt he was misquoted and that the trial by itself
could not affect ASEAN unity.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi
said, ``I don't believe Surin could have made such a ridiculous
statement.''
	   Abdullah said Anwar is being prosecuted according to the law and
it is illogical to suggest his trial could cause ASEAN problems.
	   ASEAN has a long tradition of refusing to criticize the internal
affairs of member states, but the old rules have been cracking
recently as the region grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   Surin has pushed for a review of the non-interference policy,
noting that the problems of member states often have effects on
their neighbors.
	   The proposal has been supported only by the Philippines. The two
countries are considered ASEAN's most democratic and open. Other
ASEAN states include Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore
and Vietnam.
	   Anwar faces five charges of corruption and five of illegal sex
acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Among other things, the men had been divided over the best
course to minimize the impact of the economic crisis.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a black eye and bruises. He
claimed police beat him after his arrest. Tens of thousands of
Malaysians have joined street protests to support him.

French police step up security ahead of new student protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police announced plans for tight security in
the capital during a new protest by disgruntled high school
students set for Thursday.
	   Police banned street parking as of Wednesday evening and urged
merchants to shutter their shops along the planned march route from
the Montparnasse train station to the Education Ministry.
	   In a communique issued Wednesday, the police said they were
worried the protest could get ``out of control'' and said thousands
of police would be deployed to try to prevent violence.
	   Two recent student protests have drawn hundreds of thousands of
protesters and disintegrated into violent rock-throwing
demonstrations, resulting in injuries and property damage.
	   Some high school students remain skeptical that plans by the
Education Ministry to increase the number of teachers, improve
equipment and lighten their load will really be carried out.

Operations plan for extraction force to be ready next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO ambassadors approved the ``initial
concept of operations'' for the Kosovo extraction force Wednesday
and are expected to given their backing to the final operations
plan next week, NATO officials said.
	   The extraction force made up of allied soldiers will be
responsible for the emergency rescue of civilian ``ground
verifiers'' now being dispatched to Kosovo should they run into
unexpected physical danger.
	   As part of the deal struck by U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke
Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, about 2,000
verifiers are being recruited, trained and sent to Kosovo, a
southern province of Serbia, to insure that Milosevic abides by the
agreement. They are under the direction of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   The ground verifiers are being supplemented by surveillance
aircraft.
	   NATO officials said the ceasefire in Kosovo, where hundreds of
people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced in seven
months of conflict between the ruling Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians, seems to be holding.
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population and suffered the most during the fighting. As many as
300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven from their homes by
Serb police and army forces.
	   The ambassadors, who make up the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
top policymaking body, sent the approved initial concept of
operations back to Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in
Europe, and instructed him to return with an operations plan in the
next few days.
	   NATO officials were reluctant to reveal details, saying only
that the military is looking at ``a reasonable-sized force'' based
close to Kosovo and ``able to react in a matter of minutes.''
	   First choice of location is Macedonia, on Kosovo's southern
border. But Macedonia has just had an election and the NATO
alliance must wait for the new government to be formed before
moving ahead with plans. The old Macedonian government already gave
its approval for NATO to base its air surveillance mission in
Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
	   NATO officials insisted that the extraction force was not aimed
at pulling out the OSCE verifiers but to deal with individuals or
small groups that may find themselves needing special security
help.
	   NATO considers the situation in Kosovo to be stable. Officials
said there have not been any significant skirmishes since Oct. 28,
the date the alliance determined that Milosevic was largely in
compliance with U.N. demands that he end his crackdown on ethnic
Albanians.
	   The alliance is keeping a close eye on the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, which at one point had controlled as much as 40
percent of the province. There have been reports that the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas have put up some checkpoints and have been
digging in new positions in some areas, a NATO official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He said about 200 verifiers are now in place in Kosovo, though
about half of them are personnel from the previous Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, who were already in place.

French ferry workers strike, reducing services to England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ French ferry workers walked out Wednesday
for the second straight day, sharply reducing services across the
English Channel.
	   About 90 percent of personnel at the Seafrance company were on
strike, preventing two ships, the Cezanne and the Renoir, which
sail daily for England, from sailing.
	   A third ship on its way from England to its home port in Calais
had to be directed to the French port of Dunkirk. Seafrance was
advising its customers to use the British company P&AMP;0.
	   However, Seafrance strikers have threatened to block P&AMP;O ships
from docking in Calais.
	   The workers are protesting the hiring of a former sailor from
outside the company to be the new chief of passenger service. The
strikers say he is unqualified for the post.
	   No meetings between Seafrance management and the striking
workers are scheduled for the time being.

Thailand running trade surplus with U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand ran a trade surplus with the
United States of dlrs 3.3 billion in the year to July 31, mainly
due to increased agricultural and food product exports, a U.S.
government agency said Wednesday.
	   The U.S. Information Service said Thailand exported more goods
to the United States than any other country in the first seven
months of this year, with total trade between the two countries
totaling dlrs 10.5 billion.
	   The figures were released in the context of Thai media criticism
of U.S. poultry exports to Thailand, which is itself a major
exporter of poultry, especially frozen chicken.
	   The U.S. agency said the United States imported dlrs 1.47
billion worth of Thai agricultural, food, forest and fishery
products, an increase of more than 6 percent from a year earlier.
	   It added that Thailand imported dlrs 289 million of U.S.
agricultural products, down 24 percent from the year-ago period.
The United States would normally take close to 20 percent of total
annual Thai exports, but would take around 22 percent this year.

Saudis offer arbitration in border dispute with Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Saudi Arabia is willing to accept international
arbitration of its border dispute with Yemen, the Saudi interior
minister said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz told Al-Siyassah that Riyadh was
ready to settle its border dispute with Yemen through continuing
talks or by ``resorting to international arbitration.''
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil
fields.
	   Late last month, Eritrea returned a Red Sea island to Yemen in
compliance with a court ruling after the two sides resorted to
international arbitration.

Weak demand seen lowering inflation in Philippines in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Weak consumer demand is expected to
have lowered inflation pressure on all commodity groups in the
Philippines in October, economists said Wednesday.
	   The economists said they expect October inflation to be 9.8
percent year-on-year, down from 10 percent in September. The data
is to be released Thursday.
	   In the nine months to September, inflation averaged 9.4 percent,
lower than the government's target of 10 percent for the year.
Inflation hit double-digit levels in May for the first time in
nearly two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.
	   An economic slowdown triggered by the regional financial crisis
has caused demand for most consumer items, including basic
commodities, to decline over the past few months. Food prices,
which have a hefty weighting on the consumer prices index, have
been softening since August.
	   ``With the weak economy, consumers are being very cautious with
their purchases _ and most people (are) sticking to very tight
budgets,'' said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus Securities
Corp.
	   During the second quarter of the year, the country's gross
national product shrank 0.7 percent, its first contraction in five
years. Economists expect either no growth or a contraction in the
third quarter.
	   The impact of droughts caused by the El Nino weather condition,
which lowered growth in the first half, will not be reflected in
the October inflation data, economists say.
	   ``Even if some provinces are still recovering from the effects
of the drought, most major agricultural producing provinces have
since resumed normal activities,'' said Luz Lorenzo, research head
at ATR Securities Inc.
	   Lorenzo said, however, that recent typhoons could cause
inflationary pressures over the next two months.
	   The Philippines is still recovering from the effects of two
typhoons last month that destroyed some 4 billion pesos (dlrs 100
million) worth of crops. The areas hardest hit by the typhoons
account for 55 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Lorenzo doesn't expect the effect of the typhoons on consumer
prices will be dramatic since the government has said it is
prepared to import basic commodities such as rice, sugar and corn
to make up for any supply shortfall.
	   ``As long as the government is ready to import, prices will
remain stable,'' she said.
	   Some economists now expect inflation to average 9.6 percent this
year, lower than the government's target of 10 percent.

Dutch support widens for euthanasia, assisted suicide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch approval of euthanasia and
assisted suicide has widened to 92 percent, but that broad support
hinges on doctors' strict adherence to mercy killing guidelines, a
study released Wednesday found.
	   In this country known for its permissive euthanasia policy, only
8 percent of those surveyed by the NIPO polling agency said they
oppose the practice.
	   The telephone survey of 1,201 people aged 18 and older was
commissioned by the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society. No margin
of error was given.
	   In a similar study conducted two years ago, approval of
euthanasia was pegged at 80 percent. Ditte Papousek, a spokeswoman
for the euthanasia society, declined to speculate about the reasons
behind the rise.
	   Overwhelming support also was registered among Roman Catholics
surveyed in the poll, with 96 percent backing euthanasia and
assisted suicide, Papousek said.
	   ``This underlines what we see as a trend that people think of
euthanasia as a human right and as a matter of
self-determination,'' she said.
	   Although respondents were overwhelmingly in favor of the right
to death with dignity, they made it clear in more detailed
follow-up questions that their support came with a condition:
Doctors must carefully follow the rules.
	   In 1993, the Dutch parliament became the first in the world to
allow euthanasia when it passed strict guidelines allowing doctors
to perform the procedure.
	   Those guidelines stipulate that candidates must suffer from
unbearable and irremediable pain and must request death repeatedly
and lucidly. Doctors must also seek a second opinion and report all
euthanasia deaths to authorities.
	   The Dutch draw a distinction between euthanasia, which usually
involves doctors administering a lethal injection, and assisted
suicide, which involves patients ending their own lives, most often
by overdosing on drugs provided by their doctors.
	   Although both remain technically illegal, doctors who follow the
rules can expect immunity from prosecution.
	   In the past, euthanasia cases were screened by public
prosecutors who occasionally took doctors to court when they
violated guidelines. Fearful of such prosecutions, many doctors do
not report euthanasia deaths.
	   But this week, five new panels made up of doctors and legal and
ethic experts were introduced nationwide to review instances of
mercy killing and determine whether any cases should be transferred
to prosecutors.
	   About 3,600 euthanasia cases were reported last year, or 3
percent of all deaths, said Papousek.

Goiter reduced sharply in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is crediting a 4-year-old program
to encourage use of iodized salt for a drop in the incidence of
goiter, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Nguyen Tien Dinh, chairman of the National Anti-Goiter Program,
said the goiter rate has fallen from 22.2 percent in 1993 to 14.9
percent now.
	   In addition, the number of children ages 8 to 12 with no access
to iodized salt has fallen to 30 percent from 94 percent five years
ago.
	   The figures were based on a four-month survey that concluded in
September, Dinh said.
	   Dinh said the government's target is to reduce the goiter rate
to under 5 percent by the year 2005.

Philippine government predicts economy will expand in first nine
</HEADLINE>
months &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government expects the
economy to expand in this year's first nine months as strong growth
in services offsets heavy rain's harm to agricultural production in
the third quarter, a finance official said Wednesday.
	   For the third quarter, government economic planners are
predicting a gross national product growth of at least 0.3 percent,
the official said.
	   This would bring the average GNP growth for the first nine
months of the year to at least 0.5 percent. GNP grew 2.0 percent in
the first quarter, but shrank 0.7 percent in the second quarter,
the first time a contraction was recorded in five years.
	   The official data are expected to be released at the end of the
month.
	   The economic growth would set the Philippines apart from many of
its neighbors in Southeast Asia, which have seen their economies
fall into recession as a result of the region's financial crisis.
	   Services growth is traditionally stronger in the Philippines in
the second half of the year because of increased activity ahead of
the Christmas holiday.
	   ``We are expecting services growth to be strong enough to
counter the negative impact of poor agricultural growth,'' said the
finance official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Although the Agriculture Department has said farm output may
grow by up to 2 percent this year, its says it will most likely
contract because of expected heavy rains in the remainder of the
year.
	   The department has estimated that agricultural production in the
third quarter contracted by between 1 and 4 percent.
	   The finance official said the GNP growth estimates were among
projections submitted by the Philippine government to an
International Monetary Fund mission that is in Manila to assess the
country's economic performance.
	   The mission, which arrived Tuesday, is expected to complete by

additional funds from the IMF.
	   On Wednesday, the Philippine Central Bank received a dlrs 280
million loan from the IMF that was added to its foreign currency
reserves. At the end of September, the central bank's reserves
stood at dlrs 10.6 billion.
	   The loan is part of an estimated dlrs 1.3 billion standby credit
arrangement previously agreed to by the IMF and the Philippines.

Clash wounds three Serbs

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbs were wounded after their
cars were raked by gunfire from separatist ethnic Albanians, police
said Wednesday. The violence highlighted Kosovo's continuing
potential for bloodshed despite last month's peace agreement.
	   Serb police at a checkpoint near Sipitula, about 15 kilometers
(nine miles) west of Pristina, said Albanian guerrillas opened fire
on two vehicles from the nearby Belacevac coal mine Tuesday
evening.
	   They said an ensuing gunfight between police and the attackers
lasted an hour.
	   Three miners in the two cars were injured and taken to Pristina
hospital, according to police. The cars, still sitting at the
checkpoint Wednesday morning, had several bullet holes or marks in
the windshields and chassis.
	   Villagers said Serb police began shooting at the village at
about the same time police said the gunfight began. The villagers
said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or homes of
friends and relatives.
	   A few who returned Wednesday morning said police routinely
attack the village and force them to flee.
	   In the Netherlands, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal locked horns with the Yugoslav government over the
tribunal's jurisdiction in Kosovo.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in The Hague that her court
has been given U.N. authority to investigate war crimes in any part
of Yugoslavia. She was responding to assertions by Yugoslav
government officials that Kosovo is off limits to tribunal
investigations.
	   Arbour said Yugoslav authorities still not have issued visas for
a week-long tribune mission to Belgrade and Kosovo, scheduled to
start Friday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population, overwhelmingly favor independence. The Oct. 12
agreement, wrested from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
suspended a nearly eight-month crackdown in the province that left
hundreds dead _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of
thousands others homeless.
	   While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they have
grudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise their
goal of independence.
	   Alluding to the police threat to Albanian refugees before the
attack, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader said more needs to be
done to ensure the safety of refugees going back home.
	   Ibrahim Rugova spoke Tuesday after venturing into the
countryside for the first time in nine years.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the process to return.
But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central
Kosovo. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying
to persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo's
independence from Serbia and settle for some form of self-rule.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital
Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
set up a huge police presence.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians
from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center _ reflecting views of the Rugova
camp _ reported Serb shelling of Petrovo, 30 kilometers (about 20
miles) southwest of Pristina on Wednesday.
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more
confidence and stability.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   On Wednesday, they announced they are holding two politicians
from Rugova's party who went missing Oct. 30 in Malisevo, southwest
of Pristina. The two, Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku, were
conducting an anti-KLA campaign and ``coaxed people to turn in
their arms,'' said a KLA statement printed in the daily Koha
Ditore.
	   Yugoslavia's state news agency, Tanjug, said two ethnic
Albanians were sentenced to two- and three-year prison terms for
being weapons-carrying KLA members.

Russian lawmakers urge political asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS grafs 3-6 with 7 grafs to UPDATE with report saying
Ocalan requested asylum, quote from letter to Duma, reax from
Turkish official. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a
terrorist organization.
	   Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,
who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The conflict
has killed an estimated 37,000 people.
	   Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seeking
asylum after Ocalan wrote the State Duma, parliament's lower house,
thanking it for supporting his cause. Ocalan had officially
requested asylum, Interfax reported.
	   ``This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people,'' Nikiforenko
said.
	   The Duma supported Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish
government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that
Turkey withdraw its troops.
	   In his letter to the Duma, Ocalan accused the Turkish government
of trying ``to annihilate the leadership of the Kurdish Workers
Party, drown in blood the national liberation struggle by the
Kurdish people and thus pave the way for their control of the
entire Middle East.''
	   Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized the Duma
vote, and said he hoped President Boris Yeltsin would `take on a
realistic and constructive approach.''
	   ``Instead of forging ties with a terrorist organization like the
PKK, (Russia) should keep good relations with a country like
Turkey,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara, the Turkish capital.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear. Turkey says he recently left
Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm
that he is in the country.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in
the Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran
and Syria.

Lawmakers withhold support for Tung's governing plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Tung's reaction, graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a showdown with Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa and his administration, lawmakers voted Wednesday to
withhold support for his plans for governing Hong Kong.
	   Pro-democracy lawmakers succeeded in blocking a traditional
motion of thanks for Tung's annual policy address, delivered last
month, which outlines his governing strategy for the next 12
months.
	   In debates last month on the motion, Tung came under fire for
not doing enough to stimulate Hong Kong's sagging economy and to
help the unemployed.
	   The motion is symbolic, but the symbolism is important because
it could illustrate Tung's crumbling popular support as Hong Kong
struggles through hard times that have thrown thousands of people
out of work and seen property prices collapse.
	   Speaking to reporters at a separate function, Tung dismissed the
motion as ``an internal matter for the legislature.'' He said some
politicians might have tried to ``politicize this policy speech.''
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Tung's deputy, also expressed
disappointment after the vote, but said it would not affect the
administration's ``commitment in implementing the various proposals
and pledges the chief executive has made.''
	   She also pledged to continue efforts to build a ``constructive
relationship'' with the legislature and ``to cooperate with them on
the basis of mutual understanding and respect.''
	   In 1996, when then Governor Chris Patten delivered the last
policy address under British colonial rule, the legislature voted
to express ``deep regret'' that Britain failed to pursue full
democratization during its 155 years in Hong Kong.

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S. officials now saying they are
seeking clarification on some security issues, quotes from
Palestinian negotiator. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that
was to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the ministers would
not be convened until Israel receives written guarantees from the
United States that 30 Palestinian fugitives will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the 12-week time table that was to go
begin Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due
Nov. 16 _ in exchange for Palestinian security steps.
	   Netanyahu has said implementation would not begin until the
agreement is approved by the Cabinet and by Israel's parliament.
	   The U.S. position in the dispute was not clear.
	   U.S. State Department and White House officials earlier said
that the Palestinians have lived up to their obligations, but the
spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Larry Schwartz, said
Wednesday that ``there are some security issues where additional
clarification is being sought.''
	   U.S. officials are discussing the issue with both sides,
Schwartz said, adding that ``we expect that this process will be
completed shortly.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Netanyahu of seizing
a pretext in order to dismantle the accord before it has begun.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) is inventing new agreements. He does not want
to honor anything,'' an angry Erekat told The Associated Press.
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will created
during last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in
Maryland has dissipated and that the United States will be called
in as a referee throughout the implementation process.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive Thursday in the
region to oversee implementation.
	   At issue in the latest dispute is Israel's demand to receive
written U.S. guarantees that the Palestinians will arrest 30
Palestinians, most of them suspects in the killings of Israelis.
	   Bar-Illan said that during the Wye negotiations, the two sides
settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would arrest
the 30 suspects. He said Israel was given to understand that it
would receive written assurances on the arrests from the United
States before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would convene his
Cabinet in the afternoon once he had the U.S. guarantees in hand.
Minutes before the meeting was to begin, Bar-Illan said it had been
postponed indefinitely.
	   However, Bar-Illan said he believed that after two phone
conversations between Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, that the United States had moved closer to the
Israeli position. ``They now understand that this link is missing
and without it we cannot proceed,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Erekat accused the United States of being inconsistent. ``In one
statement, they say the Palestinians honored the agreement. In the
other they say certain sentences must be clarified,'' he said.
	   Asked by Israel radio if he was creating a crisis over a minor
issue, Netanyahu said: ``I just want to establish the principle.
... We are not reopening the agreement. We are insisting that the
agreement be honored to the letter.''
	   Netanyahu also said that he would not put up with Palestinian
violations of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he said.
``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''
	   Commenting on the confusion that has accompanied the first days
of the agreement, Israeli journalist Hemi Shalev wrote in the
Maariv daily: ``There were many in Israel who expected a moving
drama and others who expected a horrible tragedy, but no one
thought that this `historic' week would of all things be a comedy
of errors.''

Plan to ease EU ban on UK beef exports is blocked but will get
</HEADLINE>
green light &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A plan to significantly ease the 1996
European Union ban on British beef exports was blocked by EU
veterinary officials Wednesday but is likely to be approved later
this month, officials said Wednesday.
	   Opposition by veterinary officials from five of the 15 EU
nations was enough to postpone, for now, a plan to allow the export
of beef from British cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996.
	   Exports of British beef were banned in March 1996 after Britain
announced a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease in British
beef and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
	   Separately, the commission delayed a decision to ban beef and
cattle exports from Portugal because the text of that decision was
not ready. The commission said it will impose the ban within days
after its legal service has examined the small print.
	   The commission has proposed the export ban due to a sharp rise
in Portuguese cases of ``mad cow'' disease.
	   British exports were banned over two years ago, after an
outbreak of ``mad cow disease,'' which was believed to have spread
through Europe in animal feed.
	   The plan to resume British sales, put forward by the EU
Commission in June, now goes to EU farms ministers, who meet Nov.
23-24. A simple majority will suffice to approve the measure.
	   At the veterinary committee meeting, eight EU countries endorsed
the beef export plan. The Netherlands and Luxembourg abstained.
Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Austria opposed the plan and
formed a ``blocking minority.''
	   The National Farmers' Union said a decision to resume sales
would help inject confidence into the farming community.
	   After Wednesday's block, the British farm sector took heart
since a lifting of the ban was now a possibility.
	   Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, called the
vote ``great news which puts us on track for the lifting of the
beef ban before Christmas.''
	   The date-based British plan follows a Commission decision in May
to allow the export from June 1 of beef from Northern Ireland
certified to be free of ``mad cow'' disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
	   The significantly broader date-based scheme would allow the
export of British beef from animals born after Britain banned the
use of cattle and sheep remains in animal feed and prohibited farms
from holding those remains. BSE is believed to have spread through
BSE-infected animal feed.
	   Britain has reported the vast majority of BSE cases in Europe.

Govt. seeks urgent solutions to power shortage in Russian east
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with government sending fuel to Kamchatka. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government on Wednesday sent a tanker full of
fuel to help relieve an energy shortage on the eastern peninsula of
Kamchatka, where residents have been receiving power for only a few
hours a day.
	   ``Kamchatka will not freeze this winter,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Vladimir Bulgak told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A tanker was dispatched from the eastern city of Nakhodka on
Wednesday and was expected in Kamchatka in two or three days, he
said.
	   The region's existing fuel supplies were expected to last only
about 10 more days in peninsula's main city,
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Residents have been receiving electricity
for about three to four hours a day, the Interfax news agency said.
	   A special commission from the Ministry of Emergency Situations
arrived on Wednesday and was seeking to stabilize the situation
before the winter hits with full force, the report said.
	   Snow already has begun to fall and the temperature is hovering
around freezing.
	   The impoverished region has had trouble purchasing adequate fuel
supplies for years, and conditions have been made worse by Russia's
latest economic crisis.

UN chief in Bosnia wants NATO in for the long-haul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The United Nations' special
representative to Bosnia said Wednesday that peacekeeping work in
the country was far from done and she'd like NATO to keep its
troops there for some time to come.
	   ''Our cooperation with NATO is very good,'' Elisabeth Rehn told
reporters after briefing the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top
policymaking body. ''The only thing I was asking them is they
should not disappear for some while.''
	   NATO maintains about 30,000 troops in Bosnia as its
Stabilization Force, or SFOR, about half the number that originally
entered the country in December 1995 to support the Dayton peace
agreement.
	   Carlos Westendorp, the high representative in Bosnia overseeing
the civilian aspects of the Dayton agreement, has talked about
needing NATO presence for two more years, said Mrs. Rehn.
	   ''I'm not sure that's enough,'' she said. ''SFOR should stay for
some years - two, three, four, whatever.''

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday
for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and
said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.
	   Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged ``all
public and private institutions and all men of good will'' to do
all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction and death.''
	   Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief
agencies have been overwhelmed.
	   Among those attending the audience were six Russian cosmonauts
taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they gave John Paul a
spacesuit.

Angolan official says army back at war with rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A senior Angolan official said Wednesday
his government was waging an undeclared, low-intensity war against
the former rebel group UNITA, which he accused of failing to
respect the country's 1994 peace accord.
	   Jorge Chicote, Angola's deputy foreign minister, said the army
and police were engaging in clashes in rural areas of the southwest
African country with marauding bands of UNITA guerrillas.
	   ``There is already a war going on in Angola,'' Chicote said in
an interview with Portuguese state radio Antena 1.
	   He said UNITA never fully disbanded its army after signing the
U.N.-brokered peace deal which ended a two-decade civil war between
the government and rebels.
	   The peace accord is on the verge of collapse. The government
last month severed all contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
because he has refused to surrender control of his central highland
strongholds to the government.
	   UNITA has rearmed and in recent months has attacked outlying
villages and towns in the vast country, according to Chicote.
	   ``The government has a responsibility to ensure the security and
stability of the Angolan people, to destroy all illegal military
concentrations,'' Chicote said from Austria where he was attending
a meeting.
	   But a UNITA spokesman in Lisbon denied the claims, saying the
recent skirmishes were between police and gangs of bandits made up
of demobilized troops from both sides' armies.
	   ``UNITA can't fight because it doesn't have an army any more,''
Rui Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   Oliveira said the government recently attacked villages in Uige
and Malanje provinces where the local population was loyal to UNITA
and had resisted the imposition of government control.
	   There has been no independent verification of the fighting.
	   The United Nations, which after the peace accord stationed more
than 7,000 troops in Angola to monitor its implementation, has
scaled down its presence to a few hundred staff.
	   Some 500,000 people were killed in the war which broke out after
independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year when UNITA,
a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, rejected its defeat in the country's first
democratic elections.

Swatch Group sells Smart Car stake to Germany's Daimler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with companies not disclosing terms, Swatch giving
reason for sale. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Swatch Group said
Wednesday it has sold its stake in the Smart Car project to German
car giant Daimler-Benz, its partner in the venture.
	   The tiny two-seater Smart Car was developed by Micro Compact Car
AG, a joint venture between Daimler-Benz and Swatch Group, the
Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch wristwatch.
	   Swatch's decision to sell its 19 percent stake in the venture
gives Daimler full control of Micro Compact Car.
	   Neither Daimler nor Swatch provided terms of the transaction. A
German newspaper, Wirtschaftswoche, put the value at 117 million
marks (dlrs 70 million).
	   Swatch said it decided to sell its stake because MCC decided
against using Swatch's hybrid motor technology.
	   MCC will pay unspecified compensation to Swatch, which may later
license its technology to the merged Daimler and Chrysler group.
	   The car went on sale across Europe last month following a
six-month delay after it flunked the so-called ``moose test,''
mimicking a driver swerving to avoid an unexpected obstacle.
	   It is on sale in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland,
Austrian, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in special
``Smart Centers,'' which bypass normal auto dealers.
	   The 2.5-meter (yard) long Smart Car takes up around half of a
standard parking spot. With its bright yellow and red colors,
mix-and-match replaceable parts and all-plastic body, it is aimed
at a young market.

Prince Charles visits medieval city in the heart of Transylvania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Expected
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIBIU, Romania (AP) _ Is Prince Charles a distant relative of
Dracula?
	   The burghers of this Transylvanian city like to think so, and
Romanian genealogists and historians claim it's definitively true.
	   The heir to the British throne - on a tour of Eastern Europe -
spent a day in the heart of Transylvania, where the Dracula legend
was born. Bram Stoker's main character was inspired by Vlad the
Impaler, who was known for piercing his victims on spikes while he
ate his dinner.
	   There weren't any vampires in sight Wednesday, but the prince
mingled with thousands of people - Gypsies, women in fur coats and
a sea of children.
	   ``I told the prince to step into Diana's world of mercy,'' said
Florin Aradian, who traveled 400 kilometers (250 miles) to meet the
son of Queen Elizabeth. Many people in the crowd were talking about
Charles' late wife Diana, who died in a car crash in August 1997.
After the prince shook hands with him, Aradian said he was so moved
he would not wash his hand for one week.
	   Charles was cheered by people waving the Union Jack as he went
on a three-kilometer (two-mile) walk of this 13th century city, 225
kilometers (141 miles) northwest of the capital Bucharest.
	   In a speech Tuesday evening, Charles criticized the late
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's plans for demolishing
medieval rural cities in Transylvania. ``Those measures drove me to
despair,'' said the prince.
	   On the streets of Sibiu he stopped to chat with a Romanian woman
about her vinegar. He also stood on the Liars Bridge. This is a
place where for centuries young lovers made promises to each other
they never honored.
	   But most Romanians were excited by the prospect that prince
Charles may be a distant relative of Vlad - the Prince of Darkness.
	   ``It is an argument for our European roots,'' said Mihai Sorin
Radulescu, a historian and genealogist. He claimed Prince Charles
is related to Vlad through the impaler's brother Vlad Calugareanu,
whose descendants married into the British Royal Family.

Real Madrid admits interest in Liverpool striker McManaman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Reigning European champion Real Madrid sent
a team spy to watch Liverpool's attacking midfielder Steve
McManaman play and has admitted it plans to make further contact
with the player's agents.
	   ``We're going to make moves toward McManaman although not
directly witht the player,'' news reports Wednesday cited Real
Madrid deputy chairman Juan Manuel Herrero as saying.
	   Herrero said team spy Jose Martinez went to watch McManaman play
Tuesday in Liverpool's UEFA game against Valencia in Spain. The
long curly-haired midfielder scored to help Liverpool draw 2-2 and
qualify for the next round.
	   McManaman's contract with Liverpool expires in June 1999. The
club has let it be known it intends offering him an attractive
renewal deal.

Report: Terrorist suspect visited Albania in 1994
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, sought
by the United States for two deadly embassy bombings, met with
Albanian officials in April 1994 as a member of a Saudi Arabian
delegation, local media reported Wednesday.
	   The daily ``Gazeta Shqiptare'' quoted a former minister saying
that bin Laden was presented to him as a businessman who would
finance the building of several apartment blocks and a health care
center in an Albanian village.
	   ``We needed investments ... and I wouldn't become suspicious of
a member of an official delegation who signed in the name of a
charity organisation,'' said the former minister, who the paper
said did not want to be identified.
	   Government officials said they could not confirm the report
because it focused on events before their time in office of which
they had no knowledge.
	   Bin Laden is suspected of involvement in the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa in August that killed more than 200
people and wounded thousands.
	   The United States launched a retaliatory cruise missile attack
Aug. 20 on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan said
run by bin Laden.
	   Wednesday's report was the second in recent months linking
Albania to Mideastern radicals.
	   Five suspects believed to be Egyptian nationals were reported
arrested and spirited out of Albania with the help of American
agents this summer.
	   Four of them were sought in the 1993 assassination of Rifat
el-Mahgoub, the speaker of the Egyptian parliament, and an abortive
attempt several years later to blow up the Khan Khalili public
market in Cairo.
	   A sixth suspect, Salah el Saied, was killed in October 24, in a
shoot-out with Albanian special police in a Tirana suburb.
	   According to Albanian sources he was wanted by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency for threatening the U.S. Embassy in Tirana in
August.
	   Workers of several Arab charity organizations left Albania after
the first arrests took place.
	   Current officials of the Albanian National Information Service
have accused Bashkim Gazidede, the former head of the secret
service, of involvement in activities of Islamic terrorists
operating in Albania.
	   When riots started last year after the collapse of pyramid
schemes, Gazidede left Albania and is believed to be hiding in
Syria.
	   On Aug. 17, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines tightened security at
the American diplomatic compound in Tirana after U.S. officials
said they received credible evidence of a plan to attack the U.S.
mission.

of thousands of requests from people seeking access to their files,
agency chief Joachim Gauck said Wednesday.
	   Thousands more applications come in every month, said Gauck, a
former East German pastor. And while some critics charge that the
files are no longer relevant today, eight years after the fall of
the Berlin Wall, Gauck argued that it was too soon to consider
ending efforts to come to terms with East Germany's past.
	   More than half the 4 million requests made since the office
opened in 1992 involve employers wanting to know whether an
employee or applicant had connections with the Stasi, as the
Ministry for State Security was known.
	   But Gauck said it was ``absolute nonsense'' to accuse his agency
of helping promote ``witch hunts'' or ``winner's justice'' in
uncovering a person's Stasi past.
	   Almost 5 percent of teachers in East Berlin were found to have
informed for the Stasi, he noted as an example, but only 21 percent
of them lost their jobs as a result.
	   Gauck spoke at an annual conference of The Associated Press in
Germany.

Prosecutor insists right to investigate in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The chief prosecutor of the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal insisted Wednesday that Yugoslav
authorities are legally bound to let her investigate alleged
atrocities in Kosovo.
	   ``There have been numerous allegations specific and credible
enough to require further investigations,'' Louise Arbour of Canada
told reporters.
	   She said the allegations included claims of summary executions,
reprisal killings and the wanton destruction of villages.
	   Arbour is due to lead a team of U.N. investigators to Belgrade
and then into Kosovo on a weeklong mission starting Friday.
However, Belgrade authorities still have not issued visas clearing
the way for the visit to the troubled Yugoslav province, Arbour
said Wednesday.
	   Yugoslav ministers have repeatedly asserted that the U.N.
tribunal has no authority to investigate in the Kosovo, a province
in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Last Friday, Yugoslav Justice Minister Zoran Knezevic was quoted
by local media as saying the tribunal ``has no jurisdiction over
Kosovo, not according to any international document.''
	   Knezevic said ``The Hague tribunal has no place in Kosovo,''
because ``conflicts there were caused by terrorist actions of
Kosovo Albanians.''
	   But on Wednesday, Arbour, the tribunal's most senior prosecutor,
once again hammered home the court's assertion that it is legally
empowered to investigate in Kosovo.
	   ``The tribunal has jurisdiction over a wide range of offenses
that may have occurred in Kosovo,'' she said.
	   She cited the 1993 U.N. Security Council resolution which set up
the court, giving it a mandate to investigate any breaches of
international humanitarian law anywhere in the former Yugoslavia
since 1991.
	   Arbour declined to say what the tribunal would do if Yugoslav
authorities continue to refuse to issue visas for investigators.
	   ``It is my expectation that visas will be granted because the
law requires that they be granted and that I and my investigators
be granted access,'' Arbour said. ``This is clearly not a matter of
discretion. It is a legal requirement.''
	   Arbour also stressed that the tribunal mission would investigate
alleged atrocities by both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
	   Hundreds of people, Serbs and ethnic Albanians, have been killed
during seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, fled their homes in the province, which is 90 percent
ethnic Albanian.

Arafat meets king for talks on new peace accord with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with
King Juan Carlos in Madrid on Wednesday for talks on the new
land-for-security agreement he signed with Israel.
	   Arafat who arived late Tuesday, was to meet Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes later in the day.
	   The Palestinian leader was invited to Spain by Matutes, who was
present when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
signed the peace agreement Oct. 23 in Maryland.
	   The Wye Plantation accord calls on Israel to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a
Palestinian crackdown on Moslem extremists who oppose peace with
Israel.
	   But Israel said Tuesday it would not carry out the agreement
until it gets assurances that the Palestinian Authority headed by
Arafat will arrest 30 Palestinian fugitives.

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat saying 12 of the 30
Palestinians sought by Israel are already in detention, Israel
saying the 30 were responsible for the deaths of nearly 100
Israelis, UPGRADE attribution on U.S. statement; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that
was to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu aides said the ministers would not be convened until
Israel receives written guarantees from the United States that 30
Palestinians wanted by Israel will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the 12-week time table that was to go
begin Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due
Nov. 16 _ in exchange for Palestinian security steps.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily, saying Netanyahu was seizing a
pretext to try and dismantle the peace agreement. ``He (Netanyahu)
is inventing new agreements. He does not want to honor anything,''
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat sad.
	   However, despite the recriminations, there were first signs that
the dispute could be resolved. U.S. officials said they were
mediating and that they expected results ``shortly.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is visiting Spain, said
that 12 of the wanted Palestinians are in detention and that he
would do his best to apprehend the others.
	   ``We will continue working on this 100 percent ... but nobody
can ask us to achieve 100 percent results,'' Arafat told a news
conference in Madrid.
	   Palestinian security officials have said that several of the men
on Israel's wanted list were arrested and tried in recent years and
months, but never gave a specific number.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior Netanyahu adviser, said the 30 wanted
men were responsible for the deaths of nearly 100 Israelis and that
12 of those on Israel's list were employed by the Palestinian
security forces.
	   The delay of the Cabinet meeting means that implementation of
the peace accord is also being held up. Netanyahu has said he could
not move ahead without the formal approval of the Cabinet and the
Israeli parliament which is scheduled to vote on Nov. 12.
	   The new dispute made it clear that any good will created during
last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in Maryland
has dissipated and that the United States will be called in as a
referee throughout the implementation process.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region on
Thursday to oversee implementation.
	   However, even the U.S. position was not clearcut.
	   U.S. State Department and White House officials said earlier
that the Palestinians have lived up to their obligations, but the
U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, said in a statement
Wednesday that ``there are some security issues where additional
clarification is being sought.''
	   At issue is Israel's demand to receive written U.S. guarantees
that the Palestinians will arrest the 30 Palestinians.
	   Bar-Illan said that during the Wye negotiations, the two sides
settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would arrest
the 30 suspects. He said Israel was given to understand that it
would receive written assurances on the arrests from the United
States before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would only convene his
Cabinet at 1:30 p.m. (1130 gmt), as tentatively scheduled, once he
he had the U.S. guarantees in hand. Minutes before the meeting was
to begin, Bar-Illan said it had been postponed indefinitely.
	   However, Bar-Illan said he believed that after two phone
conversations between Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the United States moved closer to the Israeli
position. ``They now understand that this link is missing and
without it we cannot proceed,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu said he would not put up with Palestinian violations
of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he told
Israel radio. ``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''

Thousands of miners demonstrate across Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thousands of miners demonstrated across
Ukraine on Wednesday, demanding long-overdue salaries and more
government support for the struggling coal industry.
	   In the capital Kiev, thousands of miners in dirty work clothes
and helmets marched down the central Khreshchatyk street, carrying
a makeshift coffin with pieces of coal inside and the words ``Coal
Industry'' written on it.
	   The miners then rallied near parliament and government
headquarters while Communist and nationalist lawmakers who came out
to greet them argued over who is to blame for the industry's woes.
	   Ukraine's coal industry long has been plagued by accidents,
inefficiency and lack of reforms. The government has failed to
close many non-profitable mines but at the same time had no cash to
provide enough subsidies to keep the industry afloat.
	   Wednesday's one-day warning strike was declared by four miners'
unions who said in an October appeal to workers that miners ``have
become hostages to the thoughtless and criminal policy of the
authorities.''
	   ``Miners work for half a year and even more without being paid
for their hard work, and some of them receive their back wages
posthumously,'' the appeal said.
	   Organizers had hoped for the strike to involve 163 out of
Ukraine's 210 coal mines, but it was not immediately clear how many
mines actually went on strike.
	   About 3,000 to 4,000 miners rallied in the eastern coal capital
of Donetsk and hundreds besieged the regional administration
headquarters in the western city of Lviv, banging their helmets on
the pavement in protest.
	   ``I've not been paid for the past seven months,'' said Anna
Tereshkova, a mine employee who demonstrated in Lviv.
	   More than 300 workers have died in mine accidents this year,
often blamed on the lack of funds to modernize equipment and
improve work safety. Major worker strikes idled dozens of mines in
Ukraine last spring and summer.
	   Meanwhile, the mines' debt to the budget and the state Pension
Fund has reached about 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 647 million), while
the miners are owed 2.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 705 million) in back
wages, First Deputy Coal Industry Minister Hryhoriy Spektor told
parliament Wednesday.
	   Spektor said the lack of government subsidies in 1995-97 and the
failure to close unprofitable mines were mostly to blame for
industry problems, the independent UNIAN news agency reported. In
1994, subsidies accounted for 38 percent of the coal's price, he
said.
	   Parliament, meanwhile, moved Wednesday to accommodate some of
the miners' demands, giving initial approval to a draft law that
would restructure 1.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 323 million) in tax
debts, postponing some payments until 2000 and others until 2003.
	   The law would also abolish the industry's debt of some 126
million hryvna (dlrs 37 million) in fines for non-payment of taxes,
UNIAN said.
	   The miners also are demanding that the government come up with
600 million hryvna (dlrs 176 million) in additional financing for
the industry, approved by parliament last June.
	   Union leaders threatened Wednesday to stage more strikes on Nov.
15 if the demands are not met.

Sosa, major leaguers arrive in Tokyo for friendship series

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Slugger Sammy Sosa and a team of major league
players arrived Wednesday for a series of exhibition games against
the best in Japanese professional baseball.
	   While the games are intended to promote friendly relations
between the two countries, Cleveland Indians coach Mike Hargrove
issued a lighthearted warning to his Japanese opponents.
	   The major leaguers, he said, were on no mercy mission.
	   ``We came over here to win,'' Hargrove told a news conference
after arriving.
	   ``We're here to play baseball. That's the name of the game.''
	   Hargrove coaches a team of 28 players that includes some of the
best in the game: Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling,
heavy-hitting San Diego Padres left fielder Greg Vaughn and ace
Padres relief pitcher Trevor Hoffman.
	   But from the moment he stepped off the plane, Sosa was the focus
of Japanese media attention.
	   The Chicago Cubs right fielder became a household name in this
country during his heavily publicized race with Mark McGwire for
the major league's season home run record.
	   Sosa, who ended the year with 66 home runs to McGwire's 70, said
he hopes to use the attention to raise money in Japan for victims
of Hurricane George, which killed 210 when it struck his native
Dominican Republic in September.
	   ``Everything the people of Japan can do for me and my people,
we'd appreciate it,'' he said.
	   For most of the games they will play here, Sosa and his
teammates face a Japanese all-star lineup featuring the likes of
home run king Hideki Matsui and a player known simply as Ichiro,
who led the Japanese professional leagues with a .358 batting
average.
	   But Japanese baseball is best known abroad for its pitching. And
the major leaguers will go up against some of the country's most
talented hurlers, like Shigeki Noguchi, who had a 14-9 record with
a 2.34 earned run average during the regular season.
	   Sosa said they were ready for the best the Japanese pitchers
could throw at them
	   ``We're not scared,'' said Sosa.
	   ``That could be my mother up there (on the mound) and I'd still
play my best,'' he laughed.
	   The major leaguers play their first game of the visit against
the Yomiuri Giants on Friday before playing the Japanese all-stars
in seven games Nov. 7-15.

Laudrup returns to Copenhagen but not for good _ yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brian Laudrup wants to return to Denmark and join
FC Copenhagen. Not so fast _ he'll still be wearing a Chelsea shirt
when the two clubs meet in Copenhagen on Thursday in a crucial Cup
Winners Cup game.
	   The 29-year-old Danish striker announced last week that he was
homesick and hoped to make a move to Copenhagen. Chelsea
reluctantly gave him the go-ahead to leave, just three months into
his four-year, 50,000-pound-a-week (dlrs 83,500) deal with the
London club.
	   Copenhagen officials had hoped to announce Laudrup's signing
after Thursday's second-round, second-leg game at Parken Stadium.
But Laudrup says he plans to return to London after the game and
prepare for Sunday's Premier League match at West Ham.
	   His future with Chelsea beyond Sunday remains unclear.
	   Chelsea-player manager Gianluca Vialli must now decide whether
to play Laudrup in Copenhagen, with the London club needing to
score at least one goal to have any chance of continuing the
defense of its Cup Winners title.
	   The two sides drew 1-1 in London two weeks ago, with French
World Cup star Marcel Desailly scoring the equalizer for Chelsea in
second-half injury time. Bjarne Goldbaek had scored Copenhagen's
vital away goal in the 23rd minute.
	   Laudrup has been frustrated with Vialli's rotation system, in
which players are picked for the starting team one week and dropped
the next.
	   Chelsea has five star strikers: Italians Vialli, Gianfranco Zola
and Pierluigi Casiraghi, Laudrup and Norway's Tor Andre Flo.
	   Vialli won't announce until Wednesday which two will be in the
lineup.
	   The other key game Thursday is in Yugoslavia, where Partizan
Belgrade faces Lazio. The two sides drew 0-0 in Rome last month.
	   UEFA decided to go ahead with the match in Belgrade after the
crisis in Kosovo eased, ending the threat of NATO air strikes.
	   All 30,000 tickets for the game sold out as soon as they were
made available Monday.
	   The match has generated an atmosphere reminiscent of Partizan's
glory days in 1966, when the club lost to Real Madrid 2-1 in the
Champions Cup final. Since then, Partizan has been overshadowed by
fierce Belgrade rival Red Star.
	   Skirmishes were reported Monday when Red Star fans shouted
insults at Partizan supporters lining up to buy tickets.
	   Lazio's Croat striker Alen Boksic is unlikely to get a friendly
reception from the Serbian crowds.
	   Lazio defender Sinisa Mihajlovic and midfielder Dejan Stankovic,
both former Red Star standouts, are returning to Belgrade with
mixed feelings.
	   They both say they love their homeland, but still remain great
foes of Partizan.
	   ``I know we will win,'' Mihajlovic said. ``We are a better team,
and sadly for Yugoslav soccer, Partizan will go out of the
competition.''
	   Partizan will miss injured central defender Milan Stojanovcki
and midfielder Zoltan Sabo. Key striker Nenad Bjeklovic is
recuperating and hopes to play Thursday.
	   ``We have to play with our heads, and not with our hearts,''
said Partizan coach Ljubisa Tumbakovic. ``We are outsiders against
Lazio, one of the most expensive teams in Europe. So be it, if we
win it will be a sensation. If we lose, life goes on.''
	   Lazio, which lost to Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup final last
season, is coming off an upset 1-0 loss to last-place Salernitana
in a Serie A match Sunday, leaving the Rome club six points behind
league leader Juventus.
	   ``Let's hope we play with more determination in Belgrade,'' said
Lazio's Swedish coach Sven Goran Eriksson. ``We badly need
qualification for the quarterfinals.''
	   Strikers Marcelo Salas, Christian Vieri and Alen Boksic have
been sidelined recently by injuries. Salas and Boksic may play a
portion of Thursday's match, with Roberto Mancini also in
contention for a place up front.
	   Other games Thursday, with first-leg scores in parentheses:
	   Besiktas (0) vs. Valerenga (1); Varteks (1) vs. Heerenveen (2);
Mallorca (1) vs. Genk (1); Apollon Limassol (2) vs. Pathionios (3);
Maccabi Haifa (1) vs. SV Ried (2), and Braga (1) vs. Lokomotiv
Moscow (3).
	   In the second round of the UEFA Cup, Glasgow Rangers hold a 2-1
first-leg advantage as they host Bayer Leverkusen.

Attackers storm city in northern Tajikistan

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Bands of armed militants raided a
city in northern Tajikistan early Wednesday, battling government
troops and seizing several buildings in heavy fighting, officials
said.
	   At least 10 government soldiers were killed, and the attackers
also took some 30 police officers hostage, said Zafar Saidov,
spokesman for President Emomali Rakhmonov.
	   The assailants seized all administrative buildings in the city
of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport,
Saidov said.
	   Despite a 1997 peace agreement that formally ended a civil war,
the former Soviet republic continues to be plagued by outbursts of
violence involving groups that do not recognize the deal.
	   The attackers were led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against Rakhmonov last year and then fled to
neighboring Uzbekistan, authorities said.
	   The president chaired an emergency government session to discuss
the crisis and ordered all troops be put on alert. Russia's 201st
motorized infantry division, deployed in Tajikistan to support the
government, has also been put in combat readiness.
	   The presidents of Kazakstan and Uzbekistan and Russia's minister
of foreign affairs all issued statements condemning the attack,
ITAR-Tass reported. Uzbekistan borders Tajikistan, whose location
on the Afghan border has given it strategic significance to Russia
and the rest of the region.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Russia
``resolutely supports the steps the country's leadership is taking
the counter that armed provocation and install constitutional
order,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   Interfax put the number of attackers at 1,000.
	   Tajikistan's government and mainstream opposition
representatives conferred Wednesday to discuss the situation, it
said. The government demanded the attachers surrender.
	   ``Otherwise, the republic's government reserves the right to use
against them all available means, including complete
annihilation,'' the statement said, according to Interfax.
	   The attackers didn't make any immediate demands.
	   Khudoberdyev broke away from the government after it signed a
peace deal with the mostly Islamic opposition in the summer of
1997.
	   ``The attack is aimed at thwarting the peace process in the
republic,'' Saidov said.
	   The government also blamed Khudoberdyev supporters for staging a
triple bombing in western Tajikistan on Monday night, killing one
man.
	   ``These anti-government forces in Tajikistan have as their
purpose a change of the country's course toward national
reconciliation,'' a government statement said. ``They will stop
neither at terror nor at effectively declaring war own their own
people.''

Jewish settlers occupy West Bank hill as land campaign continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers have moved 17 mobile homes onto
a West Bank hill in what peace activists said Wednesday was part of
a campaign to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
	   Mobile homes have been put up in at least two other sites since
the Oct. 23 signing of the new Mideast peace agreement that calls
for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders have said they are seizing land because they
fear it will otherwise be handed over to the Palestinians.
	   The United States opposes Jewish settlement expansion, and as
part of the new accord urged both sides again to refrain from
unilateral actions that pre-empt the outcome of negotiations on the
future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the latest incident, 17 mobile homes were erected about 250
meters (yards) away from the Avnei Hefetz settlement, a cluster of
150 homes about 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Tel Aviv.
	   The secretary of Avnei Hefetz, Israel Blonder, said the trailer
park was planned months ago and was not linked to the expected
Israeli withdrawal.
	   Lt. Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military government
in the West Bank, confirmed that the project had army approval.
	   Mossi Raz, leader of the Israeli group Peace Now, said the
settlers are trying to create disruptions and prevent the
government from implementing the peace accord, he said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan will import 40,000 tons of gas for
heating in order to meet increased demand during the winter, an
energy official said Wednesday.
	   ``Gas shortages become evident during the winter when daily
demand rises to 1,400 tons per day, three times the maximum
capacity of local production,'' said Abdul-Wahab Zou'bi, general
manager of the state-run Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co.
	   The average daily demand during the summer is 500 tons, he said.
	   Jordanian households buy gas in cylinders and use it for heating
and coocking.
	   Zou'bi did not say where the gas will come from. But gas
supplies last year came from Qatar and Egypt.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Investment in Jordan increased by 58
percent during the first 10 months of this year in comparison to
the same period last year, the semi-official Investment Promotion
Corp. said Wednesday.
	   The managing director of the corporation, Mutasser Uqleh, said
the money was spent on 178 projects in five sectors which benefit
from tax exemptions and other incentives introduced in the
investment promotion law of 1995.
	   Foreign investment made up 34 percent of the total 430 million
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 605 million), Uqlah added.
	   He said 46 percent of the foreign investment came from Gulf
investors. The rest came mainly from businessmen in the United
States, Canada and Japan.
	   The sectors which benefit from the tax exemptions are industry,
hospitals, agriculture, transport, maritime and railway.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain Telecommunications Co., known as
Batelco, said Wednesday that its net profit rose 27 percent to 31.4
million dinars (dlrs 83 million) in the first nine months of 1998
when compared with the same period a year earlier.
	   The company said the sales during the first nine months rose 17
percent to 94.8 million dinars (dlrs 251 million) from 80.7 million
(dlrs 214 million) in 1997.
	   Batelco said the gains reflected a higher demand for its
services, including mobile telephones and internet accounts from
customers.
	   Batelco is 20 percent owned by U.K. Cable &AMP; Wireless, 36 percent
by Bahrain's government, and the remaining shares are listed on the
Bahrain Stock Exchange.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ More than 1.5 million tourists visited
Syria between January and August, an increase of 6 percent over the
same period last year, Syrian Tourism Minister Danho Dauod said in
remarks published Wednesday.
	   Most of the visitor came from Arab countries, Dauod told the
government newspaper Al-Thawra.
	   The paper said the number of tourists who visited the country in
1997 was 2.3 million. Revenues for 1997 reached dlrs 1.3 billion.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Slugger Sammy Sosa and a team of major league
players arrived Wednesday for a series of exhibition games against
the best in Japanese professional baseball.
	   While the games are intended to promote friendly relations
between the two countries, Cleveland Indians coach Mike Hargrove
issued a lighthearted warning to his Japanese opponents.
	   The major leaguers, he said, were on no mercy mission.
	   ``We came over here to win,'' Hargrove told a news conference
after arriving.
	   ``We're here to play baseball. That's the name of the game.''
	   Hargrove coaches a team of 28 players that includes some of the
best in the game: Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling,
heavy-hitting San Diego Padres left fielder Greg Vaughn and ace
Padres relief pitcher Trevor Hoffman.
	   But from the moment he stepped off the plane, Sosa was the focus
of Japanese media attention.
	   The Chicago Cubs right fielder became a household name in this
country during his heavily publicized race with Mark McGwire for
the major league's season home run record.
	   Sosa, who ended the year with 66 home runs to McGwire's 70, said
he hopes to use the attention to raise money in Japan for victims
of Hurricane George, which killed 210 when it struck his native
Dominican Republic in September.
	   ``Everything the people of Japan can do for me and my people,
we'd appreciate it,'' he said.
	   For most of the games they will play here, Sosa and his
teammates face a Japanese all-star lineup featuring the likes of
home run king Hideki Matsui and a player known simply as Ichiro,
who led the Japanese professional leagues with a .358 batting
average.
	   But Japanese baseball is best known abroad for its pitching. And
the major leaguers will go up against some of the country's most
talented hurlers, like Shigeki Noguchi, who had a 14-9 record with
a 2.34 earned run average during the regular season.
	   Sosa said they were ready for the best the Japanese pitchers
could throw at them
	   ``We're not scared,'' said Sosa.
	   ``That could be my mother up there (on the mound) and I'd still
play my best,'' he laughed.
	   The major leaguers play their first game of the visit against
the Yomiuri Giants on Friday before playing the Japanese all-stars
in seven games Nov. 7-15.

Radical Basque party says no to representing gunmen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The leader of a party linked to the armed
Basque separatist group ETA on Wednesday welcomed the Spanish
government's move toward negotiations to resolve the 30-year
conflict, but rejected suggestions that it could represent the
militants.
	   Arnaldo Otegi of the Herri Batasuna party said Tuesday's
initiative for talks represented a ``positive change in attitude''
given the government has long rejected negotiating with ETA.
	   But, speaking on a Basque radio station, Otegi denied
suggestions his group could act as spokesmen for the armed
organization.
	   ``If the government wants to talk to Herri Batasuna, let it do
so. If it wants to talk to ETA, then it should talk to ETA,'' Herri
Batasuna leader Arnaldo Oregi told a Basque radio station. ``We're
not going to represent ETA in any manner or in any talks.''
	   On Tuesday, conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he
had authorized talks with groups linked to ETA in his two-year
government's first step to negotiate an end to the conflict.
	   The move by Aznar, who was the target of an ETA car-bomb attack
in 1995 when he was opposition leader, came just under two months
after the militant organization began its first ever open-ended
truce Sept. 18.
	   Otegi's Herri Batasuna has long been considered the political
wing of ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty. As
part of the pro-independence coalition Euskal Herritarrok, the
party won 16 seats in the 75-seat Basque parliament in regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Otegi said his party had not had any contact so far with the
government.
	   On Wednesday, the daily ABC cited unidentified government
sources as saying one of the government's conditions was that the
political side of any possible talks would be handled by Herri
Batasuna and _ or _ Euskal Herritarrok.
	   The paper said the government was also seeking guarantees that
ETA would keep its gunmen under control and that it would dismantle
its infrastructure, particularly its bomb-making facilities, in
France and Spain.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
an independent state of Basque areas in northern Spain and
southwestern France.
	   The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when
Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist party was in office. The talks broke
down and the violence resumed.
	   Following the latest truce, Aznar initially rejected talks until
ETA gave further proof of its peaceful intentions. The premier,
however, has come under pressure from other political parties to
respond to the cease-fire before it is too late.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the proposed contacts were
``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to give up violence
for good.''
	   The move was welcomed by political parties and media analysts
across the board.
	   Recent news reports said ETA opted for a truce because the
organization had been seriously weakened by arrests and police
infiltration in recent months. There have also been an increasing
number of demonstrations against its actions in recent years.
	   ETA and its supporters were also influenced by developments in
northern Ireland where the Irish Republican Army and other
paramilitary groups upheld cease-fires that paved the way for peace
talks.
	   No date or location has been set for any eventual talks on the
Basque problem.

China moves to make adoptions easier at home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese couples will find it easier and
foreigners perhaps more difficult to adopt children under a revised
adoption law approved by China's legislature Wednesday, state media
reported.
	   The changes are designed to alleviate overcrowding in
cash-strapped state orphanages and find more orphans homes.
Abandonment, especially of baby girls, has soared under strict
family planning controls that limit most Chinese couples to having
one child.
	   Passed by the standing committee of the National People's
Congress, the revised law reduces the age of prospective Chinese
parents from 35 to 30 years, drops a restriction that couples be
childless and allows for multiple adoptions, the Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   The restrictions were originally intended to make sure Chinese
families did not orchestrate adoptions to circumvent the one-child
limit. Tight laws at home and a rise in abandonment also helped
turn China into a popular place for Westerners, especially
Americans, looking to adopt.
	   Fearing further international condemnation of its much
criticized family planning policies, the Chinese government has
never said how many children are in state care. Foreigners adopted
4,191 Chinese children in the 12 months ending in September.
	   Xinhua reported that the revised law requires prospective
adoptive parents from abroad to provide extensive information on
their background _ all notarized by authorities in their home
countries.
	   Foreigners will also have to sign agreements with the person or
institution offering the adoption and register it with the Chinese
government, Xinhua said.
	   The report did not indicate how the changes for foreigners
differ from current procedures.
	   The new law also sets out fines and other punishments for people
who abandon or sell children, Xinhua said, without elaborating.

UEFA decision on Fiorentina incident expected by Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 9th, 10th grafs with reaction from Fiorentina,
Salerno. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA expects to decide by Monday how to
deal with an incident which caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup
match between Fiorentina and Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the
European governing body said Wednesday.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg match after a Belgian
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device hurled
from the stands.
	   There will be no replay of the match Wednesday, UEFA said in a
statement. A decision will be taken by UEFA's control and
disciplinary body.
	   ``We need to know the details'' before deciding what action to
take, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonella said.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of
its Franchi stadium as a result of its fans misbehavior during a
Cup Winners Cup game against Barcelona in 1997.
	   Although playing away from home Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno.
	   ``We behaved in accordance with the rules,'' the Swiss sports
agency SI quoted Grasshoppers sport director Erich Vogel as saying.
``Now we're waiting for the UEFA decision.''
	   ``We just have to wait and see what UEFA decides,'' Fiorentina
coach Giovanni Trappatoni told Italy's Canale 5 television.
	   The mayor of Salerno and the head of the Salerno fan club both
apologized for the incident.
	   In 1989, Dutch club Ajax was suspended from European competition
for one year after a fan threw a piece of steel fence at a visiting
team's goalkeeper.
	   UEFA also punished Ajax with a 3-0 forfeit defeat and ruled the
club must play three European games after the ban in a stadium at
least 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Amsterdam.
	   The injured official, Philippe Flament, was taken to hospital
with a right knee injury. The incident occurred as players and
officials were walking to the dressing rooms at the end of the
first half.
	   Draws for third-round games of the European competition are
scheduled on Friday.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify. The Italian club was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes of the
second leg.

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat saying 12 of the 30
Palestinians sought by Israel are already in detention, Israel
saying the 30 were responsible for the deaths of nearly 100
Israelis, UPGRADE attribution on U.S. statement; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu postponed Wednesday a Cabinet meeting that was
to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu aides said the ministers would not be convened until
Israel receives written guarantees from the United States that 30
Palestinians wanted by Israel will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the 12-week time table that was to begin
Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16
_ in exchange for Palestinian security steps.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily, saying Netanyahu was seizing a
pretext to try to dismantle the peace agreement. ``He (Netanyahu)
is inventing new agreements. He does not want to honor anything,''
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat sad.
	   However, despite the recriminations, there were first signs that
the dispute could be resolved. U.S. officials said they were
mediating and that they expected results ``shortly.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is visiting Spain, said
that 12 of the wanted Palestinians are in detention and that he
would do his best to apprehend the others.
	   ``We will continue working on this 100 percent ... but nobody
can ask us to achieve 100 percent results,'' Arafat told a news
conference in Madrid.
	   Palestinian security officials have said that several of the men
on Israel's wanted list were arrested and tried in recent years and
months, but never gave a specific number.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior Netanyahu adviser, said the 30 wanted
men were responsible for the deaths of nearly 100 Israelis and that
12 of those on Israel's list were employed by the Palestinian
security forces.
	   The delay of the Cabinet meeting means that implementation of
the peace accord is also being held up. Netanyahu has said he could
not move ahead without the formal approval of the Cabinet and the
Israeli parliament, which is scheduled to vote on Nov. 12.
	   The new dispute made it clear that any good will created during
last month's Mideast summit at secluded Wye Plantation in Maryland
has dissipated and that the United States will be called in as a
referee throughout the implementation process.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region on
Thursday to oversee implementation.
	   However, even the U.S. position was not clearcut.
	   U.S. State Department and White House officials said earlier
that the Palestinians had lived up to their obligations, but the
U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, said in a statement
Wednesday that ``there are some security issues where additional
clarification is being sought.''
	   At issue is Israel's demand to receive written U.S. guarantees
that the Palestinians will arrest the 30 Palestinians.
	   Bar-Illan said that during the Wye negotiations, the two sides
settled for verbal assurances that the Palestinians would arrest
the 30 suspects. He said Israel was given to understand that it
would receive written assurances on the arrests from the United
States before implementation of the agreement began.
	   Netanyahu said earlier Wednesday that he would only convene his
Cabinet at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT), as tentatively scheduled, once he
had the U.S. guarantees in hand. Minutes before the meeting was to
begin, Bar-Illan said it had been postponed indefinitely.
	   However, Bar-Illan said he believed that after two phone
conversations between Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the United States moved closer to the Israeli
position. ``They now understand that this link is missing and
without it we cannot proceed,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu said he would not put up with Palestinian violations
of the accord negotiated last month with U.S. help.
	   ``I'm not saying that promises cannot be broken,'' he told
Israel radio. ``But if they are broken, we will stop the process.''

South African TV authority pans first private channel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: e.tv is correct &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ ``Baywatch,'' ``Oprah'' and
``Friends'' aren't enough for the new South Africa, the
broadcasting authority said in panning the nation's first free,
private television station.
	   The e.tv channel, a joint venture of black-run consortiums and
Time-Warner Inc., failed to provide programming in African
languages and fell short in its quota of children's and information
programming, the Independent Broadcasting Authority said in a
report released Wednesday.
	   The failings were among seven violations of e.tv's broadcast
license found during the Cape Town-based channel's first week of
operation, from Oct. 1-7. A separate complaints committee will wait
for e.tv's response and decide whether or not to go ahead with a
hearing, which could result in fines or suspension.
	   An e.tv spokesman did not return phone calls for comment.
	   The channel went on the air with great fanfare in a country
where television only arrived in 1976. In the apartheid years, it
was closely controlled by the government and served as a propaganda
organ.
	   With the onset of all-race elections in 1994 that ended white
minority rule, the broadcast authority was set up to reshape South
African broadcasting in the image of the new democracy.
	   The South African Broadcasting Corp. and its three channels now
dominate the industry. M-Net, a subscription pay channel, and the
MultiChoice pay satellite service round out the choices.
	   When the authority opened the door to the first private channel,
it required the new broadcaster to have blacks as major
stakeholders and serve the public.
	   Midi TV and its e.tv channel won the license. Black unions,
business associations and investors control 80 percent of the
company, and Time-Warner's Warner Brothers the rest. Access to the
Warner TV library was considered a way to help e.tv compete with
the SABC big boys.
	   Allowed to broadcast for only six hours a day in its start-up
phase, e.tv's lineup also includes Magic Johnson's talk show ``The
Magic Hour,'' cop and lawyer shows like ``Silk Stalkings'' and ``A
Wing and a Prayer,'' and locally produced shows about sports,
current events and popular culture.
	   Despite howls of protest by many reviewers over the heavy
weighting to U.S. fare, viewer complaints have mainly been about
the station's poor reception, authority officials say.
	   Among the violations found:
	   - No shows in Zulu, Xhosa, SeSotho and SeTswana, four of the
country's 11 official languages and the main African tongues in
South Africa. The license requirement called for one hour a week.
	   - 30 minutes instead of 3 hours, 37 minutes of children's
programming a week.
	   - 240 minutes of information programming instead of 285.
	   - Too many ads per hour, sometimes exceeding the 4 minute, 11
second maximum by 3 1-2 minutes.

EU trade official presses Japan to open markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A senior European Union trade official pressed
Japanese leaders Wednesday to speed up their market opening efforts
as the best remedy for ending the Asian giant's stubborn recession.
	   Gerard Depayre, the EU's deputy director-general for external
relations, is in Tokyo for seven days of talks about lowering trade
barriers and restrictions on business between Japan and Europe.
	   He met Wednesday with Shotaro Oshima, director-general of the
Japanese Foreign Ministry's economic affairs bureau, to urge Japan
to continue its steps to cut red tape that Depayre said is choking
Japan's economy.
	   ``It is in everyone's interest that Japan restarts its economy
and creates the conditions for sustained domestic demand-led
growth. Structural reform, notably deregulation, is an essential
part of the policy mix needed to achieve this,'' he said in a
statement after the meeting.
	   Depayre said that similar deregulation in Europe had created
600,000 new jobs in just a few years.
	   He also asked Japan to eliminate barriers that still prevent
European goods from entering the Japanese market.
	   During his visit, Depayre will also meet with officials from
Japan's ministries of finance, trade and industry, agriculture and
forestry and fisheries.
	   Japanese and European trade officials have held regular talks on
deregulation since 1994, the EU mission in Tokyo said.

Foundation demands Germany pay additional slave labor compensations
</HEADLINE>
to Poles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A private foundation demanded Wednesday
that Germany pay additional compensation to Poles forced to be
Nazi-era slave laborers, an appeal launched one day before German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder makes his first official visit to
Poland.
	   The Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation says Germany
discriminated against Poles when it compensated former slave
laborers for imprisonment and health damage: While one-third of 9
million slave laborers were Polish, Germany paid Polish victims
only 2 billion marks (dlrs 1.2 billion) out of the 130 billion
marks (dlrs 78 billion) paid in compensations in 1965.
	   The foundation, devoted to protecting the rights of Nazi
victims, seeks compensation comparable that received by victims in
Western Europe. It claims that former slave laborers from the West
received tens of thousands of marks each, but that individual
Polish victims have received only 700 marks (dlrs 425).
	   Foundation chairman Jacek Turczynski urged Schroeder, sworn in
as chancellor Oct. 27, to discuss slave labor reparations with
Polish officials when he arrives in Warsaw on Thursday.
	   West European and U.S. law firms have offered to include Polish
slave laborers in suits against big German industrial firms that
used slave labor to help stoke the Third Reich war engine. The
pending suits seek back wages, opposed to the blanket compensation
paid by firms such as Siemens and Mercedes-Benz.
	   Poles were ineligible for compensation from the firms, which
were paid before the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989; communist
East European nations barred victims from applying.
	   If Germany does not address Polish victims' claims for further
reparations, the foundation has threatened to reveal documents that
it says show which companies and individuals employed slave labor.

Dec. 14 set for second trial for murder of British tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Chief Justice Zachaeus Chesoni on
Wednesday set Dec. 14 as the opening date of the second trial for
the murder of British tourist Julie Ward a decade ago in a game
reserve.
	   Chesoni named Judge Daniel Aganyanya to preside in the trial
that will be heard on a daily basis.
	   On Tuesday, Chesoni rejected a prosecution request that the
trial be postponed until next year because it was not ready to try
the case against former game warden Simon ole Makallah.
	   Makallah has pleaded not guilty to charges that he murdered
Julie Ward in the Maasai Mara game reserve between Sept. 6 and 13,
1988.
	   Makallah, 49, is currently an assistant director at the Kenya
Wildlife Service. He was a game warden in the Maasai Mara at the
time of Ward's death and served as a witness for the prosecution in
the first murder trial that ended in acquittal of two men charged
with the death.
	   The prosecution has said it would need about a month to call the
43 witnesses it has assembled.
	   In June 1992 after the acquittal of two park rangers, Justice
Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a flawed
investigation.
	   Makallah's attorneys have said they will call 12 witnesses.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found Sept. 13, 1988 in the reserve near the Tanzanian border.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals.
	   Although Attorney General Amos Wako told a news conference with
Ward's father, John, a day after the arrest that there was
sufficient evidence to hold Makallah, he was not formally charged
until two months later and was denied bail.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top finance official said Wednesday that
the government will be forced to ask for a rescheduling of its
foreign debt in 1999.
	   The comments by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov were
the strongest sign yet that Russia will not be able to pay its huge
foreign debt. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top
officials had said Russia was committed to paying its foreign debts
and had given no sign that rescheduling would be necessary, despite
the country's mounting cash problems.
	   Maslyukov said debt payments in 1999 will total dlrs 17.5
billion next year, and dlrs 3.5 billion this year.
	   ``Both of these tasks are too much for our weakened economy,''
he said.
	   ``Either we have to take extraordinary measures for squeezing
out this money from all spheres of the economy or agree on a
restructuring of our debt,'' he said.
	   ``We are choosing the second path.''
	   Maslyukov also said the government will try to minimize its
plans to print rubles to plug its budget gap this year and next.
	   Also Wednesday, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said
Russia has squandered its prospects for international aid by
approving a vague and contradictory economic plan,
	   ``There is no chance of receiving money from the West,''
Kiriyenko told the Interfax news agency. ``Credits will be provided
only for a clear, concise, consistent plan of action that would
show that the Russian budget can receive more money than it
spends.''
	   The International Monetary Fund has held up approval of the next
installment of its loan to Russia, saying it wanted to see a clear
plan of action that met its criteria.
	   Kiriyenko said the current government's plan is unclear _ in
fact, he charged, it is intentionally murky as part of a strategy
of encouraging political stability by taking pains not to offend
any faction.
	   Kiriyenko was fired in August after he effectively devalued the
national currency, the ruble, and placed a moratorium on repaying
foreign loans, tipping an already troubled economy over the edge
into crisis.
	   He has consistently defended his government's actions, and has
been increasingly outspoken in criticizing his successor, Primakov.
	   Primakov's Cabinet approved an economic plan last weekend that
proposes greater government intervention in the economy, while
still promising to hew to a path of market-oriented reform.
	   On Wednesday, an official with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development was quoted as saying the EBRD
doesn't plan to loan any money to restructure the Russian banking
system this year. There had been speculation that it might.
	   Neil Parison, head of the bank's office in Moscow, told Interfax
that any assistance from the EBRD, the Group of Seven
industrialized nations or the World Bank would depend on the
Russian Central Bank's program to restructure the system.

Ethnic Albanians clash with Serb police in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian separatists raked
two cars with gunfire, wounding three Serbs and setting off an
hour-long gunbattle with police in Kosovo province, Serb police
said Wednesday.
	   Isolated clashes have continued across the southern Serbian
province despite last month's peace agreement and the guerrillas'
grudging promise to honor it.
	   The guerrillas opened fire Tuesday evening on two vehicles from
the Belacevac coal mine, said Serb police at a checkpoint near
Sipitula, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of Pristina, Kosovo's
capital.
	   Three miners were injured and taken to Pristina hospital, police
said. The cars, still sitting at the checkpoint Wednesday, had
several bullet holes or marks in the windshields and chassis.
	   Villagers in Sipitula said Serb police began shooting at the
village at about the same time police said the gunfight began. The
villagers said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or
with friends and relatives.
	   A few who returned Wednesday said police routinely attack the
village and force them to flee.
	   ``They aren't withdrawing their forces'' as called for in the
Oct. 12 agreement, complained one man, Fatmme Mjeku.
	   On Tuesday, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader alluded to a
police threat to civilians, saying more needs to be done to ensure
the safety of returning refugees. Ibrahim Rugova spoke after
venturing into the countryside for the first time in nine years.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the process to return.
But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes as he accompanied U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying to persuade ethnic Albanians
to give up their dream of Kosovo's independence from Serbia and
settle for some form of self-rule.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-1 in the province. Hundreds of people have been killed this year
and hundreds of thousands displaced in Serb authorities' crackdown
on the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   As head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in Kosovo,
Rugova has remained almost exclusively in Pristina since Serbia
stripped the province of autonomy in 1989 and set up a huge police
presence.
	   With no major fighting in Kosovo for weeks and many Serb forces
withdrawn under an Oct. 12 peace agreement, Rugova visited villages
on the front line of fighting. Sporadic violence continues, along
with intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic
Albanians from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported Wednesday that Serb
shelling of Petrovo, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of
Pristina. The Serb Media Center blamed ``Albanian terrorists''
attacking Serb police for the violence.
	   Also Wednesday, the guerrillas announced they are holding two
politicians from Rugova's party who have been missing since Oct.
30. Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku were conducting an anti-KLA
campaign and ``coaxed people to turn in their arms,'' according to
a KLA statement printed in the daily Koha Ditore.

Too soon to close Stasi files, German agency chief says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time reference in 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The government agency in charge of records from
the dreaded East German secret police is still processing hundreds
of thousands of requests from people seeking access to their files,
agency chief Joachim Gauck said Wednesday.
	   Thousands more applications come in every month, said Gauck, a
former East German pastor. And while some critics charge that the
files are no longer relevant today, eight years after unification,
Gauck argued that it was too soon to consider ending efforts to
come to terms with East Germany's past.
	   More than half the 4 million requests made since the office
opened in 1992 involve employers wanting to know whether an
employee or applicant had connections with the Stasi, as the
Ministry for State Security was known.
	   But Gauck said it was ``absolute nonsense'' to accuse his agency
of helping promote ``witch hunts'' or ``winner's justice'' in
uncovering a person's Stasi past.
	   Almost 5 percent of teachers in East Berlin were found to have
informed for the Stasi, he noted as an example, but only 21 percent
of them lost their jobs as a result.
	   Gauck spoke at an annual conference of The Associated Press in
Germany.

Swatch Group sells Smart Car stake to Germany's Daimler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's Swatch Group has sold its
19 percent stake in the Smart Car project to German automaker
Daimler-Benz, its partner in the venture.
	   Neither Daimler nor Swatch provided terms of the transaction. A
German newspaper, Wirtschaftswoche, put the value at dlrs 70
million.
	   The tiny two-seat Smart Car was developed by Micro Compact Car
AG, a joint venture between Daimler-Benz and Swatch Group, the
Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch wristwatch.
	   The Smart Car takes up about half of a standard parking spot.
With its bright yellow and red colors, mix-and-match replaceable
parts and all-plastic body, it is aimed at a young market.
	   Swatch's decision to sell its stake in the venture gives Daimler
full control of Micro Compact Car.
	   Swatch said it decided to sell its stake because the venture
decided against using Swatch's hybrid motor technology.
	   Micro Compact Car will pay unspecified compensation to Swatch,
which may later license its technology to Daimler which is near
completion of its purchase of the U.S. automaker Chrysler Corp.
	   The Smart Car went on sale across Europe last month. It is on
sale in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austrian,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in special ``Smart
Centers,'' which bypass normal auto dealers.

Block of the world's oldest and most valuable stamps for sale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spink and Sons Ltd., in graf 4, should have an ampersand sted
``and'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The oldest and most valuable block of stamps in
the world is up for sale in Britain at a price of 2.75 million
pounds (dlrs 4.5 million).
	   The 48 mint condition Twopenny Blues, which bear the image of
Queen Victoria, were issued in 1840 but were forgotten for more
than century until they were discovered rolled inside an old
leather writing set by the Duke of Buccleuch's staff in 1945.
	   It is thought they were originally bought by Walter Francis, a
previous Duke of Buccleuch, to use on his household mail.
	   After its discovery, the set became part of two major private
collections before being acquired a few months ago by London stamp
dealers Spink and Sons Ltd., which is now selling them.
	   The Twopenny Blue is extremely rare, particularly in large
blocks. And as the world's largest known block of the world's first
issue of postage stamps, the set should attract not only collectors
but also investors and speculators, said Andrew Norris, managing
director of Argyll Etkin, a dealer in stamps and postal history.
	   The stamps were issued May 6, 1840, along with the Penny Black,
and have since become one of the great gems of philately. The
second largest block of Twopenny Blues is owned by Queen Elizabeth
II.
	   These stamps ``are probably the most important philatelic item
in the world,'' Spink director Richard Watkins was quoted as saying
in Wednesday's Daily Telegraph newspaper.

Yoko Ono says she and Linda McCartney were friends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Beatle wives Yoko Ono and Linda
McCartney liked each other. Really.
	   So says Ono, anyway. In a newspaper interview published
Wednesday, John Lennon's widow dismissed the commonly held belief
that she and Mrs. McCartney, who died of breast cancer in April,
didn't care for one another.
	   ``People always portrayed us as enemies, like two boxers on
opposite sides of the ring, but of course it was never really like
that,'' Ono was quoted as saying in the Liverpool Echo. ``In later
life especially, we became friends. We had an understanding of each
other. We had both married Beatles and we knew what that was
like.''
	   Ono and Mrs. McCartney _ wife of Lennon's songwriting partner,
Paul McCartney _ often have been portrayed as enemies, their mutual
disdain growing during the Beatles' final stormy days nearly three
decades ago.
	   Of Linda McCartney's death, Ono said: ``It was a great loss. She
was a very passionate woman about the things she believed in.''
	   In the interview, which coincided with the release of the new
``John Lennon Anthology'' album compiled by Ono, she also spoke of
the lingering hurt over her husband's death in 1980.
	   ``I am a woman who has lost my husband,'' she said. ``I think
about John every day, and talking about him is one of my last links
with him.''

Swiss react with tight lips to D'Amato defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The New York election defeat of Senator
Alfonse D'Amato, considered by many Swiss an unfair enemy of this
small country, was greeted by studied silence in Switzerland
Wednesday.
	   ``The government has taken note of Mr. D'Amato's failure to win
reelection, obviously with great regret,'' spokesman Achille
Casanova said with a straight face, but reporters laughed at the
obvious irony.
	   D'Amato used his role as chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee repeatedly to pressure Swiss banks to pay compensation to
Holocaust survivors.
	   He maintained that the banks had kept millions of dollars
deposited by Jews trying to save their wealth from Hitler's
clutches during the World War II era.
	   Following prolonged pressure from D'Amato and Jewish groups,
Switzerland's two biggest banks in August agreed to pay Holocaust
survivors dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   The New York Republican was defeated by Democrat Charles Schumer
in the United States' nastiest and costliest Senate race.
	   Newspapers frequently attacked D'Amato as a self-seeking
politician. Many Swiss, including Jewish leaders, accused him of
making false allegations against the country.
	   But few were prepared to comment Wednesday.
	   ``The people of New York have voted, and that's not something
for Swiss Jews to comment on,'' said Thomas Lyssy, vice-president
of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations.
	   The government's task force on World War II declined to comment.
Ulrich Pfister, spokesman of Credit Suisse, the country's
second-largest bank, who would say only that ``everyone can
personally think what they want.''
	   But there was sympathy for D'Amato from maverick Swiss lawmaker
Jean Ziegler, himself a longstanding critic of Swiss banks.
	   ``D'Amato didn't deserve to lose. He played an important role in
a crucial phase of Swiss history,'' Ziegler said in Geneva.
	   In July, Ziegler was the only Swiss public figure to accept
D'Amato's invitation to a hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking
Committee on World War II.
	   The Swiss owe him recognition for his part in achieving the
``just'' accord between Swiss banks and lawyers for Holocaust
survivors, Ziegler said.
	   Ziegler added that he was ``horrified by the low tone of the
election campaign and the role that money played in it.''
	   Lawmaker Jacques-Simon Eggly said he found D'Amato's defeat
``reassuring.'' Eggly, leader of the small centrist Liberal Party,
criticized him for exploiting the Holocaust.

Russian lawmakers urge political asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Turkish premier in new grafs 6-7,
Zhirinovsky assailing Turkey in new grafs 8-9, CORRECTS style on
Kurdistan Workers Party in 2nd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a
terrorist organization.
	   Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,
who leads the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has killed an estimated 37,000 people.
	   Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seeking
asylum after Ocalan wrote the State Duma, parliament's lower house,
thanking it for supporting his cause. Ocalan had officially
requested asylum, Interfax reported.
	   ``This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people,'' Nikiforenko
said.
	   The Duma supported Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
	   In Ankara, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz responded to the Duma
vote by saying that Turkey's interlocutor was Russia's government,
not its parliament.
	   Yilmaz added that Turkey had received a written statement from
the Russian government, stating that ``Russia would not allow this
murderer to find refuge in the country.''
	   Speaking to reporters after the vote, ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, who heads the Duma's third-largest party, assailed
Turkey for its demand to extradite Ocalan.
	   ``Turkey is showing its weakness,'' he said. ``What kind of a
country is it that's afraid of just one man?''
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish
government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that
Turkey withdraw its troops.
	   In his letter to the Duma, Ocalan accused the Turkish government
of trying ``to annihilate the leadership of the Kurdish Workers
Party, drown in blood the national liberation struggle by the
Kurdish people and thus pave the way for their control of the
entire Middle East.''
	   Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized the Duma
vote, and said he hoped President Boris Yeltsin would `take on a
realistic and constructive approach.''
	   ``Instead of forging ties with a terrorist organization like the
PKK, (Russia) should keep good relations with a country like
Turkey,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear. Turkey says he recently left
Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm
that he is in the country.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in
the Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran
and Syria.

Saudis offer arbitration in border dispute with Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Saudi Arabia is willing to accept international
arbitration of its border dispute with Yemen, the Saudi interior
minister said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz told Al-Siyassah that Riyadh was
ready to settle its border dispute with Yemen through continuing
talks or by ``resorting to international arbitration.''
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil
fields.
	   Late last month, Eritrea returned a Red Sea island to Yemen in
compliance with a court ruling after the two sides resorted to
international arbitration.

Two Pakistani soldiers killed as India repulses new glacial attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Two Pakistani soldiers were killed by
Indian troops in separate clashes as their units attacked Indian
outposts on a glacier high in the Himalayas, a defense spokesman
said Wednesday.
	   Major P. Purushottam claimed the Pakistanis fired mortar shells
and tried to dig into Indian territory in three attempts in the
northern and southern ends of the Siachen glacier Tuesday.
	   The clash on Siachen _ described as the world's highest
battlefield _ came two days before Indian and Pakistani officials
were scheduled to meet in New Delhi for another round of peace
talks.
	   The spokesman claimed it was the seventh Pakistani attack on
Siachen in 15 days. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan.
	   Indian troops fired at four Pakistani soldiers approaching an
Indian border post, killing one of them, at the southern end of the
glacier, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of New Delhi, and more
than 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) above sea level, Purushottam said.
	   Indian border guards at the glacier's northern end directed
machine-gun fire and mortars at about 10-12 Pakistani troops trying
to attack their positions, the officer said. One Pakistani soldier
died and the rest fled, he said.
	   Pakistani soldiers attempted a third attack within two hours but
were repulsed, Purushottam said.
	   For the last month, firing across Siachen has occurred almost
daily, but casualties have been few. Both India and Pakistan claim
the glacier, and skirmishes are common despite severe cold and high
winds.
	   A disengagement of forces and easing of tensions on the glacier
is among the items to be discussed this week by Indian and
Pakistani secretaries of defense. The talks aimed at normalizing
relations are part of a round that began this month with a meeting
between the foreign secretaries.

French World Cup striker to join Glasgow Rangers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French World Cup striker Stephane Guivarc'h, out of
favor since the arrival of Newcastle United boss Ruud Gullit, says
he will sign later this week for Scotland's Glasgow Rangers.
	   ``The two clubs have agreed a fee so nothing will get in the way
of me signing,'' Guivarc'h was quoted as saying in an interview
published Wednesday with French sports daily L'Equipe.
	   He said the fee would be around 3.5 million pounds.
	   Guivarc'h, a member of the French team that beat Brazil to win
the World Cup, said he has told Rangers he will sign later this
week, subject to a medical scheduled for Friday.
	   Guivarc'h has had a torrid time since joining Newcastle United
in the off-season. He was signed by Kenny Dalglish who was sacked
after a disappointing start to the season.
	   Dalglish's successor, Dutchman Ruud Gullit, then froze Guivarc'h
out.
	   ``Gullit told me I wasn't in his plans. He never gave me a
chance and so was never able to judge me,'' Guivarc'h said. ``He
said absolutely nothing to me. And I never knew why _ maybe he just
doesn't like my style.''
	   Guivarc'h said he almost joined Rangers in the summer and was
impressed by the infrastructure during a visit.
	   He will join French international goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier
at Rangers.

Jordan shuts down popular Arab satellite TV station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Wednesday revoked the press
credentials of a popular Arab satellite television station and its
employees, effectively closing the network's Amman bureau.
	   The move comes hours after the network, al-Jazeera Satellite
Corp., broadcast a scathing attack on Jordan in its widely watched
program, al-itijah al-Muaakes, or The Opposite Direction.
	   In its late Tuesday night program, the Qatar-based station
hosted Syrian researcher, Mohammed Khalifeh, who accused King
Hussein of conspiring with Israel since its foundation in 1948.
	   Revoking al-Jazeera's credentials was in response to
al-Jazeera's ``repeated and intentional insult against the
Jordanian people and the political regime,'' Eyad Qattan,
director-general of the Press and Publications Department at the
Information Ministry, said.
	   Mohammed Ajlouni, JSC's Amman representative, confirmed the
suspension. He declined to provide other details.
	   No news organization or journalists can function in the country
without press credentials, which are issued by the information
ministry.
	   Five Jordanians work at the Amman office of al-Jazeera, an
all-news channel known as the Arab world's Cable News Network. The
station is financed by the Qatari government.
	   In the program, Khalifeh said the Jordanian army had
``surrendered Palestinian lands to the Israelis without any
resistance'' in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. To reward Hussein's
family for siding with the ``Zionists,'' Jordan was created, he
added.
	   ``Jordan is not a nation, but an artificial entity,'' Khalifeh
said, describing Jordanians as ``a bunch of bedouins who live in an
arid desert.''
	   Former Jordanian Foreign Minister Kamel Abu Jaber also
participated in the program on a satellite link from Amman, but the
Syrian anchorman, Faisal Qassem, was often seen interrupting him
when he tried to respond.
	   Jordanian citizens and officials condemned the program in calls
to a local talk show shortly afterward on the Jordan Satellite
Television Station.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh said the attack was
``unjustified,'' but stressed it will not harm ties with the Qatari
government. Other officials accused Syria of instigating the
criticism.
	   Relations with Syria _ already lukewarm since Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel _ strained earlier this year when Arab
media reports suggested that Jordan was joining a military alliance
with Israel and Turkey. Jordan denied the report.
	   Damascus says such an alliance would undermine its security.
	   This is the first time any news organization has been shut down
in Jordan under a press law enacted in August that gives the state
sweeping authority to punish journalists for reports considered
disparaging of King Hussein.

UN chief in Bosnia wants NATO in for the long-term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United Nations' special
representative to Bosnia said Wednesday that peacekeeping work was
far from done and she'd like NATO to keep its troops there for some
time.
	   ``Our cooperation with NATO is very good,'' Elisabeth Rehn said
after briefing the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking
body. ``The only thing I was asking them is they should not
disappear for some while.''
	   NATO maintains about 30,000 troops in Bosnia as a Stabilization
Force _ about half the number that originally entered the country
in December 1995 to support the Dayton peace agreement.
	   Carlos Westendorp, the high representative in Bosnia overseeing
the civilian aspects of the Dayton agreement, has talked about
needing NATO presence for two more years, said Mrs. Rehn.
	   ``I'm not sure that's enough,'' she said. The Stabilization
Force ``should stay for some years _ two, three, four, whatever.''

Siemens earnings wiped out by restructuring costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German industrial giant Siemens said
Wednesday that a major overhaul of its business cost 4 billion
marks (dlrs 2.4 billion) in the financial year ended Sept. 30,
causing the company to post a net loss of 1.74 billion marks (dlrs
1.04 billion).
	   The preliminary figures showed a net profit of 2.66 billion
marks (dlrs 1.66 billion,) an increase of 2 percent over last
year's 2.61 billion marks (dlrs 1.63 billion.)
	   Sales were 117.8 billion marks (dlrs 73.6 billion) compared with
106.9 billion marks (dlrs 66.8 billion ) last year, an increase of
10 percent.
	   But the company said a restructuring plan announced last summer
wiped out the gains.
	   The poor performance had been expected. Company chairman
Heinrich von Pierer earlier predicted ``entirely unsatisfactory
results'' for the fiscal year.
	   A risk provision of 900 million marks (dlrs 562 million) because
of economic turmoil in Asian and Russia also dented earnings, the
company said.
	   Von Pierer said Siemens would ``noticeably strengthen itself as
an enterprise'' by cutting less profitable operations.
	   The company said it planned to spin off operations worth about
17 billion marks (dlrs 10.6 billion) in sales.
	   So far, it has sold its rail systems unit, with sales of 90
million marks (dlrs 54 million). It will also sell its copper
communications cable division.
	   Siemens said it planned to list its loss-making semiconductor
unit but didn't say when. The unit made a pretax loss of 1.2
billion marks (dlrs 750 million), compared to a pretax profit last
year of 109 million marks (dlrs 68 million.)
	   Siemens recently closed a semiconductor plant in Britain.
	   The company employed 416,000 people globally over the last year,
but the number of employees in Germany shrank by 3,000 to 194,000.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Spain's Albert Costa continued his dismal indoor
form Wednesday crashing out of the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open to
unseeded Frenchman Jerome Golmard, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5.
	   Golmard's second round win over the No. 16 seed means that the
Frenchman will face Pete Sampras in the next round, if the world
No. 1 beats Sweden's Thomas Johansson on Wednesday.
	   Clay court specialist Costa, who benefited from a bye in the
first round, has never won a match indoors.
	   ``The more the match went on, the more I was able to go to the
net and this made the difference,'' Golmard said. ``Each time I
went to the net I won the point.''
	   Golmard, 25, who has a world ranking of 57, is now looking
forward to a possible confrontation with Sampras.
	   ``There will be very few rallies because Sampras is going to
serve many aces. I'll have to be very alert on my returns,'' he
said.
	   Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, had a tough second
round win, beating Magnus Norman of Sweden, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
	   No. 7 seed Karol Kucera was also pushed to three sets, before a
sparkling third set display against France's Fabrice Santoro.
	   The Slovak player eventually won 6-2, 3-6, 6-0.

Montgomerie European Tour money leader sixth consecutive year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie, with his third
place in the season-ending Volvo Masters, repeated as the PGA
European Tour's leading money winner for the sixth consecutive
season.
	   The 35-year-old Montgomerie finished the season with total
winnings of 993,077 pounds (dlrs 1,638,577), followed by Darren
Clarke with 902,867 (dlrs 1,489,731) and Lee Westwood 814,387 (dlrs
1,343,739).
	   Montgomerie and Clarke played 20 events and Westwood played 22.
	   Some well known names on the PGA European Tour didn't have such
good seasons.
	   Two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer _ playing 18 events _
finished No. 18 with winnings of 262,347 (dlrs 432,873).
	   Worse off was Nick Faldo, the winner of six majors, who played
11 events and won 78,179 pounds (dlrs 128,995).
	   Spain's Seve Ballesteros, the former Ryder Cup captain and
winner of five of golf's majors, managed only 58,096 pounds (dlrs
95,814) playing 21 events and finished No. 108.

Republicans fail to win impeachment mandate from voters

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now Republicans face the dilemma of how to
deal with impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton
that most voters don't want, after elections that broke the
patterns of history in favor of Democrats.
	   The White House said President Clinton was encouraged by the
midterm elections in which Democrats held their lines and added as
many as five seats to their congressional minorities.
	   The president may also be relieved.
	   The impeachment momentum could be slowed by the balloting that
rebuffed Republican expectations of midterm gains _ even though a
majority of voters interviewed outside polls said the Monica
Lewinsky matter didn't affect their decisions.
	   Republican reinforcements in the House would have added impetus
to the impeachment proceedings. But none were coming.
	   And 61 percent of voters in exit polling Tuesday said they
disapproved of the way Republicans in Congress have handled the
Lewinsky scandal, with almost as many saying impeachment should be
dropped.
	   With the better-than-even break the Democrats won, the
atmosphere has changed, just as the impeachment investigation is
about to begin. There's no detailed program yet. Hearings are
expected to open the week after next in the House Judiciary
Committee. Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman, has set a goal but no
guarantee of finishing by year's end.
	   Democrats gained most of the upsets and high-visibility
takeovers in the House, Senate and state elections. Overall, the 34
Senate elections apparently produced a standstill, a Republican
majority of 55 seats to 45 Democrats.
	   With only a single Oregon contest to be settled, the trend
pointed to a House gain of five seats for the Democrats, something
that hasn't happened for the president's party at midterm since
1934.

EU says enlargement on target; sees 3 nations advancing to
</HEADLINE>
fast-track talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
talks to bring a dozen nations into the EU were on target and three
candidates _ Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia _ can likely advance to
fast-track negotiations as of 1999.
	   In an appearance before the European Parliament, EU Foreign
Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek gave a generally upbeat
assessment of efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 East European nations
into the EU in the next decade.
	   This year, the EU began preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus and opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The second group are nations seen to face a tougher job in
improving their economies before serious membership talks can
begin.
	   Yet Van den Broek signaled Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia were
performing better than expected.
	   ``The rate of progress has been sufficient,'' he said for the
European Commission to consider recommending ``the opening of
(membership) negotiations at the end of 1999 for Latvia.''
	   ``For Lithuania and Slovakia, we also hope to be able to
recommend the opening of negotiations within a reasonable period,''
he added.
	   Van den Broek appeared before the parliament as the commission
issued a status report on negotiations to date with 11 candidate
members.
	   He said Cyprus was performing ``relatively well'' in economic
terms.
	   ``The integration of Cyprus, including its northern part into
the EU should not raise major economic difficulties,'' he said.
	   However, he added, the island's division and the inability to
compose a Cyprus negotiating team that includes Turkish Cypriots
posed an obstacle to a smooth entry into the EU.
	   Van den Broek reiterated Turkey, a country that has been snubbed
as a candidate, remained unready for EU membership in both
political and economic terms.
	   He singled out as problem areas ``the role of the military in
political life, the protection of minority rights and (inadequate)
independence of the judiciary,''
	   ``There is too much macro-economic instability and state
involvement in the economy, particularly in the underdeveloped
banking sector.'' Van den Broek added.

Foreign minister cancels tour because of visible security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was either incognito or ``no'' for Danish
Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen.
	   Israel officials said Wednesday that Helveg Petersen, on a
one-day visit to Israel a day earlier, canceled a walking tour of
Jerusalem's Old City after discovering he would be accompanied by
uniformed police instead of undercover security agents.
	   Helveg Petersen left Israel for the United States early
Wednesday.
	   Imara Dotan, a spokeswoman for Israel's foreign ministry said
Helveg Petersen wanted his tour to be low-profile and requested
only undercover agents to accompany him.
	   However, diplomatic protocol requires that foreign dignitaries
be protected by uniformed police, especially in areas such as the
contested Old City which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. Enclosed by 400-year-old walls with winding, narrow
and crowded pedestrian alley ways, the Old City is a challenge to
Israeli security.
	   ``We have to do it,'' Dotan told The Associated Press. ``Our
responsibility is to give him security anywhere he goes, whether it
be in the Old City, Tel Aviv or the beach,'' she said.
	   Two members of Israel's border police, dressed in military
uniforms and carrying submachine guns, were assigned to accompany
the Danish foreign minister. When Helveg Petersen saw them, he
canceled the tour because he thought it would attract too much
attention, Dotan said. A Danish embassy official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Helveg Petersen later apologized to
the group assigned to accompany him on the tour.
	   This incident isn't the first time tight security has disrupted
a European leader's visit to the Old City. In October 1996, French
President Jacques Chirac openly scolded the flanks of security
agents and police keeping bystanders and journalists at bay during
his tour.
	   He ended up filing an official complaint because of what he said
was his guards' ``unacceptable agitation.''

Embassy to resume consular services early next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy will resume
consular services early next year after suspending operations when
a terrorist bomb destroyed the mission on Aug. 7, an embassy
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``Normal operations will resume, depending on whether the
mission is able to move to a new embassy building by January or
February,'' said Dudley Sims.
	   The blast killed 11 people, all of them Africans, and injured
86.
	   Two men have been charged with the Dar es Salaam bombing and
await trial in Dar es Salaam.
	   A nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in
neighboring Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, and
injured 5,500.
	   Sim said work was being done on several buildings on Msese
Street in Dar es Salaam's Kinondoni neighborhood that will house
the embassy. He said the existing houses were just being modified
and a new embassy was not under construction.
	   Immediately after the blast in a residential neighborhood, the
mission moved to temporary quarters nearby.
	   In Nairobi, consular services are expected to resume before the
end of the year at a modified suburban house.
	   A flag-raising ceremony was held Oct. 30 at a building on a road
between downtown Nairobi and the international airport that will
house the rest of the embassy operations until funds are
appropriated to build a new mission.

Radical Basque party says no to representing gunmen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Aznar; CORRECTS spelling of Otegi,
Euskal Herritarrok; Minor edits &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The leader of a party linked to the armed
Basque separatist group ETA on Wednesday welcomed the government's
first move toward talks to resolve the Basque conflict, but
rejected suggestions that his party might represent the gunmen.
	   Arnaldo Otegi of the Herri Batasuna group said the initiative
toward talks announced Tuesday represented a ``positive change in
attitude'' given the fact that the government has long rejected any
negotiations with ETA.
	   But, speaking on a Basque radio station, Otegi rejected
suggestions that his group might act as representatives for the
armed organization.
	   ``If the government wants to talk to Herri Batasuna, let it do
so. If it wants to talk to ETA, then it should talk to ETA,'' Otegi
said.''We're not going to represent ETA in any manner or in any
talks.''
	   Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Tuesday he had
authorized contacts with groups linked to ETA in what was his
two-year-old government's first step toward negotiating an end to
the 30-year conflict.
	   The move by Aznar, who survived a car-bomb attack in 1995 as
opposition leader, comes in the wake of ETA's first ever open-ended
truce, which started Sept. 18.
	   ``The message has been sent. Now we are waiting,'' Aznar told
reporters Wednesday, indicating that it was ETA's turn to respond.
	   He said the any decisions made along the way would be made
public although some details of the process would be kept
confidential.
	   Otegi's Herri Batasuna is considered the political wing of ETA.
Heading a new pro-independence coalition called Euskal Herritarrok,
the party won 16 seats in the 75-seat Basque parliament in regional
elections held on Oct. 25.
	   He said his party had not had any contact with the government
since Aznar's announcement Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday, the daily ABC cited unidentified government
sources as saying one of the government's conditions was for Herri
Batasuna or Euskal Herritarrok to handle the political side of any
talks.
	   The paper said the government was also seeking guarantees that
ETA would control its gunmen and that it would dismantle its
infrastructure, particularly its bomb-making facilities, in France
and Spain.
	   ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty, has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for an
independent state taking in the Basque areas of northern Spain and
southwestern France.
	   Negotiations were held with the organization in 1989 in Algeria
under the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez. The talks broke
down and ETA violence resumed.
	   Aznar initially rejected talks, demanding that ETA give further
proof of peaceful intentions. But he has also come under pressure
from other political parties to respond positively to the
cease-fire.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the proposed contacts were
``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to give up violence
for good.''
	   The move was welcomed by political parties across the board.
	   News reports said ETA decided on a truce because it had been
seriously weakened by arrests and police infiltration. Its support
has also been undermined by many large demonstrations against its
killings in recent years.
	   The organization and its allies were also influenced by
developments in Northern Ireland where the Irish Republican Army
and other paramilitary groups observed cease-fires that paved the
way for peace talks and the April peace accord between Catholics
and Protestants.
	   No date or location has been set for any talks on the Basque
conflict.

Ruling coalition parties agree on direct presidental elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The four parties of the ruling
coalition agreed Wednesday to change the constitution and elect
Slovakia's new head of state in direct presidential balloting.
	   Under the current law, the president is elected by parliament
and has to gain a three-fifth majority of votes.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since early March when
Michal Kovac's term expired. The deeply divided parliament failed
to elect a successor. The Cabinet of then Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar assumed most of the presidential powers.
	   The new coalition government was formed Oct. 30 by Prime
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, just over a month after parliamentary
elections in September resulting in the clear defeat of the
governing coalition led by Vladimir Meciar.
	   Dzurinda said the coalition will support Rudolf Schuster as its
presidential candidate. Schuster, 64, said he was glad to be the
coalition's only candidate for the post. He heads the Party of
Civic Understanding, the smallest coalition party.
	   Schuster was ambassador to Canada in 1990-92, has also served as
mayor of Kosice, the second-largest city in Slovakia.
	   The direct presidential election has been a key point in the
program of Dzurinda's party during the election campaign.
	   His new coalition has the support of 93 deputies in the 150-seat
parliament, enough to change the constitution to introduce the
popular vote for the president.
	   It was not immediately known when the new parliament would
change the constitution. The date of the election will be set
afterward.

Hurt by Northwest strike, Dutch carrier takes earnings hit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by the turbulent global
economy and a pilot strike at U.S. partner Northwest, KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines on Wednesday posted a 25 percent drop in earnings.
	   KLM said operating profit for the second quarter ending Sept. 30
declined to 377 million guilders (dlrs 201 million). It said the
decline would have been only 11 percent if the figures included
results from its subsidiary, Martinair.
	   KLM had issued a profit-warning in which it said second-quarter
results would be hurt by the global financial turmoil and by extra
costs related to the strike at Northwest Airlines.
	   The Dutch carrier said it took a one-time hit of more than 50
million guilders (dlrs 26.7 million) from the 15-day September
strike.
	   Citing the deterioration of the global economic outlook in
recent months, KLM said it doesn't expect any improvements during
the remainder of its fiscal year. KLM said it also was hurt by the
dollar's drop.
	   Looking ahead, the airline said it was working to improve
performance and would take steps to make sure flights leave and
arrive on time.

Iranians burn flags to mark anniversary of U.S. Embassy seizure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of protesters burned American
flags and effigies of Uncle Sam outside the former U.S. Embassy on
Wednesday to mark the 19th anniversary of its takeover by Islamic
militants.
	   But the atmosphere outside the former embassy compound in the
heart of Tehran was more like a carnival than a political protest.
	   Most of the 20,000 demonstrators were high school students who
were given the day off to mark the anniversary of the Nov. 4, 1979,
embassy takeover and seizure of 52 U.S. hostages, a turning point
of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   However, the anti-American sentiment that has been a cornerstone
of Iranian policy has lost its resonance since the election last
year of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who has
encouraged ties with Americans.
	   All but about a half-dozen of the 400 students who seized the
U.S. Embassy _ once zealous supporters of the Islamic Revolution
and its leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini _ are now considered
moderates who back Khatami's call for dialogue with the American
people.
	   Some in the crowd Wednesday, cheered on by fellow demonstrators,
threw handfuls of fliers into the air every few minutes, emblazoned
with ``Death to America'' and ``Death to Israel.''
	   Thick plumes of black smoke rose from burning effigies of Uncle
Sam or American flags that were set ablaze every few minutes.
	   Still, few people listened as Mohsen Rezaei, a member of a
powerful government body and former commander of the Revolutionary
Guards, denounced the United States.
	   ``Many of the people who say today, 'Why doesn't Iran establish
ties with America?' mainly emphasize the short-term reasons''
behind the embassy takeover, Rezaei said.
	   ``There were long-term reasons for the takeover of the den of
spies,'' he said, using a term popular during the revolution to
describe the U.S. Embassy.
	   Ahmad Reza Mahdavi, a 17-year-old high school student wearing a
T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of ``Titanic'' star Leonardo
DiCaprio, said he harbored no hatred against the United States.
	   ``I don't dislike America too much. But we must accept that the
American government is not fair to Iran,'' Mahdavi said.
	   ``The United States remains close to countries that are
undemocratic, violators of human rights, and worse in every way
compared to us. But all we get from them is criticism, accusations
and blame,'' Mahdavi said.
	   On Monday, the student leaders who seized the embassy in 1979
invited their former hostages to return to the country where they
spent 444 days in captivity. No American flags were burned at that
demonstration as a courtesy to the American people.

Former Shin Bet informer to be indicted in Rabin assassination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A former Shin Bet informer and right-wing
agitator who befriended Yitzhak Rabin's assassin will be indicted
on charges he failed to prevent the killing, the attorney general
said Wednesday.
	   The decision by Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein came
exactly three years after Yigal Amir, an ultranationalist Jew
opposed to Rabin's land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, shot
dead the prime minister at a Tel Aviv peace rally.
	   The suspect to be indicted is Avishai Raviv, an informer for the
Shin Bet security services who had the code name ``champagne.''
	   Raviv founded the radical group Eyal and was known for leading
some of the most virulent protests against Rabin.
	   In a news conference, Rubinstein said that Raviv was aware of
Amir's intentions to kill Rabin and did not tell his Shin Bet
handlers about it. However, Raviv was not being charged as an
accomplice because he did not know of Amir's specific plans to
shoot Rabin on the night of Nov. 4, 1995, Rubinstein said.
	   Rubinstein's decision was likely to add new fuel to theories
spread by the right-wing fringe that the Shin Bet knew of Amir's
plans from Raviv and intended _ with Rabin's knowledge _ to replace
his bullets with blanks and let him fire them in order to discredit
the right wing.
	   Questions have also been raised about Raviv's relationship with
Amir, and to what extent the Shin Bet informer may have encouraged
Amir to carry out the killing.
	   A government-appointed commission of inquiry into the
assassination has ruled out any conspiracy.
	   Israel's dovish opposition has dismissed the conspiracy theories
as attempts to deflect the blame for incitement against Rabin away
from ultranationalist groups. Rabin supporters have accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then the opposition leader, of
creating the divisive political climate that led to the killing.
	   Rubinstein said the Shin Bet was opposed to putting Raviv on
trial _ apparently in part because it would hurt future recruitment
efforts _ and that's why the decision to indict him had been so
difficult.
	   ``The bottom line is that this is not a case against the (Shin
Bet),'' Rubinstein said. ``It's a case against Avishai Raviv.''
	   Raviv will also be charged with encouraging violent acts and
inciting to racism, a result of his activities in Eyal.
	   Another Amir friend, Margalit Har-Shefi, was sentenced in
September to nine months in jail for failure to prevent the the
assassination. The maximum sentence is two years.

China's legislature removes two senior prosecutors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's legislature removed two of the nation's
top prosecutors for misconduct as part of a judicial housecleaning,
state media reported Wednesday.
	   The standing committee of the National People's Congress voted
to dismiss Luo Ji and Huang Lizhi from the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, the highest-level agency for prosecutors in China,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Procurator-General Han Zhubin recommended their removal, saying
the two had ``violated discipline and are not suited to be
procurators,'' Xinhua said.
	   No further information was given of their alleged misdeeds.
China's Communist Party leadership has been trying to curb rampant
official corruption and hopes building a more modern, professional
legal system will help restore public confidence.
	   Both the procuratorate and the Supreme People's Court have since
the spring launched campaigns to ferret out corruption and
incompetence within their ranks.

Magistrate drops most charges against suspect in Rwandan's slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Wednesday dropped three of
the five charges filed against a suspect in the May murder of a
Rwandan opposition leader and his driver.
	   Jesse Lesiit dropped charges against Rwandan David Akiki
Kiwanuka of conspiring with two other suspects to murder former
Rwandan Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga and of possessing a
pistol and 26 rounds of ammunition without a license.
	   She said in a hearing that the prosecution had not presented
sufficient evidence to sustain the charges.
	   Also charged in connection with the gunning down of Sendashonga
and Bosco Nkuliyubu Keye were Kenyan Charles Muhanji Wamuthoni and
Ugandan Christopher Lubanga Mlondo.
	   However, Jesiit ordered the three suspects to appear in court
Nov. 13 to hear whether they will be handed over to the high court
to stand trial for the May 16 murders.
	   The accused have been held without bail since a week after the
murder.
	   Sendashonga had been living in exile in Kenya after being
dismissed from the Rwandan government in August 1995.
	   After the arrests, police spokesman Njeru Kianda said a Rwandan
Tutsi businessman living in Nairobi had confessed to ordering
Sendashonga's death to avenge the killing of the Rwandan's father
on the former minister's orders.
	   Sendashonga, a Hutu, was a member of the predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front that ousted a Hutu extremist government in
Rwanda in July 1994 after it carried out a three-month slaughter of
at least 500,000 people, mostly of them minority Tutsis.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts in 1995 after they protested the
reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.

French ferry workers strike, intercept British ferries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with strikers intercepting ferries at port &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ More than 1,000 people were stuck on a
British ferry in this northern port on Wednesday after striking
French ferry workers prevented them from disembarking.
	   The irate passengers were stuck on board the P&AMP;O `Pride of
Dover' ferry for more than an hour, but finally were allowed to get
off shortly after midday.
	   The workers then intercepted another P&AMP;O ferry, the `Stena
Fantasia.'
	   About 90 percent of personnel at the Seafrance company have been
on strike for two days, protesting the appointment of a former
sailor from outside the company to be the new chief of passenger
service. The strikers say he is unqualified for the post.
	   The strike action sharply reduced services across the English
Channel Wednesday, with the company's two ferries, the Cezanne and
the Renoir, which sail daily for England, prevented from sailing.
	   It also caused long traffic jams on roads leading to the port.
	   A third ship on its way from England to its home port in Calais
had to be directed to the French port of Dunkirk. Seafrance was
advising its customers to use P&AMP;0.
	   No meetings between Seafrance management and the striking
workers are scheduled for the time being.

Israel denies its secret service still using Canadian passports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Israeli government Wednesday denied a TV news
report that its secret service is still seeking Canadian passports
to use in its covert operations.
	   CTV News reported Tuesday that Leslie Lewis, a dual
Canadian-Israeli citizen who moved from Vancouver to Israel in
1991, has informed Canadian authorities the Mossad approached him
as recently as last February about getting its hands on a Canadian
passport.
	   In September 1997, Israeli agents were caught after a bungled
assassination attempt of a Palestinian militant leader in
neighboring Jordan. The agents were carrying doctored Canadian
passports, causing a major diplomatic flap between Canada and
Israel.
	   In November 1997, then Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
promised that Israel would not use Canadian passports again.
	   Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also told his secret
service that Canadian passports were off-limits.
	   But within weeks, according to Lewis, the Mossad asked him for
his Canadian passport, a request he refused. And last February, he
said the agency asked yet again, this time about getting his
daughter to apply for a Canadian passport so she could turn it
over.
	   David Bar-Illan, one of Netanyahu's advisers, denied the CTV
report.
	   ``There is no basis to this,'' he said. ``Neither the Mossad nor
any other agency of the Israeli government uses Canadian passport
for any purpose whatsoever.''
	   Canada's ambassador to Israel, David Berger, insists the
Israelis are keeping their promise.

European defense ministers discuss lessening reliance on NATO
</HEADLINE>

defense ministers &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European defense ministers said Wednesday
they need to improve their military capability in order to react
swiftly to crises like Kosovo without having to rely on U.S.-led
NATO.
	   Meeting at a one-day conference, ministers from the 15-nation
European Union said the muscle is needed to lend more clout to
diplomacy in the Balkans and other European hotspots.
	   Several denied any motive of eventually challenging the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization as the continent's main military
power.
	   ``We don't intend to undermine NATO, or to duplicate it, because
NATO exists and is a cornerstone, the foundation stone of the
European state,'' British Defense Minister George Robertson said at
a news conference. ``Nor is there any appetite for a single
European army.
	   ``But there is a desire to make sure that Europe can be what it
wants to be: effective, efficient and able to deal with the sort of
crises that can come in the future.''
	   The meeting was billed as an informal, one-time gathering of
defense ministers. There was no official communique, but the
problems and delays in trying to quash conflicts in Bosnia and
Kosovo clearly were on their minds.
	   Britain has taken the lead in urging that the EU take a bigger
defense role without having to rely on NATO. Prime Minister Tony
Blair said last month that the union needs ``fresh thinking'' about
developing a defense capability.
	   Unifying and upgrading the European military would be a natural
step after the adoption of a single currency.
	   ``No one denies the importance of the transatlantic link for our
security,'' said French Defense Minister Alain Richard. ``But
neither does anyone doubt that Europe, with a single currency,
cannot for long make do without a real dimension of defense and
security.''
	   Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend of Austria, which holds the
rotating EU presidency, said Europe's military is unsatisfactory in
such areas as reconnaissance and strategic transport.
	   He said Europe must learn lessons from the disasters in Bosnia
and Kosovo.
	   ``We Europeans simply have to be willing and able to get to
grips with European crises and conflicts, if necessary also by our
own efforts _ before hundreds of thousands of people have been
killed and millions have been driven from their homes,'' he told
the ministers.
	   The crisis in Iraq also was discussed. Robertson said the
ministers had ``one voice'' in demanding that Iraq resume
cooperating with weapons inspectors.
	   ``There is one signal to Baghdad: that compliance with the U.N.
is the only alternative for Saddam Hussein at this time,''
Robertson told reporters.
	   Failing full compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions,
``then Saddam must face the consequences,'' he said.

Ruling coalition parties agree on direct presidental elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The four parties of the ruling
coalition agreed Wednesday to change the constitution and elect
Slovakia's new head of state in direct presidential balloting.
	   Under current law, the president is elected by parliament and
has to gain a three-fifth majority of votes.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since March, when Michal
Kovac's term expired. The deeply divided parliament failed to elect
a successor. The Cabinet of then-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
assumed most of the presidential powers.
	   The new coalition government was formed Oct. 30 by Prime
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, a month after parliamentary elections
and the defeat of the governing coalition led by Meciar.
	   Dzurinda said the coalition will support Rudolf Schuster as its
sole presidential candidate.
	   Schuster, 64, heads the Party of Civic Understanding, the
smallest coalition party.
	   Schuster was ambassador to Canada in 1990-92 and former mayor of
Kosice, the second-largest city in Slovakia.
	   The direct presidential election has been a key point of
contention during the election campaign.
	   The new coalition has the support of 93 deputies in the 150-seat
parliament, enough to change the constitution to introduce the
popular vote for the president.
	   It was not immediately known when the new parliament would
change the constitution. The date of the election will be set
afterward.

Plan for representation of euro-nations at G-7 meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday that Italy, Germany, France and the nation holding the EU
presidency represent the 11 countries that will adopt the euro
currency at Group of Seven meetings.
	   The EU's proposal for euro-zone participation in the G-7, the
International Monetary Fund, and other global bodies where economic
and monetary issues feature has become a controversial issue since
the small euro nations also wanted a bigger say.
	   In the Commission's view, the current euro zone members of the
G-7 are capable of speaking for all the single currency countries,
provided they establish strict consultation and reporting
procedures with non-G-7 counterparts.
	   The proposal, intended as grist for an EU finance ministers
debate on the issue Nov. 23, should spark debate about whether
smaller states will be seated at the G-7 table.
	   Commission officials have said their proposal was conditioned by
the unwillingness of the EU's G-7 contingent - which also includes
non-euro country Britain - to cede any status to a common euro-zone
delegate. Early on in the representation debate, the larger states
made it clear that there would be no dilution of their global
influence.
	   External euro zone relations is one of the last monetary union
details EU countries are addressing ahead of the single currency
launch on Jan. 1, 1999. EU leaders want to take final decisions on
the representation issue at a summit in Vienna Dec. 11-12.
	   Small euro-zone countries will definitely be empowered via an
enhanced role for the finance minister of the EU country that holds
the rotating EU presidency.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and charged into
crowds of demonstrators with nightsticks Wednesday as tensions over
fuel price increases erupted in the capital.
	   Demonstrators stoned passing cars and erected makeshift
barricades, preventing access to many parts of the city. Industries
were closed because workers failed to show up for duty.
	   Reinforcements of riot police were seen headed through western
Harare, where shop owners barricaded their stores and panicked
crowds ran from stone-throwing bands of youths.
	   Several schools appealed to parents to collect their children
early, state radio said. Many suburban shops were closed.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries in the latest unrest
to hit Zimbabwe since its economy began collapsing a year ago.
	   Frenzied demonstrators even attempted to torch a gas station by
trying to spray gasoline from pumps and ignite it. Police prevented
the demonstrators from possibly immolating themselves by charging
into the crowd with batons, witnesses said.
	   Other gas stations around shut off power to their pumps.
	   State radio reported several shops, including a liquor store,
were looted in Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of
Harare. Mobs in Chitungwiza also stoned and torched a bus, an army
truck and several other vehicles overnight, the radio said.
	   Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters in the suburb,
witnesses said.
	   By mid-afternoon an uneasy calm returned to much of the capital.
	   The unrest began when private taxi vans and buses blocked
entrance routes to Harare to protest a 67 percent hike in gas
prices announced by the government on Saturday. Scuffles broke out
between transport operators and commuters. Commuters were angered
by taxi vans _ those that were still operating _ which had doubled
their fares to about 10 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 0.27) for a single
trip.
	   In downtown Harare, some shops and banks closed their doors.
Police prevented demonstrators reaching the city center.
	   State radio said several people were arrested overnight but gave
no further details.

Colombian troops retake remote town after costly rebel siege
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian troops re-established control
Wednesday over a remote state capital seized by leftist rebels
three days ago, ending a siege in which an estimated 150 soldiers
and police were killed.
	   For the government, the battle for Mitu appeared to be the
costliest single engagement in more than three decades of civil war
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the hemisphere's
oldest and largest rebel band.
	   Besides the dead, 45 police officers were taken prisoner in the
fighting.
	   To retake the Amazon basin city, about 500 soldiers fought their
way in after their transport planes and helicopters refueled at an
airfield just across the border in Brazil, said army spokesman
Capt. Fernando Avila.
	   The Brazilian government protested use of its territory for the
operation and recalled its ambassador for consultations.
	   Colombian military planes were unable to land in Mitu because
the rebels had mined it, so they used the Brazilian airfield to
refuel Tuesday and evacuate more than 30 wounded, said Gen.
Fernando Tapias, the armed forces chief.
	   The director of the Mitu hospital, William Vaquero, said about
150 soldiers and police were killed, and the rebels also suffered a
large number of casualties. The military has not confirmed the
death toll.
	   The rebels, who withdrew Tuesday night, said in an e-mail
communique that they suffered five killed and 15 wounded.
	   Vaquero told Caracol radio that at least seven civilians were
killed in the fighting, which began before dawn Sunday. A force of
at least 800 rebels blew up the microwave communications tower,
seized the airport and leveled the police base, defended by 125
officers and cadets, firing homemade missiles from some 200
modified propane gas cylinders.
	   The FARC did not say how many police it killed and captured in
the 12-hour garrison attack, but reported 28 police and soldiers
killed and 38 wounded in combat with government reinforcements on
Monday.
	   No soldiers were based in Mitu, which is accessible only by air
and water.
	   Despite the rebel attack, President Andres Pastrana says he
still plans to go ahead with peace talks with the guerrilla group
in the coming weeks.
	   Pastrana, who took office in August vowing to end the 34-year
civil war, has agreed to begin peace talks without a cease-fire.
Before talks start, the rebels want to exchange captured soldiers
and police _ up to about 290 after Sunday's siege _ for 452 jailed
guerrillas. Pastrana has so far not agreed to the demand.

NATO-led Sea Breeze peacekeeping maneuvers end in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A parade of military vessels Wednesday
outside Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa formally concluded the
NATO-led Sea Breeze '98 peacekeeping exercise.
	   The maneuvers brought together military units from Ukraine, the
United States, Russia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Great Britain,
Greece, Georgia, Italy, Romania and Turkey.
	   The exercise was organized by Ukraine and the United States
under NATO's Partnership for Peace program. It simulated an
international force assembled by the United Nations to assist an
imaginary coastal republic devastated by an earthquake.
	   About 4,500 participants with 28 ships, more than 30 aircraft
and dozens of military vehicles pretended to deliver humanitarian
aid, evacuate sick and injured citizens and enforce an embargo to
prevent illegal weapons supplies.
	   The sea stage involved defense from attacks of a mock enemy,
artillery practices, the destruction of an imaginary enemy
submarine, escort of ships belonging to the peacekeeping force and
a landing operation.
	   Russia, which refused to participate in Sea Breeze '97,
contributed two ships and 30 marines to the maneuvers, its first
joint exercise with the Ukrainian and U.S. navies.
	   The exercise has enraged Ukrainian leftists, who are opposed to
their country's active ties with NATO. Last month, Ukraine's
Communists and their allies who dominate parliament tried to ban
Sea Breeze, but fell two dozen votes short of approving the motion.
	   Sea Breeze '97 drew sharp protests from Russia and hundreds of
angry demonstrators on the mostly Russian-populated Crimean
Peninsula.
	   Moscow criticized last year's exercise because its original
scenario spoke of preventing ethnic unrest in Crimea, which Russia
saw as an allusion to the peninsula's ethnic Russian separatists
wanting Crimea to become part of Russia instead of Ukraine.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Taking on the challenge of finding peace
in Congo, a top U.S. official appeared to achieve little Wednesday
in her bid to persuade Rwandans to disengage from the three-month
Congolese war.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice, reversing an
earlier position, met with Congolese rebels in a hastily arranged
meeting in Kigali, U.S. Embassy and Rwandan officials said.
	   Details from the meeting were not immediately available.
	   On Sunday, embassy officials told rebels their request for a
meeting with Rice was premature. Rice overruled the decision
Wednesday.
	   The rebellion against President Laurent Kabila has already
embroiled troops from as many as eight countries, including Rwanda,
which accuses him of genocide and failing to rid the common border
of Rwandan rebels.
	   ``We have heard the desire of all sides for peace. Every
government that we have spoken to has made a clear preference for
peace,'' Rice said before meeting with the rebels. ``I think the
challenge is how to get there. We'll continue our efforts to try to
search for peace.''
	   After three hours of talks with President Pasteur Bizimungu and
Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president and chief architect of
Rwandan policy in Congo, the Rwandan government again denied having
troops in Congo and distanced itself from the crisis.
	   ``We believe the Congolese people are the principal in this
conflict, therefore the Congolese government, the rebels and other
political organizations in Congo must find a way to negotiate a
political settlement,'' Minister of State Patrick Mazimhaka said.
	   Rice was scheduled to meet Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
later Wednesday in Entebbe, her final destination.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate directly with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. On
Wednesday, Kabila flew to Harare, Zimbabwe, for consultations with
President Robert Mugabe, who has sent 6,000 troops and an air force
to prop up his Congolese ally.
	   Angola and Namibia, too, sent troops and tanks to help stop
rebel advances.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already visited South Africa,
Angola, Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe, had a hard time convincing the
countries supporting Kabila of U.S. impartiality in the conflict.
	   Both Kabila and Mugabe insisted the United States put pressure
on Rwanda and Uganda to withdraw their support for the rebels
before any deal could be reached.
	   In Kigali, Rice acknowledged Rwanda's security concerns in
Congo, and said any settlement must address the border security and
an end to ethnic killings _ a reference to anti-Tutsi persecution
in Congo.
	   ``Our aim is to move the peace process forward. We see our role
as one of support to regional efforts to achieve a negotiated
settlement to Congolese conflict,'' she said.
	   Rice denied reports that Angola had promised to withdraw troops
from Congo, saying such discussions had never taken place.

German government says not trying to limit central banks'
</HEADLINE>
independence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government denied Wednesday that
it was trying to pressure the country's central bank or the new
European Central Bank, a reference to controversial demands by the
finance minister for cuts in interest rates.
	   ``Nobody is questioning the independence of the Bundesbank,''
Germany's central bank, said Uwe-Carsten Heye, spokesman for
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
	   The notion the government was pressuring the banks was
``false,'' Heye said.
	   His remarks came one day before Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine was to attend a meeting of the Bundesbank's
policy-setting council Thursday.
	   Lafontaine has repeatedly demanded the Bundesbank and the ECB
cut interest rates to include broader goals, such as jobs creation
and economic growth, in monetary policy decisions.
	   The ECB will decide monetary policy for the 11 of the European
Union's 15 states launching a common currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
	   Schroeder has backed his finance minister's calls, but recently
has appeared to distance himself, suggesting the issue could be
better discussed in private with bankers.
	   Most central bankers have responded coolly. They say jobs and
growth are structural issues to be solved with political and
economic, not monetary, mechanisms.
	   Schroeder believes the EU's 1992 Maastricht Treaty which set up
the ECB did imply a link between jobs policy and monetary policy,
said Heye, adding that ``Monetary policy cannot be kept out of
public debate.''
	   Heye described Lafontaine's visit to the Bundesbank as a
courtesy call with the goal of discussing monetary policy and jobs
creation.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said Wednesday he could do nothing for a Dutch cyclist
detained since his arrest on suspicion of doping during the Tour de
France.
	   Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok pressed the plight of TVM team
leader Cees Priem during a working lunch with Jospin at Kok's
official residence in The Hague.
	   But Jospin told reporters his hands were tied. ``The French
judicial system is totally independent. We can't tell them what to
do,'' he said.
	   Priem was arrested July 23 with TVM doctor Andrei Mikhailov
after performance-enhancing drugs were discovered in the pro team's
hotel.
	   Although he has not yet been charged and is not in custody,
Priem has not been allowed to leave France and must check in daily
with authorities. He has been placed under formal investigation, a
step short of being formally charged.
	   The president of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union recently
suggested that French authorities might be holding Priem to protest
the liberal Dutch drugs policy which has often led to tension
between the two nations.
	   Jospin dismissed that claim Wednesday.
	   ``I can tell you one thing,'' he said. ``We are involved in a
struggle against doping in sport ... I am sure everyone agrees with
the necessity of eradicating doping from sport.''
	   The investigation of the TVM team began last March, when French
customs agents found about 100 doses of EPO, which increases oxygen
to the red blood cells, in a team car.
	   That find came to light following the outbreak of the scandal
involving the Spanish team Festina, which was kicked off the Tour
after some of its riders admitted taking performance-enhancing
drugs.

Victims' families announce creation of Flight 111 association
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Relatives of some of those killed in the crash of
Swissair Flight 111 have formed a family association, the group
said Wednesday in a statement which criticized the information
provided by the airline.
	   The group, ``The Families of Swissair Flight 111,'' is chaired
by Miles Gerety, brother of Pierce Gerety, an American who directed
relief operations in central Africa for the U.N. refugee agency.
	   All 229 passengers and crew members on board the Swissair MD-11
bound from New York to Geneva were killed in the crash off the
coast of Nova Scotia.
	   The U.S. State Department has mailed a letter from Gerety to
relatives of U.S. citizens killed, the association said in a
statement.
	   The group was formed ``because we feel that, in the midst of all
this pain, one of the best things we can do for ourselves and for
each other is to share our feelings and offer one another
support,'' Gerety wrote.
	   It also plans a memorial to the victims.
	   The group said it started over the Internet after relatives
traveled to the crash site at Peggy's Cove with the support of
Swissair and its partner, Delta Air Lines.
	   But when families returned home, they found information about
the crash had dried up, vice-chairperson Monica Hawkins said.
	   Swissair has won praise for its handling of the disaster. The
airline arranged for rapid transport, police protection and cash
payments for families wanting to grieve at the site of the
accident.
	   It also chartered planes to ensure that journalists could reach
the area and used its public relations firm to help smooth things
on the ground.
	   But Gerety said families were often unaware of sources of
information, such as a Swissair recorded message about the progess
of the recovery operation.
	   ``Relatives felt increasingly isolated and frustrated with
Swissair and Canadian officials, Hawkins added. ``When people are
in shock, telling them something once doesn't mean they'll remember
it.''
	   The families have organized their own website as part of their
attempt ``to build a support network.''

Steffi Graf beats Sugiyama after slow start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ In the second match of her latest
comeback, Steffi Graf overcame a slow start and beat sixth-seeded
Ali Sugiyama 6-4, 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals of the Leipzig
Open Wednesday.
	   Graf, a four-time winner of the tournament who is unseeded this
time because of her low ranking, had trouble finding her timing and
clearly showed the lack of match practice early on against the
quick Japanese.
	   But the former No. 1 picked up her game late in the first set
and went on to post a workmanlike victory.
	   ``I expected a tough match. She's been playing good tennis in
recent months. I played her a few months ago and lost in three
close sets,'' Graf said. ``I knew she would be aggressive.''
	   Graf was sidelined nearly two months after having surgery for a
bone spur in her right wrist.
	   The 29-year-old German is now ranked No. 22 in the world, but
she could still qualify for the season-ending Chase Championship in
New York Nov. 16-22. She also plans to play in Philadelphia next
week.
	   Sugiyama, ranked No. 18 in the world, broke Graf's serve in the
opening game and the German could not find her range.
	   The key game of the match turned out to be the third, Graf's
second service game that went to eight deuces. Graf won a long and
spectacular rally and then hit an ace to clinch the game after
fighting off three break points.
	   ``That was a very important game. I had possibilities to win it
earlier and she had chances to break me,'' Graf said. ``Winning
this game gave me confidence. I knew it'd be tough to win the first
set if I lost that game. She put me under a lot of pressure.''
	   Graf then broke Sugiyama's serve twice as she fought back from a
4-2 deficit to win five games in a row, clinching the first set and
going up 1-0 in the second.
	   The German broke once more for a 4-2 lead and held three match
points. She wasted one with a double-fault, hit a slice backhand
long on the next but the Japanese then netted a backhand.
	   Graf, who held the top ranking a record 374 weeks and dominated
the women's game for a decade, now has a 22-0 match record in
Leipzig, a tournament she helped found.
	   In another match in the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament,
third-seeded Dominique van Roost ousted former French Open champion
Iva Majoli 6-4, 6-1.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers have moved 17 mobile homes onto
a West Bank hill, and peace activists said Wednesday that this was
part of a campaign to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
	   Mobile homes have been put up in at least two other sites since
the Oct. 23 signing of the new Mideast peace agreement which calls
for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders have said they are seizing land because they
fear it would otherwise be handed over to the Palestinians.
	   The United States opposes Jewish settlement expansion, and as
part of the new accord urged both sides again to refrain from
unilateral actions that pre-empt the outcome of negotiations on the
future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the latest incident, 17 mobile homes were erected about 250
meters (yards) away from the Avnei Hefetz settlement, a cluster of
150 homes about 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Tel Aviv.
	   Israel Bonder, The secretary at Avnei Hefetz, said the trailer
park was planned months ago and was not linked to the expected
Israeli withdrawal.
	   ``In any case, our settlement wouldn't be returned (to the
Palestinians),'' Blonder said.
	   He said the mobile homes were to be replaced eventually with
permanent housing, but would not say how many new homes are to be
built.
	   Lt. Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military government
in the West Bank, confirmed that the project had army approval.
	   By seizing the adjacent hill, the settlers are trying to create
disruptions and prevent the government from implementing the peace
accord, Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said.
	   Hagit Yaari, spokeswoman for the peace group, said there was no
housing shortage on Avnei Hefetz and that some 110 apartments there
are standing empty.
	   Blonder said that 60 apartments at Avnei Hefetz are vacant, but
said that they were too small to accommodate families wanting to
move into the settlement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to appease Jewish settlers who are
staunchly opposed to the peace agreement. Since the signing of the
peace accord, Netanyahu has been ``giving bribes to the settlers by
continuing settlements,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu has said Israel would keep expanding settlements to
accommodate what he said was natural population growth.

	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ Along a fence, the young elephants
stretched out their trunks Wednesday toward the newest batch of
visitors. One stood to the side, pus from a wound oozing down his
forehead, and others had scars.
	   It was the elephants' first news conference amid a court battle
over their treatment that has ignited international controversy and
provoked a call for a tourism boycott.
	   Their owner, Richard Ghiazza, summoned reporters to show the
animals were in good condition, but acknowledged that mistakes had
been made in training them.
	   ``Our idea is not to train them to perform and jump. We just
want them to accept human beings,'' said Ghiazza, owner of African
Game Services, an animal export farm near Pretoria.
	   For the past two weeks, a judge in the nearby small town of
Brits has been listening to a custody suit over the 30 elephants,
which were captured in the drought-ridden Tuli area of Botswana in
August.
	   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has filed animal cruelty charges against Ghiazza. They allege that
he has chained and hobbled the elephants, allowed his Indonesian
trainers to puncture their hide with sharp hooks and deprived them
of water and food.
	   The society wants the elephants released to other game reserves
where they can roam free. A decision is expected later this week.
	   People for Ethical Treatment of Animals have protested outside
South African embassies in several capitals, and the Spice Girls
have publicly appealed for their rescue.
	   Ghiazza ``admits mistakes have been made,'' Cobus Raath, a
veterinarian, told reporters at the game ranch near Pretoria.
``Everyone must go through a learning curve.''
	   Wildlife veterinarian Hym Ebebes, who heads an independent
committee monitoring the elephants' welfare, said Ghiazza had
slowed down the training, removed chains, provided straw as bedding
on a cement floor and banished the hooks.
	   Earlier this year, Ghiazza brought in six mahouts, as the
Indonesian trainers are known. They usually work with Asian
elephants, which are regarded as more trainable than their African
counterparts.
	   ``If I catch one Mahout not behaving as he should, he gets a
warning. The second time, he's back to Indonesia,'' Ghiazza said.
	   Other independent elephant experts have told the court that the
mahout training traumatizes the elephant and instills aggression.
	   ``Are these elephants going to enjoy quality of life? If the
answer is no, then they're better off dead,'' Kenyan expert Daphne
Sheldrick told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   But Raath, who has participated in culling of elephants in
Kruger Park, disagreed.
	   ``Any elephant would sooner have an alternative life than to
die,'' Raath said. ``Anyone who has seen baby elephants shot on top
of their mothers would be appalled.''
	   SPCA investigator Rick Allan said the court had been shown his
videotape of a mahout trainer throwing 18 buckets of water in the
face of a young elephant who was thirsty and trying to drink.
	   The elephant was not allowed to drink.
	   From 1967 to 1995, government rangers killed 14,629 elephants to
limit their numbers in Kruger Park. With populations growing at 7
percent a year, Kruger _ which stopped culling to quell
international protest _ is considering reintroduction of the
practice later this month to limit its herd of more than 8,000
elephants.

Protesters in Iran mark anniversary of embassy seizure

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ American flags were burned Wednesday and so
were effigies of Uncle Sam. There were calls of ``Death to
America'' too. But the atmosphere was distinctly carnival at the
massive government-sponsored rally marking the 19th anniversary of
Iran's seizure of the U.S. Embassy.
	   Some 20,000 people _ mostly school children and high school
students given a day off for the rally _ gathered outside the
former U.S. Embassy for the annual demonstration.
	   But lacking among the participants, many of them born after the
embassy takeover, was the revolutionary fervor that drove Islamic
students who took over the U.S. Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979 and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Anti-American sentiments have since then been a cornerstone of
Iranian policy but the rhetoric has been losing edge since the
election last year of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric
who has encouraged ties with Americans.
	   Most demonstrators responded sporadically and indifferently to
calls of ``Death to America'' from a speaker directing the show
from behind a microphone on a platform.
	   Calls for ``Death to Israel'' got a more enthusiastic response.
	   Thousands of colorful fliers denouncing America and Israel were
thrown into the air like confetti and children waved balloons
printed with called for Israel's destruction.
	   A few listened as Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-line leader and former
army commander, criticized efforts to re-establish ties with the
United States.
	   He said Iran should consider opening a dialogue with the U.S.
government only when its president publicly apologizes to Iran. The
United States should also pledge that it will no longer interfere
in Iran's affairs and withdraws its warships from the Gulf.
	   Amir Khojasteh, a 25-year-old demonstrators, said he favored
ties with the United States as long as ``we stand beside them, not
behind them.''
	   Ahmad Reza Mahdavi, a 17-year-old student wearing a T-shirt with
a picture of Titanic star Leonard DiCaprio, said he harbored no
hatred against the United States.
	   ``I don't dislike America too much, but we must accept that the
American government is not fair to Iran,'' said Mahdavi.
	   The takeover of the embassy was a turning point in the 1979
Islamic Revolution that overthrew the pro-U.S. shah's regime and
installed the Shiite clerical government.
	   Hardly anyone in Iran will publicly criticize the seizure.
President Khatami also defended it.
	   The occupation was ``a kind of protest to a series of policies
which had culminated in the violation of Iran's national rights and
sovereignty,'' Khatami told students during a tour of a girls'
school in Tehran.
	   Outside the former U.S. Embassy, demonstrators said it was
necessary to participate.
	   ``We are here to keep alive the memory of that day 19 years
ago,'' said Ayat Nojavan, a 37-year-old government employee.
	   However, he disagreed with the burning of the American flag.
``We would be hurt if they burned our flag.''
	   Seyed Morteza Sahebi, 55, who was with the mob that stormed the
embassy in 1979, said he still felt the same anger about the United
States.
	   ``I feel the same as I did 19 years ago. Our revolutionary
fervor is intact. We must continue our death to America slogan,''
said Sahebi, who held out a clenched fist when he shouted ``Death
to America.''
	   In schools throughout Iran, bells were rung to mark the
anniversary, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   But in a sign of changing attitudes, the student leaders who
overran the embassy invited on Monday their former hostages to
return to Iran as their guests.
	   The former students, who have undergone ideological
transformation in the past few years and are considered moderates,
held their rally two days ahead of the actual anniversary in order
to avoid a clash with hard-liners.
	   No American flags were burned at that demonstration as a
courtesy to the American people.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Taking on the challenge of finding peace
in Congo, a top U.S. official appeared to achieve little Wednesday
in her bid to persuade Rwandans to disengage from the three-month
Congolese war.
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice, reversing an
earlier position, met with Congolese rebels in a hastily arranged
meeting in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   ``We had a frank exchange of views,'' said Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition. ``The
Americans listened to our concerns, and we hoped the contacts will
continue.''
	   On Sunday, U.S. Embassy officials told rebels their request for
a meeting with Rice was premature. Rice overruled the decision
Wednesday.

Chinese defender allegedly pushes ref
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Crystal Palace's Chinese defender Fan Zhiyi was
under scrutiny Wednesday after allegedly pushing a referee at the
end of an English division one soccer game.
	   The Football Association was expected to look into claims that
referee Terry Heilbron was pushed by Fan after Tuesday night's game
at West Bromwich Albion.
	   Heilbron, who awarded Albion a last-minute penalty which
resulted in a 3-2 defeat for Palace, was surrounded by Palace
players at the end of the match.
	   ``The referee said he though he might have been pushed by Zhiyi
but he does not seem to know, although if anyone had pushed me I'm
sure I would know all about it,'' Palace manager Terry Venables
said.
	   Palace's other Chinese defender, Sun Jihai, had been sent off by
Heilbron in the 70th minute.
	   Heilbron said he would include the alleged pushing incident in
his match report.
	   ``There was a melee at the end of the game and I was well
protected by the West Bromwich Albion stewards,'' Heilbron said.
``Everything will be in my report to the Football Association. ...
The report will cover the conduct of a Crystal Palace player in
particular and the conduct of some players in general.''
	   West Midlands police spoke to the referee about the incident but
decided not to take any action.
	   The incident comes less than two weeks after Paolo di Canio, an
Italian striker with Premier League club Sheffield Wednesday, was
banned for 11 games and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,500) for
pushing a referee to the ground.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's foreign minister on Wednesday welcomed the
outcome of the U.S. elections, saying it was ``a good thing for
democracy'' that the Democrats did not suffer a backlash from the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
	   For Swiss officials, however, the New York defeat of Republican
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato was one of the most significant aspects of
Tuesday's elections.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, in an interview with
radio station RTL, said President Bill Clinton's party had
performed well ``despite the pressures on him, despite the attacks
which really resembled McCarthyism.''
	   ``Generally, it's a good thing for democracy that this type of
attack doesn't weigh on the voters' choices.''
	   French officials have voiced dismay over the Lewinsky affair and
some expressed satisfaction that Republicans failed to gain a
mandate for impeachment proceedings against Clinton.
	   Jack Lang, head of France's National Assembly's foreign affairs
committee, said the result was ``a victory for democracy and good
judgment.''
	   Lang, a former culture minister, congratulated Clinton in a
press release, saying he was pleased ``that the American people
stood up against the heinous campaign that has been orchestrated
against you by ultraconservatives for too long.''
	   Swiss officials focused on D'Amato, who used his role as
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee repeatedly to pressure
Switzerland's banks to pay compensation to Holocaust survivors.
	   He has maintained that the banks had kept millions of dollars
deposited by Jews trying to save their wealth from Hitler's
clutches during the World War II era.
	   Although officials in general remained tight-lipped, D'Amato's
defeat was met with thinly-veiled sarcasm.
	   ``The government has taken note of Mr. D'Amato's failure to win
re-election, obviously with great regret,'' government spokesman
Achille Casanova said with a straight face, although reporters
laughed at the obvious irony.
	   In Italy, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini echoed French
officials, saying the results show a ``strengthening of the
Democratic Party, and therefore also of the presidency.''
	   Republicans retained control of the U.S. House for another two
years but failed to obtain the sizable increases the party's
leaders had sought to reinforce their agenda to impeach Clinton.
	   Vedrine said stability was positive in terms of foreign policy.
	   ``We know well the foreign policy of Clinton and (U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine) Albright,'' Vedrine said. ``So we know where we
stand.''

Prosecutors open investigation based on bodyguard's complaint
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Taking a new step in the Princess Diana
investigation, prosecutors on Wednesday opened an inquiry based on
a lawsuit by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who claims his life was
put in danger by the Ritz Hotel and its car service.
	   In a lawsuit filed last month, Rees-Jones, sole survivor of the
crash that killed the princess and two others, claimed that Ritz
management and the Etoile limousine company failed to provide a
licensed driver for the 280S Mercedes sedan that crashed.
	   The driver, Henri Paul, didn't have the type of license required
by law to drive the Mercedes. Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and
driver Paul were killed in the Aug. 31, 1997 crash in the Alma
traffic tunnel.
	   Paul, chief of security at the Ritz, was legally drunk and
taking prescription drugs for depression at the time.
	   The action by prosecutors Wednesday indicated they saw merit in
Rees-Jones' complaints.
	   Although the inquiry, called a ``complaint against X,'' did not
mention either the Ritz or Etoile, it is the logical next step in
any action against them. Prosecutors could have declined to open an
inquiry.
	   Now, Judge Herve Stephan must decide whether to bring charges
against the Ritz or Etoile _ or anyone else. He already has
questioned Ritz and Etoile managers, but only as witnesses. If he
wants to question them again, he must place them under official
investigation, a step short of formal charges.
	   Rees-Jones' lawsuit in September marked the first time that Ritz
management and the car company _ which serves only the Ritz _ had
been legally targeted for responsibility in the crash.
	   The offense of endangering the lives of others is punishable by
a maximum one year in jail and a fine of 100,000 francs (about dlrs
18,000.)
	   But attorney David Crawford, who represents Rees-Jones in
London, has said that anyone found guilty may also be liable to pay
damages to Rees-Jones.
	   At the time of the crash, Rees-Jones was an employee of Ritz
owner Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed. He has since
stopped working for Al Fayed.
	   The former bodyguard fell into a coma after the crash and his
face had to be surgically reconstructed. He was questioned several
times by French judicial officials but remembered very little of
the crash.
	   A final report by Judge Stephan is expected by the end of the
year.
	   Nine photographers and a motorcycle courier have been placed
under formal investigation for manslaughter and failure to assist
people in danger. They are expected to be exonerated on the first
charge.

Zhirinovsky: Iraq insulted by U.N. inspectors' `mockery'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and other hard-liners in the Russian
parliament on Wednesday backed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
decision to sever contacts with U.N. weapons inspectors and warned
the United States against using force on Iraq.
	   Ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who just
returned from a visit to Iraq that included talks with President
Saddam Hussein, said Wednesday that Iraq cut off contacts with U.N.
monitors because it felt insulted by their stance.
	   ``Iraq has met all their conditions, but they continue to pose
new demands all the time,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``They are openly
mocking the country.''
	   Zhirinovsky, who frequently criticizes American global
influence, accused the United States of intentionally fomenting
tension to justify its military presence.
	   ``The American administration is winding up tension to justify
spending to keep the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf,'' Zhirinovsky
told a news conference in Moscow. ``They constantly need to launch
an agression.''
	   On Tuesday, Zhirinovsky said in Baghdad that the Iraqi president
saw ``no problem'' with monitoring but wants to know when the
sanctions will end.
	   Saddam has not spoken publicly since his government announced
Saturday it was halting dealings with the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees weapons inspections. Iraq's precondition for
resuming cooperation is U.N. pledges to begin easing or lifting the
trade sanctions.
	   Baghdad accuses the Special Commission, led by Australian
Richard Butler, of working on behalf of the United States to
prolong the sanctions.
	   The inspectors are to certify that Iraq has complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   ``Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction,'' Russian Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Wednesday. ``Butler's commission
continues to conduct espionage activities there in violation of
international law.''
	   ``Americans want to dictate their will to the whole world,'' he
said. ``This is a wild recurrence of the Cold War.''
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq left over
from Soviet times, is generally sympathetic to the Arab nation and
has called for an early lifting of the sanctions, imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Still, the official government line has been critical of
Saddam's decision. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Tuesday called
it ``incomprehensible'' and again called for a peaceful solution to
the crisis.

	   CODLEA, Romania (AP) _ A teen helped his friend steal a bicycle
and got three years in prison. In the cell opposite, another
convict is doing five years for bludgeoning to death a boy who
crept into his field to steal hay to feed horses.
	   Romanian prisons are packed with people like 19-year-old Bogdan
Bonchis, a first offender convicted of a relatively minor offense
and locked up with others jailed for major violent crimes.
	   Others sit behind bars _ sometimes for years _ waiting to be
charged.
	   In Romania, there are no minimum security facilities, no general
amnesties from the president as during communism and no system of
community service in lieu of jail time to reduce overcrowding.
	   Two-thirds of Codlea Penitentiary's 1,120 inmates, an
overcrowded institution in the country's northern Transylvania
region, are serving sentences for theft. One in five must share a
bunk.
	   Nationwide, about 51,000 people are behind bars in the country's
38 prisons. Based on government standards for incarceration, there
is space for only 30,000 inmates, said Col. Constantin Batitoiu, a
director of the country's prison system.
	   Of those currently imprisoned, about 29,000 are there for theft.
Prison officials say petty offenders, like Bonchis, should get
fines, probation or community service.
	   Judicial and penal officials have made that recommendation, but
parliament has so far not acted.
	   ``I know of a lot of cases where sentences were exaggerated for
misdemeanors,'' said Corneliu Turianu, a senator and formerly a
judge. ``I don't know why judges feel they have to hand out prison
sentences.''
	   Ironically, the end of communism brought even tougher laws and
sentences, especially for crimes against property now that private
ownership is no longer curbed.
	   In 1996, parliament increased the sentences for theft. Maximum
sentences which under communism were measured in months are now
counted in years.
	   Here at Codlea, one inmate who stole three hens is serving three
years. ``He will cost the state 65 million lei'' (dlrs 7,000) to
house and feed him, Codlea's deputy commander Grigore Ormenisan
said.
	   At the same time, critics say, authorities have turned their
back on corruption which involves the rich and the politically
well-connected.
	   ``It is inadmissible that those that steal a hen are locked
away, while those that steal billions are free,'' Justice Minister
Valeriu Stoica said.
	   Three other prisons are being built and Stoica hopes that
parliament will pass legislation offering lighter punishment for
lesser offenses.
	   But for Bonchis, his hand caked in mud, as he harvests potatoes
with other convicts in the shadow of a mountain, hoping to get his
sentencduced. ``I appealed but it didn't work. I don't think I
should be spending my youth here.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments of splinter nationalist party &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The New York election defeat of Senator
Alfonse D'Amato, considered by many Swiss an unfair enemy of this
small country, was greeted by studied silence in Switzerland
Wednesday.
	   ``The government has taken note of Mr. D'Amato's failure to win
reelection, obviously with great regret,'' spokesman Achille
Casanova said with a straight face, but reporters laughed at the
obvious irony.
	   D'Amato used his role as chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee repeatedly to pressure Swiss banks to pay compensation to
Holocaust survivors.
	   He maintained that the banks had kept millions of dollars
deposited by Jews trying to save their wealth from Hitler's
clutches during the World War II era.
	   Following prolonged pressure from D'Amato and Jewish groups,
Switzerland's two biggest banks in August agreed to pay Holocaust
survivors dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses.
	   The New York Republican was defeated by Democrat Charles Schumer
in the United States' nastiest and costliest Senate race.
	   Newspapers frequently attacked D'Amato as a self-seeking
politician. Many Swiss, including Jewish leaders, accused him of
making false allegations against the country.
	   But few were prepared to comment Wednesday.
	   ``The people of New York have voted, and that's not something
for Swiss Jews to comment on,'' said Thomas Lyssy, vice-president
of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations.
	   The government's task force on World War II declined to comment.
Ulrich Pfister, spokesman of Credit Suisse, the country's
second-largest bank, who would say only that ``everyone can
personally think what they want.''
	   But there was sympathy for D'Amato from maverick Swiss lawmaker
Jean Ziegler, himself a longstanding critic of Swiss banks.
	   ``D'Amato didn't deserve to lose. He played an important role in
a crucial phase of Swiss history,'' Ziegler said in Geneva.
	   Ziegler, the only Swiss public figure to accept D'Amato's
invitation to a July committee hearing on World War II, said the
Swiss owe him recognition for his part in achieving the banks'
``just'' settlement.
	   The splinter nationalist Swiss Democrats, however, could hardly
contain their glee at D'Amato's defeat.
	   ``His whole rampage against Switzerland in the past two years
has been just as useless as his more than dlrs 20 million election
campaign,'' said a statement from the party, which has four seats
in the 200-member Swiss lower house.
	   ``It is pleasing that obviously the Americans have not let
themselves be taken in by this foul-mouth and have sent this
notorious senator from `the land of unlimited opportunity' into the
wasteland.''
	   Lawmaker Jacques-Simon Eggly said he found D'Amato's defeat
``reassuring.'' Eggly, leader of the small centrist Liberal Party,
criticized him for exploiting the Holocaust.

	   TRUJILLO, Honduras (AP) _ With 7,000 people feared dead in
Honduras alone, the government appealed Wednesday for international
aid and rescue workers warned of rampant starvation and illness if
the country's shattered bridges and washed-out roads are not
quickly rebuilt.
	   Hurricane Mitch, which killed an estimated 9,000 people
throughout Central America, has turned Honduras' largest cities
into virtual islands accessible only by air.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Martinez led foreign diplomats on a
tour of devastated areas of the capital, Tegucigalpa. President
Carlos Roberto Flores personally appealed for temporary bridges,
supplies and other help in a broadcast message.
	   ``We have food,'' Lt. Col. Jose J. Barahona said as 8,800 pounds
(4,000 kilos) of supplies were being unloaded from a U.S. Air Force
cargo plane Tuesday in the northern city of Trujillo. ``The problem
is the areas that are only reachable by helicopter _ and we don't
have enough.''
	   Nicaragua's rural communities are also isolated; many have had
no outside communication since the storm began nearly a week ago.
With fuel in short supply, few areas can keep power plants running
_ and that means no electricity for water pumps.
	   Floods and mudslides caused by Mitch were blamed for deaths
across a broad, 500-mile (800-kilometer) corridor from Nicaragua
into southern Mexico, from Honduras' Atlantic Coast to the Pacific.
	   Guatemala had 157 dead, 100,000 homes damaged and at least 30
highways blocked after Hurricane Mitch swept through. Six people
died in Mexico and 31 were missing from a schooner in the
Caribbean.
	   El Salvador reported 225 dead, 135 missing and 50,000 homeless.
Late Tuesday, the El Salvadoran Congress declared a three-day
national mourning period for the victims.
	   The scope of the disaster overwhelmed relief efforts. Flood
victims jeered Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman during a Tuesday
visit to Leon, 55 miles (90 kms) north of Managua. Up to 1,950
people were believed to have been killed nearby when a mudslide
crashed down the flanks of a volcano after days of torrential
rains.
	   ``Murderer! We're dying of hunger!'' the refugees shouted.
Administration officials claimed political opponents orchestrated
the incident to embarrass the president.
	   Preliminary estimates indicate that 7,000 people died in
Honduras _ a number that could rise, Col. Rene Osorio of the
national emergency commission said. In addition, 11,100 people were
missing and 1 million were homeless, he said.
	   At least 300 people have been arrested in Tegucigalpa for
violating a dusk to dawn curfew to prevent looting and robberies.
	   The Honduran and Nicaraguan ambassadors to the United States
said Tuesday that at least 70 percent of the infrastructure in
their countries was destroyed. Roads, bridges, telephone lines and
almost every other means of communication have been wiped out by
flooding and mudslides.
	   Barahona, an emergency official in the Honduran province of
Colon, said workers so far have been unable to reach up to 12,000
of the area's 100,000 residents because of damaged roads.
	   Some Trujillo residents said the food isn't getting to those who
need it most.
	   ``There's nothing here,'' said Luisa Argentina Aguilar, who was
left homeless with her two children, mother and sister when the
storm blew the roof off her house.
	   She suspected that food packages were going first to influential
families. ``They're not giving them to the poor people,'' she said.
	   The devastated infrastructure also is impeding distribution of
fuel _ important for aid trucks, planes and helicopters.
	   ``We have enough fuel to last about five or six days,'' Col.
Alfredo San Martin, the Honduran Air Force chief of staff, said in
Tegucigalpa.
	   Along with emergency supplies, the United States sent more than
two dozen military aircraft and 500 military personnel to assist
with air surveillance and rescue missions.
	   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, whose country was sending a
dozen military planes and 28 helicopters, called President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday to urge a large-scale international aid effort.
Zedillo's office said Clinton was ``highly sympathetic'' to the
Mexican leader's concerns and pledged to review aid efforts.
	   Chaos reigned in northern Nicaragua, where a mudslide Friday
from the 4,610-foot (1,405-meter) Casitas volcano buried hundreds
of people under tons of mud and rocks.
	   Rescuers saw four men buried up to their chests screaming for
help late Monday on the slopes of Casitas, where bodies littered
wide fields of mud. The rescuers could not reach the men _ blocked
by 200 yards (200 meters) of quaking, unstable mud.
	   As if this weren't enough, new natural disasters struck Tuesday.
Just 22 miles (35 kilometers) from Casitas, the Cerro Negro volcano
began erupting, and Mitch re-formed as a weak tropical storm in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   Mitch moved over the Yucatan peninsula late Tuesday, although
its 45 mph (75 kph) winds were but a shadow of last week's 180 mph
(290 kph) gusts. On Wednesday, the storm was about 520 miles (840
kilometers) southwest of the Florida coast.
	   In the volcanic eruption, lava flowed down Cerro Negro's
3,300-foot (1,000-meter) northern face into an apparently
unpopulated area, but the poses no immediate danger.

UEFA decision on Fiorentina incident expected by Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background, reaction from Fiorentina, Salerno. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA expects to decide by Monday how to
deal with an incident which caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup
match between Fiorentina and Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the
European governing body said Wednesday.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg match after a Belgian
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device hurled
from the stands.
	   There will be no replay of Wednesday's match, UEFA said in a
statement. A decision will be taken by UEFA's control and
disciplinary body.
	   ``We need to know the details'' before deciding what action to
take, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonella said.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   The away home match was the second of a two-game suspension
imposed on Fiortina's Franchi stadium, the result of fan behavior
during a European Cup Winners Cup match against Barcelona in 1997.
	   Although playing away from home, Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno.
	   ``We behaved in accordance with the rules,'' the Swiss sports
agency SI quoted Grasshoppers sport director Erich Vogel as saying.
``Now we're waiting for the UEFA decision.''
	   ``We just have to wait and see what UEFA decides,'' Fiorentina
coach Giovanni Trappatoni told Italy's Canale 5 television.
	   The mayor of Salerno and the head of the Salerno fan club both
apologized for the incident.
	   In 1989, Dutch club Ajax was suspended from European competition
for one year after a fan threw a piece of steel fence at a visiting
team's goalkeeper.
	   UEFA also punished Ajax with a 3-0 forfeit and ruled the club
must play three European games after the ban in a stadium at least
100 kilometers (62 miles) from Amsterdam.
	   The injured official, Philippe Flament, was taken to hospital
with a right knee injury. The incident occurred as players and
officials were walking to the dressing rooms at the end of the
first half.
	   Draws for third-round games of the European competition are
scheduled on Friday.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify. The Italian club was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes of the
second leg.

Germany reports terrorist threat against U.S. embassy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes, more sites raided, special police
involved. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German police raided several locations near
Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S.
Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Police, including agents of an elite anti-terrorist unit,
checked several suspects during raids in an industrial zone and
other sites Tuesday, but no arrests were made, said Eva Schuebel,
spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe.
	   The agency said it had received ``credible information'' that
Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at the
sites, but none were found.
	   The agency's investigation is continuing, Schuebel said.
	   ``For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat to the
U.S. Embassy,'' she said.
	   The embassy had no comment.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi
dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those
attacks.
	   A suspected top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is
jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request, raising
concern about reprisals on German soil.
	   U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm
members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   In September, German police stepped up security at the U.S.
consulate in Hamburg after receiving a tip about a possible threat.

Poles buying up telecom shares despite turbulent times
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Despite market turbulence that hurt many
small investors, Poles are diving back into the stock market,
opening thousands of new accounts to take advantage of Central
Europe's largest-ever initial public offering: the Polish telephone
company.
	   ``Investing in the stock market is still a good way to make
money,'' insists Rafal Parczewski, a 21-year-old law student who
plans to borrow 10,000 zloty (dlrs 2,900) to buy shares in
Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPSA).
	   When the three-week subscription period for domestic investors
ends Friday, Poles will have signed up for about 100 million
shares, twice as much as the allocated amount, according to an
estimate by the Polish daily Law and Economy newspaper.
	   The successful offering indicates Poles are becoming used to
market bears and bulls only seven years after the Warsaw Stock
Exchange was founded.
	   Poles initially were enthusiastic about investing, but many left
once they realized that they could lose money as well as make it.
	   Still, enough returned to make large sales this year, like that
of copper giant KGHM and Grupa Pekao SA, the largest commercial
bank, successful. Then in August, Russia's financial crisis
erupted.
	   The average turnover on the Warsaw's stock exchange fell by more
than half, to 100 million zloty (dlrs 29 million) a day from 250
million zloty (dlrs 72 million), said Piotr Kazimierski, an analyst
with CAIB Securities.
	   The story was the same across eastern Europe. Citing weak
markets, Russia and Bulgaria withdrew plans to sell shares in their
telecommunications companies. In the Balkans, Greece scaled down
its offering.
	   Poland, though, decided to go ahead with its sale, although at a
price _ 14.5-18 zloty (dlrs 4.20 to 5.20) a share _ that was only
about half what analysts had anticipated in early 1997. Officials
said they were afraid delay would cause price to drop further.
	   And backed by heavy advertising, the TPSA offering is bringing
Poles back to the stock market.
	   In the past two months, brokers at PBK SA, which is overseeing
the telecom sale, opened 6,000 new accounts _ as many as it did
over the past nine months, said PBK director Adam Parfiniewicz.
	   ``It should be a good investment because TPSA will not certainly
go bankrupt,'' said Grzegorz Adamczyk, 44, a construction engineer
planning to buy at least 1,000 shares. ``It makes money on our
phone calls and we surely won't be calling less.''
	   Poles have a chance to buy 49 million shares, or 3.5 percent of
the company's entire stock, estimated at more than dlrs 8 billion.
Ten percent is being offered to foreign institutional investors,
and 1.5 percent to domestic institutions.
	   With 8 million subscribers in Poland, TPSA controls 97 percent
of the market in a country of 39 million people. Although Poland
has started opening its telecommunication market, competition for
TPSA will be restricted for many years.
	   And pent-up demand in this booming economy is huge: 2.5 million
Poles are waiting for a telephone.
	   Yet, the former communist-style monopoly is notorious for poor
service and lack of efficiency compared with its Central European
peers. For example, TPSA has just 107 lines per employee, compared
167 for Hungary's Matav.
	   Large investments the company requires before restructuring is
completed means it will not bring high short-term profit, according
to Artur Jasinski, BGZ stockbroker.
	   But Poles seem hopeful as they buy their shares.
	   ``I did it out of curiosity because the sale was so
advertised,'' said Teresa Wawrzyniec, a shop clerk who is investing
in the stock market for the first time. ``I want to see what will
happen.''

Russian parliament votes down resolution on anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and their hardline allies in the
Russian parliament's lower house joined ranks Wednesday to defend a
Communist lawmaker who made anti-Semitic comments during public
rallies last month.
	   Several liberal lawmakers proposed a resolution condemning the
remarks by retired Gen. Albert Makashov as provoking an ``increased
tension in relations between ethnic different groups.''
	   Communists and ultranationalists spoke out against the
resolution and expressed support for Makashov.
	   ``The Russian people have suffered most, and such remarks are a
reaction to that fact,'' ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said
during the debates. ``If the Russian people are satisfied, all
others will lead a happy life.''
	   Makashov refused to apologize.
	   Only 107 lawmakers in the 450-seat house supported the
resolution.
	   Last month, Russian prosecutors opened an inquiry into
statements made by Makashov and other hardliners and warned they
might face criminal charges.
	   Such a move is bound to fail since Makashov has immunity from
prosecution as a lawmaker, and Communists and their allies are
certain to block any attempt to lift his immunity.

Mubarak sends message to Saddam on Iraq's crisis with the U.N.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak has written
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Iraq's latest dispute with the
United Nations, Egypt's foreign minister said Wednesday.
	   He did not reveal the contents of the letter but said any
solution should take into consideration ``the interests of the
Iraqi people and Iraq's respect of the (U.N.) Security Council's
resolutions.''
	   Minister Amr Moussa said he met with Iraq's envoy to the Arab
League, Nabil Najim, on Monday and also spoke on telephone with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Najim left Cairo Tuesday
for Iraq after completing his tenure in office. Najim is believed
to have carried Mubarak's letter.
	   Moussa said he expected Mubarak to hold ``an important
discussions'' with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen who arrives
here Thursday.
	   Cohen is touring the Gulf and some Middle East countries to win
support for possible military action against Iraq.
	   The U.N.-Iraq crisis is over Iraq's decision Saturday to end all
cooperation with U.N. disarmament experts. Iraq has demanded a firm
timetable for lifting of U.N. sanctions as a precondition for
resuming cooperation.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
will not be lifted until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of mass destruction weapons.

Ugandan confesses to killing American woman, seven others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Ugandan confessed Wednesday to killing
an American woman and seven others, then tried to strangle the
magistrate who took his statement, police said.
	   Richard Arinaitwe admitting killing Maria Cecilia Goetz, a
35-year-old Minneapolis woman, at a downtown Kampala hotel on July
28, said Chris Bakiza, director of criminal investigations.
	   The 21-year-old also said he killed seven other people, Bakiza
told a news conference, refusing to release additional details.
	   Arinaitwe will be charged later this week, Bakiza said.
	   After giving his confession to Kampala Magistrate Elizabeth Jane
Alividza, Arinaitwe asked her for a glass of water. While her back
was turned, Arinaitwe grabbed her by the neck, and tried to
strangle her, Bakiza said.
	   A courtroom police officer who heard their scuffle quickly
subdued Arinaitwe, and the magistrate was unharmed, he said.
	   Arinaitwe was arrested earlier this week after he robbed a
Kenyan of dlrs 3,600 at a hotel, Bakiza said. The researcher
remembered the license plate number of the getaway car, which
police used to track down Arinaitwe.
	   At his house, police found three pistols and three knives. One
knife matched a leather sheath found in the hotel room of the slain
American, Bakiza said.
	   Goetz's body bore deep knife wounds on the lower left abdomen
and on the left side of the mouth. She was a programmer for East
Africa Minnesota Information Health Volunteers.

	   PUSHKAR, India (AP) _ Plagued by years of drought and a sour
economy, the world's largest camel bazaar is suffering from slow
trading.
	   The Pushkar Camel Fair, which began Oct. 23 and ends Wednesday
night, still drew more than 30,000 camels to this Hindu holy town
at the edge of the Thar Desert in the western Indian state of
Rajasthan.
	   The camels, which sell for anywhere between 5,000 rupees (about
dlrs 125) to 42,000 rupees (dlrs 1,000), are checked by traders for
stance, stride, condition of teeth and most important, head
position. A camel that holds its head high is good for riding. One
which bows its head is used for pulling.
	   The camel is still the work horse of the Indian desert, where
they lumber through fields and along any highway, pulling loads of
sugar cane, hay or firewood stripped from the precious few trees.
	   But many traders said they feared a centuries-old way of life
might be fading away.
	   ``Why use camels when a tractor can do the work of seven?'' said
Preladh Singh, 68, who shepherded eight camels on a seven-day walk
from Chitughar in the nearby state of Madhya Pradesh.
	   After a week camping out at the fair, he still hadn't sold a
single camel. He planned to try his luck elsewhere rather than
return home empty-handed.
	   While Singh left his family behind, other traders' wives and
daughters went through Pushkar's sprawling outdoor market, haggling
for the colorful clothing and jewelry. Members of the Rabari tribe,
who often live in remote villages, use the bazaar as an annual
meeting place to find marriage partners for their children.
	   The fair, which coincides with a Hindu festival, also draws
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from throughout India. They come
to bathe in the holy waters of Pushkar Lake, believed to have the
power to cleanse a lifetime of sins.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Each morning this week, a convoy of U.N.
cars _ with the required Iraqi escorts _ has headed into the field
carrying U.N. weapons experts.
	   It suggests a certain normality in the search for Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction as mandated by U.N. Security Council
resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But U.N. officials said Wednesday that this is mere trickery _
that things have changed markedly since Iraq on Saturday officially
cut links to the U.N. Special Commission charged with ferreting out
Iraq's long-range missiles and chemical and biological weapons.
	   The U.N. convoys these days are carrying mainly monitors from
the separate U.N. body overseeing the elimination of nuclear
weapons, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It's sort of a pat on the back to the Vienna-headquartered IAEA,
which is close to declaring Iraq free of nuclear weapons. That's in
marked contrast to insistence by the Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, that Iraq is hiding other dangerous arms.
	   However, Iraq also has given what might seem a reward to UNSCOM.
	   In a formally announced ``exception'' to its ban on dealing with
the commission, it is allowing UNSCOM technicians to ride along to
repair monitoring cameras and collect samples from sensors.
	   Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for UNSCOM in New York, sees this as
yet another attempt by the Baghdad regime to deceive.
	   ``By letting our technicians go out, they (the Iraqis) give the
appearance that some sort of monitoring is still going on,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   In fact, the monitors are supposed to do what UNSCOM chairman
Richard Butler has said is among the commission's most important
work _ the long-term monitoring designed to keep Iraq from building
more weapons in the future.
	   Buchanan says what's going on now is nothing like real
monitoring.
	   ``It's maintenance work,'' he added, explaining UNSCOM has just
a handful of air-sampling sensors to check for chemicals and
cameras at no more than 20 to 30 sites, ``a small fraction'' of
several hundred suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   ``These things are a very minor part of monitoring and not a
substitute for physical inspection,'' Buchanan said, contacted by
telephone from Baghdad.
	   He and U.N. officials in Iraq said the Baghdad regime has not
told them formally why the nuclear monitors were allowed to
continue their work while UNSCOM was stopped.
	   ``They've tried in the past to divide us up in an attempt to
show that UNSCOM is horrible and the IAEA nice,'' Buchanan noted.
	   In fact, the almost-daily barbs from government officials and
the state-run media target UNSCOM and Butler, its Australian chief.
	   On Wednesday, the newspaper Babel _ published by Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's son Odei _ called UNSCOM inspectors ``a group of
bandits, thieves and mercenaries whose only aim is to aggravate our
hardships.''
	   It's not surprising Iraq gives different treatment to the two
U.N. agencies _ which both must declare Iraq free of weapons before
the Security Council can lift trade sanctions imposed after the
1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
	   The IAEA report that it found no evidence of Iraq trying to
develop nuclear weapons has been used by Iran's supporters on the
council to suggest easing the sanctions, which have devastated the
country's economy.
	   Butler, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that Iraq has not fully
disclosed the extent of its biological and chemical programs _
ammunition for the United States and Britain to argue sanctions
should be maintained.
	   To try to force the council's hand, Iraq on Aug. 5 announced
that both the IAEA and UNSCOM must cease inspection activities _
unannounced, intrusive, spot-check visits to suspected weapons
sites.
	   The decision Saturday went further, barring UNSCOM from going to
previously identified weapons sites.
	   A day later, Butler said in a TV interview that the long-term
monitoring is all that ensures Iraq will not be building a new
arsenal in the future.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council,'' he said.

Only one minister shows up; others send attorneys

<TEXT>
	   NAKURU, Kenya (AP) _ Only one government minister of 10 current
and former officials summoned to appear Wednesday before a
presidential commission investigating ethnic violence showed up.
	   The nine others, several of whom have been implicated in
stirring up the clashes in Rift Valley province in 1991-92 that
preceded Kenya's return to multiparty politics, were represented by
attorneys.
	   It was the first time high-ranking government officials had been
summoned to appear before such a commission, which has powers of
subpeona.
	   Last week, reporters for the Daily Nation and the East African
Standard told the Akiwumi Commission they had seen then Energy
Minister Nicholas Biwott and Local Government Minister William ole
Ntimama incite members of their respective Kalenjin and Maasai
ethnic group to carry arms and drive those who favored multiparty
democracy from the region.
	   Attorneys representing Ntimama, now Minister of Transport and
Communications, claim the reporters ``concocted'' the reports.
	   Minister of Public Works Kipkalya Kones was to appear before the
commission Thursday.
	   Members of the commission were to rule on whether they would
accept the reporters' version of events.
	   Under the rules of the commission, if members are not satisfied
with the attorneys' testimony, they can oblige the ministers
themselves to appear.
	   The commission was set up earlier this year to look into the
origin of the clashes in which at least 1,000 people died and
thousands more were forced out of their homes and still have not
returned.
	   Kenya became a single-party state in 1966 under former President
Jomo Kenyatta and his Kenya African National Union party.
	   President Daniel arap Moi, who assumed office on Kenyatta's
death in 1978, and KANU reluctantly agreed to multiparty elections
in 1992.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said Wednesday he could do nothing for a Dutch cyclist
detained since his arrest on suspicion of doping during the Tour de
France.
	   Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok pressed the plight of TVM team
leader Cees Priem during a working lunch with Jospin at Kok's
official residence in The Hague.
	   But Jospin told reporters his hands were tied.
	   ``The French judicial system is totally independent. We can't
tell them what to do,'' he said.
	   Priem was arrested July 23 with TVM physician Dr. Andrei
Mikhailov after performance-enhancing drugs were discovered in the
team's hotel.
	   Although he has not yet been charged and is not in custody,
Priem has not been allowed to leave France and must check in daily
with authorities. He has been placed under formal investigation, a
step short of being formally charged.
	   The president of the Royal Dutch Cycling Union recently
suggested that French authorities might be holding Priem to protest
the liberal Dutch drug policy which has often led to tension
between the two nations.
	   Jospin dismissed that claim Wednesday.
	   ``I can tell you one thing,'' he said. ``We are involved in a
struggle against doping in sport ... I am sure everyone agrees with
the necessity of eradicating doping from sport.''
	   The investigation of the TVM team began in March, when French
customs agents found about 100 doses of EPO, a synthetic hormone
which increases oxygen to the red blood cells, in a team vehicle.
	   That discovery was publicized following the outbreak of the
scandal involving the Spanish team Festina, which was kicked out of
the Tour after some of its riders admitted taking
performance-enhancing drugs.

	   It said three _ Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia _ were doing well
enough they may advance to fast-track negotiations as of 1999. The
commission warned Hungary and Slovenia to keep up the pace of
writing EU rules and regulations into their laws.
	   And it reiterated once again Turkey remained unready for
membership, primarily because of its shaky human rights record.
	   Appearing before the European Parliament, EU Foreign Affairs
Commissioner Hans van den Broek gave a generally positive
assessment of efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 East European nations
into the EU in the next decade.
	   This year, the EU began preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus and opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The second group are nations facing a tougher job in improving
their economies before serious membership talks can begin.
	   Yet Van den Broek said Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia were
performing better than expected.
	   ``The rate of progress has been sufficient,'' he said for the
European Commission to consider recommending ``the opening of
(membership) negotiations at the end of 1999 for Latvia.''
	   ``For Lithuania and Slovakia, we also hope to be able to
recommend the opening of negotiations within a reasonable period,''
he added.
	   Countries wanting to join the EU must be democracies, market
economies, at peace with their neighbors and able to absorb all EU
laws, rules and regulations.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward enlargement. But the
most successful candidates _ Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic
_ may well join as early as 2003 or 2004.
	   Preliminary talks opened in March. In its first report card, the
Commission cited Hungary and Slovenia for ``a worrying slowdown''
in writing EU legislation into national laws.
	   ``If the stagnation ... continues, they could have a problem in
the medium term in meeting their obligations as future member
states,'' Van den Broek said.
	   Across Eastern Europe, he added, countries must do more ``to
protect human rights, improve the judicial system and the fight
against corruption.'' He said Latvia was an exception.
	   Speaking of the economic situation, the commission reported
that:
	   _ the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia
``are functioning market economies that should be able to cope with
competitive pressures and market forces within the union in the
medium term.''
	   _ Latvia and Lithuania ``have made substantial progress'' on
that score
	   _ Slovakia suffers from ``excessive'' government intervention in
the economy.
	   _ Bulgaria and Romania ``cannot yet be regarded as market
economies.''
	   As a group, the candidate countries enjoy an economic growth
rate this year of 4.7 percent and they continue to attract foreign
investments, the commission said. It added: ``Inflation is well
below two digits in five of the countries and budget deficits are
small.''
	   A weak point, said the commission, was the low priority given to
environmental protection in Eastern Europe.
	   The Commission was uncompromising for Turkey, citing
shortcomings in human rights, in civilian control over the military
as well as the military crackdown against Kurds in southeastern
Turkey.
	   ``Turkey has most of the hallmarks of a market economy including
a dynamic private sector and liberal trade rules. Provided that
macro-economic stability is restored,'' the commission said, Turkey
should have no problem in dealing with EU competitors.
	   The commission said Cyprus was performing ``relatively well'' in
economic terms, adding, ``The integration of Cyprus, including its
northern part into the EU should not raise major economic
difficulties.''
	   However, it added, the island's division and the inability to
compose a Cyprus negotiating team that includes Turkish Cypriots
posed an obstacle to a smooth entry into the EU of the entire
island.

Former Shin Bet informer to be indicted in Rabin assassination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A former Shin Bet informer and right-wing
agitator who befriended Yitzhak Rabin's assassin will be indicted
on charges he failed to prevent the killing, Israel's attorney
general said Wednesday.
	   Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein announced the indictment
exactly three years after Yigal Amir, a Jewish extremist opposed to
Rabin's land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians, shot and killed
the prime minister.
	   Rubinstein identified the suspect as Avishai Raviv, an informer
for the Shin Bet security services who used the code name
``champagne.'' He faces a maximum two-year sentence if convicted.
	   Raviv founded the radical group Eyal and was known for leading
some of the most virulent protests against Rabin.
	   At a news conference, Rubinstein said Raviv was aware of Amir's
intentions to kill Rabin and did not tell his Shin Bet handlers
about it. However, Raviv will not be charged as an accomplice
because he did not know Amir's specific plans to shoot Rabin on the
night of Nov. 4, 1995, Rubinstein said.
	   The decision to indict Raviv is likely to fuel theories spread
by the right-wing fringe that Shin Bet knew of Amir's assassination
plan and intended _ with Rabin's knowledge _ to replace his bullets
with blanks and let him fire them to discredit the right wing.
	   Questions have also been raised about Raviv's relationship with
Amir, and to what extent the Shin Bet informer may have encouraged
Amir to carry out the killing.
	   A government-appointed commission of inquiry into the
assassination has ruled out any conspiracy.
	   Israel's dovish opposition dismisses the conspiracy theories as
attempts to deflect the blame for incitement against Rabin away
from ultranationalist groups. Rabin supporters have accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then the opposition leader, of
creating the divisive political climate that led to the killing.
	   Rubinstein said the Shin Bet was opposed to putting Raviv on
trial _ apparently in part because it would hurt future recruitment
efforts.
	   However, ``the bottom line is that this is not a case against
the (Shin Bet),'' Rubinstein said. ``It's a case against Avishai
Raviv.''
	   Raviv will also be charged with encouraging violent acts and
inciting to racism, a result of his activities in Eyal.
	   Another Amir friend, Margalit Har-Shefi, was sentenced in
September to nine months in jail for failing to prevent the
assassination.

Opposition students protest campus election process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Hundreds of opposition party students
demonstrated Wednesday against a decision by the Cairo University
to exclude them from students union elections, police said.
	   University officials who vet candidates have disqualified many
students of opposition parties for political reasons.
	   Police officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said the students shouting anti-government slogans demanded their
representatives be allowed to run for the elections.
	   The protesters were supporters of the banned fundamentalist
Muslim Brotherhood and several legal opposition parties, they said.
	   They said anti-riot police surrounded the university and
prevented the students from spreading out to nearby neighborhoods
to stage protests.
	   Union elections are supposed to be open to students of all
political affiliation but officials usually support members of the
governing National Democratic Party.

Gunmen kill two Islamic activists in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ A group of masked gunmen stormed a
restaurant Wednesday in southeastern Bangladesh and killed two
activists of an Islamic party.
	   The attackers sprayed the two men with bullets as they were
having tea at a restaurant at Fatkchari in the Chittagong district,
216 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi
capital, a police official said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Three other diners were injured, he said.
	   No one claimed responsibility for killing the activists, who
belonged to the Islamic Chhatra Shibir, the student front of the
country's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami. Police blamed the
attack on party dissidents.

Fifteen more civilians convicted in Sierra Leone treason trials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A Sierra Leone high court on
Wednesday convicted 15 civilians of treason for working with the
West African nation's ousted military junta.
	   In addition, former President Joseph Saidu Momoh, who headed a
one-party state from 1985 until his ouster in 1992 and who had
close ties to the junta, was convicted of conspiracy to commit
treason.
	   Five more people were found not guilty of treason and other
offenses and were released following the mass trial.
	   The convictions were the latest in a string of treason trials in
this poverty-stricken country, where a Nigerian-led intervention
force ousted the junta earlier this year and returned President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to power.
	   With the Wednesday rulings, 43 civilians have been convicted of
treason. Most face death by hanging. Last month, hundreds of people
cheered as 24 army officers convicted of participating in the
bloody coup that brought the junta to power were publicly executed.
	   Many more suspects remain on trial and hundreds are languishing
in prison without being charged.
	   While Kabbah has been returned to power, fighting continues
between Sierra Leonean forces and ousted junta fighters and their
rebel allies.
	   The rebels have killed, raped and maimed villagers as part of a
brutal campaign against the government. They have also threatened
mass killings in retaliation for the arrest of their leader, Foday
Sankoh, and other rebels. Sankoh was recently sentenced to death
but has appealed his conviction.
	   The fifteen people convicted Wednesday face the death penalty
while Momoh, who was found innocent of treason, faces a prison
term.
	   Sentences will be handed down later this week after the court
hears pleas of mitigating circumstances.

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu reaction to Arafat comments graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that
was to ratify the land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu aides said the ministers would not be convened until
Israel receives written guarantees from the United States that 30
Palestinians wanted by Israel will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the 12-week time table that was to go
begin Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due
Nov. 16 _ in exchange for Palestinian security steps.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily, saying Netanyahu was seizing a
pretext to try and dismantle the peace agreement. ``He (Netanyahu)
is inventing new agreements. He does not want to honor anything,''
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat sad.
	   However, despite the recriminations, there were first signs that
the dispute could be resolved. U.S. officials said they were
mediating and that they expected results ``shortly.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is visiting Spain, said
that 12 of the wanted Palestinians are in detention and that he
would do his best to apprehend the others.
	   ``We will continue working on this 100 percent ... but nobody
can ask us to achieve 100 percent results,'' Arafat told a news
conference in Madrid.
	   Palestinian security officials have said that several of the men
on Israel's wanted list were arrested and tried in recent years and
months, but never gave a specific number.
	   In a press statement released by his office, Netanyahu
cautiously welcomed Arafat's comments. ``This is exactly what we
demand: strict fulfillment of each and very letter of the agreement
by both sides, Palestinian and Israeli alike,'' the statement said.

Arafat says total fulfillment of Israel's security demands
</HEADLINE>
impossible &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
Wednesday the latest Israeli condition for ratifying the new
land-for-security deal had been partially met but suggested that
total fulfillment was impossible.
	   Arafat was responding to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
demand for written guarantees that all 30 men on a list of suspects
wanted by Israel for killing Israelis would be detained by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   ``We have detained 12 of them and we will continue working on
this 100 percent but...nobody can ask us to achieve 100 percent
results,'' Arafat told a press conference in Madrid after talks
with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   The peace accord negotiated at Wye Plantation and signed in
Washington on Oct. 23 commits Israel to withdraw from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown
on Moslem extremists who oppose peace with Israel.
	   But Israel reiterated Wednesday that it would not carry out the
agreement until it received assurances from the Palestinian
Authority headed by Arafat that it would arrest all 30 on the
wanted list.
	   Aides to Netanyahu said in Jerusalem that the Israeli cabinet
would not be convened to ratify the accord until Israel got such a
written guarantee from the United States.
	   Arafat, who arrived in Madrid late Tuesday, said the 12 detained
were arrested prior to Netanyahu's latest insistence on the issue.
	   Palestinian security officials have previously said that several
of the men on the list had been arrested and tried, but never
before given a specific number.
	   Arafat also suggested that Israel had a responsibility to deal
with extremist groups of its own.
	   ``The extremists that exist on both sides are cooperating in
order to wreck the peace process, '' he said. ``We should not
forget that Rabin was assassinated by Israeli extremists.''
	   The head of the Palestinian Authority said that the Mideast
peace process had inevitably slowed following the assassination of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three years ago, and Netanyahu's
coming to power in 1996.
	   But Arafat claimed that 74 percent of the Israeli population
favored the latest U.S.-backed peace initiative, and said he had
conceded Netanyahu's earlier request for a 10-day postponement of
its implementation after a call from U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   With the latest conditions from Israel threatening to undermine
the Wye Plantation accord, negotiated with the direct participation
of President Bill Clinton, Arafat said he expected U.S. special
envoy to the U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross to arrive in the region
within the next few days.
	   Earlier Wednesday Arafat met with King Juan Carlos and was due
to hold talks with Foreign Minister Abel Matutes later in the day.
	   The Palestinian leader was invited to Spain by Matutes, who was
present when Arafat and Netanyahu signed the peace agreement Oct.
23.
	   At their joint press conference Aznar said that the Spanish
government considered that the Palestinians were fulfilling all
their obligations in the Wye Plantation accord and that he ``hoped
to soon be able to say the same about Israel.''

German cabinet meets on Kosovo air surveillance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Germany to take part in protection force,
comments from ministers, background. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet on
Wednesday approved German participation in NATO air surveillance
over Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
	   Germany has committed some 350 soldiers to the operation,
designed to monitor an Oct. 12 peace agreement between Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Germany will contribute 16 unmanned spy aircraft known as drones
to the operation, which is being based is Skopje, Macedonia.
	   The aim is to monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo
and the safety of some 2,000 unarmed international observers
monitoring the pullout.
	   The government's decision requires the approval of parliament,
which will vote on the matter next week. Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said he expects easy passage in the legislature.
	   Germany also expects to contribute about 100 soldiers to a
special NATO force being set up to free observers if they are
hindered or taken hostage by Serbs, Scharping said.
	   Germany, France and Britain will take the lead role in the
force, he said.
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a Greens party leader who once
was a pacifist, said that experiences with U.N. peacekeepers being
taken hostage in Bosnia made such a force necessary.

United Nations envoy sees progress on East Timor dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Wednesday he was
making progress in his efforts to mediate a settlement between
Portugal and Indonesia on the disputed territory of East Timor,
news reports said.
	   ``Progress has been made and we'll pursue the (East) Timor issue
with great commitment,'' United Nations mediator Jamsheed Marker
was quoted as saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to break the
long-standing deadlock over East Timor, was in Lisbon for three
days of talks with government officials, lawmakers and exiled East
Timorese independence activists.
	   He said he was skeptical about recent reports of an Indonesian
army offensive against a small band of pro-independence guerillas
operating out of the jungle in East Timor's interior.
	   ``From what I know from the talks I've had with the Indonesian
authorities, I think it's quite unlikely they carried out such an
action,'' Marker was quoted as saying by Lusa.
	   East Timorese opponents of Indonesia's rule claimed Sunday that
some 2,000 Indonesian troops supported by helicopters launched an
attack on the rebels. Jakarta denied the claim.
	   Portuguese officials expressed concern about the reports, saying
they could undermine confidence-building measures.
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in December
1975, a few months after the departure of Portugal's colonial
administration. It annexed the territory, 1,200 miles (1,900
kilometers) east of Jakarta, a month later.
	   The resignation of authoritarian Indonesian President Suharto in
May and the democratic changes introduced under his successor, B.J.
Habibie, have brought fresh impetus to negotiations for a solution.

Jordan shuts down popular Arab satellite TV station

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Wednesday revoked the press
credentials of a popular Arab satellite television station and its
employees, effectively closing the network's Amman bureau.
	   The move against al-Jazeera Satellite Corp. came hours after it
broadcast a scathing attack on Jordan in its widely watched
program, al-itijah al-Muaakes, or The Opposite Direction.
	   In the late Tuesday night show, the Qatar-based station hosted
Syrian researcher, Mohammed Khalifeh, who accused King Hussein of
conspiring with Israel since its foundation in 1948.
	   Revoking al-Jazeera's credentials was in response to
al-Jazeera's ``repeated and intentional insult against the
Jordanian people and the political regime,'' Eyad Qattan,
director-general of the Press and Publications Department at the
Information Ministry, said.
	   Mohammed Ajlouni, JSC's Amman representative, confirmed the
suspension. He declined to provide other details.
	   No news organization or journalists can function in the country
without press credentials, which are issued by the Information
Ministry.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh said the attack was
``unjustified.''
	   The state-run Petra news agency quoted him as saying that
al-Jazeera's office will remain closed until its anchorman
``publicly and officially apologizes'' for the attack and ceases
his ``campaign against Jordan.''
	   Five Jordanians work at the Amman office of al-Jazeera, an
all-news channel known as the Arab world's Cable News Network. The
station is financed by the Qatari government.
	   In the program, Khalifeh said the Jordanian army had
``surrendered Palestinian lands to the Israelis without any
resistance'' in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Jordan was created to
reward Hussein's family for siding with the ``Zionists,'' he added.
	   ``Jordan is not a nation, but an artificial entity,'' Khalifeh
said, describing Jordanians as ``a bunch of bedouins who live in an
arid desert.''
	   Former Jordanian Foreign Minister Kamel Abu Jaber also
participated in the program on a satellite link from Amman, but the
Syrian anchorman, Faisal Qassem, was often seen interrupting him
when he tried to respond.
	   Jordanian citizens and officials condemned the program in calls
to a local talk show shortly afterward on the Jordan Satellite
Television Station.
	   Relations with Syria _ already lukewarm since Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel _ strained earlier this year when Arab
media reports suggested that Jordan was joining a military alliance
with Israel and Turkey. Jordan denied the report.
	   Damascus says such an alliance would undermine its security.
	   This is the first time any news organization has been shut down
in Jordan under a press law enacted in August that gives the state
sweeping authority to punish journalists for reports considered
disparaging of King Hussein.

Italy arrests alleged supporter of Algerian militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Anti-terrorist police in Bologna arrested
an Algerian suspected of providing refuge, money and false
documents to his country's deadly Armed Islamic Group, authorities
said Thursday.
	   Fettar Rachid was in some way involved with an Aug. 31 bombing
at a marketplace in Algiers, said Lorenzo Murgolo, chief of the
anti-terrorist police in Bologna. The bombing killed 17.
	   Police detained Rachid late Wednesday on Italian warrants for
alleged subversive association and document forgery.
	   Authorities called him a ``key reference point'' for Islamic
militants worldwide and alleged he knew about plans for the market
bombing in Algeria.
	   Suspicion for such attacks often falls on the Armed Islamic
Group _ the deadliest of the groups waging an Islamic insurgency
against Algeria's government.
	   Italian authorities also allege he organized arms and explosives
training for militants at camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   Rachid had been living in Bologna as a workman. Authorities said
the arrest followed a long investigation.

Talks resume with pre-meeting swipes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. National Basketball Association and the
players union resumed talks Wednesday, with both sides bickering
even before they began negotiations to end the lockout.
	   One day after what was to have been the start of the season,
commissioner David Stern said agents for the highest-paid players
had disrupted and slowed the process.
	   ``There's something going on that doesn't involve us, something
internally in the union,'' Stern said. ``As I stand here today, I
don't know exactly what it was, but it's clear to me what's coming.
Watch the process. You'll see.''
	   Union director Billy Hunter arrived about 10 minutes after Stern
and said: ``He should blame it on Russ,'' a reference to deputy
commissioner Russ Granik.
	   The sour moods on both sides were a new twist on day 127 of the
work stoppage that has forced the league to cancel games for the
first time in its history. At all previous bargaining sessions, the
principals were more amicable during their pre-meeting comments.
	   ``I don't have a prediction,'' Stern said. ``We'd like to
negotiate a deal. There's 1 billion dollars to 1.1 billion dollars
in salaries on the table that we'd like to pay the players, but
it's not happening.
	   ``The agents are saying, `If you're not going to pay the players
the way we want them, then we'd rather not have them paid.'
Ultimately, this is something the union membership is going to have
to decide for themselves.''
	   Wednesday's talks at a Manhattan law office were the first since
Monday. Also scheduled to attend were Granik and union president
Patrick Ewing.
	   There were to have been 10 games Tuesday night and 11 Wednesday
night.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   ``If I had to guess, the first game will be Dec. 25, because
that's when NBC's (television) money and the big chips are on the
table,'' Utah's Karl Malone said. ``Stern wants players to miss two
or three paychecks to start feeling the message.''

Lingering violence keeps up tension in Kosovo

	   SPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Suspected Albanian separatists opened
fire on two vehicles carrying three mine workers Tuesday, providing
a stark reminder that despite a cease-fire violence in strife-torn
Kosovo is far from over.
	   People on both sides of Kosovo's conflict said Wednesday that
tension remains high in this area because of incident like the
roadside ambush that injured three Serbs at the Belacevac coal
mine, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   Heavy fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas has stopped throughout the province and many refugees
are coming back from the woods, but the majority Albanian province
has a long way to go before real peace is established.
	   The three workers, two of them seriously injured, were
transported to a Pristina hospital, and the attack sparked an
hour-long shootout between police and the attackers, Serb police
said.
	   But villagers in nearby Sipitula said they knew nothing about an
ambush and only heard Serb police firing in their direction,
causing them to flee for nearby fields or homes of friends and
relatives.
	   Two bullet-riddled, bloodstained vehicles were still sitting
near the road Wednesday, a pool of blood beside one open door.
	   Dozens of spent shell casings littered the roadside from where
the attack took place.
	   ``The mine is not working today because the people are afraid to
go to work,'' said mine security guard Blagoje Ristic.
	   He said the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas have ambushed
vehicles along the same stretch of road twice previously, and that
KLA snipers hide in abandoned houses in the area.
	   Police gave few details of the ambush on the two vehicles, one
of which bore the logo of the mining company on its door. On
Wednesday, another mining company vehicle with the same logo was
seen being driven by police.
	   In Sipitula village, over a small ridge from the mine, the few
residents who came back Wednesday morning to assess the situation
said Serb police were continuing to harass them.
	   ``They are playing this game and aren't withdrawing their
forces,'' complained Fatme Mjeku, who said he and his neighbors
often hide in surrounding woods at night because of police gunfire.
	   ``This happens frequently,'' stressed 59-year-old Hilmi Mjekiqi,
adding that police burned a school building in the village on
Friday.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes on Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo to pressure
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to agree Oct. 12 to halt a
seven-month crackdown on Albanian separatists.
	   The crackdown killed hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic
Albanians _ and left an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Under the agreement, Serb police and Yugoslav army forces in
Kosovo must cut down to levels before the offensive and refugees
must be allowed to return to their homes.
	   The agreement also calls for international agencies to move
freely in Kosovo.
	   While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they have
grudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise their
goal of independence.
	   In the Netherlands, Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in The
Hague that Yugoslav war crimes tribunal had been given U.N.
authority to investigate war crimes in any part of Yugoslavia. She
was responding to assertions by Yugoslav government officials that
Kosovo is off limits to tribunal investigations.

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Anti-terrorist police in Bologna arrested
an Algerian suspected of providing refuge, money and false
documents to his country's deadly Armed Islamic Group, authorities
said Wednesday.
	   Fettar Rachid was in some way involved with an Aug. 31 bombing
at a marketplace in Algiers, said Lorenzo Murgolo, chief of the
anti-terrorist police in Bologna. The bombing killed 17.
	   Police detained Rachid late Tuesday on Italian warrants for
alleged subversive association and document forgery.
	   Authorities called him a ``key reference point'' for Islamic
militants worldwide and alleged he knew about plans for the market
bombing in Algeria.
	   Suspicion for such attacks often falls on the Armed Islamic
Group _ the deadliest of the groups waging an Islamic insurgency
against Algeria's government.
	   Italian authorities also allege he organized arms and explosives
training for militants at camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   Rachid had been living in Bologna as a workman. Authorities said
the arrest followed a long investigation.

EU: enlargement on target; three nations on fast-track talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
that preliminary talks to bring Cyprus and 10 East European nations
into the EU were ``broadly on track'' since candidates were
committed to economic and political reforms.
	   It said three _ Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia _ were doing well
enough to advance to fast-track negotiations as of 1999. The
commission warned Hungary and Slovenia to keep writing EU rules and
regulations into their laws.
	   But it reiterated that Turkey was not ready for membership,
because of its shaky human rights record.
	   Appearing before the European Parliament, EU Foreign Affairs
Commissioner Hans van den Broek gave a generally positive
assessment of efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 East European nations
into the EU in the next decade.
	   ``The rate of progress has been sufficient,'' he said for the
European Commission to consider opening membership talks at the end
of 1999 for Latvia, and within a ``reasonable period'' for
Lithuania and Slovakia.
	   But all Eastern European nations _ except Latvia _ must do more
``to protect human rights, improve the judicial system and the
fight against corruption,'' Van den Broek said.
	   Countries wanting to join the EU must be democracies, market
economies, at peace with their neighbors and able to absorb all EU
laws, rules and regulations.
	   The EU has set no date for its eastward enlargement. But the
most successful candidates _ Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic
_ may well join as early as 2003 or 2004.
	   This year, the EU began preliminary talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus. It opened
``preparatory'' talks with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria, which must improve their economies before serious
membership talks can begin.
	   The Commission cited Hungary and Slovenia for ``a worrying
slowdown'' in writing EU legislation into national laws, which Van
den Broek said could signal future problems meeting their
obligations as member states.
	   As a group, the candidate countries enjoy an economic growth
rate this year of 4.7 percent and they continue to attract foreign
investments, the commission said. It added: ``Inflation is well
below two digits in five of the countries and budget deficits are
small.''
	   A weak point, said the commission, was the low priority given to
environmental protection in Eastern Europe.
	   The Commission was uncompromising for Turkey, citing
shortcomings in human rights, in civilian control over the military
as well as the military crackdown against Kurds in southeastern
Turkey.
	   The commission said Cyprus was performing ``relatively well'' in
economic terms, but said the island's division and its inability to
include Turkish Cypriots in a negotiating team posed an obstacle to
enter the EU.

Plan for representation of euro-nations at G-7 meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission proposed
Wednesday that Italy, Germany, France and the nation holding the EU
presidency represent the 11 countries that will adopt the euro
currency at Group of Seven meetings.
	   The EU's proposal for euro-zone participation in the G-7, the
International Monetary Fund, and other global bodies where economic
and monetary issues feature has become a controversial issue since
the small euro nations also wanted a bigger say.
	   In the Commission's view, the current euro zone members of the
G-7 are capable of speaking for all the single currency countries,
provided they establish strict consultation and reporting
procedures with non-G-7 counterparts.
	   The proposal, intended as grist for an EU finance ministers
debate on the issue Nov. 23, should spark debate about whether
smaller states will be seated at the G-7 table.
	   Commission officials have said their proposal was conditioned by
the unwillingness of the EU's G-7 contingent, which also includes
non-euro country Britain, to cede any status to a common euro-zone
delegate. Early on in the representation debate, the larger states
made it clear that there would be no dilution of their global
influence.
	   External euro zone relations is one of the last monetary union
details EU countries are addressing ahead of the single currency
launch on Jan. 1, 1999. EU leaders want to take final decisions on
the representation issue at a summit in Vienna Dec. 11-12.
	   Small euro-zone countries will definitely be empowered via an
enhanced role for the finance minister of the EU country that holds
the rotating EU presidency.

Netanyahu postpones Cabinet meeting for second time in two days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu reaction to Arafat comments graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in two days, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday postponed a Cabinet meeting that
was to ratify Israel's land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu aides said the ministers would not be convened until
Israel receives written guarantees from the United States that 30
Palestinians wanted by Israel will be arrested.
	   The new delay makes it increasingly unlikely that Israel and the
Palestinians will stick to the 12-week timetable that was to begin
Monday. As part of the plan, Israel was to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank _ with the first pullback installment due Nov. 16
_ in exchange for Palestinian security steps.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily, saying Netanyahu was seizing a
pretext to dismantle the peace agreement. ``He (Netanyahu) is
inventing new agreements. He does not want to honor anything,''
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat sad.
	   However, there were some signs that the dispute could be
resolved. U.S. officials said they were mediating and that they
expected results ``shortly.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is visiting Spain, said
that 12 of the wanted Palestinians are in detention and that he
would do his best to apprehend the others.
	   ``We will continue working on this 100 percent ... but nobody
can ask us to achieve 100 percent results,'' Arafat told a news
conference in Madrid.
	   Palestinian security officials have said that several of the men
on Israel's wanted list were arrested and tried in recent years,
but gave no specific number.
	   In a statement, Netanyahu cautiously welcomed Arafat's comments.
``This is exactly what we demand: strict fulfillment of each and
every letter of the agreement by both sides, Palestinian and
Israeli alike,'' the statement said.

Government aims to stem corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Corruption in Lebanon is so endemic that
people have long viewed public office as a sure way to make a quick
fortune.
	   That image may be changing. The Cabinet is expected to take the
first step Wednesday night by approving a draft bill targeting
``illicit wealth'' that threatens to expose bribe-taking officials.
	   ``The fat cats stole and continue to steal the resources of the
country and they must be confronted,'' columnist Faisal Salman
wrote in the leftist As-Safir newspaper last week.
	   The fight against corruption will receive another boost when
President-elect Emile Lahoud, a former army commander with a clean
reputation, takes office Nov. 24.
	   He has pledged to clean up the government ``beginning at the
top.'' Since his election last month, he has been holding
unprecedented meetings with senior public service employees to map
out a plan of action.
	   But many Lebanese are skeptical of the campaign. Critics say the
amended version of the bill before the Cabinet would shield
legislators and Cabinet ministers from full scrutiny and dull the
impact of the measure.
	   The proposal still needs to be approved by Parliament and it is
not clear if the legislature will further amend the bill.
	   Even if it is passed, many Lebanese fear it may go the way of
the 1953 anti-corruption law, which was never enforced.
	   Most Lebanese are resigned to paying bribes to cut through red
tape and get things done.
	   Bribes are sometimes paid to settle construction violations, to
get lower assessment of property value or to cut customs duties,
among other things.
	   Prosecuting corrupt government officials was not possible in the
past because many are protected by politicians, some of whom were
themselves involved in shady dealings.
	   Under the proposal, senior public servants must declare their
financial assets and are liable for prosecution for wrongdoing
dating back 15 years from the proposal's adoption.
	   Corrupt employees will be fined and their property confiscated
but they will escape criminal charges.
	   The proposed law hit snags as soon as it was announced.
	   Some politicians said it will have little effect in a society
where cash is mostly used and there are often no records of
transactions.
	   Others warned that it could undermine banking secrecy, the
mainstay of Lebanon's financial system.
	   A Cabinet committee has amended the proposal so that financial
statements of members of Parliament and Cabinet ministers will be
sealed and can only be divulged if a case is leveled against one.
	   That led critics to accuse members of the administration of
trying to get themselves off the hook by covering their tracks.
	   ``The corruption which bankrupts the state is much more
dangerous than the corruption of small favors that do not enrich
the bribed and do not bankrupt the briber,'' Walid Al-Husseini,
publisher of the leftist Al-Kifah Al-Arabi, wrote in an editorial
in the newspaper last week.

Government approves new version of 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ After parliament rejected the 1999
state budget last month saying the proposed deficit of dlrs 930
million is too big, the government on Wednesday agreed on a new
draft with a deficit that is even bigger.
	   Premier Milos Zeman told a news conference Wednesday that his
minority Social Democratic Cabinet voted on Wednesday to approve a
deficit of 31 billion koruna (dlrs 1.07 billion.)
	   He said that unlike the previous draft, the new budget doesn't
count on revenues from higher taxes or social insurance, also
rejected by the parliament last month, but does expect revenue from
the planned sale of the state's stake in the Ceskoslovenska
Obchodni Banka bank.
	   Individual chapters of the budget are still to be discussed by
the Cabinet on Friday.
	   It was not immediately clear what chances for approval the new
budget will have in the 200-seat lower chamber of the parliament.
	   Most center-right opposition deputies have repeatedly said they
would not vote for a deficit budget. But the opposition Christian
Democrats have indicated they may accept a deficit should it be
aimed at stimulating economic growth.
	   Zeman himself seemed pessimistic about the budget's chances for
approval.

Russia will ask for rescheduling foreign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of insistence that Russia would pay
off its staggering foreign debts this year and next, the government
gave up and announced Wednesday it will have to ask for a
rescheduling.
	   In the past, Russia kept borrowing to pay off its old loans. But
after the economic crisis hit in mid-August, the International
Monetary Fund _ Russia's key lender _ refused to provide more aid
before it sees a sound economic plan.
	   The Russian government owes dlrs 3.5 billion this year and dlrs
17.5 billion next year to foreign creditors.
	   ``Both tasks are too much for our weakened economy,'' First
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said Wednesday.
	   ``We will either have to adopt an emergency budget and the most
harsh measures for squeezing this money out of all spheres of the
economy, or we will have to agree with our creditors on
restructuring our debt,'' he said.
	   ``We will work on the second option.''
	   In recent months, Russian leaders insisted they would not
devalue the national currency, ask for humanitarian aid from
abroad, or default on domestic treasury debts, or GKOs. By now, the
country has done all three.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials had also
said Russia would be able to pay off its foreign debts on time,
despite mounting cash problems.
	   Maslyukov insisted Wednesday that Russia will not default on the
foreign debt or ``make any rash movements,'' but will try to reach
a rescheduling agreement.
	   Still, rescheduling would cause ``very unpleasant actions'' for
Russians, Maslyukov said.
	   He did not elaborate, but said the government will introduce a
``very harsh budget'' in 1999. Russia will still have to cover the
deficit by printing money, he said _ a move that could lead to high
inflation.
	   Maslyukov emphasized that the government will try to keep
money-printing to a minimum, putting out no more than 15 billion
rubles (dlrs 963 million) this year and no more than 35 billion
rubles (dlrs 2.2 billion) in 1999.
	   But he also stressed that the government's plans will depend on
whether it gets more of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan that the IMF put
together before the crisis.
	   Maslyukov refused to provide details on the rest of the
government's economic plan, approved last weekend by Primakov's
Cabinet. Officials have said the plan proposes greater government
intervention in the economy, while promising to stick to a path of
market-oriented reform.
	   Earlier Wednesday, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said
the plan is intentionally murky as part of a strategy of
encouraging political stability by taking pains not to offend any
faction.
	   But the vagueness has cost Russia any prospects for
international aid, Kiriyenko said.
	   ``There is no chance of receiving money from the West,'' he told
the Interfax news agency. ``Credits will be provided only for a
clear, concise, consistent plan of action that would show that the
Russian budget can receive more money than it spends.''
	   The IMF has held up approval of the next installment of its
loan, saying it wanted to see a plan that met its criteria, and
signs that it is being implemented.
	   Maslyukov, a Communist, criticized the IMF for failing to take
Russia's specific economic conditions into account.
	   ``The (IMF officials) are wonderful economists, but they see
nothing but monetarism,'' Maslyukov told a news conference. ``They
have a stable economy, which is not in crisis.''
	   ``But our economy is unstable. For an unstable structure you
need different approaches.''

Car blows up outside main Kremlin gate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A car exploded Wednesday just outside the main
gate to the Kremlin, killing one person and critically injuring
another, a Russian news agency said. The cause of the blast was not
immediately known.
	   The car exploded shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), just 3.5
meters (yards) outside the Spassky Gate, the main entrance to the
Kremlin, the walled enclosure that has been Russia's governmental
and spiritual center for centuries.
	   Clouds of smoke could be seen drifting over St. Basil's
Cathedral, a few meters (yards) away.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said two people were inside the car,
and quoted police as saying one died and the other was critically
injured.
	   There was no immediate word on what caused the explosion. A
spokeswoman for the Emergency Ministry, who declined to be
identified, said it was being treated as a criminal matter.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has his office at the Kremlin, but has
been in the southern resort city of Sochi recovering from what has
been described as exhaustion.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Bands of armed militants raided a
city in northern Tajikistan Wednesday, battling government troops
and seizing several buildings in heavy fighting.
	   At least 10 government soldiers were killed, and the attackers
also took about 30 police officers hostage, said Zafar Saidov,
spokesman for President Emomali Rakhmonov.
	   Late in the day, the Interior Ministry reported that a portion
of the elite Presidential Guards had surrendered to the rebels. The
rebels were reported to be meeting with local Tajik leaders to
discuss terms for ending the fighting.
	   The assailants seized all administrative buildings in the city
of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport,
Saidov said.
	   Despite a 1997 peace agreement that formally ended a civil war,
the former Soviet republic continues to be plagued by outbursts of
violence involving groups that do not recognize the deal.
	   The National Reconciliation Commission, which was designed to
end hostilities by bringing together the government and its
opposition, issued a statement calling for an end to the
hostilities.
	   ``Such actions have once led the republic to a civil war,'' the
statement said, imploring the anti-government forces to put down
their arms.
	   The attackers were led by Makhmud Khudoberdyev, a former army
colonel who turned against Rakhmonov last year and then fled to
neighboring Uzbekistan, authorities said.
	   The president chaired an emergency government session to discuss
the crisis and ordered all troops be put on alert. Russia's 201st
motorized infantry division, deployed in Tajikistan to support the
government, has also been put in combat readiness.
	   Representatives of seven nations, along with the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met in
the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, to discuss potential solutions to the
crisis.
	   Jan Kubic, the U.N. envoy, said he was in close consultation
with Rakhmonov and was keeping U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
abreast of developments.
	   The presidents of Kazakstan and Uzbekistan and Russia's minister
of foreign affairs all issued statements condemning the attack,
ITAR-Tass reported. Uzbekistan borders Tajikistan, whose location
on the Afghan border has given it strategic significance to Russia
and the rest of the region.
	   Interfax put the number of attackers at 1,000. The Tajik
government demanded their surrender.
	   ``Otherwise, the republic's government reserves the right to use
against them all available means, including complete
annihilation,'' the statement said, according to Interfax.
	   Khudoberdyev broke away from the government after it signed a
peace deal with the mostly Islamic opposition in the summer of
1997.
	   ``The attack is aimed at thwarting the peace process in the
republic,'' Saidov said.
	   The government also blamed Khudoberdyev supporters for staging a
triple bombing in western Tajikistan on Monday night, killing one
man.
	   ``These anti-government forces in Tajikistan have as their
purpose a change of the country's course toward national
reconciliation,'' a government statement said. ``They will stop
neither at terror nor at effectively declaring war own their own
people.''

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Several thousand people, including
President Jorge Sampaio, government officials and religious leaders
from India, attended the opening Wednesday of the first Hindu
temple in Portugal, a predominantly Roman Catholic country.
	   ``This temple is an example of the integration of the Hindu
community in Portugal,'' local Hindu leader Kantilal Jamnadas said
in a speech.
	   Hindu leaders are encouraging the building of temples in Europe
because of the increasing number of Indians migrating to the
continent.
	   The dlrs 12 million temple, one of the largest Hindu temples in
Europe, is located on Lisbon's Mahatma Gandhi Avenue.
	   It was designed by Portuguese architect Augusto Silva and paid
for by the Portuguese government, Lisbon City Council and local
businessmen.
	   Lisbon Mayor Joao Soares unveiled a statue of Indian
independence leader Mohandas Gandhi and his wife Kasturba.
	   Some 500 people, including Indian theologians and Hindus living
in Britain, traveled from abroad to attend the opening ceremony,
which included Hindu rituals.
	   There are about 9,000 Hindus in Portugal which has a population
of 9.9 million.

Swiss probe own embassy's role in Pinochet-era disappearance

 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Wednesday launched an
inquiry into the role of its embassy in Argentina in the
disappearance of a Swiss-Chilean student which is behind a Swiss
request for the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   The government has mandated a historian and a specialist in
international law to reconstruct the events which led to the
disappearance of Alexis Jaccard, the foreign ministry said in a
statement.
	   Jaccard disappeared in May 1977 in the Argentine capital, Buenos
Aires.
	   He ``was kidnapped by the Argentine security forces in
collaboration with the secret services of Chile,'' the foreign
ministry said.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Following a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by Jaccard's
widow, Switzerland requested Pinochet's arrest with a view to
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   Swiss authorities last month requested Argentina to provide all
the information it has on the case, the foreign ministry said.
	   Switzerland has prepared a formal request for the extradition of
Pinochet, but is awaiting the outcome of Spain's attempt to have
him extradited.
	   Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition
from Britain on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during
his 17-year rule which ended 1990.

Arafat says total fulfillment of Israel's security demands

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
Wednesday the latest Israeli condition for ratifying the new
land-for-security deal had been partially met but suggested that
total fulfillment was impossible.
	   Arafat was responding to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
demand for written guarantees that the Palestinian Authority would
arrest all 30 men on a list of suspects wanted for killing
Israelis.
	   ``We have detained 12 of them and we will continue working on
this 100 percent,'' Arafat said after Wednesday talks with Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar. ``But ... nobody can ask us to achieve
100 percent results.''
	   The peace accord negotiated at Wye Plantation and signed Oct. 23
in Washington commits Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Muslim extremists who oppose peace with Israel.
	   But Israel reiterated Wednesday that it would not carry out the
agreement until it received assurances from Arafat's Palestinian
Authority that it would arrest all 30 suspects.
	   Aides to Netanyahu said in Jerusalem that the Israeli Cabinet
would not be convened to ratify the accord until Israel got a
written guarantee from the United States.
	   At a press conference with Arafat, Aznar said that the Spanish
government considered that the Palestinians were fulfilling all
their obligations in the Wye Plantation accord and that he ``hoped
to soon be able to say the same about Israel.''
	   Arafat said the 12 detained were arrested before Netanyahu's
latest demand.
	   Palestinian security officials have previously said that several
of the men on the list had been arrested and tried, but had not
given a specific number.
	   Arafat also suggested that Israel had a responsibility to deal
with extremist groups of its own.
	   ``The extremists that exist on both sides are cooperating in
order to wreck the peace process,'' he said. ``We should not forget
that Rabin was assassinated by Israeli extremists.''
	   The head of the Palestinian Authority said that the Mideast
peace process had inevitably slowed since the assassination of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three years ago, and Netanyahu's
coming to power in 1996.
	   But Arafat claimed that 74 percent of the Israeli population
favored the latest U.S.-backed peace initiative, and said he had
conceded Netanyahu's request for a 10-day postponement after a call
from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   With the latest threats to the Wye Plantation accord, Arafat
said he expected U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross to visit the region
within days.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat also met with King Juan Carlos and was to
later meet Foreign Minister Abel Matutes.

 &UR; West Indies Cricket Board faces revolt by top players &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: NEW with focus on WICB meeting; WILL be UPDATED with outcome
of 2000 GMT Antigua meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Facing a revolt by the region's top
players, the West Indies Cricket Board met Wednesday to discuss
their complaints about fees for an imminent three-month tour of
South Africa.
	   Only seven of the 16 players arrived in Johannesburg on
Wednesday. Captain Brian Lara, vice captain Carl Hooper and pacemen
Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose were among nine players who
ignored the board's directive to travel to South Africa.
	   The nine congregated at a hotel at London's Heathrow Airport,
where the West Indian Players' Association, the player's union,
said they were having their own meeting.
	   The union had asked the board to meet with players in London,
but said it was turned down. Instead, the WICB invited Lara, who is
vice president of the players' association, and Hooper, the
players' representative, to meet at their headquarters on the
Caribbean island of Antigua.
	   But the players apparently decided against that. The players'
association said newly appointed chief executive officer David
Holford, a former West Indies allrounder, and secretary Roland
Holder, a West Indies batsman, would be representing the players in
Antigua.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the WICB implied that the dissent was
limited to Lara, a controversial but brilliant batsman who pulled
out of the team two days before its departure for the 1996
Aurstralia tour and abandoned the team following the third test
match on a 1995 tour of England, and Hooper, who also quit the
England tour.
	   But it has become clear that many more top players are involved,
enough that a pullout would hurt the West Indian's chances against
the tough South Africans, who beat them in Sunday's final of the
Wills International Cup in Bangladesh.
	   The board also has a tougher task because it is not negotiating
with individuals but with the players' association, which recently
got a large cash contribution from the board, an office from the
Barbados government and, on June 1, appointed its first executive
officer. The association could be looking for an opportunity to
show its mettle.
	   Neither side will discuss details of the fees. But the Barbados
Nation newspaper on Wednesday said the players want to be paid
above their tour fee for one-day internationals and for a one-week
training camp to be held before the Nov. 10 start of the South
Africa tour; increased meal allowances; and some guarantee of
security in Johannesburg, where two Pakistani players were mugged
while on tour last year.
	   The Nation quoted unnamed Caribbean sources as saying that
players were upset that they would be paid less for the South
African tour than their 1996-1997 Australia tour, which also was a
five-test series. The Nation said those who had played in less than
15 test matches would be paid about dlrs 16,000 for South Africa,
compared to dlrs 22,000 to 25,000 for the Australia tour; and
senior players dlrs 50,000 to 60,000 compared to dlrs 60,000 to
70,000 for Australia.
	   Still, the West Indians are believed to be the second-highest
paid cricketers in the world behind the Australians.
	   The last major revolt by the West Indians came in 1978, when the
then-poorly paid islanders snubbed the regional team and contracted
to Australian magnate Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.
	   When that was disbanded, the West Indians negotiated
substantially better contracts with the board and began a 15-year
winning streak that earned it a repuation as the best team in the
world.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Each morning this week, a convoy of U.N.
cars _ with the required Iraqi escorts _ has headed into the field
carrying U.N. weapons experts.
	   It suggests a certain normality in the search for Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction as mandated by U.N. Security Council
resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But U.N. officials said Wednesday that this is mere trickery _
that things have changed markedly since Iraq on Saturday officially
cut links to the U.N. Special Commission charged with ferreting out
Iraq's long-range missiles and chemical and biological weapons.
	   The U.N. convoys these days are carrying mainly monitors from
the separate U.N. body overseeing the elimination of nuclear
weapons, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It's sort of a pat on the back to the Vienna-headquartered IAEA,
which is close to declaring Iraq free of nuclear weapons. That's in
marked contrast to insistence by the Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, that Iraq is hiding other dangerous arms.
	   However, Iraq also has given what might seem a reward to UNSCOM.
	   In a formally announced ``exception'' to its ban on dealing with
the commission, it is allowing UNSCOM technicians to ride along to
repair monitoring cameras and collect samples from sensors.
	   Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for UNSCOM in New York, sees this as
yet another attempt by the Baghdad regime to deceive.
	   ``By letting our technicians go out, they (the Iraqis) give the
appearance that some sort of monitoring is still going on,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   In fact, the monitors are supposed to do what UNSCOM chairman
Richard Butler has said is among the commission's most important
work _ the long-term monitoring designed to keep Iraq from building
more weapons in the future.
	   Buchanan says what's going on now is nothing like real
monitoring.
	   ``It's maintenance work,'' he added, explaining UNSCOM has just
a handful of air-sampling sensors to check for chemicals and
cameras at no more than 20 to 30 sites, ``a small fraction'' of
several hundred suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   ``These things are a very minor part of monitoring and not a
substitute for physical inspection,'' Buchanan said, contacted by
telephone from Baghdad.
	   He and U.N. officials in Iraq said the Baghdad regime has not
told them formally why the nuclear monitors were allowed to
continue their work while UNSCOM was stopped.
	   ``They've tried in the past to divide us up in an attempt to
show that UNSCOM is horrible and the IAEA nice,'' Buchanan noted.
	   In fact, the almost-daily barbs from government officials and
the state-run media target UNSCOM and Butler, its Australian chief.
	   On Wednesday, the newspaper Babel _ published by Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's son Odai _ called UNSCOM inspectors ``a group of
bandits, thieves and mercenaries whose only aim is to aggravate our
hardships.''

Support of government's austerity measures to be tested in Congress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Voting is scheduled to begin at 1900 GMT. Will be updated. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The government on Wednesday marshaled
its allies for a vote on social security reform that will gauge
Congressional willingness to approve a series of belt-tightening
measures aimed at shoring up Brazil's ailing economy.
	   Legislators will vote on three measures that are the final
touches of a social security reform bill introduced to Congress
nearly three years ago.
	   If approved, the bill is expected to save 3 billion reals (dlrs
2.5 billion), barely enough to make a dent in the the deficit.
	   But it would go a long way toward proving that Brazil's
independent- minded Congress is serious about cutting the country's
ballooning budget deficit of around dlrs 65 billion _ a worrisome 7
percent of the gross domestic product.
	   Analysts say the vote will help the government measure its
chances of getting Congress to approve the fiscal austerity
measures unveiled last week.
	   ``If the articles are approved, the government will score an
important victory,'' according to Bernard Appy of the LCA political
and economic consultancy firm. ``But more important will be the
message it will send the government _ a message that will say
Congress is willing to approve the fiscal austerity measures.''
	   However, ``if the government loses, the fiscal adjustment
measures will plunge into a black hole,'' said Congressman Paulo
Heslander.
	   Last week, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and spending
cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and some dlrs
80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by Congress.
	   On Tuesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso underscored the
importance of Congress's approval of the reform bill and the
multi-year fiscal stabilization plan.
	   ``The whole world is watching us, watching to see if we'll be
able to resolve the crisis,'' the president said.
	   Congressman Arnaldo Madeira, said he expected at least 470 of
the lower house's 513 legislators to appear at Wednesday's session.
	   ``Our experience has shown that this number is enough to
guarantee the 308 votes needed to approve the reform bill,''
Madeira said.
	   The bill would end so called ``special retirements,'' which
allowed certain workers to retire in their 40s, and would keep
workers from accumulating multiple pensions.
	   The three items needed to complete the bill would institute a
minimum retirement age and require workers to contribute to the
social security system for a fixed number of years.
	   Another article establishes a monthly pension ceiling of 1,200
reals (dlrs 1,008) which retirees can receive from the social
security system. Any amount above this must come from private
pension funds.
	   The government also wants to limit special benefits for workers
in hazardous jobs.

Europeans see US election results as rejection of Lewinsky scandal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ European officials and commentators suggested on
Wednesday that U.S. election results confirm what they knew all
along: the private lives of politicians should not become affairs
of state.
	   ``In setting aside the (Monica) Lewinsky affair, the world's
greatest democracy seems to have understood the limits of its
obsession with exposing the private lives of politicians,''
London's Evening Standard said in an editorial.
	   In France, where discussion of politicians' private lives has
largely remained taboo, officials have snickered over the Lewinsky
scandal. Some expressed satisfaction Wednesday that Republicans
failed to gain a clear mandate for impeachment proceedings against
President Bill Clinton.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said it was a ``a good thing for
democracy'' that the Democrats did not suffer a backlash from the
Lewinsky affair.
	   Vedrine, in an interview with RTL radio, said Clinton's party
had performed well ``despite the pressures on him, despite the
attacks which really resembled McCarthyism.''
	   Vedrine also said the stability would be good for cooperation in
foreign policy.
	   ``We know well the foreign policy of Clinton and (U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine) Albright,'' Vedrine said. ``So we know where we
stand.''
	   Jack Lang, head of the National Assembly's foreign affairs
committee, sent a message to Clinton, saying he was pleased ``that
the American people stood up against the heinous campaign that has
been orchestrated against you by ultraconservatives for too long.''
	   Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, for his part, had been
talking to Clinton late Tuesday evening when election results
became clear, a spokesman for Blair said.
	   Blair told Clinton that ``the result would seem to show that,
provided political leaders focused on the things that mattered to
people, governed from the center and delivered, then people would
stand by them,'' the spokesman quoted Blair as saying.
	   In Germany, the state secretary and second-ranking official in
the foreign ministry, Guenther Verheugen, told InfoRadio
Berlin-Brandenburg the election results ``unburdened the
president'' and ``strengthened his negotiating position in interior
and foreign policy.''
	   And in Italy, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the results
show a ``strengthening of the Democratic Party, and therefore also
of the presidency.''
	   For Swiss officials, however, the defeat in New York of
Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato was the most significant aspect of
Tuesday's elections.
	   D'Amato used his role as chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee to repeatedly pressure Switzerland's banks to pay
compensation to Holocaust survivors.
	   Although Swiss officials in general remained tight-lipped,
D'Amato's defeat was met with thinly-veiled sarcasm.
	   ``The government has taken note of Mr. D'Amato's failure to win
re-election, obviously with great regret,'' government spokesman
Achille Casanova said with a straight face. Reporters laughed at
the obvious irony.

Taliban release 108 prisoners as they promised
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban army released 108
opposition prisoners Wednesday in southern Afghanistan, as a Saudi
envoy announced that the religious militia had agreed to a further
two-week cease-fire.
	   ``They have been released unilaterally,'' said Abdul Hai
Muttmayan, a spokesman for the Taliban army who spoke by satellite
telephone from the southern Kandahar province. ``We don't know
anything about our prisoners being held by (Ahmed Shah) Massood,''
who leads the northern-based opposition with ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
	   The release comes as Said Jalal, a confidante of Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah, announced a further two-week cease fire and
the beginning of a process to release 3,000 prisoners.
	   Jalal apparently has been accepted by both sides as a
negotiator.
	   ``There won't be any fighting while the prisoners are being
released,'' said Muttmayan.
	   Most of the jailed men were from northern Afghan provinces of
Balkh and Jozjan, where the opposition alliance dominates.
	   The Taliban army, which rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
is trying to gain control of the remaining part from its
northern-based opponents.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Talks in the American National Basketball
Association labor dispute broke off Wednesday after the sides met
for less than two hours, the shortest session since the lockout
began July 1.
	   ``We were just sitting around the table, and both of us are
somewhat stymied not knowing which way to move next,'' union
director Billy Hunter said. ``We just thought it might be better to
go back to our respective offices and look at where we were.
	   ``If we think it's appropriate, we will talk about getting
together on Friday.''
	   Commissioner David Stern and league representatives did not
immediately comment.
	   The sides were bickering even before they began bargaining. One
day after what was to have been the start of the season, Stern said
agents for the highest-paid players had disrupted and slowed the
process.
	   ``There's something going on that doesn't involve us, something
internally in the union,'' Stern said. ``As I stand here today, I
don't know exactly what it was, but it's clear to me what's coming.
Watch the process. You'll see.''
	   Hunter arrived about 10 minutes after Stern and said: ``He
should blame it on Russ,'' a reference to deputy commissioner Russ
Granik.
	   The sour moods were a new twist on the work stoppage that forced
the league to cancel games for the first time in its history. At
all previous bargaining sessions, the principals were more amicable
during their pre-meeting comments.
	   ``I don't have a prediction,'' Stern said. ``We'd like to
negotiate a deal. There's 1 billion to 1.1 billion dollars in
salaries on the table that we'd like to pay the players, but it's
not happening.
	   ``The agents are saying, `If you're not going to pay the players
the way we want them, then we'd rather not have them paid.'
Ultimately, this is something the union membership is going to have
to decide for themselves.''
	   There were to have been 10 games Tuesday night and 11 Wednesday
night.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   ``If I had to guess, the first game will be Dec. 25, because
that's when NBC's money and the big chips are on the table,''
Utah's Karl Malone said on ESPN. ``Stern wants players to miss two
or three paychecks to start feeling the message.

Islamic party announces reward for arrest of Bangladeshi author
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OSMAN GHANI MANSOOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh's largest Islamic party
offered a large reward Wednesday for information on the whereabouts
of Taslima Nasrin, the feminist author who has been the target of
death threats from Muslim extremists.
	   Nasrin has been in hiding since returning in September after
four years of self-imposed exile in Europe and the United States.
She returned to care for her mother, who is dying of cancer.
	   ``Taslima Nasrin is an infidel and it is the duty of Muslims to
find her out and turn (her) over to police,'' said Abu Taher, a
member of the central committee of Jamaat-e-Islami, or Islamic
Congregation party.
	   ``No one can save the infidel from the hands of those who love
Islam,'' Taher told about 2,000 cheering supporters in Chittagong,
130 miles (210 kilometers) southeast of the Bangladeshi capital,
Dhaka.
	   He said the party was offering dlrs 2,500 _ about 10 times the
average yearly income in Bangladesh _ to anyone who could find
Nasrin. The reward comes in addition to the dlrs 5,000 bounty
various Muslim extremist groups, including Islamic Congregation,
have already placed on Nasrin's head.
	   Nasrin's troubles began in 1994 when a newspaper quoted her as
saying the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten. She
denied making the comment, but admitted that she favored changes in
the Islamic laws to give women in her male-dominated society more
rights.
	   Her return sparked off new street protests by Islamic extremists
and revived a civil suit accusing her of offending Islam, a crime
in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   On Tuesday, the magistrate in the case, in a Dhaka court,
refused bail and ordered her to surrender by Jan. 5. If convicted,
she could be imprisoned for two years.

First victims of Swedish dance fire buried

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nine of the 63 young people who died in
a Swedish dance hall fire were buried together in a ceremony that
attracted thousands of mourners Wednesday, nearly a week after the
blaze.
	   In a Muslim burial ground in a suburb of Goteborg, 500
kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm, the nine white
coffins lay on stands side-by-side, gazed at by an enormous crowd
that had gathered in gray, near-freezing weather.
	   Most of the estimated 400 people at the dance last Thursday were
immigrants or of immigrant parents, primarily Muslims.
	   A spokesman for the national association of Iranian immigrants,
Saied Taghavi, said Iranians had decided to conduct their own
investigation of the fire.
	   ''We don't want to declare that we don't trust in the
authorities,'' he said. ''But the experiences of the Estonia and
the murder of Palme show that this is needed.''
	   The investigation of the killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme 12
years ago has been widely criticized _ a man was convicted of the
killing, but the conviction was overturned for insufficient
evidence _ and there has been wide dissatisfaction with the
three-nation commission that investigated the 1994 sinking of the
ferry Estonia, in which 852 people died.
	   Police have not determined the cause of the fire that raged
through the second-floor dance hall. Dissatisfaction with the
investigation grew Tuesday after investigators found a body that
had laid in the charred ruins for five days, undetected as
searchers and even Prime Minister Goeran Persson went through the
building.
	   Police say they still don't know exactly where the fire began,
but more signs are pointing to the emergency-exit stairway,
Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf told a news conference
Wednesday.
	   Many chairs and other wooden items reportedly were stored in the
stairway. The fire blocked that exit, forcing the panicked dancers
to either attempt to flee down the one remaining stairway or jump
out of second-story windows.

Cholesterol-lowering drugs improve survival after heart attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Cholesterol-lowering drugs can significantly reduce the risk of
death in heart attack victims, even if their cholesterol levels are
not greatly elevated, a study shows.
	   Results of the study were first reported by The Associated Press
last year when they were presented at a meeting of the American
Heart Association. They are now being published in Thursday's issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   In the study, 9,014 people who survived heart attacks or serious
angina were randomly assigned to get either pravastatin, also known
as Pravachol, or dummy pills. Their cholesterol levels ranged from
155 to 271.
	   Over six years of follow-up, Pravachol reduced deaths from heart
disease by 24 percent. Deaths from all causes fell from 14 percent
to 11 percent.
	   The study was conducted by Dr. Andrew Tonkin and others from the
University of Sydney in Australia.
	   In the United States, about 30 percent of heart attack survivors
are taking cholesterol-lowering medicines.

Chechen warlord sentenced to prison _ in absentia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Supreme Court of secessionist Chechnya
sentenced a rebellious warlord to four years in prison Wednesday
for attempting a coup against President Aslan Maskhadov.
	   The court, which relies on Islamic law, sentenced Salman Raduyev
in absentia. The warlord, who remains at large in Chechnya, said he
had no intention of surrendering.
	   He said the sentencing by the Supreme Shariah Court ``will mark
the start of a violent resolution of the long-standing crisis'' in
the republic, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Raduyev and his forces captured the main television center in
Grozny, the Chechen capital, on May 21, killing the national
security chief. That was apparently the basis for the charge
against him.
	   Raduyev, a field commander in the 1994-96 war for independence
with Russia, has lately been rallying the country's opposition
around a demand that Maskhadov resign. The president has so far
stood firm, and said Sunday that Raduyev and two other opposition
figures had proposed a compromise.
	   In September, Maskhadov had told a rally of his followers that
Raduyev should be publicly executed in the central square in
Grozny.
	   Raduyev and other opponents have accused Maskhadov of failing to
restore order in the breakaway republic after the war with Russia.
	   Shamil Basayev, a former prime minister, went on television
Monday night to say that Maskhadov's resignation ``will be useful
both for Chechen security and for the strengthening of the
independent Chechen state.''
	   Even the government acknowledges that Chechnya has been plagued
by violence and kidnappings. Chechen security forces have lately
been waging a campaign to bring order, although the campaign itself
has led to a spate of attacks against security officials.
	   A news report Wednesday said two security officials were killed
in what the government suspects was retaliation for the crackdown.
	   Security Ministry officials said two of their staff in Grozny
have been found with their throats cut, Interfax reported. The
ministry said the killings were an attempt to thwart the anti-crime
campaign.
	   Late last month, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, Shadid
Bargishev, was killed in a car bomb explosion.
	   Officials said Bargishev was targeted because he had promised to
launch a major offensive against hostage-takers, and he had
recently succeeded in securing the release of several captives,
including a British couple.
	   About 100 people are believed still held in Chechnya, including
three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk. On Wednesday, a Chechen
prosecutor said one group of kidnappers was demanding dlrs 7
million in ransom for the release of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's envoy to the region, Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped
last May 1.
	   Deputy Prosecutor General Magomed Magomadov added that Russian
authorities had earlier offered dlrs 4 million to the kidnappers
for Vlasov's release, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent, but no country has
recognized its independence, and Moscow insists the territory is
part of Russia.

Discovery of pilotless aircraft in militant hide-out baffles

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Security forces in India's insurgency-swept
Jammu-Kashmir state made the stunning discovery of two
remote-controlled pilotless aircraft in a hide-out of Muslim
guerrillas deep in a mountainous forest, a police source said
Wednesday.
	   The microlight plastic aircraft have cavities which police
believe could be used to load three kilograms (6.6 pounds) of
explosives, said the source on condition of anonymity. The aircraft
have a range of three kilometers (1.8 miles).
	   The police source said the aircraft were found in a dense forest
during a three-day search operation to flush out Muslim militants
fighting Indian security forces for nine years. The search ended
early Wednesday in the Datapani region about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southwest of the state's winter capital of Jammu.
	   This is the first time militants have been found equipped with
such sophisticated aircraft, the source said. The aircraft were
both six feet long, three feet wide and two feet high.
	   The densely forested area is heavily guarded by the army but
soldiers have been the target of repeated militant attacks in the
region in recent months.
	   The source said security officials were stunned by the discovery
of the aircraft, which could be used by militants to launch attacks
at will and spread terror.
	   Nearly a dozen groups active in the region are fighting to
either carve out a separate state of Kashmir or merge with
Pakistan, India's neighbor and rival. India accuses Pakistan of
arming and funding the insurgency. Pakistan denies the charge but
acknowledges giving ideological support to the separatists.
	   The discovery of the aircraft came a day after the seizure of
300 kilograms (660 pounds) of explosives in downtown Srinagar, the
state's summer capital. The Army said it had preempted a terrorist
strike acting on a tip off from an informer who said the explosives
had been hidden by militants.

Prosecutor appeals ruling favoring Russian whistle-blower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prosecutor appealed to the Russian Supreme Court
to overturn a lower court ruling that favored a former naval
officer charged with treason, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Prosecutor Alexander Gutsan of St. Petersburg filed the appeal
Tuesday, complaining that the lower court had drawn ``premature
conclusions'' about the evidence against Alexander Nikitin,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Nikitin is accused of giving the Norwegian environmental group
Bellona state secrets on how the Russian navy's Northern Fleet
handles its nuclear waste and reactors.
	   Last week, Judge Sergei Golets threw out all the evidence
presented in the indictment and sent the case back to prosecutors
for further investigation.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ American flags were burned Wednesday and so
were effigies of Uncle Sam. There were calls of ``Death to
America'' too. But the atmosphere was distinctly carnival at the
massive government-sponsored rally marking the 19th anniversary of
Iran's seizure of the U.S. Embassy.
	   Some 20,000 people _ mostly school children and high school
students given a day off for the rally _ gathered outside the
former U.S. Embassy for the annual demonstration.
	   But lacking among the participants, many of them born after the
embassy takeover, was the revolutionary fervor that drove Islamic
students who took over the U.S. Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979 and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Anti-American sentiments have since then been a cornerstone of
Iranian policy but the rhetoric has been losing edge since the
election last year of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric
who has encouraged ties with Americans.
	   Most demonstrators responded sporadically and indifferently to
calls of ``Death to America'' from a speaker directing the show
from behind a microphone on a platform.
	   Calls for ``Death to Israel'' got a more enthusiastic response.
	   Thousands of colorful fliers denouncing America and Israel were
thrown into the air like confetti and children waved balloons
printed with called for Israel's destruction.
	   A few listened as Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-line leader and former
army commander, criticized efforts to re-establish ties with the
United States, which were severed after the embassy takeover.
	   He said a dialogue with the United States can reopen only when
its president publicly apologizes to Iran. The United States should
also pledge that it will no longer interfere in Iran's affairs and
withdraws its warships from the Gulf.
	   The United States softened its stand after Khatami's election,
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright suggested that a
bilateral dialogue could be started.
	   But at the same time the Clinton administration says relations
can't improve until Tehran stops its support for international
terrorism and opposition to the Middle East peace process. Other
hurdles are the U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, and the Congress'
recent decision to allocate dlrs 20 million for covert activities
in Iran.
	   Amir Khojasteh, a 25-year-old demonstrators, said he favored
ties with the United States as long as ``we stand beside them, not
behind them.''
	   Ahmad Reza Mahdavi, a 17-year-old student wearing a T-shirt with
a picture of Titanic star Leonard DiCaprio, said he harbored no
hatred against the United States.
	   ``I don't dislike America too much, but we must accept that the
American government is not fair to Iran,'' said Mahdavi.
	   The takeover of the embassy was a turning point in the 1979
Islamic Revolution that overthrew the pro-U.S. shah's regime and
installed the Shiite clerical government.
	   Hardly anyone in Iran will publicly criticize the seizure.
President Khatami also defended it.
	   The occupation was ``a kind of protest to a series of policies
which had culminated in the violation of Iran's national rights and
sovereignty,'' Khatami told students during a tour of a girls'
school in Tehran.
	   Outside the former U.S. Embassy, demonstrators said it was
necessary to participate.
	   ``We are here to keep alive the memory of that day 19 years
ago,'' said Ayat Nojavan, a 37-year-old government employee.
	   However, he disagreed with the burning of the American flag.
``We would be hurt if they burned our flag.''
	   Seyed Morteza Sahebi, 55, who was with the mob that stormed the
embassy in 1979, said he still felt the same anger about the United
States.
	   ``I feel the same as I did 19 years ago. Our revolutionary
fervor is intact. We must continue our death to America slogan,''
said Sahebi, who held out a clenched fist when he shouted ``Death
to America.''
	   In schools throughout Iran, bells were rung to mark the
anniversary, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   But in a sign of changing attitudes, the student leaders who
overran the embassy invited on Monday their former hostages to
return to Iran as their guests.
	   The former students, who have undergone ideological
transformation in the past few years and are considered moderates,
held their rally two days ahead of the actual anniversary in order
to avoid a clash with hard-liners.
	   No American flags were burned at that demonstration as a
courtesy to the American people.

International center opens to keep track of Russia's nukes

<TEXT>
	   OBNINSK, Russia _ To keep Russia's nuclear material from
disappearing abroad, Russian, European and American partners opened
a center Wednesday that better tracks the government's stockpiles
of uranium and plutonium.
	   In theory, scientists say, keeping track of the nuclear material
should be as easy as running a supermarket: Stock up with goods,
slap a bar code on each product, and always make sure the balance
sheet adds up.
	   ``We're not inventing anything new here,'' said Marc Cuypers,
the deputy director of the European Commission's Institute for
Systems, Information and Safety. ``It's a lot like a supermarket,
except that our material happens to be extremely dangerous.''
	   The Russian Methodological and Training Center, a joint project
between Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, the U.S. Department of
Energy and the European Commission, is located in Russia's nuclear
heartland, the site of the world's first nuclear power plant.
	   The project got under way in 1995, when Russia was rife with
reports of smuggling of uranium and plutonium after the weakening
of safeguards with the fall of the Soviet Union, and the government
didn't know how much nuclear material it had.
	   Russian officials insist that weapons-grade nuclear material has
never been stolen or sold, but admit there were at least 30 thefts
of radioactive substances in 1992-1995.
	   ``Our borders have become for all practical purposes
transparent,'' Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, Yevgeny Adamov,
said Wednesday. ``The weakening of our ability to manage nuclear
material has been immeasurable.''
	   By introducing the center, Russian leaders hope to create ``a
radical break in technology, a change to modern means'' that will
close those borders to illegal and dangerous trade, Adamov said.
	   The facility trains specialists to accurately measure, to a 0.1
percent margin of error, the weight, chemical content, and isotope
levels of a hunk of plutonium or uranium.
	   They must learn how to keep track of it, protect it and _ here's
the supermarket part _ how to use computers that assign each piece
a bar code.
	   Participants say the center, and possible facilities like it in
the future, will improve Russia's system of accounting for nuclear
material to international standards, so it can keep track of every
gram of plutonium and uranium as it disarms its warheads.
	   It is unclear, however, when Russia will actually be able to use
the specialists it trains at the center. Russia's parliament still
has not passed legislation requiring nuclear stockpiles to be
looked after with the rigid standards of the West.
	   Still, participants hope that through international cooperation,
the center will eventually get rid of Russia's old way of keeping
track of nuclear material _ secret cities, armed guards, and little
discourse with the West.
	   Russia must be able to ``assure the general public shown
material is accounted for and controlled,'' said Gordon Adam, a
member of the European Parliament and vice president of its
commission on energy. ``The center can only succeed (if) the
countries included ruthlessly pick the brains of the others.''

Steffi Graf beats Sugiyama after slow start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sanchez-Vicario upset, other results, CORRECTS
van Roost score to 6-4, 6-4 in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ In the second match of her latest
comeback, Steffi Graf overcame a slow start and beat sixth-seeded
Ali Sugiyama 6-4, 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals of the Leipzig
Open Wednesday.
	   Graf, a four-time winner of the tournament who is unseeded this
time because of her low ranking, had trouble finding her timing and
clearly showed the lack of match practice early on against the
quick Japanese.
	   But the former No. 1 picked up her game late in the first set
and went on to post a workmanlike victory.
	   ``I expected a tough match. She's been playing good tennis in
recent months. I played her a few months ago and lost in three
close sets,'' Graf said. ``I knew she would be aggressive.''
	   In the quarterfinals, Graf will meet 19-year-old Frenchwoman
Anne-Gaelle Sidot, who upset top-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario,
the reigning French Open champion and Graf's old rival.
	   Sidot, a qualifier ranked No. 74 in the world, beat the Spaniard
6-1, 4-6, 6-2.
	   Graf was sidelined nearly two months after having surgery for a
bone spur in her right wrist.
	   The 29-year-old German is now ranked No. 22 in the world, but
she could still qualify for the season-ending Chase Championship in
New York Nov. 16-22. She also plans to play in Philadelphia next
week.
	   Sugiyama, ranked No. 18 in the world, broke Graf's serve in the
opening game and the German could not find her range.
	   The key game of the match turned out to be the third, Graf's
second service game that went to eight deuces. Graf won a long and
spectacular rally and then hit an ace to clinch the game after
fighting off three break points.
	   ``That was a very important game. I had possibilities to win it
earlier and she had chances to break me,'' Graf said. ``Winning
this game gave me confidence. I knew it'd be tough to win the first
set if I lost that game. She put me under a lot of pressure.''
	   Graf then broke Sugiyama's serve twice as she fought back from a
4-2 deficit to win five games in a row, clinching the first set and
going up 1-0 in the second.
	   The German broke once more for a 4-2 lead and held three match
points. She wasted one with a double-fault, hit a slice backhand
long on the next but the Japanese then netted a backhand.
	   Graf, who held the top ranking a record 374 weeks and dominated
the women's game for a decade, now has a 22-0 match record in
Leipzig, a tournament she helped found.
	   In other matches in the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament,
second-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France beat Elena Likhovtseva of
Russia, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, and third-seeded Dominique van Roost of
Belgium ousted former French Open champion Iva Majoli of Croatia
6-4, 6-4.

French premier affirms support for U.N. tribunal

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Wednesday sought to end a lingering dispute with the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, insisting that France fully supports
the U.N. court's work.
	   Jospin, however, stopped short of saying that French
peacekeepers would be allowed to testify openly at trials. They
currently are permitted to give evidence by deposition.
	   Other nations, including Britain, Canada and the Netherlands,
have sent former peacekeepers to testify in public during trials.
	   The refusal to allow French former NATO peackeepers to appear at
the tribunal soured relations between France and the tribunal last
year. At one point, chief prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada
suggested the French were attempting ``to control the tribunal's
access to the truth.''
	   But after a working visit to the court Wednesday, Jospin said
France ``fully and completely supports'' the tribunal's work.
	   In a speech, Jospin said that ``like other states, France asks
that the depositions of its senior officials be accompanied by
guarantees of protection and confidentiality.''
	   He also told officials that French authorities recently agreed
to relocate traumatized witnesses in France.
	   Trying to put the dispute behind her, Arbour said Wednesday that
the tribunal and France now have ``an ongoing and busy relationship
which at this point is very satisfactory.''
	   Jospin also sought to play down the arrest last Thursday of a
French air force official on charges of supplying NATO intelligence
to Serb authorities.
	   Jospin said the quick decision of the French Defense Ministry to
turn over all information known about Pierre Bunel ``reconfirmed
France's credibility.''
	   Bunel, a 46-year-old official based in Brussels, allegedly
supplied information on planned airstrikes to Serb authorities
during Belgrade's standoff with NATO over the Kosovo conflict.
	   Bunel has been placed under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged _ and faces up to 15 years in jail if
convicted.
	   ``We are a state that respects the rule of law,'' Jospin said.

South Africa on way to passing one of world's toughest anti-smoking
</HEADLINE>
laws &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ No smoking in enclosed public
places except in designated areas. No tobacco advertising. Even ads
for non-tobacco products would not be allowed to show people
smoking cigarettes.
	   Such is life in South Africa envisioned by one of the world's
strictest anti-smoking bills, which parliament's lower house
approved on Wednesday.
	   Parliament's upper house has already passed the bill proposed by
President Nelson Mandela's health minister. It must now reconsider
it due to some last-minute amendments. Final passage appeared
assured.
	   ``It is just a formality,'' said one dejected lawmaker, Ruth
Rabinowitz of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which voted against the
bill.
	   But tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to
mount a constitutional challenge to the bill, which could delay it
becoming law or perhaps kill it altogether. Opponents say the bill
infringes individual and free-trade rights.
	   All but one of the opposition parties in the National Assembly
opposed the bill on Wednesday, but the ruling African National
Congress' hefty majority ensured a victory. It was approved by 213
votes to 106.
	   ``Fundamental fanatacism has won the day,'' rued the National
Party, which ruled under apartheid and whose last president, F.W.
de Klerk, was a chain smoker.
	   Although the two sides remained deeply divided, the day had its
light moments.
	   ANC lawmaker Kader Asmal evoked laughter when he spoke in
support of the bill, saying it didn't ban smoking altogether but
just ``privatized pleasure.''
	   Asmal smoked for 50 years until giving up under a doctor's
orders earlier this year.
	   When the house speaker announced absent lawmakers would be given
five minutes to appear for the vote, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
asked whether the time could be used for a smoke break.
	   Manuel is not known to be a smoker, and he did not join a
handful of lawmakers who hurried out of the chamber to sneak a
quick puff below a nearby flight of stairs.
	   Parliament banned smoking in most public areas of the building,
including the area below the stairs, several months ago.
	   During debate on Tuesday, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma
declared ``the social cost of continued indulgence in the
destructive habit of smoking is prohibitively high.''
	   The bill outlaws smoking in enclosed public places like train
stations and shopping malls and in the workplace.
	   It provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate
facilities are created for those desperate for a puff. Bars and
restaurants with designated smoking areas also would escape the
ban.
	   The planned law bans all tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
Even ads for products such as drinks and clothes would be banned
from showing people smoking.
	   The maximum fine for smoking at work or in public places would
be 200 rand (dlrs 35). Advertising violations could generate fines
of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).
	   Cigarette advertisements in South Africa on billboards and the
print media already must prominently display such warnings as
``DANGER: SMOKING CAN KILL YOU,'' or ``DANGER: SMOKING CAUSES
CANCER.''
	   The tobacco industry, advertising groups and some unions oppose
the bill and are vowing a fight.

First victims of Swedish dance fire buried

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nine of the 63 young people who died in
a Swedish dance hall fire were buried together in a ceremony
Wednesday that attracted thousands of mourners.
	   In a Muslim burial ground in a suburb of Goteborg, 300 miles
(500 kilometers) southwest of Stockholm, the nine white coffins lay
on stands side-by-side in front of an enormous crowd that had
gathered in gray, near-freezing weather.
	   Most of the estimated 400 people at the dance last Thursday were
immigrants or of immigrant parents, primarily Muslims.
	   A spokesman for the national association of Iranian immigrants,
Saied Taghavi, said they had decided to conduct their own
investigation of the fire.
	   ``We don't want to declare that we don't trust in the
authorities,'' he said. ``But the experiences of the Estonia and
the murder of Palme show that this is needed.''
	   The investigation of the killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme 12
years ago has been widely criticized _ a man was convicted of the
killing but that was overturned for insufficient evidence _ and
there has been wide dissatisfaction with the three-nation
commission that investigated the 1994 sinking of the ferry Estonia,
in which 852 people died.
	   Police have not determined the cause of the fire that raged
through the second-floor dance hall. Dissatisfaction with the
investigation grew Tuesday after investigators found a body that
had laid in the charred ruins for five days, undetected as
searchers and even Prime Minister Goeran Persson went through the
building.
	   Police say they still don't know exactly where the fire began,
but more signs are pointing to the emergency exit stairway,
Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf told a news conference
Wednesday.
	   Many chairs and other wooden items reportedly were stored in the
stairway. The fire blocked that exit, forcing the panicked dancers
to either attempt to flee down the one remaining stairway or jump
out of second-story windows.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A car sped onto Red Square on Wednesday and
exploded just outside the main gate to the Kremlin, injuring three
guards and the driver, authorities said. The cause of the blast was
not immediately known.
	   Initial reports said one person was killed inside the car, but a
spokesman for the presidential press service said no one had died.
	   The car exploded shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), a few meters
(yards) outside the Spassky Gate, the main entrance to the Kremlin.
The walled enclosure has been Russia's governmental and spiritual
center for centuries.
	   Clouds of smoke could be seen drifting over St. Basil's
Cathedral, a few meters (yards) away. Officials inside the Kremlin
said they could feel the concussion from the blast.
	   The Kremlin spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the car had driven very fast toward Red Square, past the famous GUM
department store. It knocked down fences, drove across the square
and approached the gate at the foot of Spassky Tower, a large red
clock tower that is one of Russia's most distinctive symbols.
	   The driver jumped out just before the car, a cheap,
Russian-built Moskvich, exploded, the official said. The blast was
reported to have had the force of 6 kilograms (13 pounds) of
dynamite.
	   Two Kremlin guards, one presidential guard and the driver were
reported injured.
	   The driver was identified as Ivan Orlov, a 65-year-old
journalist for a nationalist magazine from the Moscow suburb of
Podolsk, the Interfax news agency reported. It was not immediately
clear whether he was arrested.
	   Reporting on the incident was sketchy, and the entire area
surrounding the blast was sealed off to the press and public.
	   The Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the
Soviet KGB, said it was investigating the incident, and had not
ruled out terrorism as a motive, Interfax said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has his office at the Kremlin, but has
been in the southern resort city of Sochi recovering from what has
been described as exhaustion.
	   Kremlin officials said the doors to the gate have been closed
for years, and expressed assurance that the car could not have
broken through them.

Vatican official links Holy Land visit by pope to peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Progress in the peace process between Israelis and
Palestinians could open the way to a papal visit to the Holy Land,
a top Vatican official said Wednesday.
	   Pope John Paul II has frequently expressed the desire to make
the trip _ he has an open invitation from the Israelis _ but no
date has ever been set. The Palestinians have also invited him.
	   While the Vatican has never publicly set conditions, Archbishop
Jean-Louis Tauran, the Vatican's foreign minister, said a visit
would be ``more likely'' if the peace process moved ahead.
	   A papal trip to Israel is one of a series of thorny issues on
the agenda of Vatican-Israeli diplomacy, with Tauran igniting the
latest flashpoint during a visit to Jerusalem last week.
	   The Vatican official said east Jerusalem was ``illegally
occupied'' by the Israelis and asked for international guarantees
for sites considered holy by Christians, Jews and Muslims.
	   Israel considers all of Jerusalem, including the traditionally
Arab east which it took over in the 1967 war, its eternal capital.
	   As if in a tit-for-tat, Israel's ambassador to the Vatican came
back Tuesday with a call for the Vatican to wait 50 years before
moving ahead with any plan to beatify Pius XII, the World War
II-era pope.
	   Ambassador Aharon Lopez said the moratorium would give time for
all relevant documents in the Vatican archives to be made public
and allow the healing of ``wounds still open'' from the Holocaust.
	   Pius, pope from 1939 until his death in 1958, has been accused
by Jews and others of remaining silent about the Nazi Holocaust.
	   Vatican officials dismissed Lopez' foray as a blunder, but the
only official response was that the beatification process ``would
take its due course.''
	   Tauran, pressed by reporters while attending a conference
Wednesday on diplomacy, said there was no need to ``dramatize'' the

	   He said the Israeli request for a moratorium on the
beatification was ``nothing new. Even if not exactly in the terms
of a 50-year moratorium, I've heard it before,'' he said.

Rios rails against surface, saying it makes championship unfair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World No. 2 Marcelo Rios on Wednesday labeled the
ATP tour unfair, and called for the end-of-season ATP Tour World
Championships to be played on a different surface.
	   He suggested it be moved to South America.
	   Currently, the championship is played indoors in Hanover, which
the Chilean said favors fast-court players.
	   ``I think that they should change surfaces. It's not fair for
the clay court players like me. I play pretty good indoors, but it
is not fair,'' Rios said after defeating Australia's Todd
Woodbridge 6-0, 6-4, in the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   ``The court is made for Sampras, for Becker. That's one of the
reasons Sampras wins every year, because the surface is too fast
indoors.''
	   Rios, who briefly held the world No. 1 spot this year, said that
moving the tournament to South America would also mean that matches
could be played outdoors.
	   Playing in South America would be a ``great idea,'' he said.
``Right now, when tournaments are played there, top players don't
go.''
	   ``They could go to South America because it is summer there,''
he said, before returning to his real point -- surfaces not
summers.
	   ``I don't care if it (held) in Europe or in the States. They
should change the surface.
	   ``Right now the tour is not fair for everybody,'' Rios said.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A top U.S. envoy met with Rwandan- and
Ugandan-backed Congolese rebels on Wednesday in a bid to end their
three-month rebellion.
	   But Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Susan Rice, acknowledged
she achieved little on her seven-nation tour to persuade outsiders
to withdraw from the conflict that has embroiled troops from as
many as eight countries.
	   ``We have heard the desire of all sides for peace,'' Rice said.
``I think the challenge is how to get there. We'll continue our
efforts to try to search for peace.''
	   Reversing an earlier position, Rice met with Congolese rebels
trying to topple their president, Laurent Kabila, in a hastily
arranged meeting in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   ``We had a frank exchange of views,'' said Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition. ``The
Americans listened to our concerns, and we hoped the contacts will
continue.''
	   On Sunday, U.S. Embassy officials told rebels their request for
a meeting with Rice was premature. Rice overruled their decision
Wednesday, although African leaders have kept the rebels on the
fringe of peace talks.
	   After three hours of talks with President Pasteur Bizimungu and
Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president and chief architect of
Rwandan policy in Congo, the Rwandan government again denied having
troops in Congo and distanced itself from the crisis.
	   On Wednesday, Kabila flew to Harare, Zimbabwe, for consultations
with President Robert Mugabe, who has sent 6,000 troops and an air
force to prop up his Congolese ally. Angola and Namibia, too, sent
troops and tanks to help stop rebel advances.
	   After the presidents met, Mugabe dismissed Rice's call for an
immediate cease-fire, and predicted victory over the Congolese
rebels and their Rwandan and Ugandan allies.
	   ``We told Rice: if they have the will to pull out, fine. If they
don't, we will have the will to drive them out,'' Mugabe said one
day after meeting Rice.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate directly with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   U.S. diplomats said Rice, who already visited South Africa,
Angola, Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe, had a hard time convincing the
countries supporting Kabila that the United States was impartial in
the conflict.
	   In Kigali, Rice acknowledged Rwanda's security concerns in
Congo, and said any settlement must address the border security and
an end to ethnic killings _ a reference to anti-Tutsi persecution
in Congo.
	   ``Our aim is to move the peace process forward,'' she said. ``We
see our role as one of support to regional efforts to achieve a
negotiated settlement to Congolese conflict.''
	   Rice later met with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni for two
hours in Entebbe, her final stop before returning to Washington on
Thursday. Neither Rice nor Museveni commented after their meeting.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe
predicted victory Wednesday against Congolese rebels and their
Rwandan and Ugandan allies and rejected a U.S. initiative calling
for an immediate cease-fire in the Congo.
	   Mugabe, who met with Congolese President Laurent Kabila in
Harare Wednesday as riots over economic hardships rocked Zimbabwe's
capital, said southern African troops fighting alongside Kabila's
forces were there to restore peace and stability and provide aid to
rebuild Congo's shattered economy. Zimbabwe's economic troubles
have been worsened by the costs of its deployment of 6,000 troops,
warplanes and armor to Congo.
	   Kabila sped past demonstrators in a heavily armed convoy,
escorted by a helicopter.
	   On Tuesday, Mugabe met with a U.S. peace mission led by the
State department's top Africa official, Susan Rice, the assistant
secretary of state for African affairs.
	   Rice's visit ``should not be regarded as more important than it
actually is. She is just an assistant secretary of state,'' Mugabe
told reporters.
	   He said peace could only be brought to the Congo by the
withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan forces. Rwanda denies it has
troops on Congolese soil.
	   ``We told Rice: `If they have the will to pull out, fine. If
they don't, we will have the will to drive them out,''' said
Mugabe.
	   Zimbabwe and its southern African allies, Angola and Namibia,
have vowed to launch an offensive against rebel strongholds in the
dense jungles of eastern Congo.
	   Mugabe said he discussed with Kabila economic aid from Zimbabwe
to the Congo, even though Zimbabwe's economy is in a shambles.
	   ``We want to rehabilitate Congo's socio-economic system,''
Mugabe said. ``The people (of Congo) must eat, people must be
dressed up, people must be taken care of ... in terms of education,
health and medical care and obviously in terms of social
services.''
	   ``We can't wait until the end of the war. Planning must start
and programs must start in those areas where it is possible,''
Mugabe said.
	   Kabila added: ``Though we are fighting, we have to ameliorate
the standards of living of our people.''

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Cruzeiro has done the hard part _ won
in Argentina. Thursday night all it has to do is draw with River
Plate at home to reach the semifinals of the Copa Mercosur.
	   Despite having strikers Marcelo and Fabio Junior at its
disposal, don't expect Cruzeiro to push forward.
	   ``I expect the game to be evenly matched,'' Cruzeiro coach Levir
Culpi said. ``We cannot underestimate the Argentines who always
with a lot of determination and courage.''
	   River Plate, on the other hand, may have to abandon its
predominantly defensive, counter-attack style, led by sole striker
Pizzi, to overcome last week's 2-1 loss.
	   ``We won't let them (Cruzeiro) to control the ball,'' River
Plate coach Ramon Diaz said. ``We may be playing with just one
striker, but a lot of our midfielders are excellent scorers.''

Lingering violence keeps up tension in Kosovo

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas ambushed
two cars, riddling them with gunfire and wounding three Serbs, Serb
police said Wednesday _ a harsh reminder that despite a cease-fire,
the violence in Kosovo is far from over.
	   Although heavy fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas has stopped and many refugees are returning to their
villages from the woods, isolated attacks continue in the southern
Serbian province, and tensions remain high.
	   The attack Tuesday evening on two vehicles from the Belacevac
coal mine set off an hour-long gunbattle between ethnic Albanian
guerrillas and Serb police, said police at a checkpoint near
Sipitula, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of the Kosovo
capital, Pristina.
	   Three miners were wounded, two of them seriously, and were taken
to a Pristina hospital, police said. The two bullet-riddled cars
were still sitting at the checkpoint Wednesday, a pool of blood
congealing beside them. Dozens of spent shell casings littered the
road.
	   Residents of Sipitula said Serb police began shooting at the
village at about the same time police said the gunfight began. The
villagers said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or
with friends and relatives.
	   Police gave few details of the ambush on the two cars, one of
which bore the logo of the mining company on its door.
	   However, a mine security guard, Blagoje Ristic, said Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas have ambushed vehicles along the same
stretch of road twice previously and KLA snipers hide in abandoned
houses in the area. ``The people are afraid to go to work,'' he
said.
	   The few villagers who returned Wednesday to assess the situation
in Sipitula said Serb police were continuing to harass them.
	   ``They are playing this game and aren't withdrawing their
forces,'' complained Fatme Mjeku, who said he and his neighbors
often hide in surrounding woods at night because of police gunfire.
	   ``This happens frequently,'' said 59-year-old Hilmi Mjekiqi,
adding that police burned a school building in the village on
Friday.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes on Serb and Yugoslav forces to pressure Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to agree Oct. 12 to halt a seven-month
crackdown on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1.
	   Under the agreement, Serb police and Yugoslav army forces in
Kosovo must be reduced to levels before the offensive and refugees
must be allowed to return to their homes.
	   The agreement also calls for international agencies to move
freely in Kosovo.
	   While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they have
grudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise their
goal of independence.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
left homeless in the Serb authorities' crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour
said the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has U.N. authority to
investigate war crimes in any part of Yugoslavia. She was
responding to assertions by Yugoslav government officials that
Kosovo is off limits to tribunal investigations.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An arrest warrant was issued
Wednesday for Trevor Tutu, son of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, when he
failed to appear in court on charges of reckless or negligent
driving.
	   It was the second arrest warrant to be issued in the case. The
first one was withdrawn after Tutu, 42, explained that he went to
the wrong court because he lost his original summons.
	   The son of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate is charged in
connection with a rush-hour traffic accident in Johannesburg on
Jan. 22.
	   Tutu sustained minor injuries and his car was badly damaged.
Three other cars were damaged and one other driver was slightly
injured.

EU promises ``generous'' help for NIreland to boost peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
promised to maintain ``generous'' funding for Northern Ireland in
support of the peace process there.
	   EU Regional Development Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies told
visiting members of the Northern Ireland Assembly aid would remain
at current levels until at least 2003 though Ulster no longer
qualifies as one of the EU's poorest regions.
	   ``The Commission won't leave you out in the cold,'' Mrs.
Wulf-Mathies told assembly members who visited the EU head office.
	   Through its regional fund spending and contributions to the
International Fund for Ireland, the EU has contributed hundreds of
millions of dollars to improve social and economic conditions in
Ulster in recent years.
	   But as the Ulster economy improved, the area dropped on the list
of priority areas benefiting from special EU development aid.
	   ``I know many of you expect the Commission to secure (poorest
region) status for Northern Ireland,'' Mrs. Wulf-Mathies told the
80-member Assembly delegation.
	   ``However, you will understand that despite serious economic and
social weaknesses, Northern Ireland is, happily, too prosperous to
belong further to the group of poorest regions.
	   ``But the Commission won't leave you out in the cold. We know
the peace process needs continuing support to be self-sustaining.
Therefore, Northern Ireland will benefit from generous transitional
arrangements in the period 2000-2006.''
	   Earlier the Assembly members, led by First Minister David
Trimble and his Deputy Seamus Mallon, visited the European
Parliament which held a plenary session here.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stern comment in new grafs 4-5. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Talks in the American National Basketball
Association labor dispute broke off Wednesday after the sides met
for less than two hours, the shortest session since the lockout
began July 1.
	   ``We were just sitting around the table, and both of us are
somewhat stymied not knowing which way to move next,'' union
director Billy Hunter said. ``We just thought it might be better to
go back to our respective offices and look at where we were.
	   ``If we think it's appropriate, we will talk about getting
together on Friday.''
	   Commissioner David Stern blamed the breakup on agents. He said
pressure was being applied on union leadership by agents for
high-salaried players at the expense of middle-income players.
	   ``There's not a lot to talk about,'' Stern said. ``We estimate
that we will pay out over a billion dollars (in player) salaries.
And the representatives that sat in the room with us on behalf of
those 400 players seem intent to have that billion dollars, along
with the sand in the hourglass, just drip away.''
	   The sides were bickering even before they began bargaining. One
day after what was to have been the start of the season, Stern said
agents for the highest-paid players had disrupted and slowed the
process.
	   ``There's something going on that doesn't involve us, something
internally in the union,'' Stern said. ``As I stand here today, I
don't know exactly what it was, but it's clear to me what's coming.
Watch the process. You'll see.''
	   Hunter arrived about 10 minutes after Stern and said: ``He
should blame it on Russ,'' a reference to deputy commissioner Russ
Granik.
	   The sour moods were a new twist on the work stoppage that forced
the league to cancel games for the first time in its history. At
all previous bargaining sessions, the principals were more amicable
during their pre-meeting comments.
	   ``I don't have a prediction,'' Stern said. ``We'd like to
negotiate a deal. There's 1 billion to 1.1 billion dollars in
salaries on the table that we'd like to pay the players, but it's
not happening.
	   ``The agents are saying, `If you're not going to pay the players
the way we want them, then we'd rather not have them paid.'
Ultimately, this is something the union membership is going to have
to decide for themselves.''
	   There were to have been 10 games Tuesday night and 11 Wednesday
night.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   ``If I had to guess, the first game will be Dec. 25, because
that's when NBC's money and the big chips are on the table,''
Utah's Karl Malone said on ESPN. ``Stern wants players to miss two
or three paychecks to start feeling the message.

points before winning the game and immediately breaking Johansson's
service to force a first-set tie break.
	   Even then, Sampras needed to be at his best.
	   With the scores tied at five points each, he played a
breathtaking cross court backhand winner at full stretch.
	   The second set proved a much easier task, with Sampras in total
command and losing only one game.
	   No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios, one of the players battling with
Sampras for the end-of-year No. 1 spot, had an easier second-round
contest, beating Todd Woodbridge, 6-0, 6-4.
	   Woodbridge had a 2-0 record against Rios, and the Chilean had
never previously won a match at the Paris Open. Despite that, the
match was one-sided from the start.
	   Thanks to some wayward Woodbridge serving and blistering
backhand returns from the Chilean, Rios took the first set without
losing a game. He won in just one hour and two minutes.
	   Spain's Albert Costa continued his dismal indoor form Wednesday,
crashing out to unseeded Frenchman Jerome Golmard, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5.
	   Golmard's second-round win over the No. 16 seed means that the
Frenchman will face Sampras in the next round.
	   Clay court specialist Costa, who benefited from a bye in the
first round, has never won a match indoors.
	   ``The more the match went on, the more I was able to go to the
net and this made the difference,'' Golmard said. ``Each time I
went to the net I won the point.''
	   Golmard, 25, who has a world ranking of 57, is now looking
forward to a confrontation with Sampras.
	   ``There will be very few rallies because Sampras is going to
serve many aces. I'll have to be very alert on my returns,'' he
said.
	   Mark Philippoussis, this year's U.S. Open finalist, ousted
another seed, beating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic, 2-6, 6-4,
6-4.
	   After a fine start to the year, which saw him win the Australian
Open, No. 10 seed Korda has been in poor form recently.
	   Korda, 30, said he decided to stay on the ATP tour for another
year after last month's Ostrava tournament.
	   ``I am not doing what I should be doing. I really need to win
one match to change things. But I am not going to give up,'' he
said.
	   Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, had a tough second
round win, beating Magnus Norman of Sweden, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
	   No. 7 seed Karol Kucera was also pushed to three sets, before a
sparkling third set display against France's Fabrice Santoro.
	   The Slovak player eventually won 6-2, 3-6, 6-0.

Lebanese Cabinet approves bill to fight corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Corruption in Lebanon is so endemic that
people have long viewed public office as a sure way to make a quick
fortune, but that may be changing.
	   The Lebanese Cabinet took the first step Wednesday by
unanimously approving a draft bill targeting ``illicit wealth''
that threatens to expose bribe-taking officials.
	   ``The fat cats stole and continue to steal the resources of the
country and they must be confronted,'' columnist Faisal Salman
wrote in the leftist As-Safir newspaper last week.
	   The fight against corruption will receive another boost when
President-elect Emile Lahoud, a former army commander with a clean
reputation, takes office Nov. 24.
	   He has pledged to clean up the government ``beginning at the
top.'' Since his election last month, he has been holding
unprecedented meetings with senior public service employees to map
out a plan of action.
	   But many Lebanese are skeptical of the campaign. Critics say the
amended version of the bill before the Cabinet would shield
legislators and Cabinet ministers from full scrutiny and dull the
impact of the measure.
	   The proposal still needs to be approved by Parliament and it is
not clear if the legislature will further amend the bill.
	   Even if it is passed, many Lebanese fear it may go the way of
the 1953 anti-corruption law, which was never enforced.
	   Most Lebanese are resigned to paying bribes to cut through red
tape and get things done.
	   Bribes are sometimes paid to settle construction violations, to
lower tax assessments of property values or to cut customs duties.
	   Under the proposal, senior public servants must declare their
financial assets and are liable for prosecution for wrongdoing in
the 15 years prior to the proposal's adoption.
	   Corrupt employees would be fined and their property confiscated
but they would escape criminal charges.

Pinochet crimes too great for immunity, lawyers say

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Citing trials this century of German Nazis,
Bosnian Serbs and Rwandan Hutus for genocide and war crimes,
lawyers argued Wednesday in Britain's highest court that former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet must meet the same legal
fate.
	   ``International law now recognizes a category of international
crimes,'' said Alun Jones, the lawyer representing a Spanish
magistrate seeking Pinochet's extradition, along with the Spanish
government and British prosecutors.
	   Jones spoke on the first day of an appeal before Parliament's
House of Lords against a High Court decision that British
authorities acted illegally Oct. 16 in arresting Pinochet on a
Spanish warrant.
	   The High Court held last week that, as a foreign former head of
state, the 82-year-old general has immunity from prosecution.
	   The present Chilean government says some 3,000 political
opponents were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year-old
rule, which began with the violent overthrow of a leftist
government in a 1973 military coup.
	   In a key development for prosecutors, the five judges _ sitting
in a committee room packed with reporters and bewigged lawyers _
overruled objections from Pinochet's lawyers and said they would
hear arguments on legal points not raised at the initial hearing.
	   The new arguments include whether Pinochet was legally head of
state during the first violent hours after the coup and whether
developments in international law mean that Britain has a duty to
hand over a person accused of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   ``We could try a Vietnamese for torturing a Cambodian 20 years
ago, once he is here,'' Jones said.
	   The senior judge, Lord Justice Gordon Slynn of Hadley,
interjected that whether international law has evolved to make
Pincohet's arrest lawful ``seems to me to be one of the principal
questions we have to decide.''
	   Outside Parliament, some 20 demonstrators stood throughout the
day-long hearing, clustered around a big banner saying ``Wanted:
Augusto Pinochet.''
	   Pinochet, recovering from Oct. 9 back surgery, remained under
police guard at a north London hospital.
	   In addition to Spain, six other European countries have
extradition proceedings under way, but those likely would become
irrelevant if the Lords free him.
	   If they uphold his arrest after the hearing, which is expected
to continue into next week, a legal battle looms in British courts
over extradition.
	   Whatever happens, Pinochet's troubles in London appeared to have
finally ended his political career in Chile.
	   The Chilean government on Wednesday said that upon returning
home, he should quit politics totally and ask for forgiveness.
	   ``General Pinochet would do a great favor to his country by
leaving political activity and assuming responsibility and somehow
asking for pardon for the abuses,'' Interior Minister Raul Troncoso
said.
	   Troncoso also backed a proposal by political parties supporting
President Eduardo Frei to set up a commission to try to determine
what happened to some 1,000 people still unaccounted for under
Pinochet's rule.
	   The parties also want a legal panel to examine the possibility
of Pinochet standing trial in Chile.
	   As a senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, Pinochet has
so far had immunity from prosecution there.

International center opens to keep track of Russia's nukes

<TEXT>
	   OBNINSK, Russia (AP) _ To keep Russia's nuclear material from
disappearing abroad, Russian, European and American partners opened
a center Wednesday that better tracks the government's stockpiles
of uranium and plutonium.
	   In theory, scientists say, keeping track of the nuclear material
should be as easy as running a supermarket: Stock up with goods,
slap a bar code on each product, and always make sure the balance
sheet adds up.
	   ``We're not inventing anything new here,'' said Marc Cuypers,
the deputy director of the European Commission's Institute for
Systems, Information and Safety. ``It's a lot like a supermarket,
except that our material happens to be extremely dangerous.''
	   The Russian Methodological and Training Center, a joint project
between Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, the U.S. Department of
Energy and the European Commission, is located in Russia's nuclear
heartland, the site of the world's first nuclear power plant.
	   The project got under way in 1995, when Russia was rife with
reports of smuggling of uranium and plutonium after the weakening
of safeguards with the fall of the Soviet Union, and the government
didn't know how much nuclear material it had.
	   Russian officials insist that weapons-grade nuclear material has
never been stolen or sold, but admit there were at least 30 thefts
of radioactive substances in 1992-1995.
	   ``Our borders have become for all practical purposes
transparent,'' Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, Yevgeny Adamov,
said Wednesday. ``The weakening of our ability to manage nuclear
material has been immeasurable.''
	   By introducing the center, Russian leaders hope to create ``a
radical break in technology, a change to modern means'' that will
close those borders to illegal and dangerous trade, Adamov said.
	   The facility trains specialists to accurately measure, to a 0.1
percent margin of error, the weight, chemical content, and isotope
levels of a hunk of plutonium or uranium.
	   They must learn how to keep track of it, protect it and _ here's
the supermarket part _ how to use computers that assign each piece
a bar code.
	   Participants say the center, and possible facilities like it in
the future, will improve Russia's system of accounting for nuclear
material to international standards, so it can keep track of every
gram of plutonium and uranium as it disarms its warheads.
	   It is unclear, however, when Russia will actually be able to use
the specialists it trains at the center. Russia's parliament still
has not passed legislation requiring nuclear stockpiles to be
looked after with the rigid standards of the West.
	   Still, participants hope that through international cooperation,
the center will eventually get rid of Russia's old way of keeping
track of nuclear material _ secret cities, armed guards, and little
discourse with the West.
	   Russia must be able to ``assure the general public shown
material is accounted for and controlled,'' said Gordon Adam, a
member of the European Parliament and vice president of its
commission on energy. ``The center can only succeed (if) the
countries included ruthlessly pick the brains of the others.''

Citibank announces major Dublin expansion of European operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Citibank Corp. of America announced
Wednesday it plans to more than double its already substantial
operations in Ireland.
	   The banking giant, which opened a European service center in
Dublin in 1996 that already employs about 1,000 people, said it
plans to hire an additional 1,300 people within the next three
years for its European Processing and Servicing Center.
	   A statement by Ireland's Industrial Development Agency said the
expansion would make Citibank's operations ``the largest
back-office and shared-services operation in Ireland.''
	   Citibank is building a new 270,000-square-foot
(25,083-square-meter) Dublin headquarters in the capital's
International Financial Services Center. The ever-expanding complex
on the banks of the River Liffey has become a major European venue
for offshore banking and financial management in recent years,
buoyed by a special 10 percent rate in corporation tax.
	   Citibank's chief country officer in Ireland, Aidan Brady, said
the move was part of the bank's strategy to concentrate operations
``into hubs, or single sites, where administration, data
processing, software services, customer support or teleservices can
be provided across wider geographies.''

IMF criticizes Ukraine's proposal to print money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund objected
Wednesday to a Ukrainian government proposal to print money to help
solve its critical debt problems.
	   The top International Monetary Fund negotiator in talks with
Ukraine, John Odling-Smee, said after a meeting with President
Leonid Kuchma that the issue was not raised during the talks, but
voiced hope that the government would not resort to money
emissions, which usually lead to high inflation.
	   The IMF mission is in Kiev to tackle Ukraine's growing economic
problems, including a backlog in wage and pension payments and poor
tax collection.
	   The delegation's arrival followed last week's release of dlrs 78
million in credits for Ukraine, the second tranche of a dlrs 2.2
billion loan approved last September.
	   The former Soviet republic's government badly needs foreign aid
to cover the mounting foreign debt and to support its finances,
which were hit by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   However, the government is not allowed by the IMF to spend its
reserves to pay off the debt, and has to stick to the fund's
requirements to qualify for next tranches of the badly needed loan.
	   In desperate search for extra revenues needed to maintain the
required budget deficit _ another key IMF requirement _ senior
government officials said this week that Ukraine would ask the IMF
to allow a limited money emission to pay off some overdue wages and
pensions.
	   However, Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko said Wednesday the
government so far has not approached the visiting IMF team with the
issue.
	   But he added that the requirements Ukraine has to meet under its
loan deal with the IMF ``do not fully correspond to the situation
in the country.''
	   Tyhypko's comments echoed earlier statements by Ukraine's
leaders that they want the fund to soften its lending conditions,
namely those concerning tax collection and social welfare payments.
	   The Ukrainian government is owed more than 8 billion hryvna
(dlrs 2.3 billion) in unpaid taxes, while wage and pension debts
have been steadily rising for years and have reached 6.5 billion
hryvna (dlrs 1.91 billion).
	   Tyhypko said the visiting IMF team has not yet made its
conclusion on releasing a new tranche of the loan, but noted that
fund officials recognized Ukraine's progress ``in certain
aspects,'' the UNIAN news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, central bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said the IMF
mission, which on Wednesday finished monitoring his agency's
performance, was fully satisfied.
	   Yushchenko said the central bank would continue working with the
IMF to jointly develop a set of monetary policies to maintain
stability in the financial markets until the end of the year.

Former separatist leader killed in India's Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen forced their way into
the home of a former separatist leader Wednesday in India's
troubled Jammu-Kashmir province, killing him and a niece and
injuring two other people.
	   The attackers sprayed bullets throughout the home of Ghulam
Quadir Wani, 48, killing him, and seriously injuring a 12-year-old
niece, Rehana Nazeer, who later died in the hospital, police said.
	   The attack in Arin Bandipura village, 70 kilometers (45 miles)
north of the state's summer capital of Srinagar, also seriously
injured Wani's 22-year-old daughter and a maid. His wife and
parents escaped.
	   Hundreds of villagers gathered in the darkness outside the
village police station to mourn Wani, where officials kept his
body.
	   Wani was for several years at the forefront of the separatist
Muslim rebellion in the state which began in 1989.
	   His Muslim United Front took part in the 1987 provincial
elections but lost to an alliance of the current ruling National
Conference and India's main opposition Congress Party. The
separatists alleged the elections had been rigged, and gradually
took to arms.
	   Wani joined the prominent guerrilla group Jammu Kashmir
Liberation Front in 1990. In 1994, he crossed the border to
Pakistan and stayed there for three years before returning to his
village last year, police said.
	   India accuses neighboring Pakistan of fomenting the nine-year
insurgency. Islamabad says it provides only ideological support.

term &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ The upper house of parliament has
approved an amendment to the constitution that would allow
President Sam Nujoma to stand for a third term in office.
	   Lawmakers of the ruling South West Africa People's Organization,
or SWAPO, approved the amendment by 50 votes to 15 from members of
opposition parties on Tuesday.
	   The matter will next be considered by parliament's lower house,
the National Council.
	   Critics charge the amendment threatens to undermine democracy in
Namibia.
	   ``This is not only a very serious blow to democracy, but also to
the rule of law in Namibia,'' said Phil ya Nangolo, director of the
National Society of Human Rights. ``What we have now is a
dictatorship, still barely in disguise, but not for long.''
	   Presidential elections are to be held toward the end of 1999 _
Namibia's third general election since independence in 1990.

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas ambushed
two cars, riddling them with gunfire and wounding three Serbs, Serb
police said Wednesday _ a harsh reminder that despite a cease-fire,
the violence in Kosovo is far from over.
	   Although heavy fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas has stopped and many refugees are returning to their
villages from the woods, isolated attacks continue in the southern
Serbian province, and tensions remain high.
	   The attack Tuesday evening on two vehicles from the Belacevac
coal mine set off an hour-long gunbattle between ethnic Albanian
guerrillas and Serb police, said police at a checkpoint near
Sipitula, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of the Kosovo
capital, Pristina.
	   Three miners were wounded, two of them seriously, and were taken
to a Pristina hospital, police said. The two bullet-riddled cars
were still sitting at the checkpoint Wednesday, a pool of blood
congealing beside them. Dozens of spent shell casings littered the
road.
	   Residents of Sipitula said Serb police began shooting at the
village at about the same time police said the gunfight began. The
villagers said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or
with friends and relatives.
	   Police gave few details of the ambush on the two cars, one of
which bore the logo of the mining company on its door.
	   However, a mine security guard, Blagoje Ristic, said Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas have ambushed vehicles along the same
stretch of road twice previously and KLA snipers hide in abandoned
houses in the area. ``The people are afraid to go to work,'' he
said.
	   The few villagers who returned Wednesday to assess the situation
in Sipitula said Serb police were continuing to harass them.
	   ``They are playing this game and aren't withdrawing their
forces,'' complained Fatme Mjeku, who said he and his neighbors
often hide in surrounding woods at night because of police gunfire.
	   ``This happens frequently,'' said 59-year-old Hilmi Mjekiqi,
adding that police burned a school building in the village on
Friday.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes on Serb and Yugoslav forces to pressure Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to agree Oct. 12 to halt a seven-month
crackdown on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1.
	   Under the agreement, Serb police and Yugoslav army forces in
Kosovo must be reduced to levels before the offensive and refugees
must be allowed to return to their homes.
	   The agreement also calls for international agencies to move
freely in Kosovo.
	   While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they have
grudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise their
goal of independence.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
left homeless in the Serb authorities' crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour
said the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has U.N. authority to
investigate war crimes in any part of Yugoslavia. She was
responding to assertions by Yugoslav government officials that
Kosovo is off limits to tribunal investigations.

IRA prisoner convicted of bombing British cavalry released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The man convicted of one of the
IRA's most notorious bombings was freed Wednesday as part of
Northern Ireland's peace accord.
	   Danny McNamee had completed 12 years of a 25-year sentence after
being convicted of making a car bomb detonated in London's Hyde
Park in 1982 that killed four members of the British army's Blues
and Royal ceremonial cavalry, along with seven of their horses.
	   Seventeen onlookers were wounded.
	   Although described in his 1987 trial as the Irish Republican
Army's top explosives engineer, McNamee had always protested he did
not make the bomb.
	   Two hours after the Hyde Park explosion, a second bomb in nearby
Regents Park claimed the lives of six musicians from the Royal
Green Jackets regiment, one of whom was impaled on park railings.
McNamee was not charged in connection with that bombing.
	   Since being transferred to Northern Ireland's Maze prison from
England last year, McNamee, 37, had chosen to stay in the section
of the Maze reserved for IRA inmates. But he always maintained that
a single fingerprint used to convict him was faked, and an appeal
of his conviction is due to go ahead next month.
	   More than 200 convicted members of the IRA and outlawed
pro-British groups have been freed early from prisons in
British-ruled Northern Ireland under terms of April's peace accord.
About another 150 prisoners are eligible for early parole by
mid-2000.
	   After the Hyde Park explosion, the British tabloids turned
Sefton, the most seriously wounded of the nine surviving horses,
into a national hero. The horse's jugular vein had been severed by
shrapnel, but he survived as the regiment's mascot, dying of old
age in 1994.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Thousands of miners demonstrated across
Ukraine on Wednesday, demanding long-overdue salaries and more
government support for the struggling coal industry.
	   In the capital Kiev, thousands of miners in dirty work clothes
and helmets marched down the central Khreshchatyk street, carrying
a makeshift coffin with pieces of coal inside and the words ``Coal
Industry'' written on it.
	   The miners then rallied near parliament and government
headquarters while Communist and nationalist lawmakers who came out
to greet them argued over who is to blame for the industry's woes.
	   Ukraine's coal industry long has been plagued by accidents,
inefficiency and lack of reforms. The government has failed to
close many non-profitable mines but at the same time had no cash to
provide enough subsidies to keep the industry afloat.
	   Wednesday's one-day warning strike drew more than 10,000 miners
throughout Ukraine, the national Miners' Union said.
	   The protest was declared by four miners' unions who said in an
October appeal to workers that miners ``have become hostages to the
thoughtless and criminal policy of the authorities.''
	   ``Miners work for half a year and even more without being paid
for their hard work, and some of them receive their back wages
posthumously,'' the appeal said.
	   Organizers had hoped for the strike to involve 163 out of
Ukraine's 210 coal mines, but it was not immediately clear how many
mines actually went on strike.
	   About 5,000 miners rallied in the eastern coal capital of
Donetsk and hundreds besieged the regional administration
headquarters in the western city of Lviv, banging their helmets on
the pavement in protest.

Siemens earnings wiped out by restructuring costs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to CLARIFY that company still had a net profit despite
extraordinary losses. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Industrial giant Siemens said Wednesday
that a major overhaul of its business cost 4 billion marks (dlrs
2.4 billion) in the financial year ended Sept. 30, causing 1.74
billion marks (dlrs 1.04 billion) more of extraordinary losses than
extraordinary gains.
	   Consequently, Siemens said it had an adjusted net profit of 92
million marks (dlrs 55.4 million), with an unadjusted net profit of
2.66 billion marks (dlrs 1.6 billion). The unadjusted net profit
was a 2 percent increase over last year's 2.61 billion marks (dlrs
1.63 billion).
	   Sales were 117.8 billion marks (dlrs 73.6 billion) compared with
106.9 billion marks (dlrs 66.8 billion ) last year, an increase of
10 percent.
	   But the company said a restructuring plan announced last summer
wiped out much of the gains.
	   The poor performance had been expected. Company chairman
Heinrich von Pierer earlier predicted ``entirely unsatisfactory
results'' for the fiscal year.
	   A risk provision of 900 million marks (dlrs 562 million) because
of economic turmoil in Asian and Russia also dented earnings, the
company said.
	   Von Pierer said Siemens would ``noticeably strengthen itself as
an enterprise'' by cutting less profitable operations.
	   The company said it planned to spin off operations worth about
17 billion marks (dlrs 10.6 billion) in sales.
	   So far, it has sold its rail systems unit, with sales of 90
million marks (dlrs 54 million). It will also sell its copper
communications cable division.
	   Siemens said it planned to list its loss-making semiconductor
unit but didn't say when. The unit made a pretax loss of 1.2
billion marks (dlrs 750 million), compared to a pretax profit last
year of 109 million marks (dlrs 68 million.)
	   Siemens recently closed a semiconductor plant in Britain.
	   The company employed 416,000 people globally over the last year,
but the number of employees in Germany shrank by 3,000 to 194,000.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians burned American flags and chanted
``Death to America'' Wednesday, but the rally marking Iran's
seizure of the U.S. Embassy lacked the revolutionary fervor that
spawned the takeover 19 years ago.
	   About 20,000 people _ mostly school children and high school
students given a day off for the rally _ gathered outside the
former U.S. Embassy for the annual demonstration.
	   The atmosphere among participants, most born since the takeover,
was like a carnival _ gone was the anger and zeal that drove
Islamic students to seize the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, and hold 52
Americans hostage for 444 days.
	   Anti-American sentiment has been a cornerstone of Iranian
policy. But the rhetoric has been losing edge since the election
last year of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who has
encouraged ties with Americans.
	   Most demonstrators responded sporadically and indifferently to
calls of ``Death to America!'' from a speaker directing the show
from behind a microphone on a platform. Calls for ``Death to
Israel!'' got a more enthusiastic response instead.
	   Thousands of colorful fliers denouncing America and Israel were
thrown into the air like confetti and children waved balloons
printed with calls for Israel's destruction.
	   A few listened as Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-line leader and former
army commander, criticized efforts to re-establish ties with the
United States.
	   He said Iran should consider opening a dialogue with the U.S.
government only when its president publicly apologizes to Iran.
	   U.S. officials, who have long accused Iran of supporting
terrorism, softened their stand after Khatami's victory and
suggested a dialogue could be started. But the Clinton
administration says relations can't significantly improve until
Tehran cuts ties to terrorists and drops opposition to the Middle
East peace process.
	   Amir Khojasteh, a 25-year-old demonstrator, said he favored ties
with the United States as long as ``we stand beside them, not
behind them.''
	   Ahmad Reza Mahdavi, a 17-year-old student wearing a T-shirt with
a picture of Titanic movie star Leonard DiCaprio, said he harbored
no hatred against the United States.
	   ``I don't dislike America too much, but we must accept that the
American government is not fair to Iran,'' said Mahdavi.
	   Seyed Morteza Sahebi, 55, who was with the mob that stormed the
embassy in 1979, said he still felt the same anger about the United
States.
	   The takeover of the embassy was a turning point in the 1979
Islamic Revolution that overthrew the pro-U.S. shah's regime and
installed the Shiite clerical government.
	   Few in Iran will publicly criticize the seizure. Khatami
defended it Wednesday.
	   The occupation was ``a kind of protest to a series of policies
which had culminated in the violation of Iran's national rights and
sovereignty,'' Khatami told students during a tour of a girls'
school in Tehran.
	   In schools throughout Iran, bells were rung to mark the
anniversary, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   But in a sign of changing attitudes, the student leaders who
overran the embassy on Monday invited their former hostages to
return to Iran as their guests. At least two former hostages said
they may return.
	   Outside the former U.S. Embassy, demonstrators said it was
necessary to participate in the rally.
	   ``We are here to keep alive the memory of that day 19 years
ago,'' said Ayat Nojavan, a 37-year-old government employee.
	   However, he disagreed with the burning of the American flag.
``We would be hurt if they burned our flag.''

 &UR; Bill considered to allow Namibian president to stand for third term

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ The upper house of parliament has
approved an amendment to the constitution that would allow
President Sam Nujoma to stand for a third term in office.
	   Lawmakers of the ruling South West Africa People's Organization,
or SWAPO, approved the amendment by 50 votes to 15 from members of
opposition parties on Tuesday.
	   The matter will next be considered by parliament's lower house,
the National Council.
	   Critics charge the amendment threatens to undermine democracy in
Namibia.
	   ``This is not only a very serious blow to democracy, but also to
the rule of law in Namibia,'' said Phil ya Nangolo, director of the
National Society of Human Rights. ``What we have now is a
dictatorship, still barely in disguise, but not for long.''
	   Presidential elections are to be held toward the end of 1999 _
Namibia's third general election since independence in 1990.

European defense ministers discuss lessening reliance on NATO

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European defense ministers said Wednesday
they need to improve their military capability so they can react
swiftly to crises like Kosovo without having to rely on U.S.-led
NATO.
	   At a one-day conference, ministers from the 15-nation European
Union said muscle is needed to lend more clout to diplomacy in the
Balkans and other European hot spots.
	   Several denied any intention to eventually challenge the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization as the continent's main military
power.
	   ``We don't intend to undermine NATO, or to duplicate it, because
NATO exists and is a cornerstone, the foundation stone of the
European state,'' British Defense Minister George Robertson told
reporters. ``Nor is there any appetite for a single European army.
	   ``But there is a desire to make sure that Europe can be what it
wants to be: effective, efficient and able to deal with the sort of
crises that can come in the future.''
	   The problems and delays in trying to quash conflicts in Bosnia
and Kosovo clearly were on the ministers' minds.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said last month that the EU
needs ``fresh thinking'' about developing a defense capability.
	   Unifying and upgrading the European military would be a natural
step after the adoption of a single currency in January, some said.
	   ``No one denies the importance of the trans-Atlantic link for
our security,'' said French Defense Minister Alain Richard. ``But
neither does anyone doubt that Europe, with a single currency,
cannot for long make do without a real dimension of defense and
security.''
	   On the latest Iraqi crisis, Robertson said the ministers had
``one voice'' in demanding that Baghdad resume cooperating with
weapons inspectors.
	   ``There is one signal to Baghdad: that compliance with the U.N.
is the only alternative for Saddam Hussein at this time,''
Robertson told reporters.
	   Failing full compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions,
``then Saddam must face the consequences,'' he said.
	   Iraq announced Saturday that it was suspending cooperation with
weapons inspectors, citing the refusal of the United Nations to
lift sanctions imposed Iraq's 1990 invasion in Kuwait. The
sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq has
destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and other hard-liners in the Russian
parliament sought an official report on Boris Yeltsin's health
while the president continued to recuperate at a Black Sea resort
Wednesday.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, asked the presidential
doctors to give a detailed account of Yeltsin's condition. The
lawmakers are expected to follow up Thursday, when they consider a
bill that would require the president to undergo a medical exam,
with the results passed on to parliament.
	   However, the bill faces an uphill battle because Yeltsin would
have to approve it before it becomes law, and he's almost certain
to veto the measure.
	   Yeltsin has ignored opposition attacks and insisted he will
serve out his term that lasts until the middle of the year 2000.
The president and his doctors say he has no serious health
problems, and his current ailment is described as fatigue and
high-blood pressure.
	   Coincidentally, Russian television is scheduled to air a
documentary Thursday called ``Yeltsin's Heart,'' about the
quintuple bypass surgery the president underwent two years ago. The
documentary will remind Russians that the president was already
quite sick during the 1996 presidential election, a fact that was
carefully hidden from the public.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, Yeltsin's opponent in that
campaign, has insisted insisted that a medical inspection would
reveal that the president is now incapable of performing his
duties.
	   Zyuganov has spoken about Yeltsin's drinking habits in extremely
blunt language in the last few days, and he kept up his attacks
Wednesday.
	   ``You would consider me mad if I suggest that you board a plane
with a drunk and incapacitated first pilot,'' Zyuganov said at a
news conference on Wednesday. ``I feel pity for him (Yeltsin), he
destroyed his health with his own hands.''
	   Yeltsin has denied opposition claims that he has a drinking
problem.
	   Meanwhile, presidential aide Oleg Sysuyev said on Wednesday that
Yeltsin would outline his ``new political role'' in an address to
the parliament early next year.
	   Sysuyev, who was in France, reiterated that the president would
concentrate on political issues and allow his Cabinet to deal with
economic matters, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Kremlin also said Wednesday that Yeltsin is still scheduled
to meet next week with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and the
following week with new German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

Magistrate drops most charges against suspect in Rwandan's slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Wednesday dropped three of
the five charges against a suspect in the May murder of a Rwandan
opposition leader and his driver.
	   Jesse Lesiit said there was insufficient evidence to support
weapons and conspiracy charges against David Akiki Kiwanuka.
Prosecutors had accused Kiwanuka of conspiring with two other
suspects to murder former Rwandan Interior Minister Seth
Sendashonga and possessing a pistol and 26 rounds of ammunition
without a license.
	   Still, Kiwanuka and his co-defendants, Kenyan Charles Muhanji
Wamuthoni and Ugandan Christopher Lubanga Mlondo, were ordered to
appear in court Nov. 13 to hear whether they will be handed over to
the high court to stand trial for the May 16 murders.
	   The suspects have been held without bail since a week after the
murder.
	   Sendashonga had been living in exile in Kenya after being
dismissed from the Rwandan government in August 1995.
	   Sendashonga, a Hutu, was a member of the predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front that ousted a Hutu extremist government in
Rwanda following the 1994 genocide of at least 500,000 people,
mostly minority Tutsis.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts after they protested the reprisal
killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.

Strike closes famed monument for fifth full day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A strike locked visitors out of the Eiffel Tower
for a fifth full day Wednesday and promised to keep Paris' most
visited monument closed for a sixth day, despite two hours of
talks.
	   The negotiations ``didn't go too badly,'' the press office of
the company that runs the Eiffel Tower said. But new, minor points
of contention were raised, it added, without providing details.
	   The 200 workers employed at the Eiffel Tower are demanding more
personnel, rejecting as insufficient the recent hiring of 20
people, with plans to recruit five more workers at the start of the
year.
	   In the Wednesday talks, the Societe Nouvelle d'Exploitation de
la Tour Eiffel, which runs the Eiffel Tower, modified its plan,
saying the five others would be hired starting Dec. 19.
	   But workers are now ``demanding new adjustments on minor
organizational points which were not part of the negotiations,''
the press office said.
	   The strike is costing the Eiffel Tower some 300,000 francs (dlrs
55,000) per day. They note that November is a slack period for
tourists. Some 310,000 people visited the Eiffel Tower in November
1997, compared to 850,000 visitors in August.

Chancellor acknowledges central bank's independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ After cranking up pressure on the
German central bank to cut interest rates last weekend, new
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday insisted his government
respected the bank's independence.
	   ``The Bundesbank, and in a few months the ECB, are the only ones
who will set interest rates,'' Schroeder said following a meeting
with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok.
	   ``We respect that the Bundesbank and the ECB are fully
independent,'' he added. The ECB, or European Central Bank, will
set monetary policy for countries taking part in Europe's single
currency, the euro, which will be launched Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, holds its
regular monthly policymaking meeting Thursday and is widely
expected to hold rates steady.
	   On Sunday, Schroeder said that job creation is just as important
as fighting inflation when setting monetary policy. German
unemployment is stuck above 10 percent.
	   Schroeder and his new Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine have
been turning up the pressure on the fiercely-independent central
bank to cut rates since they came to power following Germany's
Sept. 27 general elections.
	   At a press conference, Schroeder and Kok said their two
countries already enjoy close cooperation, which will be further
intensified when the euro is launched.
	   Schroeder also praised the Dutch ``polder model,'' under which
the government, employers and labor unions strive to reach
consensus on job creation, keeping the lid on salary rises and
maintaining economic growth.
	   ``We can't copy it because the economic structures are different
in Germany, but we can study it and take what fits,'' Schroeder
said.
	   Schroeder's one-day visit came amid Dutch fears that his new
center-left government will abandon the stringent budget policies
that marked Helmut Kohl's 16-year reign.
	   Last week, Dutch Liberal Party leader Hans Dijkstal voiced his
concerns that Lafontaine will allow Germany's budget deficit and
total debt to run up.
	   Dijkstal, whose right-of-center Liberals are the No. 2 party in
the Dutch coalition government, warned that the Netherlands is
highly dependent on financial and economic policies in Germany, the
country's largest trading partner.
	   But Schroeder reassured the Dutch that his government is
committed to economic stability.
	   Schroeder's meeting with Kok also coincided with the visit of
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin although the French and German
leaders did not meet in The Hague.

Castro opponents to seek genocide probe in Spain against Cuban
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Cuban exile group opposed to Fidel Castro
said Wednesday it will ask a Spanish court to investigate whether
the Cuban leader can be charged in Spain with genocide and other
crimes.
	   The Miami-based group, called the Foundation for Human Rights,
said it was inspired by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's action
against Augusto Pinochet.
	   Garzon made headlines around the world last month by having
Pinochet arrested in London and trying to get the former Chilean
dictator extradited for trial in Spain on genocide, torture and
terrorism charges. That case is pending in Britain's House of
Lords.
	   ``Our position is that if Pinochet committed crimes during 17
years of dictatorship, then Fidel Castro certainly deserves public
scrutiny for his crimes during 40 years,'' Mariella Ferretti, a
spokeswoman for the Foundation, said in a telephone interview from
Miami.
	   Spanish lawyers handling the case for the foundation said they
would submit papers to the National Court Thursday asking it to
open a probe into whether Castro, who seized power in 1959, and
other officials of his communist government can be charged with
genocide, terrorism and crimes against the state.
	   It was the National Court that ruled last week that Spanish
courts have jurisdiction to prosecute human rights crimes committed
off Spanish soil, like those cited against Pinochet, who ruled from
1973 to 1990.
	   A Chilean government-sponsored report issued in 1991 says more
than 3,000 people died under Pinochet as his regime tried to crush
a perceived communist threat.
	   Under Spanish law, when petitioned as expected Thursday, the
National Court assigns an investigating magistrate _ like Garzon _
to the case. This usually takes two to five days, lawyers said.
	   That judge then decides, on the basis of evidence provided by
the plaintiff, whether there are grounds for a formal probe, said
Javier Barrilero, one of the Spanish attorneys involved in the
Castro case.
	   Once a judge gets such a file, he usually acts quickly.
``Theoretically it should take a week or 10 days,'' Barrilero told
The Associated Press.
	   He said the judge in the Castro case might end up being Garzon.
	   Barrilero said the papers he will file include testimony from
more than 100 Cubans who suffered torture or other abuses by
Castro's government or are relatives of people who died in Cuban
jails, while in police custody or were executed.
	   Among other cases cited is an incident in July 1994 in which a
Cuban Coast Guard vessel allegedly rammed a tug boat full of Cubans
trying to flee the island. A report issued three years later by
Amnesty International says 42 people drowned, 23 of them children.
	   Barrilero said Castro should be charged with genocide because he
has made a systematic attempt to eliminate entire groups of people,
for religious and particularly political reasons.
	   ``Being against the regime is reason enough for extermination,''
Barrilero said.
	   The Foundation for Human Rights is part of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a Miami-based group vehemently opposed to
Castro. It is well funded by Cuban exiles living in Florida and
politically influential both in that state and in Washington.

U.N.: Poverty and nature equally to blame for Mitch devastation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Poverty and nature are equally to blame
for the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch's rampage through
Central America, the administrator of the United Nations
Development Program said Wednesday.
	   ``Hurricanes, torrential rains and mudslides are familiar
occurrences in this part of the world, but when they strike poor
communities they can be devastating,'' James Gustave Speth said in
a statement.
	   ``Generations of poverty and deforestation for fuel and farms
have exposed vast areas of Central America to erosion and
washways,'' he said.
	   These barren hillsides most vulnerable to killer storms are the
only place where thousands of families in Honduras, Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala can farm and build homes, Speth said.
	   Mitch washed away hillside farms, villages and homes, burying
many in fields of mud.
	   Central Americans were still strugging Wednesday to reach
thousands of people stranded almost a week after the hurricane
pounded the region with wind gusts up to 180 mph (290 kph), and
killing an estimated 9,000 people in the region, most in Honduras.
	   An estimated 2.5 million people have been affected by Mitch's
deadly sweep across Central America, the U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva said Tuesday.
	   Governments in the region have appealed for assistance and so
far dlrs 5.5 million has been channeled to the devastated
countries, said the U.N. office, which is trying to mobilize
international aid.
	   So far, money has come from the International Red Cross, the
Interamerican Development Bank, France, Mexico, the Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Britain and the United States, it said.
	   The United States responded to a separate appeal from the U.N.
office for rescue boats and helicopters to reach isolated areas and
donated dlrs 750,000 for helicopter flights in addition to making
transport available for relief supplies and search and rescue
operations. France was also sending a 20-member civilian rescue
team to the region, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   To support relief efforts, Speth said he ordered that more than
dlrs 100 million be diverted from UNDP poverty eradication projects
in Honduras.
	   In Rome, the World Food Program announced it will step up
emergency food deliveries to Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala. In Washington, the Pan American Health Organization
issued an urgent appeal for medical assistance for hurricane
victims.
	   The U.N. coordinating office is expected to send up to 55 tons
of relief supplies to the region Friday from its base in Pisa,
Italy, Eckhard said.
	   UNDP's resident representative in Honduras, Zoraida Mesa, said
the country had lost its banana export crop although the coffee
crop might be rescued if harvested within the month.
	   ``The social impact of this calamity may be felt for years,''
Mesa said. ``The education system was precarious before the
hurricane, but now with schools destroyed, damaged or closed, who
knows when the children will be able to return.''
	   The Central Bank estimated that per capita income in Honduras
this year will fall by 8 percent as a direct result of Mitch, ``an
enormous loss'' for a country where real per capital income was
less than dlrs 2,000 a year in 1995, UNDP said.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Inter Milan's Diego Simeone scored on a
free kick in the 89th minute to tie Spartak Moscow 1-1 in a Group C
Champions League fourth-rotation match Wednesday.
	   Before a record crowd of 83,000 at Luzhniki Stadium, Spartak
took a 1-0 lead in the 68th minute on a shot from 10 meters (yards)
by Andrei Tikhonov that went in off the post and got behind Inter
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Ronaldo, who had played in only two matches this season as he
nurses tendinitis in both knees, started but was substituted for in
the 66th minute.
	   Both clubs have seven points in four games to lead the group,
pending Sturm Graz-Real Madrid's game Thursday. That match was
rained out Wednesday. Real Madrid has six points and the Austrians
have lost all three.
	   ``This game gave us a chance to hope for better future,'' said
Inter coach Luigi Simeone, whose job is on the line after a poor
start. ``Spartak showed a perfect game, but Inter found a chance to
tie.''

Thousands take to streets over disallowed goal

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) - More than 10,000 furious fans Wednesday
waved giant banners, stomped to trumpet music and even roared
threats against Premier Costas Simitis - all because of a goal
disallowed at a soccer game.
	   Supporters of Salonica's PAOK soccer team gathered on the
streets of this northern port city after a game against Olympiakos
Piraeus was called off Saturday.
	   The match was stopped after PAOK fans invaded the pitch and
clashed with police when the referee canceled a goal by the hosts
with eight minutes left in the game. Olympiakos was leading 2-1 at
the time.
	   An assistant referee was hit in the head and hospitalized with
concussion. Three policemen and eight civilians were also injured
in the clashes.
	   Sixteen fans, arrested during the incidents were sentenced to
suspended prison terms ranging from eight to 26 months.
	   The rowdy but peaceful rally, was joined by people from across
northern Greece.
	   The demonstrators chanted slogans against the Greek Soccer
Federation and threatened never to vote for Premier Costas Simitis.
	   PAOK is demanding a rematch and the suspension of the game's
referee, Yiannis Papapetrou. It also wants an investigation into
allesged ``soccer corruption.''

Dutch support widens for euthanasia, assisted suicide

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch approval of euthanasia and
assisted suicide has widened to 92 percent, but that broad support
hinges on doctors' strict adherence to mercy killing guidelines, a
study released Wednesday found.
	   In this country known for its permissive euthanasia policy, only
8 percent of those surveyed by the NIPO polling agency said they
oppose the practice.
	   The telephone survey of 1,201 people aged 18 and older was
commissioned by the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society. No margin
of error was given.
	   In a similar study conducted two years ago, approval of
euthanasia was pegged at 80 percent. Ditte Papousek, a spokeswoman
for the euthanasia society, declined to speculate about the reasons
behind the rise.
	   Overwhelming support also was registered among Roman Catholics
surveyed in the poll, with 96 percent backing euthanasia and
assisted suicide, Papousek said.
	   ``This underlines what we see as a trend that people think of
euthanasia as a human right and as a matter of
self-determination,'' she said.
	   The survey was conducted in late March. The euthanasia society
did not say why it waited seven months to publish the findings.

US Defense Secretary in Qatar to discuss standoff with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cohen's meeting with Qatar emir; EDITS to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied
Gulf states Wednesday for support of possible military action
against Iraq but _ at least publicly _ he appeared to be winning
little backing.
	   Cohen arrived in Qatar after visiting Bahrain and Kuwait earlier
Wednesday. U.S. officials and the local governments did not release
any details of his hurriedly-arranged tour that began with Saudi
Arabia late Tuesday.
	   Cohen is expected to spend the night in Qatar and go to Egypt
Thursday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak later in the day.
He is likely to stop briefly in the United Arab Emirates en route
to Egypt.
	   In Qatar, Cohen met with the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa
al-Thani, and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani.
	   They discussed the recent developments in the Iraq-U.N. crisis,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said without elaborating.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Saturday decision to end all
cooperation with U.N. weapons experts. The U.N. Security Council
has condemned the Iraqi decision and is now debating what action to
take.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, more than 20 warships
including the carrier USS Eisenhower, and about 170 warplanes and
helicopters in the Gulf region, according to the Pentagon.
	   But it is not clear whether United States' Gulf allies will
support a military strike.
	   On Tuesday, a Saudi official said King Fahd told the defense
secretary that the kingdom would not be ``a springboard for attacks
on Iraq.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But the Pentagon said Cohen was assured of Saudi backing in the
event of military action against Iraq.
	   During the last standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons
inspectors in February, Kuwait was alone among Arab states in
opening its air bases to American and British warplanes.
	   But on Tuesday night, a spokesman for Kuwait's defense ministry
said the emirate was ``not a party to the dispute between the
United Nations and Iraq and it always strives for peace,'' the
state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   In Kuwait, he met with the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
and in Bahrain, he held talks with crown prince Sheik Hamad bin Isa
Al Khalifa. He did not speak to reporters after the meetings.
	   During the earlier crisis, almost all Arab governments publicly
opposed an attack on Iraq, while U.S. officials maintained they
were privately assured of support.
	   Arab newspapers reported that Cohen was actually told that Arab
leaders would support an attack on Iraq only if it was guaranteed
to remove President Saddam Hussein.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Inter Milan's Diego Simeone scored on a
header off a free kick in the 89th minute to tie Spartak Moscow 1-1
in a Group C Champions League fourth-rotation match Wednesday.
	   Before a record crowd of 83,000 at Luzhniki Stadium, Spartak
took a 1-0 lead in the 68th minute on a shot from 10 meters (yards)
by Andrei Tikhonov that went in off the post and got behind Inter
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Ronaldo, who had played in only two matches this season as he
nurses tendinitis in both knees, started but was substituted for in
the 66th minute.
	   Both clubs have seven points in four games to lead the group,
pending Sturm Graz-Real Madrid's game Thursday. That match was
rained out Wednesday. Real Madrid has six points and the Austrians
have lost all three.
	   ``This game gave us a chance to hope for better future,'' said
Inter coach Luigi Simeone, whose job is on the line after a poor
start. ``Spartak showed a perfect game, but Inter found a chance to
tie.''

Car blows up outside main Kremlin gate

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A car sped onto Red Square on Wednesday and
exploded just outside the main gate to the Kremlin, injuring three
guards and the driver, authorities said. The cause of the blast was
not immediately known.
	   Initial reports said one person was killed inside the car, but a
spokesman for the presidential press service said no one had died.
	   The car exploded shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), a few meters
(yards) outside the Spassky Gate, the main entrance to the Kremlin.
The walled enclosure has been Russia's governmental and spiritual
center for centuries.
	   Clouds of smoke could be seen drifting over St. Basil's
Cathedral, a few meters (yards) away. Officials inside the Kremlin
said they could feel the concussion from the blast.
	   The Kremlin spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the car had driven very fast toward Red Square, past the famous GUM
department store. It knocked down fences, drove across the square
and approached the gate at the foot of Spassky Tower, a large red
clock tower that is one of Russia's most distinctive symbols.
	   The driver, a journalist for a nationalist magazine, jumped out
just before the car, a cheap, Russian-built Moskvich, exploded, the
official said. The blast was reported to have had the force of 6
kilograms (13 pounds) of dynamite.
	   Two Kremlin guards, one presidential guard and the driver were
injured. The gate was also slightly damaged.
	   Russian television showed an unidentified bloodied body lying
near the charred car on the square's stone slope.
	   The driver was identified as Ivan Orlov, a 65-year-old
journalist for the magazine ``Russian Pravda'' from the Moscow
suburb of Podolsk, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He was taken to the hospital to treat minor scratches, where he
was being questioned by police, who said he would undergo a
psychiatric examination, Interfax said. It also quoted police as
saying the driver had a gas pistol in his car.
	   Reporting on the incident was sketchy, and the entire area
surrounding the blast was sealed off to the press and public.
	   The Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the
Soviet KGB, said it was investigating the incident and had not
ruled out terrorism as a motive, Interfax said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has his office at the Kremlin, but has
been in the southern resort city of Sochi recovering from what has
been described as exhaustion.
	   Kremlin officials said the doors to the gate have been closed
for years, and expressed assurance that the car could not have
broken through them.

Extraction force to be ready by the end of November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to add editor's note &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Solana saying emergency plans
to be ready by end of the month. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said Wednesday the alliance's Kosovo extraction force for emergency
evacuation of civilian monitors will be ready to go by the end of
November.
	   The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body made up
of ambassadors from the 16 member nations, approved the ``initial
concept of operations'' for the force and is expected to give its
backing to the final operations plan next week, officials said.
	   The extraction force of allied soldiers will be responsible for
the emergency rescue of civilian ``ground verifiers'' now being
dispatched to Kosovo should they run into unexpected physical
danger.
	   ``I expect to have it ready around the end of the month,''
Solana told reporters. ``Everything is in place now for finalizing
the plan.''
	   As part of the deal struck by U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke
Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, about 2,000
verifiers are being recruited, trained and sent to Kosovo, a
southern province of Serbia, to insure that Milosevic abides by the
agreement. They are under the direction of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   The ground verifiers are being supplemented by surveillance
aircraft.
	   NATO officials said the ceasefire in Kosovo, where hundreds of
people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced in seven
months of conflict between the ruling Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians, seems to be holding.
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population and suffered the most during the fighting. As many as
300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven from their homes by
Serb police and army forces.
	   The NATO ambassadors sent the approved initial concept of
operations back to Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in
Europe, and instructed him to return with an operations plan in the
next few days.
	   NATO officials were reluctant to reveal details, saying only
that the military is looking at ``a reasonable-sized force'' based
close to Kosovo and ``able to react in a matter of minutes.''
	   First choice of location is Macedonia, on Kosovo's southern
border. But Macedonia has just had an election and the NATO
alliance must wait for the new government to be formed before
moving ahead with plans. The old Macedonian government already gave
its approval for NATO to base its air surveillance mission in
Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
	   NATO officials insisted that the extraction force was not aimed
at pulling out the OSCE verifiers but to deal with individuals or
small groups that may find themselves needing special security
help.
	   NATO considers the situation in Kosovo to be stable. Officials
said there have not been any significant skirmishes since Oct. 28,
the date the alliance determined that Milosevic was largely in
compliance with U.N. demands that he end his crackdown on ethnic
Albanians.
	   The alliance is keeping a close eye on the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, which at one point had controlled as much as 40
percent of the province. There have been reports that the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas have put up some checkpoints and have been
digging in new positions in some areas, a NATO official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He said about 200 verifiers are now in place in Kosovo, though
about half of them are personnel from the previous Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, who were already in place.

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Nikola Poplasen, the new
ultranationalist president of the Bosnian Serb substate, was sworn
in Wednesday, while moderate Serbs took key assembly posts.
	   Poplasen, a former paramilitary leader of the Serb Radical
Party, was officially installed at a session of the new parliament,
nearly two months after his election victory over moderate Biljana
Plavsic. While a hard-liner, he promised to honor the Dayton peace
agreement.
	   ``Maintaining peace and the provisions of the Dayton peace
agreement are the necessary framework for the values we have all
agreed upon,'' Poplasen said after the inauguration.
	   He also promised continued economic recovery through
privatization and by attracting foreign investments.
	   ``Donor help and loans to Republika Srpska are of utmost
importance in boosting our economy,'' Poplasen said, referring to
the Bosnian Serb republic. ``Our lasting orientation is certainly
toward reaching agreements with foreign companies and developing
democracy.''
	   Poplasen's Radical Party is allied with the Serb Democratic
Party, the supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   In the September elections, also held for the 83-seat
parliament, 32 seats were won by the Radicals and other hard-liners
and the same number went to a coalition of moderates. The rest are
held by representatives of Croats and Muslims.
	   The resulting impasse between the two Serb camps in parliament
had delayed the vote on anew assembly leadership - the speaker, two
deputies and assembly secretary - which is required before the
president-elect can take office.
	   Muslim and Croat deputies in the assembly eventually ended the
Serb-Serb bickering by endorsing the moderates, which led to the
appointment of Petar Djokic as the speaker, a moderate deputy and a
secretary.
	   Poplasen's next step is to name a premier, a post so far held by
Milorad Dodik, who won praise from international officials for
implementing the 1995 Dayton peace agreement. Western officials
have insisted that Dodik remain in the post.
	   But the hardliners have accused Dodik of betraying Serb
interests in Bosnia.

Argentina: Growth to stall after international crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's economy minister said
Wednesday the country's gross domestic product growth would be flat
in the fourth quarter amid lingering economic uncertainties around
the world.
	   ``We're operating under the hypothesis that growth will be
flat'' in the final three months of the year, Roque Fernandez told
a news conference in Buenos Aires.
	   But the leading Argentine economic official said that GDP should
be above 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   For 1999, Fernandez also said the government was sticking by its
initial forecast of 4.8 percent growth, predicting that ``in the
first four months of next year we'll see a recuperation from the
crisis.''
	   Speaking with reporters, the official also confirmed interest by
foreign companies, including British Petroleum and several U.S.
corporations, in acquiring a 14.9 percent stake in energy company
YPF.
	   He said the government's execution of that planned sale would
depend on market conditions. Officials had said previously such a
sale would be completed by January 1999 by the government.
	   In other developments, Fernandez said Argentina would continue
to tap international debt markets, as it has done in recent weeks,
if market conditions improve.
	   The comments came as Argentine officials met in Europe with
bankers and investors. Argentina has tapped international debt
markets in recent weeks by re-opening two existing global bonds to
sell a combined dlrs 550 million.
	   On another issue, Fernandez confirmed the federal government had
reached a deal with provincial governors that should allow
Argentina's Senate to take up a sweeping tax-reform bill that had
stalled in the upper house.
	   The Senate is expected to begin debating the bill as early as
next week. The legislation, already approved by the Chamber of
Deputies, had stalled in the Senate.

Extraction force to be ready by the end of November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Wednesday the alliance's special force for emergency
evacuation of civilian monitors in Kosovo will be ready to go by
the end of November.
	   The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body,
approved the ``initial concept of operations'' for the force and is
expected to give its backing to the final operations plan next
week, officials said.
	   The extraction force of allied soldiers will be responsible for
the emergency rescue of civilian monitors being dispatched to
Kosovo if they run into unexpected danger.
	   ``I expect to have it ready around the end of the month,''
Solana told reporters. ``Everything is in place now for finalizing
the plan.''
	   Under a deal The monitors are verifying the promised withdrawal
of Serb forces from Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian
province in Serbia.
	   As part of the deal struck by U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke
Oct. 12 with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, about 2,000
monitors are being sent to Kosovo to verify the withdrawal of
Yugoslav forces from the predominantly ethnic Albanian province.
	   The ground verifiers are being supplemented by surveillance
aircraft.
	   NATO officials said the ceasefire in Kosovo, where hundreds of
people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced in seven
months of conflict between the ruling Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians, seems to be holding.
	   Albanians make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population and suffered the most during the fighting. As many as
300,000 ethnic Albanian civilians were driven from their homes by
Serb police and army forces.

	   GRAZ, Austria (AP) _ A waterlogged pitch at the Arnold
Schwarzenegger stadium and driving rain forced Swedish referee
Karl-Erik Nilsson to postpone Wednesday's Champions League match
between Sturm Graz and Real Madrid.
	   The Group C match will be replayed Thursday, with the kickoff
set for 8.45 p.m. (1945 GMT).
	   ``It's too bad for the fans, but it was a correct decision by
the referee,'' said Graz chairman Hannes Kartnig.
	   Real officials agreed. ``The decision is fine, there is no
reason for discussion,'' said Real board member Manuel Fernandes.
	   The only problem for Real was to find a new hotel. The team
checked out of its hotel before leaving for the stadium because it
was planning to return home right after the match.
	   Real Madrid has two wins and one loss, while Graz has lost all
three group matches so far.

Exiled Islamic leader denies ordering attack on Ataturk's
</HEADLINE>
mausoleum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Dismissing Turkey's accusation, an Islamic
leader in exile on Wednesday denied ordering up a plot to disrupt
the nation's 75th anniversary celebrations with a kamikaze attack
on the tomb of Turkey's founder.
	   However, Metin Kaplan of the Cologne, Germany-based Anatolian
Federal Islamic State also said he has declared a holy war against
the secular Turkish republic, which he wants replaced with a
religious one.
	   ``Whoever rejects an Islamic state are heathens,'' Kaplan told
private Show television.
	   Turkish police arrested 23 alleged members of Kaplan's group the
day before Turkey's Oct. 29 celebrations of its founding by Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk. Under Ataturk, overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey got a
strictly secular constitution.
	   The suspects confessed they had planned to mark the anniversary
by crashing a plane into Ataturk's mausoleum, where Turkish
leaders, foreign dignitaries and thousands of others were paying
their respects.
	   ``I have not assigned anyone for this subject,'' Kaplan said of
the foiled attack. ``But all Muslims must abide with the jihad.''
	   Turkey has been weighing asking Germany to extradite Kaplan.
Saying he is a political refugee, Germany has requested past such
requests for Kaplan, who also leads the German-based Association of
Islamic Groups and Communities.
	   The two groups are not known to have carried out any attacks and
have only a limited following in Turkey. From abroad, Kaplan has
been stepping up a propaganda war against Turkey.

	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ More than 10,000 furious fans Wednesday
waved giant banners, stomped to trumpets and even roared threats
against Premier Costas Simitis _ all because of a goal disallowed
during a Greek first-division match last weekend.
	   Supporters of Salonica's PAOK gathered on the streets of this
northern port city to protest the match that was abandoned Saturday
against Olympiakos Pireaus.
	   The match was halted with Olympiakos leading 2-1 after PAOK fans
invaded the field and clashed with police following referee Yiannis
Papapetrouan's decision to annul a goal by PAOK with eight minutes
remaining.
	   A linesman was hit in the head and hospitalized with a
concussion. Three police officers and eight fans also were injured.
	   Sixteen fans were convicted and sentenced to suspended prison
terms ranging from eight to 26 months.
	   Wednesday's rowdy but peaceful rally was joined by people from
across northern Greece.
	   The demonstrators chanted slogans against the Greek federation
and threatened never to vote for Premier Costas Simitis.
	   PAOK is demanding a rematch and the suspension of Papapetrou. It
also wants an investigation into allesged ``soccer corruption.''

Jewish settlers occupy West Bank hill as land campaign continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from settler leader, UPDATES with disputed figures
on empty homes. &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers have moved 17 mobile homes onto
a West Bank hill, and peace activists said Wednesday that this was
part of a campaign to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
	   Mobile homes have been put up in at least two other sites since
the Oct. 23 signing of the new Mideast peace agreement, which calls
for an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders have said they are seizing land, fearing it will
be handed over to the Palestinians.
	   The United States opposes Jewish settlement expansion, and as
part of the new accord urged both sides again to refrain from
actions that could affect the outcome of negotiations on the future
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   In the latest incident, 17 mobile homes were erected about 250
meters (yards) away from the Avnei Hefetz settlement, a cluster of
150 homes about 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Tel Aviv.
	   Israel Bonder, the secretary at Avnei Hefetz, said the trailer
park was planned months ago and not linked to the expected Israeli
withdrawal.
	   ``In any case, our settlement wouldn't be returned (to the
Palestinians),'' Blonder said.
	   He said the mobile homes were to be replaced eventually with
permanent housing, but would not say how many new homes are to be
built.
	   Lt. Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military government
in the West Bank, confirmed that the project had army approval.
	   But the left-wing Peace Now group said the settlers are trying
to prevent the government from carrying out the pullback.
	   Hagit Yaari, spokeswoman for the peace group, said there was no
housing shortage on Avnei Hefetz and that some 110 apartments there
are standing empty.
	   Blonder said that 60 apartments at Avnei Hefetz are vacant, but
said that they were too small to accommodate families wanting to
move into the settlement.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to appease Jewish settlers who oppose
the agreement. Since the signing of the peace accord, Netanyahu has
been ``giving bribes to the settlers by continuing settlements,''
he said.
	   Netanyahu has said Israel would keep expanding settlements to
accommodate what he said was natural population growth.

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Suspected ethnic Albanian
separatists opened fire on two vehicles carrying mine workers,
raising tensions Wednesday and providing a stark reminder of the
violence that persists in Kosovo despite a cease-fire agreement.
	   People on both sides of Kosovo's conflict said Wednesday that
tension remains high in this area because of incident like the
roadside ambush that injured three Serbs at the Belacevac coal
mine, 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   Heavy fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas has stopped throughout the province and many refugees
are coming back from the woods, but the majority Albanian province
has a long way to go before real peace is established.
	   The three workers, two of them seriously injured, were
transported to a Pristina hospital, and the attack sparked an
hour-long shootout between police and the attackers, Serb police
said.
	   But villagers in nearby Sipitula said they knew nothing about an
ambush and only heard Serb police firing in their direction,
causing them to flee for nearby fields or homes of friends and
relatives.
	   Two bullet-riddled, bloodstained vehicles were still sitting
near the road Wednesday, a pool of blood beside one open door.
	   Dozens of spent shell casings littered the roadside from where
the attack took place.
	   ``The mine is not working today because the people are afraid to
go to work,'' said mine security guard Blagoje Ristic.
	   He said the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas have ambushed
vehicles along the same stretch of road twice previously, and that
KLA snipers hide in abandoned houses in the area.
	   In Brussels, Nato Secretary General Javier Solana said the
alliance's Kosovo extraction force for emergency evacuation of
civilian monitors will be ready to go by the end of November.
	   The extraction force of allied soldiers will be responsible for
the emergency rescue of civilian ``ground verifiers'' now being
dispatched to Kosovo should they run into unexpected physical
danger.
	   ``I expect to have it ready around the end of the month,''
Solana told reporters. ``Everything is in place now for finalizing
the plan.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with strike continuing at national library &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A strike locked visitors out of the Eiffel Tower
for a fifth full day Wednesday and promised to keep Paris' most
visited monument closed for a sixth day, despite two hours of
talks.
	   But the ``grande dame'' of Paris was not the only victim of
social protests.
	   France's ``Tres Grande Bibliotheque,'' or ``Very Big Library''
as the new National Library of France is jokingly known, was in its
third week of a strike.
	   Library employees, angry over computer glitches at the high-tech
facility that opened to researchers less than a month ago, are
demanding improved working conditions and closed doors on Monday.
	   Representatives of the strikers met Wednesday with Culture
Minister Catherine Trautmann and were expected to vote Thursday
whether to continue their job action.
	   Negotiations over the Eiffel Tower conflict ``didn't go too
badly,'' the press office of the company that runs the Tower said.
But new, minor points of contention were raised, it added, without
providing details.
	   The 200 workers employed at the Eiffel Tower are demanding more
personnel, rejecting as insufficient the recent hiring of 20
people, with plans to recruit five more workers at the start of the
year.
	   In the Wednesday talks, the Societe Nouvelle d'Exploitation de
la Tour Eiffel, which runs the Eiffel Tower, modified its plan,
saying the five others would be hired starting Dec. 19.
	   But workers are now ``demanding new adjustments on minor
organizational points which were not part of the negotiations,''
the press office said.
	   The strike is costing the Eiffel Tower some 300,000 francs (dlrs
55,000) per day. They note that November is a slack period for
tourists. Some 310,000 people visited the Eiffel Tower in November
1997, compared to 850,000 visitors in August.

Iraqi Kurdish leader reassures Turkey over peace plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's premier and deputy premier talked
over a U.S.-backed Kurdish peace plan with an Iraqi Kurd leader on
Wednesday, afterward declaring themselves reassured the plan would
not lead to creation of a Kurdish state.
	   The September agreement sealed a cease-fire between the two
Iraqi Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq.
	   The accord made reference to a future federal structure for
Kurds, alarming Turkey. With Iraq, Turkey opposes creation of a
Kurdish state in northern Iraq, fearing it would encourage Kurdish
rebels in its own country.
	   Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, one of the
two factions in the accord, talked separately in Ankara with Deputy
Premier Bulent Ecevit and Premier Mesut Yilmaz.
	   ``Reference to a federal solution in the declaration were
disturbing to us, but Mr. Barzani today made an announcement that
appeased our fears,'' Ecevit told reporters after the meeting.
	   Crucially, Ecevit said, Barzani agreed that ``Any solution to
northern Iraq has to be within the territorial integrity of Iraq.''
	   Under the cease-fire accord, Barzani and Jalal Talabani of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed to share power and hold
elections in the de facto autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq,
set by after 1991 Gulf War.
	   Talabani is due to arrive in Ankara on Saturday. It was unclear
if the two former armed rivals would meet.
	   In Barzani's talks with Turkey's leaders, Yilmaz said, Barzani
agreed to increase cooperation in the fight against the Turkish
Kurdish rebel group PKK, which carries out cross-border attacks
from hideouts in northern Iraq.

US Defense Secretary in Qatar to discuss standoff with Iraq

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied
Gulf states Wednesday for support of possible military action
against Iraq but _ at least publicly _ he appeared to be winning
little backing.
	   Cohen arrived in Qatar after visiting Bahrain and Kuwait earlier
Wednesday. U.S. officials and the local governments did not release
any details of his hurriedly-arranged tour that began with Saudi
Arabia late Tuesday.
	   Cohen is expected to spend the night in Qatar and go to Egypt
Thursday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak later in the day.
He is likely to stop briefly in the United Arab Emirates en route
to Egypt.
	   In Qatar, Cohen met with the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa
al-Thani, and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani.
	   They discussed the recent developments in the Iraq-U.N. crisis,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said without elaborating.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Saturday decision to end
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N. Security Council
has condemned the Iraqi decision and is now debating what action to
take.
	   In Baghdad, an information ministry spokesman Wednesday
reiterated comments by Iraqi leaders that U.S. threats will not
force Iraq to rescind its decision.
	   ``The Iraqi people shall not be terrified by American threats,''
the official Iraqi News Agency quoted the unnamed spokesman as
saying.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Bands of armed militants raided a
city in northern Tajikistan on Wednesday, battling government
troops and seizing several buildings in heavy fighting.
	   At least 10 government soldiers were killed, said Zafar Saidov,
spokesman for President Emomali Rakhmonov.
	   The attackers took about 30 police officers hostage, but they
were later released when government troops stormed a municipal
office where they were being held, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Late in the day, the Interior Ministry reported that a portion
of the elite Presidential Guards had surrendered to the rebels. The
rebels were reported to be meeting with local Tajik leaders to
discuss terms for ending the fighting.
	   Despite a 1997 peace agreement that formally ended a civil war,
the former Soviet republic continues to be plagued by outbursts of
violence involving groups that do not recognize the deal.
	   The assailants seized all administrative buildings in the city
of Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital, Dushanbe. They also took control of the city airport,
Saidov said.
	   A rebel leader told ITAR-Tass that his forces also controlled
the only major road from the capital to the northern region.
	   Phone lines were down throughout the area of the fighting. It
was unclear how they were cut off.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the rebel attacks
and urged both sides to find a peaceful solution, his spokesman,
Fred Eckhard, was quoted by ITAR-Tass as saying.

	   GRAZ, Austria (AP) _ A waterlogged pitch at the Arnold
Schwarzenegger stadium and driving rain forced Swedish referee
Karl-Erik Nilsson to postpone Wednesday's Champions League match
between Sturm Graz and Real Madrid.
	   The Group C match will be replayed Thursday, with the kickoff
set for 8 p.m. (1945 GMT). UEFA wanted the match to kick off at 8.
45 (1945 GMT), but the two teams insisted on 8 p.m. and UEFA later
agreed.
	   ``It's too bad for the fans, but it was a correct decision by
the referee,'' said Graz chairman Hannes Kartnig.
	   Real officials agreed. ``The decision is fine, there is no
reason for discussion,'' said Real board member Manuel Fernandes.
	   The only problem for Real was to find a new hotel. The team
checked out of its hotel before leaving for the stadium because it
was planning to return home right after the match.
	   Real Madrid has two wins and one loss, while Graz has lost all
three group matches so far.

Palestinian Authority reverses press restrictions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian Cabinet minister rescinded
restrictions on foreign reporters Wednesday issued by a Palestinian
agency two days earlier.
	   The Palestinian Information Agency on Monday had ordered foreign
reporters to register in advance before entering Palestinian
territory and disclose whom they planned to interview in
Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abd Rabbo canceled the
regulations and charged that the agency had no authority to issue
them. He complained that the restrictions ``damage the reputation
of the Palestinian Authority and turns it into an oppressive police
state.''
	   The agency is a government agency that puts out official news
releases and is connected to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
office. Abd Rabbo's ministry is separate. He announced the reversal
of the restrictions in a letter to government officials and Arafat.
	   The Foreign Press Association, which had criticized the
regulations, welcomed their cancelation.

	   GURABO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Bernie Williams has been courted by
Colorado, Los Angeles, Texas, Baltimore, Detroit and other teams
but remains undecided on where he will play next season.
	   ``I still really have no idea,'' the free agent outfielder said
Wednesday. ``It's still to early to make a determination.''
	   Fresh off a World Series win with the New York Yankees, the
American League batting champion wants a deal at least seven years
long and his agent, Scott Boras, sounds like he wants a higher
average than the dlrs 13 million a year catcher Mike Piazza will
get with his dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract with the New York
Mets.
	   Williams spoke after presenting a dlrs 100,000 check from the
New York Yankees Foundation and the New York Police Department to a
day care center for the elderly. Williams is from Vega Baja, Puerto
Rico.
	   The Arizona Diamondbacks, managed by former Yankees manager Buck
Showalter, have also said they are interested in Williams and hope
to discuss pay with him this week. Teams may not discuss financial
terms with free agents other than their former players until
Friday.
	   Williams said he has an emotional attachment to the Yankees
after seven years in New York, but noted the team did not approach
him while he was still under contract. He rejected a dlrs 37.5
million, five-year offer last spring, then cut off talks until
after the season.
	   ``It would be a little foolish if I didn't take advantage of the
opportunity that I have now,'' Williams said, saying he hoped to
make a decision within two months.
	   He said he was seeking a city that offered stability for his
family, ``a city that is easy to live in, that has a good system of
schools and will give (my family) security for five or six years.''
	   Williams has a .339 average with 26 homers and 97 RBIs despite
missing five weeks because of a sprained knee.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A car sped onto Red Square on Wednesday and
exploded just outside the main gate to the Kremlin, injuring three
guards and the driver, authorities said. The cause of the blast was
not immediately known.
	   Initial reports said one person was killed inside the car, but a
spokesman for the presidential press service said no one had died.
	   The driver, identified as a journalist for a nationalist,
anti-Semitic magazine, was detained and was being questioned by the
Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, Russian
news agencies reported. Prosecutors launched a criminal case into
the incident.
	   The car exploded shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), a few meters
(yards) outside the Spassky Gate, the main entrance to the Kremlin.
The walled enclosure has been Russia's governmental and spiritual
center for centuries.
	   Clouds of smoke could be seen drifting over St. Basil's
Cathedral, a few meters (yards) away. Officials inside the Kremlin
said they could feel the concussion from the blast.
	   The Kremlin spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the car had driven very fast toward Red Square, past the famous GUM
department store. It knocked down fences, drove across the square
and approached the gate at the foot of Spassky Tower, a large red
clock tower that is one of Russia's most distinctive symbols.
	   The driver jumped out just before the car, a cheap,
Russian-built Moskvich, exploded, the official said. The blast was
reported to have had the force of 6 kilograms (13 pounds) of
dynamite.
	   Two Kremlin guards, one presidential guard and the driver were
injured. The presidential guard was in critical condition, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The gate was also slightly damaged.
	   Russian television showed an unidentified bloodied body lying
near the charred car on the square's stone slope.
	   The driver was identified as Ivan Orlov, a 65-year-old
journalist for the magazine ``Russian Pravda'' from the Moscow
suburb of Podolsk, the Interfax news agency reported. The magazine
carries anti-Semitic and nationalist articles, Interfax said.
	   He was taken to the hospital to treat minor scratches, where he
was being questioned by police, who said he would undergo a
psychiatric examination, Interfax said. It also quoted police as
saying the driver had a gas pistol in his car.
	   Reporting on the incident was sketchy, and the entire area
surrounding the blast was sealed off to the press and public.
	   The Federal Security Service said it was investigating and had
not ruled out terrorism as a motive, Interfax said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has his office at the Kremlin, but has
been in the southern resort city of Sochi recovering from what has
been described as exhaustion.
	   Kremlin officials said the doors to the gate have been closed
for years, and expressed assurance that the car could not have
broken through them.

Dynamo Kiev buries Arsenal 3-1

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Serhiy Rebrov, Oleksandr Holovko and Andriy
Shevchenko scored Wednesday as Ukranian champions Dynamo Kiev
defeated their English counterparts Arsenal 3-1 to tighten the
Champions League race in Group E.
	   The win gave Dynamo five points in four games, the same as
Arsenal. Lens entered its match with Panathinaikos with five and
the Greeks had three.
	   Rebrov, pulled down in the area by Martin Keown, scored on a
penalty in the 27th as Dynamo took a 1-0 lead. Arsenal keeper David
Seaman managed to get a hand on the ball to his right but it
dropped in six inches (15 cm) over the line.
	   It was Rebrov's late goal two weeks ago in England that salvaged
a 1-1 draw for Dynamo.
	   Holovko made it 2-0 on a header in the 62nd from eight meters
(yards) off a long cross that gave Seaman no chance as it beat him
to his left.
	   Shevchenko, regarded as the best striker in Europe and
reportedly bound for Italy, showed why in the 72nd on a perfectly
struck free kick from 25 meters (yards) that curled into the
corner.
	   Stephen Hughes scored in the 84th for Arsenal.
	   Playing before more than 65,000 on an Olympic stadium pitch
softened by all-day rain, Dynamo Kiev took better advantage of its
chances as Arsenal played without four key players. Tony Adams,
Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka are injured and Dennis Bergkamp
missed the match with an injury and because he is afraid to fly.

U.N. negotiators seeking cost-effective ways to cut greenhouse gas

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ With much of the world agreed on
a timetable to cut pollution, a U.N. conference on global warming
turned its attention Wednesday to ways to trim the costs of the
effort.
	   ``It's important right from the start to focus on how countries
can reach their targets at the lowest possible cost,'' said Mark
Hambly, a member of the U.S. delegation.
	   Some European Union and developing countries disagreed, saying
the price of cleaning the environment should not be the first
consideration.
	   Delegates from over 160 nations are in Buenos Aires to find ways
to implement a 1997 global warming treaty reached in Kyoto, Japan.
	   At that time, countries agreed industrialized nations should cut
their pollution output by an average 5 percent below 1990 levels by
2012.
	   U.S. officials opened the day's talks saying efforts to reach
those levels should take into account the enormous expense to scale
back emissions.
	   Parties from both sides are expected to discuss the issue
through the next week when environmental ministers from the
countries arrive.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
what are known as greenhouse gas emissions _ mainly carbon dioxide
from factories, power plants and automobiles. Critics say dire
warming scenarios remain unproved and don't warrant potentially
costly shifts away from fossil fuels.
	   Meanwhile, senior U.S. delegation officials said ``positive''
talks were taking place with developing nations on ways to increase
their commitment to reducing greenhouse gases.
	   One of the few industrialized nations not to sign the Kyoto
treaty, the United States has said it would only sign after poorer
nations made a bigger commitment to fight pollution.
	   Earlier this week, Argentina, backed by Washington, sought to
add a discussion of ``voluntary'' quotas for those countries to the
conference agenda. The move failed when a number of developing
nations led by China blocked that effort.
	   While the United States went into the discussions, a group of
scientists called on Washington to make a bigger commitment in the
fight against rising temperatures on Earth.
	   Alden Meyer, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists,
said the United States should step up its commitment ``by having
the president sign the Kyoto Protocol and announce some major
domestic policy initiatives to show we're doing more at home.''

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United exploded for four
first-half goal to beat Denmark's Brondby 5-0 Wednesday in a
Champions League match in Group D.
	   The English side beat Brondby 6-2 two weeks ago in Denmark and
this outing was just as bad as David Beckham scored in the 7th with
subsequent goals by Andy Cole (13th), Phil Neville (15th) and
Dwight Yorke (27th).
	   Paul Scholes added another in the 63rd.
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson eased up in the second
half when he brought on substitutes Jordi Cruyff and Ole Solskjaer.
	   The Dane's weren't helped by the absence of No. 1 goalkeeper
Mogens Krogh, who missed the match with a back injury with backup
Emeka Andersen getting the call.
	   The victory gave Manchester United eight points from four games
to lead Group D. Brondy has three.

Fire breaks out at Italian palace on World Heritage list

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fire broke out Wednesday in the attic of the Reggia
palace at Caserta in southern Italy, raising fears for the
sumptuous, sprawling 18th-century landmark.
	   Authorities said they would have to wait until daylight to
determine the extent of the damage.
	   The fire was discovered late Wednesday and was declared under
control within hours after firefighters were summoned from as far
away as Rome. Smoke and flames were seen at two windows; Italy's
ANSA news service quoted a firefighter as saying the fire had
reached at least four rooms.
	   Officials said an investigation would start Thursday into the
cause of the fire at the palace, about 30 miles outside of Naples.
	   Charles III commissioned the palace in 1751 to show off the
might of the kingdom of Naples. With five floors and 1,200 rooms,
it made the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites last year.
	   World leaders met there in 1994 for the Group of Seven economic
summit _ a setting that prompted Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to
scrap his usual business suit for a tuxedo.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Bayern Munich scored in the 87th minute
to post a 2-1 come-from-behind victory over FC Barcelona in a
Champions League Group D matchup on Wednesday.
	   Injury-plagued Barcelona opened the scoring in the 29th minute
as Giovanni Silva de Oliveira converted a penalty after being
fouled just outside goalkeeper Oliver Kahn's box.
	   Bayern answered in the third minute of the second half as
Alexander Zickler cashed in on an error by the Barcelona defense,
recovering a mishandled pass to slam the ball to the left of keeper
Ruud Hesp.
	   The Germans continued to press, keeping the Spaniards pinned
down in their own territory.
	   Bayern missed a golden opportunity to score in the 65th minute
when a diving Hesp stopped a blazing shot by Zickler and Giovane
Elber recovered it. Standing by himself, he sent the ball sailing
high and to the left.
	   In the 80th minute Sonny Anderson of Barcelona made a
spectacular attempt, kicking backwards over his head as faced away
from Kahn. But this shot sailed high as well.
	   Bayern sealed the win in the 87th minute with a goal from Hasan
Salihamidzic on a solo runaway in which he eluded Hesp.
	   Barcelona was playing without defenders Miguel Angel Nadal and
Michael Reiziger and midfielder Luis Enrique Martinez.
	   In the first round a month ago, Bayern won 1-0 at home.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An equalizer four minutes from the end
by Brazilian striker Luiz Antonio secured a 2-2 tie Wednesday for
Finland's HJK Helsinki at Benfica of Portugal in the European
Champions' League.
	   The result left the Finnish side on five points after four
rotations, one point ahead of the Lisbon team.
	   A fluke goal in the fourth minute by defender Hannu Tihinen put
Helsinki into the lead.
	   Tihinen headed weakly toward goal and the ball took a deflection
off defender Scott Minto to trickle past stranded keeper Michel
Preud'homme.
	   The goal gave the robust Finnish side greater confidence at the
120,000-capacity Stadium of Light where just 20,000 fans turned out
to support a Benfica side that has lost form in recent weeks.
	   Benfica was disjointed in midfield and anxious in attack during
the first half but came out fighting after the interval and pinned
the Finnish team in its own half of the pitch.
	   Joao Pinto hit the bar in the first minute of the second half.
	   Benfica squandered a series of clear chances and the game looked
lost until Nuno Gomes and then Bruno Calado suddenly shot the
Portuguese into the lead with a pair of goals in the space of two
minutes in the closing stages.
	   Gomes scored in the 80th minute, pouncing on a shot by Calado
that got trapped in the Helsinki defense to slot the ball in from
short range.
	   Then Calado struck a powerful long-range shot past goalie Tommi
Koivistoinen to give Benfica the lead.
	   But Antonio hit a curling shot past Preud'homme after 86 minutes
to clinch a point.

Researchers find that grassland depends on underground fungus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK CALLAHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Earth's rich carpets of grasslands may be more than meets the
eye. The grasses and wildflowers owe their diversity to
partnerships with underground fungi, new research strongly
suggests.
	   The findings could prompt scientists to rethink ways of
restoring endangered habitats such as America's shrinking tallgrass
prairies, and help farmers become more productive.
	   Scientists had thought that competition between plant species
and grazing by animals controlled the amount of diversity in
grasslands.
	   ``What this says is that it's the below-ground that controls the
above-ground, instead of the other way around,'' said John N.
Klironomos, an assistant professor of botany at the University of
Guelph, near Toronto.
	   Klironomos and a separate team of Swiss researchers found that
specialized species of fungus dictate how many and what type of
species sprout on the surface of the earth by feeding nutrients to
the plants.
	   While such a relationship had been suspected, this research is
the most persuasive work demonstrating the theory, said David
Janos, an associate professor of biology at the University of
Miami. ``It's a really interesting, provocative paper that takes us
that next step forward. It's a major contribution.''
	   Similar links have been shown between fungus and trees.
	   Klironomos' team created bare outdoor plots, introduced varying
numbers of species of fungus, then scattered a uniform amount of
seeds from 15 species of grasses and wildflowers.
	   In a study published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,
they report that plots with the most fungal species sprouted the
greatest variety of surface plants.
	   Their findings were complemented by similar work in greenhouses
at the University of Basel in Switzerland. Researchers there found
that even a slight shift in the number of fungal species can lead
to big swings in plant diversity.
	   The studies' suggestion that some fungi favor specific plant
species was particularly intriguing, said Elaine Ingham, an
associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Oregon State
University.
	   ``I think this gives us undeniable proof that fungi are
controlling the plants,'' she said.
	   Ingham said learning which fungi favor which plants could help
farmers create more productive pastures without fertilizer.
	   The findings also explain why efforts to restore tallgrass
prairies often fall short, said Mike Miller, senior ecologist at
Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, which has created a
tallgrass prairie on the grounds of its underground atomic
accelerator.
	   ``We have something that looks like a prairie, but is not really
functioning like a prairie because it lacks this large population
of fungi that play a big role in enriching and stabilizing the
soil,'' Miller said.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Unable to provide Hondurans such
basics as gasoline, food and water, a government overwhelmed by
Hurricane Mitch's destruction made an urgent appeal for
international aid Wednesday.
	   The storm, which killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout
Central America, has turned Honduras' largest cities into virtual
islands accessible only by air. The U.S. Air Force was helping
Honduras deliver aid to remote towns, Communications Minister Tomas
Lozano said.
	   Honduran officials estimated their country's death toll at 7,000
on Wednesday, though no one knows how many really died. Some 10,000
people officially were listed as missing. Up to 1 million are
homeless, said Col. Rene Osorio of the national emergency
committee.
	   ``We really don't know what the numbers are. There are places we
haven't reached yet,''' Osorio said.
	   Mitch hit the Honduran coast last week and parked itself there,
dumping several feet (about a meter) of rain onto the poor nation
before moving across the Yucatan Peninsula and into the Gulf of
Mexico. On Wednesday, the tropical storm was moving northeast
toward Florida with sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph).
	   It left behind a stunning wake of death and devastation across
Central America.
	   ``How do we continue, without food, without sleep?'' said
35-year-old Yoland Marvella Arraya, who has spent nights outside on
a soggy mattress along the debris-strewn banks of the Choluteca
River since flooding destroyed her family's home.
	   ``I don't know what to think. My mind needs help,'' she said.
	   In neighboring Nicaragua, as many as 2,400 were believed dead.
Rains there last week caused a crater lake atop the Casitas volcano
to break open Friday and spill tons of mud onto villages along the
slopes.
	   El Salvador declared three days of national mourning for the 239
dead there. In Guatemala, 194 were reported dead and at least
77,900 had evacuated their homes. At least six people were killed
in southern Mexico and seven people died in Costa Rica.
	   The Nicaraguan government pleaded Wednesday for more helicopters
to deliver food and medical supplies. Its air force has only six
helicopters.
	   ``The low number of helicopters available to us represents a
bottleneck in handing out food,'' Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique
Bolanos said.
	   A U.S. Army base in Panama sent three helicopters to Nicaragua
on Monday and the U.S. government pledged to send another seven.
Mexico said it was sending 10, and Panama will send two more.
	   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo called President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday to urge that a large-scale international aid effort be
made. Zedillo's office said Clinton was ``highly sympathetic'' and
pledged to review aid efforts.
	   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II called on ``all public and
private institutions and all men of good will'' to do all they can
``in this grave moment of destruction and death.''
	   The obstacles are daunting: Countless roads are out in Honduras,
including main highways. Without roads, gasoline can't be delivered
from Puerto Cortez on the south coast; without gasoline,
international donations of water and food can't be delivered from
the Palmerola military airbase or San Pedro Sula airstrip and safer
approach paths than the capital's. Nearly all available aircraft
are being used in the continuing search for survivors and victims
in isolated towns.
	   ``There are medicines available, but the problem is the same:
How do we transport it?'' said a frustrated Andres Aguiriano
Duarte, deputy commissioner of the emergency committee.
	   ``Honduras will get ahead only with the help of the nations of
the world,'' Lozano said, adding that the government will ask its
foreign creditors to forgive some of Honduras' dlrs 4.1 billion
foreign debt.
	   The government is coping with competing demands: to find and
rescue survivors still isolated by flooding in remote towns; to
establish a reliable information network that can assess the
magnitude of the disaster and corresponding needs; the urgent need
for drinking water and food in the capital of 800,000.
	   ``The people's desperation is growing,'' Aguiriano said. ``For
an emergency of this nature it's difficult to maintain normal
order.''
	   The country's roads sustained dlrs 2 billion in damage, nearly
one-third of Honduras' gross domestic product and double the
government's budget, Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez said.
	   With most of Tegucigalpa's bridges knocked out, men charged five
lempiras (30 cents) a head to carry residents across muddy streams
and rivers. Citizens tossed soiled clothes and furniture from shops
and homes into growing, foul-smelling piles on streets. Blocks-long
lines formed at a few stations where gasoline was available, but
rationed to 1 gallon (4 liters) per person.
	   ``We've been waiting four hours,'' said Gladys Nunez, 50, two
plastic containers in hand. ``It's been all nerves and tension.''
	   That tension, authorities fear, could prompt lawlessness if
basic needs remain unmet. Despite an overnight curfew declared
under a state of siege, many army troops and police who otherwise
could patrol streets diverted to continuing search and rescue
operations.
	   At least 300 people have been arrested in Tegucigalpa for
violating the curfew, police said.
	   Aguiriano insisted, however, that given time the government
would make progress without risking an outbreak of lawlessness.
``There is no danger of disorder,'' he said.
	   The strain was showing elsewhere in Tegucigalpa, where officials
say residents in some neighborhoods have formed vigilante groups to
ward off looters.
	   The Honduran Red Cross, meanwhile, continued its search
operations in the countryside but was hampered by the lack of
transportation and dlrs 2 million in flood damage to its
Tegucigalpa headquarters.
	   Gone are the national blood bank run by the Red Cross, four Red
Cross ambulances, a bus, a mechanics' garage. Workers mopped floors
and smeared mud from medical equipment on the first two floors
while the third-floor headquarters operated Wednesday with one
phone line and a handful of cellular telephones.
	   ``Tell the world that, really, our country has been destroyed,''
said Red Cross president Meneca de Mencia. ``The Red Cross itself
is homeless. And we're still rescuing living survivors.''

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia Zagreb ended a scoring famine
Wednesday by defeating Porto 3-1 in a Group A match of the
Champions League.
	   The victory and the goals were the first for the Croats after
four rotations and kept their hopes alive for a place in the
quarterfinals.
	   Mihael Mikic, making his debut in the league at 18, opened the
scoring for Croatia in the 7th minute when he met a neatly lofted
ball from the left and guided it into the net.
	   Hungry to extend the lead and make amends for countless missed
scoring opportunities in previous matches, Croatia ventured
ominously forward and struck again in the 37th minute.
	   Breaking away in midfield, Tomislav Rukavina gambled a distant
shot which deflected off a defender and looped over stranded Ivica
Kralj who had wandered out of goal.
	   Porto struggled to regroup but could only manage a spark of hope
in the 39th minute when Nuno Jardel came off the substitute bench
to head a corner into the net.
	   Several other chances went unexploited for the Portuguese who
lacked concentration on close-range headers from Brazilian Doriva
Jardel and Zlatko Zahovic.
	   Bosnian international Edin Mujcin sealed the scoring for Croatia
in the 61st minute after he latched onto a loose ball on the edge
of the penalty box and directed it deftly inside the right post.
	   The game was played on a chopped and muddy pitch worsened by
sporadic bursts of pouring rain.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam drew level with
Olympiakos Piraeus at the top of Champions League Group A with a
2-0 win over the Greek side Wednesday.
	   Frank de Boer's through ball on 33 minutes found South Arican
striker Benni whose shot was knocked into the air and Richard
Witschge rose to head home from point-blank range.
	   And Dean Gorre sealed the game two minutes from time with a
delightful 20-meter (yard) chip over advancing Greek keeper
Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos.
	   Ajax and Olympiakos now have seven points apiece with Portugal's
Porto and Croatia Zagreb on four points.
	   Olympiakos forced the first genuine shooting oppotunity on 15
minutes with Sinica Gogic's low shot blocked by a diving Edwin van
der Sar, but Ajax took over from then on.
	   The Dutch side had three strong appeals for penalties turned
down.
	   The first came when Vasilios Karapialis was booked for a foul on
goal-bound Shota Arveladze on 23 minutes, but referee Braschi
Stefano gave a free kick just outside the box.
	   Claims for a handball and a foul on Brazilian Wamberto also went
begging in the second half.
	   Morten Olsen's three first-half substitutions, forced by
injuries, all paid off.
	   Benni made a goal, Gorre scored one and Portuguese star Dani had
an inspired game including a twenty-meter (yard) drive against the
Olympiakos crossbar.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland must solve the controversy over
access to its Tatra mountain reserve if it wants to hold the 2006
Winter Olympics, the head of an International Olympic Committee
team said Wednesday.
	   Chiharu Igaya and 15 other members of the IOC group spent three
days visiting the southern mountain resort of Zakopane, which is
bidding for the games.
	   Igaya declared Zakopane and Poland as a whole fit to hold the
games, but stressed that the question of using Tatra National Park
should be settled first.
	   In August, a group of Polish intellectuals, including two Nobel
laureates, protested the bid by Zakopane, saying the environment
would be destroyed by venue construction and by thousands of
visitors.
	   Much of the Zakopane area is in the Tatra National Park,
established in 1954 to protect plants and wildlife. It was
designated a natural reserve by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1992.
	   Tatra National Park features Kasprowy Wierch, which is Poland's
tallest mountain available to skiers at 6,557 feet (1,967 meters).
It has two ski slopes, and park management has long resisted calls
to build more lifts, saying it would damage the environment.
	   Park directors argue that expanding the skiing area for the
Olympics would require cutting 10,000 trees in violation of an
environmental protection law.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Bayern Munich scored in the 87th minute
to post a 2-1 come-from-behind victory over FC Barcelona in a
Champions League Group D matchup on Wednesday.
	   Injury-plagued Barcelona opened the scoring in the 29th minute
as Giovanni Silva de Oliveira converted a penalty after being
fouled just outside goalkeeper Oliver Kahn's box.
	   Bayern answered in the third minute of the second half as
Alexander Zickler cashed in on an error by the Barcelona defense,
recovering a mishandled pass to slam the ball to the left of keeper
Ruud Hesp.
	   The Germans continued to press, keeping the Spaniards pinned
down in their own territory.
	   Bayern missed a golden opportunity to score in the 65th minute
when a diving Hesp stopped a blazing shot by Zickler and Giovane
Elber recovered it. Standing by himself, he sent the ball sailing
high and to the left.
	   In the 80th minute Sonny Anderson of Barcelona made a
spectacular attempt, kicking backwards over his head as faced away
from Kahn. But this shot sailed high as well.
	   Bayern sealed the win in the 87th minute with a goal from Hasan
Salihamidzic on a solo runaway in which he eluded Hesp.
	   Barcelona was playing without defenders Miguel Angel Nadal and
Michael Reiziger and midfielder Luis Enrique Martinez.
	   In the first round a month ago, Bayern won 1-0 at home.

Wednesday in a Group E game for the Champions League.
	   With its victory, Panathinaikos moved to the top of the group
with six points from four games.
	   Arsenal, Dynamo Kiev and Lens follow with 5 points each.
	   Playing before 55,000 spectators at the Athens Olympic stadium,
Panathinaikos pushed from the opening kickoff, but its players
failed to beat a well-organized French defense.
	   Lens' goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz made a key save to a free-kick
by Croatian midfielder Aljosa Asanovic in the 47th minute.
	   In the 52nd, a free kick taken by Nikos Limberopoulos sent the
ball in front of the French goalmouth. Vokolos, who was left
unmarked, scored the game's only goal with a header.
	   Lens became more aggressive after the goal and missed at least
two good scoring opportunities with Wagneau Eloi.
	   Seconds before the final whistle, Panathinaikos came close to a
second goal, but Brazilian striker Mauro Da Silva's shot from close
range was saved by Warmuz.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A car carrying two bombs sped onto Red Square on
Wednesday and exploded just outside the main gate to the Kremlin,
injuring three guards and the driver, authorities said.
	   Initial reports said one person was killed inside the car, but a
spokesman for the presidential press service said no one had died.
	   The driver, identified as a journalist for a nationalist,
anti-Semitic magazine, was detained and was being questioned by the
Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, Russian
news agencies reported. Prosecutors launched a criminal case into
the incident.
	   The car exploded shortly after 7 p.m. (1600 GMT), a few meters
(yards) outside the Spassky Gate, the main pedestrian entrance to
the Kremlin. The walled enclosure has been Russia's governmental
and spiritual center for centuries.
	   Clouds of smoke could be seen drifting over St. Basil's
Cathedral, a few meters (yards) away. Officials inside the Kremlin
said they could feel the concussion from the blast, and passersby
speaking on Russian television said they felt a stunning thud and
saw a bright green flash.
	   The Kremlin spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the car had driven very fast toward Red Square, past the famous GUM
department store. It knocked down fences, drove across the square
and approached the gate at the foot of Spassky Tower, a large red
clock tower that is one of Russia's most distinctive symbols.
	   The driver jumped out just before the car, a cheap,
Russian-built Moskvich, exploded, the official said.
	   The blast was caused by a bomb with the force of 6 kilograms (13
pounds) of dynamite, the Interfax news agency cited police as
saying. Kremlin guards found another, stronger bomb soon after the
explosion and defused it.
	   Two Kremlin guards, one presidential guard and the driver were
injured. The presidential guard was in critical condition, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The gate was also slightly damaged.
	   Russian television showed an unidentified bloodied body lying
near the charred, smoldering car on the square's stone slope.
	   The driver was identified as Ivan Orlov, a 65-year-old
free-lance journalist for the magazine Russian Pravda from the
Moscow suburb of Podolsk, the Interfax news agency reported. The
magazine carries anti-Semitic and nationalist articles, Interfax
said.
	   He was taken to the hospital to treat minor scratches, where he
was being questioned by police, who said he would undergo a
psychiatric examination, Interfax said. It also quoted police as
saying the driver had a gas pistol in his car.
	   The editor of Russian Pravda, Alexander Aratov, told Interfax
that Orlov was a former driving instructor who strongly disliked
President Boris Yeltsin. Orlov was long a supporter of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party, and used
to sell the party's literature in Russia's parliament building,
Aratov said.
	   Reporting on the incident was sketchy, and the entire area
surrounding the blast was sealed off to the press and public.
	   The Federal Security Service said it was investigating and had
not ruled out terrorism as a motive, Interfax said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has his office at the Kremlin, but has
been in the southern resort city of Sochi recovering from what has
been described as exhaustion.
	   Kremlin officials said the doors to the gate have been closed
for years, and expressed assurance that the car could not have
broken through them.

France distances itself from NATO officer accused of aiding Serbs

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French officials, wary their credibility with NATO
might be damaged by a new spy case, on Wednesday sought to distance
themselves from a French officer accused of supplying information
on planned NATO strikes to Serbs.
	   But Defense Minister Alain Richard said that France's sense of
``relative calm'' would only be verified on the ground, when it
takes part shortly in a NATO security mission in Kosovo.
	   Pierre Bunel, a 46-year-old French army official posted in
Brussels, was arrested for allegedly supplying ``intelligence to a
foreign power.'' He faces 15 years in jail.
	   He is accused of supplying information on planned NATO air
strikes to Serbs during the October standoff with Kosovo.
	   Richard, speaking on the state-run television channel, said the
officer committed ``veritable treason.'' But he added that, working
within the French delegation to NATO, Bunel would not have had
access to operational plans.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine put a more optimistic face on
the spy case.
	   The matter, he said, is ``extremely regrettable,'' but ``in no
way'' will harm France's role in NATO.
	   ``What happened is in no way linked to our policies which are
totally clear,'' Vedrine told the LCI television channel. ``And our
partners are well aware of that.''
	   The French press has raised questions about the credibility of
France among its NATO allies. France is not part of NATO's military
wing and the Bunel case is the second incident this year involving
a French officer allegedly compromising NATO activities in the
former Yugoslavia.
	   French authorities earlier this year recalled Maj. Herve
Gourmelon from Bosnia following reports his contacts with Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic led NATO to abort a mission to arrest
Karadzic.
	   The French government long has been considered by its Western
allies as sympathetic to the Serbs. It is a relationship dating
back to World War I when France and Britain helped set up an
independent Yugoslavia after the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
	   Judicial sources in France, requesting anonymity, said Bunel
allegedly gave Serbian officials a list of areas that NATO targeted
for air strikes.
	   The newspaper Le Monde reported Wednesday that Bunel had met
four times between July and October with Jovan Milanovic, a
Yugoslav diplomat stationed in Brussels who also worked for
Yugoslav intelligence and allegedly received the secret NATO list.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO air
strikes to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to respect
an Oct. 12 agreement to withdraw police and military forces in
Kosovo to levels before a February crackdown on Albanian
separatists.
	   Former U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Philippe Morillon,
said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien that the affair
was ``fortunately an exception'' that should not lead ``the public
to doubt for a second the loyalty of all our soldiers ....''
	   Richard, the defense minister, said it was the French who
uncovered Bunel's activities. The statement contradicted accounts
by the foreign minister -- who said the case was brought to
France's attention by NATO officials -- and by Le Monde -- which
reported that the U.S. Army tipped off the French.
	   Richard said his aide for special affairs, Gen. Phillipe Rondot,
``acquired the first indications of this criminal act'' and sought
an investigation.
	   Officials have not indicated why the Monday announcement of
Bunel's arrest was delayed. Vedrine said the case came to light
``several weeks ago.''

	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas ambushed
two cars, riddling them with gunfire and wounding three Serbs, Serb
police said Wednesday _ a harsh reminder that despite a cease-fire,
the violence in Kosovo is far from over.
	   Although heavy fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas has stopped and many refugees are returning to their
villages from the woods, isolated attacks continue in the southern
Serbian province, and tensions remain high.
	   The attack Tuesday evening on two vehicles from the Belacevac
coal mine set off an hour-long gunbattle between ethnic Albanian
guerrillas and Serb police, said police at a checkpoint near
Sipitula, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of the Kosovo
capital, Pristina.
	   Three miners were wounded, two of them seriously, and were taken
to a Pristina hospital, police said. The two bullet-riddled cars
were still sitting at the checkpoint Wednesday, a pool of blood
congealing beside them. Dozens of spent shell casings littered the
road.
	   Residents of Sipitula said Serb police began shooting at the
village at about the same time police said the gunfight began. The
villagers said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or
with friends and relatives.
	   Police gave few details of the ambush on the two cars, one of
which bore the logo of the mining company on its door.
	   However, a mine security guard, Blagoje Ristic, said Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas have ambushed vehicles along the same
stretch of road twice previously and KLA snipers hide in abandoned
houses in the area. ``The people are afraid to go to work,'' he
said.
	   The few villagers who returned Wednesday to assess the situation
in Sipitula said Serb police were continuing to harass them.
	   ``They are playing this game and aren't withdrawing their
forces,'' complained Fatme Mjeku, who said he and his neighbors
often hide in surrounding woods at night because of police gunfire.
	   ``This happens frequently,'' said 59-year-old Hilmi Mjekiqi,
adding that police burned a school building in the village on
Friday.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes on Serb and Yugoslav forces to pressure Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to agree Oct. 12 to halt a seven-month
crackdown on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1.
	   Under the agreement, Serb police and Yugoslav army forces in
Kosovo must be reduced to levels before the offensive and refugees
must be allowed to return to their homes.
	   The agreement also calls for international agencies to move
freely in Kosovo.
	   An estimated 2,000 international monitors are expected to patrol
the territory to ensure the agreement is honored. In Brussels,
Belgium, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance's
evacuation force for the monitors will be ready to go by the end of
November.
	   The military force will be responsible for the emergency rescue
of civilian ``ground verifiers'' now being dispatched to Kosovo
should they run into unexpected danger.

IOC official told to catch a train
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers (SOCOG) were
left embarrassed when a taxi driver refused to take a senior IOC
official into the city and took him to a train station instead.
	   Fiji-based International Olympic Committee official Robin
Mitchell said he understood the reasons for the taxi driver's
actions, but SOCOG officials were not amused.
	   ``A few of us were apoplectic that this should happen to
anyone,'' a SOCOG spokesman told Thursday's edition of the The
Daily Telegraph newspaper.
	   Mitchell was in Sydney on Olympic business and planned a meeting
with SOCOG in the city.
	   The taxi he ordered at his airport hotel failed to show so he
hailed another. Because the taxi driver was close to his changeover
time he offered to drive Mitchell to the nearest train station and
give him directions to get to SOCOG's city office.
	   Mitchell accepted the offer and rode the four stations before
walking 10 minutes to reach SOCOG 20 minutes late for a scheduled
meeting on Monday.
	   ``I'm not angry really,'' Mitchell told the newspaper. ``I know
Sydney fairly well so it wasn't much of a hassle.
	   ''His directions were very good (and) he apologized that he
couldn't take me.''
	   It is difficult to find taxis in Sydney around 3pm each day
because of the changeover. Taxi authorities hope to overcome this
problem in time for the 2000 games by adding an extra 500 licenses
which require drivers to be on the road between 12pm and 5pm.
	   New South Wales Taxi Council president Reg Kermode said he was
appalled by the incident.
	   ``I'm disappointed one of our guys would act that way to a
visitor to the country,'' Kermode said.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A second half goal by Leonidas Vokolos
gave Panathinaikos Athens a 1-0 victory over France's Lens
Wednesday in a Group E game for the Champions League.
	   With its victory, Panathinaikos moved to the top of the group
with six points from four games.
	   Arsenal, Dynamo Kiev and Lens follow with 5 points each.
	   Playing before 55,000 spectators at the Athens Olympic stadium,
Panathinaikos pushed from the opening kickoff, but its players
failed to beat a well-organized French defense.
	   Lens' goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz made a key save to a free-kick
by Croatian midfielder Aljosa Asanovic in the 47th minute.
	   In the 52nd, a free kick taken by Nikos Limberopoulos sent the
ball in front of the French goalmouth. Vokolos, who was left
unmarked, scored the game's only goal with a header.
	   Lens became more aggressive after the goal and missed at least
two good scoring opportunities with Wagneau Eloi.
	   Seconds before the final whistle, Panathinaikos came close to a
second goal, but Brazilian striker Mauro Da Silva's shot from close
range was saved by Warmuz.

Hearns, 40, making comeback as cruiserweight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ No longer skinny, no longer young, boxer Thomas
Hearns still yearns for the bright lights. At age 40, the Hit Man
will begin what he hopes is a comeback Friday night at Joe Louis
Arena.
	   Hearns, who weighed 147 pounds (66 kilograms) when he made his
professional debut in 1977, will carry close to 195 pounds (88
kilograms) into the ring against Jay Snyder, 37, of Spartenburg,
South Carolina.
	   ``It's the beginning, all over again,'' Hearns' trainer Emanuel
Steward said Wednesday at a news conference.
	   Hearns hasn't fought since Nov. 29, 1996, when he won a TKO over
Karl Willis in five rounds. So, why do this?
	   ``This is what I do,'' Hearns said. ``I eat and sleep my
profession. I want to be a winner. I want to show people you can do
what you want, no matter what your age is.''
	   His goal, he said, is to fight four times and eventually earn
the cruiserweight championship. If he succeeds, it would be his
eighth world title covering welterweight, middleweight,
light-heavyweight and super-middleweight divisions.
	   Hearns won his last crown in 1995 with a first-round knockout of
Lenny Lapaglia for the World Boxing Union cruiserweight
championship. He said he would like to win either the WBA or WBC
cruiserweight titles.
	   ``After I do four fights, I may walk away,'' Hearns said. ``Or,
I might not. I don't know. After I get the cruiserweight title, I
might defend that.''
	   Hearns, who was up around 200 pounds (90 kilograms) when he
began working out about two months ago, said his punching ability
is the same as it always was. It probably won't matter in this
bout, however.
	   Snyder, who works as a maintenance supervisor at a manufacturing
plant, has been knocked out in the first round in two fights this
year.
	   ``My manager called one day and said we had the opportunity to
do this,'' Snyder said. ``I said, `All right, let's do it.' Thomas
and Sugar Ray Leonard were big heroes of mine when I was coming
up.''
	   Hearns will take a record of 57-4-1 into the fight, with 45
knockouts. Snyder, who picked up the nickname ``Swamp Man'' during
a Toughman contest about 10 years ago, is 17-5 with 16 knockouts.
	   ``The reason I'm doing this is for the love of my profession,''
Hearns said. ``There's nothing like the challenge of going
one-on-one with an opponent in the ring.
	   ``I know there are a lot of people who have doubts. But that's
what fires me up. I love showing them they're wrong.''

U.S. pays U.N. dues and avoids loss of General Assembly vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States paid an additional dlrs
197 million of its regular 1998 dues to the United Nations on
Wednesday, the minimum needed to avoid the loss of its vote in the
General Assembly. But Washington still owes dlrs 1.3 billion in
arrears.
	   ``The U.S. budget payment, while late, is most welcome,'' Joseph
Connor, U.N. undersecretary-general for management, said at a news
conference.
	   The United States pays for the largest slice of U.N. activities,
about dlrs 2 billion annually to the U.N. system as a whole, but it
is also the biggest delinquent.
	   Connor said a record 107 countries have paid their 1998 dues and
all arrears, and he urged the remainder to join them.
	   After pressing the U.S. Congress for months to pay the back
dues, on Oct. 22 U.S. President Bill Clinton vetoed legislation to
provide dlrs 926 million in delinquent payments.
	   The president said that the congressional decision to link the
U.N. payment to unrelated restrictions on abortion gave him no
choice. He has offered to work with the next Congress on drafting
an ``achievable package'' to pay back dues.
	   The budget bill approved by the Republican-dominated Congress
and signed by Clinton last month includes the dlrs 197 million
payment to the United Nations made Wednesday, the minimum needed to
preserve the U.S. vote in the 185-member General Assembly.
	   The United States would not have lost its vote in the more
important U.N. Security Council, whose resolutions are legally
binding, unlike those in the assembly. But Washington has suffered
a loss of prestige at the United Nations and throughout the world
by its refusal to pay up.
	   The Republican-controlled Congress has balked at paying arrears
until the United Nations makes sweeping reforms that include
streamlining the organization. The United Nations contends that
those reforms have largely been implemented.
	   The payment, which the United Nations received Wednesday, brings
the total payments by the United States in 1998 for both the
regular budget and peacekeeping assessments to dlrs 586 million,
Connor said.
	   ``It should be noted that the United States has paid its budget
dues in full for the past three years running, and intends to
continue to do so,'' acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said in
a statement.
	   The U.S. dues will be used to cover most of the U.N. budget in
November and December, and will greatly reduce the projected U.N.
deficit for the year _ from dlrs 247 million to dlrs 50 million,
Connor said.
	   The budget deficit has been covered by dipping into peacekeeping
funds. In 1996, the United Nations borrowed dlrs 195 million from
peacekeeping operations and last year it borrowed dlrs 122 million,
Connor said.
	   He said that raiding the peacekeeping budget by about dlrs 800
million over the years meant that some countries could not be paid
at all for contributing troops and equipment for peacekeeping
operations.
	   This has affected the willingness of some countries to
participate in peacekeeping missions, he said.

Study: Arsenic brings remission for rare leukemia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JANET McCONNAUGHEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A form of arsenic once used in ant bait appears to be an
impressive new weapon against a rare form of leukemia, stopping the
disease completely in two-thirds of terminally ill patients in a
small study.
	   The results were spectacular, said one of the doctors who tested
the treatment on victims of acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL.
	   Of 12 patients given arsenic trioxide, 11 responded with
remission of their cancer, but the APL quickly returned in three.
All traces of the disease disappeared for up to 10 months in the
other eight patients. The 12th died of a brain hemorrhage caused by
APL but unrelated to the arsenic treatment, the researchers said.
	   The side effects were few and minor, according to the pilot
study done at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York
City and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
	   All 12 patients were extremely ill when the arsenic compound was
administered.
	   ``These were people on their way out. So to be able to treat and
completely eliminate the disease to below detectable levels _
that's extraordinary,'' said Dr. Robert E. Gallagher of New York's
Montefiore Medical Center. He was not involved in the study but
wrote an accompanying editorial.
	   Arsenic trioxide appears to be the most effective single drug
against APL, which strikes about 1,500 people in the United States
and 2,000 people elsewhere each year. But long-term studies are
needed to know if the compound can cure APL, said Dr. Steven
Soignet, lead author of the study.
	   It may be only the beginning of arsenic's use against cancer,
Gallagher said: Test-tube studies have indicated it may work
against other leukemias and even some tumors, including breast and
prostate cancer.
	   Memorial Sloan-Kettering is signing up patients for two more
pilot studies, one for other blood cancers and one for tumors, said
another of the researchers, Dr. Raymond Warrell Jr. Like the APL
patients, the new patients are people whose cancers are growing
despite all other treatments.
	   Researchers will probably ask the Food and Drug Administration
next year to approve arsenic trioxide as a regular treatment for
APL, Warrell said.
	   ``There has been such a spectacular response in patients who had
no alternative, that it's really in everyone's interest to approve
it as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   Arsenic alone is a poison and a carcinogen, but arsenic
compounds have been used as medicines for thousands of years. In
modern times, arsenic was the first effective treatment for
syphilis and is still used to treat African sleeping sickness.
	   The New York study was the first to confirm work in China, where
doctors did the first studies with arsenic trioxide and also
pioneered the current standard treatment for APL _ a vitamin A
derivative called all-trans-retinoic acid.
	   In a leukemia patient, instead of maturing into useful cells,
leukemia cells proliferate, crowding out mature white cells, red
blood cells and platelets.
	   Lack of red cells makes patients anemic, lack of white cells
makes it hard for their bodies to fight infection and lack of
platelets makes them bruise and bleed easily.
	   Retinoic acid makes the white cells mature. Arsenic apparently
makes them grow up partway and die. Researchers don't know how the
arsenic compound works. That's also the subject of intense study,
Warrell said.

Former Nova Scotia premier pleads not guilty to sex charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Gerald Regan, who was premier of
Nova Scotia from 1970-78, pleaded innocent Wednesday to eight
sex-related charges, including a rape charge dating to 1956.
	   The plea was entered during proceedings that otherwise focused
on selection of jurors for Regan's trial. Six jurors have been
selected thus far from a pool of 160 candidates.
	   Regan, 70, is standing trial as a result of accusations by three
women regarding incidents alleged to have occurred between 1956 and
1969. He faces one count of rape, two of attempted rape, three of
indecent assault, and two of unlawful detainment.

McGwire picked as AP player of the year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark McGwire, whose historic home run chase
captivated North America and reinvigorated the sport, is The
Associated Press Major League Baseball Player of the Year.
	   McGwire beat out Sammy Sosa in the race to break Roger Maris'
homer record and wound up hitting an impossible-to-imagine 70.
	   The St. Louis star shattered the 37-year-old mark of 61, a
number that had become part of American history. And he did it with
remarkable humility, paying respect to Maris' family and Sosa
throughout the pursuit and celebrating with his 10-year-old batboy
son, Matt.
	   ``I still can't figure out how I hit 70,'' McGwire said during
the World Series. ``It's hard enough to hit 62; 70 was
incredible.''
	   McGwire received 103 votes in balloting by AP newspaper and
broadcast members released Wednesday. Sosa, who hit 66 homers for
the Chicago Cubs, was second with 80 votes.
	   Seven other players tied for third with one vote each _
outfielders Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle, Albert Belle of the Chicago
White Sox and Eric Davis of Baltimore; pitchers Roger Clemens of
Toronto and Trevor Hoffman of San Diego; and shortstops Derek Jeter
of the New York Yankees and Nomar Garciaparra of Boston.
	   McGwire led the majors in slugging percentage (.752) and on-base
percentage (.470), helped by a National League-record 162 walks.
Playing his first full season in the NL, the Cardinals first
baseman had 147 RBIs, scored 130 runs and batted .299.
	   Sosa led the majors with 158 RBIs and 134 runs scored. The Cubs
right fielder batted .308 and also stole 18 bases.
	   Despite McGwire's accomplishments, the Cardinals finished just
83-79, 19 games behind in the NL Central. Sosa helped the Cubs go
90-73 and win the wild-card spot in a tiebreaking game with San
Francisco.
	   Leading the Cubs into the playoffs may give Sosa an edge over
McGwire in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player award, which the
Baseball Writers' Association of America will announce on Nov. 19.
	   ``He had a better year than I did,'' McGwire said recently of
Sosa, ``because he went to the playoffs.''
	   Even with expectations high for big totals in this expansion
season, McGwire managed to exceed them.
	   He began his record run with a grand slam on opening day. On
Sept. 8, with Sosa standing in right field at Busch Stadium,
McGwire broke Maris' record with plenty of games to spare.
	   Big Mac closed out his amazing year with two home runs on the
final day, including No. 70 on his last swing of the season. He
turned 35 a few days later, on Oct. 1.
	   ``I've amazed myself that I've stayed in such a tunnel for so
long throughout what I had to deal with as far as the media, the
expectations, almost every eye in the country watching,'' McGwire
said.
	   Along the way, McGwire had to deal with a controversy about
androstenedione, a muscle-enhancing supplement that he uses.
Baseball is now considering a ban on the substance, which is banned
in the NFL, Olympics and the NCAA.
	   ``We both had unbelievable years,'' McGwire said. ``No one in
the game of baseball has done what he and I did.''
	   Said Sosa: ``I always say that he was the man and he motivated
me. We had no jealousy.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pete Sampras survived a first-set scare against
Thomas Johansson before storming back to beat the Swede 7-6 (9-7),
6-1 in Wednesday's second round of the dlrs 2.55 million Paris
Open.
	   Serving at 3-5 in the first set, the world No. 1 saved two set
points before winning the game and immediately breaking Johansson's
service to force a first-set tie break.
	   Even then, Sampras needed to be at his best.
	   With the scores tied at five points each, he played a
breathtaking cross court backhand winner at full stretch.
	   The second set proved a much easier task, with Sampras in total
command and losing only one game.
	   ''I didn't feel too comfortable in the first set and it showed.
It took me a while to find my bearings,'' Sampras said. ''I was
struggling but I managed to squeek it out.''
	   ''Johansson played here a couple of days ago, so he was used the
conditions,'' Sampras added.
	   Richard Krajicek, the No. 11 seed, withdrew with a knee injury
while leading 5-2 in the final set, giving Marc Rosset of
Switzerland a place in the third round.
	   ''My season is finished,'' Krajicek said, adding that he will
have an operation on his left knee next week.
	   No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios, one of the players battling with
Sampras for the end-of-year No. 1 spot, had an easy second-round
contest, beating Todd Woodbridge, 6-0, 6-4.
	   Woodbridge had a 2-0 record against Rios, and the Chilean had
never previously won a match at the Paris Open. Despite that, the
match was one-sided from the start.
	   Thanks to some wayward Woodbridge serving and blistering
backhand returns from the Chilean, Rios took the first set without
losing a game. He won in just one hour and two minutes.
	   No. 3 seed Patrick Rafter was in equally good form, beating
France's Nicolas Escude 6-3, 6-1.
	   Rafter set the tone by breaking Escude's first service game, and
holding his remaining serves to take the set.
	   At 1-1 in the second set, Rafter broke service again with a
blisering forehand return that the Frenchman couldn't reach.
	   ''Today was the first time since the U.S. Open that I really got
rhythm on my serve,'' Rafter said. ''I also had a lot more
confidence with my knee, which has given me problems recently.''
	   Among other seeds to fall Wednesday were No. 12 seed Jonas
Bjorkman, who lost to fellow Swede Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-2, and
No. 15 Jan Siemerink, who was eliminated by American Vincent
Spadea, 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Spain's Albert Costa continued his dismal indoor form, crashing
out to unseeded Frenchman Jerome Golmard, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5.
	   Golmard's second-round win over the No. 16 seed means that the
Frenchman will face Sampras in the next round.
	   Clay court specialist Costa, who benefited from a bye in the
first round, has never won a match indoors.
	   Carlos Moya was another clay court specialist to lose, beaten by
Australia's Jason Stoltenberg, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Mark Philippoussis, this year's U.S. Open finalist, ousted
another seed, beating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic, 2-6, 6-4,
6-4.
	   After a fine start to the year, which saw him win the Australian
Open, No. 10 seed Korda has been in poor form recently.
	   Korda, 30, said he only decided to stay on the ATP tour for
another year after last month's Ostrava tournament.
	   ``I am not doing what I should be doing on the court. I really
need to win one match to change things. But I am not going to give
up,'' he said.
	   Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, had a tough second
round win, beating Magnus Norman of Sweden, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
	   No. 7 seed Karol Kucera was also pushed to three sets, before a
sparkling third set display against France's Fabrice Santoro.
	   The Slovak player eventually won 6-2, 3-6, 6-0.

 &UR; Chirac supports tough stance toward Baghdad &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Wednesday raised by a notch its tone of
firmness toward Iraq, with President Jacques Chirac expressing
solidarity with the tough American stance and calling Baghdad's
actions ``unacceptable.''
	   In telephone calls to President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Chirac assured the allies that France ``shares
the same analysis,'' Catherine Colonna said.
	   The remarks by Chirac raise to a new degree the message of
firmness by France, which had been working to get the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq eased in order to restart once-lucrative trade
ties.
	   Iraq abruptly ceased cooperation last weekend with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The United States is sounding out allies about the potential use
of military strikes, supported by Britain.
	   Such language has been avoided by French officials. But Colonna
quoted Chirac as saying in his conversation with Blair that Iraq
``must imperatively restart its cooperation with the United
Nations.''
	   ``Iraq is making a mistake,'' she quoted Chirac as saying, and
its action is ``unacceptable.''
	   France on Tuesday recalled its representative in Baghdad for
consultations.

Galatasary, Kaiserslautern pick up key wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Galatasary and Kaiserslautern of Germany
_ two underdogs to win Europe's top club soccer prize _ took big
steps toward the final eight of the Champions League with key
victories Wednesday.
	   Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Dynamo Kiev also picked up
key wins _ Dynamo beating English champion Arsenal 3-0 _ with early
favorites like Inter Milan and Juventus settling for draws.
	   With four of the six rotations completed, German champion
Kaiserslautern is the nearest of the 12 teams to clinching a place
with 10 points _ five ahead of its closest rival in Group F. One
more point will gain the quarterfinal berth.
	   Here's a look at each group:
 &UR; GROUP A &QC; 
	   In Amsterdam, Netherlands, Ajax Amsterdam drew level with
Olympiakos with a 2-0 win. They both have seven points to top the
group. Richard Witschge scored on a header in the 33rd and Dean
Gorre sealed the game two minutes from time with a 20-meter (yard)
chip over Greek keeper Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos.
	   In Zagreb, Croatia, Croatia Zagreb defeated Porto 3-1. Both
clubs have four points. Mihael Mikic, 18, scored in the 7th and
Tomislav Rukavina made it 2-0 in the 37th as his long shot went in
off a defender. Nuno Jardel scored for Porto in the 39th with the
final by Edin Mujcin in the 61st.
 &UR; GROUP B &QC; 
	   In Istanbul, Turkey, striker Hakan Sukur scored two goals (55th
and 74th) as Galatasaray beat Rosenborg 3-0. Galatasaray has seven
points from four games to lead the group. Rosenborg has five
points. Arif Erdem got the Turks' other goal as Galatasaray's
Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi missed several other key chances.
	   In Turin, Italy, Juventus of Turin, a European Champions Cup
finalist three years running, needed the help of an own-goal to
salvage its fourth straight draw in this season's competition, 1-1
against Spain's Athletic Bilbao. Julen Guerrero gave Athletic a 1-0
lead in the 45th. Athletic defender Mikel Lasa accidentally knocked
in the equalizer 21 minutes later off a corner kick mixup. Juventus
has four points and the Basques three.
 &UR; GROUP C &QC; 
	   In Graz, Austria, the Sturm Graz-Real Madrid game was washed out
and was set for Thursday. That was good news for the Austrians.
Real Madrid has six points in three matches and the Austrians have
lost all three including a 6-1 drubbing last month in Madrid.
	   In Moscow, Russia, Spartak Moscow and Inter Milan played a 1-1
draw with Diego Simeone notching the equalizer in the 89th on a
header off a free kick. Andrei Tikhonov gave Spartak the lead in
the 68th on a shot that hit the post and then went in off Inter
goalie Gianluca Pagliuca. Both clubs have seven points in four
games to lead the group, pending Sturm Graz-Real Madrid's game
Thursday.
 &UR; GROUP D &QC; 
	   In Barcelona, Spain, Bayern Munich won 2-1 to improve to seven
points, one behind Manchester United. Bayern got the winner in the
87th on a breakaway by Hasan Salihamidzic. Giovanni gave Barca a
1-0 lead in the 29th but Bayern tied in the 48th when Alexander
Zickler capitalized on a Spanish defensive error. Barca has four
points.
	   In Manchester, England, United exploded for four first-half goal
to beat Denmark's Brondby 5-0 to lead the group with eight points.
The English side beat Brondby 6-2 two weeks ago in Denmark. David
Beckham scored in the 7th with subsequent goals by Andy Cole
(13th), Phil Neville (15th), Dwight Yorke (27th) and Paul Scholes
(63rd). The Dane's played without No. 1 keeper Mogens Krogh.
 &UR; GROUP E &QC; 
	   In Kiev, Ukraine, Serhiy Rebrov, Oleksandr Holovko and Andriy
Shevchenko scored on a wet pitch as Ukraine champions Dynamo Kiev
defeated their English counterparts Arsenal 3-1. The win gave
Dynamo five points in four games, the same as Arsenal and Lens.
Rebrov scored on a penalty in the 27th, Holovko made it 2-0 on a
header in the 62nd, and Shevchenko, regarded as the best striker in
Europe, showed why in the 72nd on a perfectly struck free kick.
	   In Athens, Leonidas Vokolos scored in the 52nd for a 1-0 win for
Panathinaikos over Lens and first place in the tightest of the six
groups. The Greeks have six points. Vokolos scored off a free kick
by Nikos Limberopoulos.
 &UR; GROUP F &QC; 
	   In Kasierslautern, Germany, the German champions rallied for a
3-1 win over PSV, which played two-thirds of the match a man down.
The Germans have 10 points atop the group with Heslinki No. 2 with
five. PSV has three in last place. Ruud van Nistelrooy gave PSV a
1-0 lead in the 18th, but Juergen Rische got the equalizer in the
68th, Marco Reich made it 2-1 in the 77th and Marian Hristov scored
another in injury time.
	   In Lisbon, Portugal, an equalizer four minutes from the end by
Brazilian striker Luiz Antonio secured a 2-2 tie for Finland's HJK
Helsinki against Benfica. Hannu Tihinen gave Helsinki a 1-0 lead in
the 4th. Nuno Gomes and Bruno Calado scored late goals for Benfica
before Anotio equalized. Benfica has four points.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Unable to provide Hondurans such
basics as gasoline, food and water, a government overwhelmed by
Hurricane Mitch's destruction made an urgent appeal for
international aid Wednesday.
	   Across Central America, Hurricane Mitch has killed an estimated
9,000 people, and destroyed roads leading to areas where thousands
were still missing.
	   A revived Mitch was expected to hit Florida on Thursday as a
tropical storm, bringing 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cms) of rain.
Mitch had sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) Wednesday as it passed
northwest of Cuba, but there were no immediate reports of damage.
	   In Honduras, the largest cities have become virtual islands
accessible only by air. The U.S. Air Force was helping Honduras
deliver aid to remote towns, Communications Minister Tomas Lozano
said.
	   Honduran officials estimated their country's death toll at 7,000
on Wednesday, though no one knows how many really died. Some 11,000
people officially were listed as missing. Up to 1 million are
homeless, said Col. Rene Osorio of the national emergency
committee.
	   ``We really don't know what the numbers are. There are places we
haven't reached yet,''' Osorio said.
	   Mitch hit the Honduran coast last week and parked itself there,
dumping several feet (nearly 1 meter) of rain onto the poor nation
before moving across the Yucatan Peninsula and into the Gulf of
Mexico.
	   It left behind a stunning wake of death and devastation across
Central America.
	   ``How do we continue, without food, without sleep?'' said
Yolanda Marvella Arraya, 35, who has spent nights outside on a
soggy mattress along the debris-strewn banks of the Choluteca River
since flooding destroyed her family's home. ``I don't know what to
think. My mind needs help.''
	   In neighboring Nicaragua, as many as 2,400 were believed dead.
Rains there last week caused a crater lake atop the Casitas volcano
to break open Friday and spill tons of mud onto villages along the
slopes.
	   Nicaraguan military spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval warned that
land mines planted by guerrillas in the 1980s could surface in
flooded areas. An estimated 100,000 mines were left behind.
	   ``We encourage people to be extremely cautious when coming near
mined areas, which have been marked 'no entry','' he said.
	   Stung by opposition critics who say his government has failed to
adequately hand out food and medical supplies, President Arnoldo
Aleman said Wednesday he had asked the church to handle aid
distribution.
	   El Salvador declared the whole country a disaster area and
ordered three days of national mourning for the 239 dead there.
Some 58,000 homeless people gathered at improvised shelters, where
overcrowding is so severe it may lead to epidemic diseases, health
officials said.
	   In Guatemala, 194 were reported dead and at least 77,900 had
evacuated their homes. At least six people were killed in southern
Mexico and seven people died in Costa Rica. Throughout the region,
about 13,000 people are listed as missing.
	   The Nicaraguan government pleaded Wednesday for more helicopters
to deliver food and medical supplies. Its air force has only six
helicopters.
	   A U.S. Army base in Panama sent three helicopters to Nicaragua
on Monday and the U.S. government pledged to send another seven.
Mexico said it was sending 10, and Panama will send two more.
	   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo called U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday to urge that a large-scale international aid
effort be made. Zedillo's office said Clinton was ``highly
sympathetic'' and pledged to review aid efforts.
	   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II called on ``all public and
private institutions and all men of good will'' to do all they can
``in this grave moment of destruction and death.''
	   Obstacles to relief are daunting: countless roads are out in
Honduras, including main highways. Nearly all available aircraft
are being used in the search for survivors and victims in isolated
towns.
	   ``There are medicines available, but the problem is the same:
How do we transport it?'' said a frustrated Andres Aguiriano
Duarte, deputy commissioner of the emergency committee.
	   Citing food and other shortages, the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa
said families of the embassy's staff could leave if they wished.
	   The U.S. Peace Corps, with about 207 members in Honduras, was
pulling up stakes to Panama under a mandatory departure order.
Peace Corps personnel, Estell said, ``are in places where they
really can't use them right now.''

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Inter Milan's Diego Simeone scored on a
header off a free kick in the 89th minute to tie Spartak Moscow 1-1
in a Group C Champions League fourth-rotation match Wednesday.
	   Before a record crowd of 83,000 at Luzhniki Stadium, Spartak
took a 1-0 lead in the 68th minute on a shot from 10 meters (yards)
by Andrei Tikhonov that went in off the post and got behind Inter
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Ronaldo, who had played in only two matches this season as he
nurses tendinitis in both knees, started but was substituted for in
the 66th minute.
	   Both clubs have seven points in four games to lead the group,
pending Sturm Graz-Real Madrid's game Thursday. That match was
rained out Wednesday. Real Madrid has six points and the Austrians
have lost all three.
	   ``This game gave us a chance to hope for better future,'' said
Inter coach Luigi Simoni, whose job is on the line after a poor
start. ``Spartak showed a perfect game, but Inter found a chance to
tie.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ French officials, wary their credibility with NATO
might be damaged by a new spy case, on Wednesday sought to distance
themselves from a French officer accused of supplying information
on planned NATO strikes to Serbs.
	   But Defense Minister Alain Richard said that France's sense of
``relative calm'' would only be verified on the ground, when it
takes part shortly in a NATO security mission in Kosovo.
	   Pierre Bunel, a 46-year-old French army official posted in
Brussels, was arrested for allegedly supplying ``intelligence to a
foreign power.'' He faces 15 years in jail.
	   He is accused of supplying information on planned NATO air
strikes to Serbs during the October standoff with Kosovo.
	   Richard, speaking on the state-run television channel, said the
officer committed ``veritable treason.'' But he added that, working
within the French delegation to NATO, Bunel would not have had
access to operational plans.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine put a more optimistic face on
the spy case.
	   The matter, he said, is ``extremely regrettable,'' but ``in no
way'' will harm France's role in NATO.
	   ``What happened is in no way linked to our policies which are
totally clear,'' Vedrine told the LCI television channel. ``And our
partners are well aware of that.''
	   The French press has raised questions about the credibility of
France among its NATO allies. France is not part of NATO's military
wing and the Bunel case is the second incident this year involving
a French officer allegedly compromising NATO activities in the
Balkans.
	   French authorities earlier this year recalled Maj. Herve
Gourmelon from Bosnia following reports his contacts with former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic led NATO to abort a mission to
arrest Karadzic to face possible war crimes charges.

Galatasaray, Kaiserslautern pick up key wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Galatasaray &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Galatasaray and Kaiserslautern of Germany
_ two underdogs to win Europe's top club soccer prize _ took big
steps toward the final eight of the Champions League with key
victories Wednesday.
	   Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Dynamo Kiev also picked up
key wins _ Dynamo beating English champion Arsenal 3-0 _ with early
favorites like Inter Milan and Juventus settling for draws.
	   With four of the six rotations completed, German champion
Kaiserslautern is the nearest of the 12 teams to clinching a place
with 10 points _ five ahead of its closest rival in Group F. One
more point will gain the quarterfinal berth.
	   Here's a look at each group:
 &UR; GROUP A &QC; 
	   In Amsterdam, Netherlands, Ajax Amsterdam drew level with
Olympiakos with a 2-0 win. They both have seven points to top the
group. Richard Witschge scored on a header in the 33rd and Dean
Gorre sealed the game two minutes from time with a 20-meter (yard)
chip over Greek keeper Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos.
	   In Zagreb, Croatia, Croatia Zagreb defeated Porto 3-1. Both
clubs have four points. Mihael Mikic, 18, scored in the 7th and
Tomislav Rukavina made it 2-0 in the 37th as his long shot went in
off a defender. Nuno Jardel scored for Porto in the 39th with the
final by Edin Mujcin in the 61st.
 &UR; GROUP B &QC; 
	   In Istanbul, Turkey, striker Hakan Sukur scored two goals (55th
and 74th) as Galatasaray beat Rosenborg 3-0. Galatasaray has seven
points from four games to lead the group. Rosenborg has five
points. Arif Erdem got the Turks' other goal as Galatasaray's
Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi missed several other key chances.
	   In Turin, Italy, Juventus of Turin, a European Champions Cup
finalist three years running, needed the help of an own-goal to
salvage its fourth straight draw in this season's competition, 1-1
against Spain's Athletic Bilbao. Julen Guerrero gave Athletic a 1-0
lead in the 45th. Athletic defender Mikel Lasa accidentally knocked
in the equalizer 21 minutes later off a corner kick mixup. Juventus
has four points and the Basques three.
 &UR; GROUP C &QC; 
	   In Graz, Austria, the Sturm Graz-Real Madrid game was washed out
and was set for Thursday. That was good news for the Austrians.
Real Madrid has six points in three matches and the Austrians have
lost all three including a 6-1 drubbing last month in Madrid.
	   In Moscow, Russia, Spartak Moscow and Inter Milan played a 1-1
draw with Diego Simeone notching the equalizer in the 89th on a
header off a free kick. Andrei Tikhonov gave Spartak the lead in
the 68th on a shot that hit the post and then went in off Inter
goalie Gianluca Pagliuca. Both clubs have seven points in four
games to lead the group, pending Sturm Graz-Real Madrid's game
Thursday.
 &UR; GROUP D &QC; 
	   In Barcelona, Spain, Bayern Munich won 2-1 to improve to seven
points, one behind Manchester United. Bayern got the winner in the
87th on a breakaway by Hasan Salihamidzic. Giovanni gave Barca a
1-0 lead in the 29th but Bayern tied in the 48th when Alexander
Zickler capitalized on a Spanish defensive error. Barca has four
points.
	   In Manchester, England, United exploded for four first-half goal
to beat Denmark's Brondby 5-0 to lead the group with eight points.
The English side beat Brondby 6-2 two weeks ago in Denmark. David
Beckham scored in the 7th with subsequent goals by Andy Cole
(13th), Phil Neville (15th), Dwight Yorke (27th) and Paul Scholes
(63rd). The Dane's played without No. 1 keeper Mogens Krogh.
 &UR; GROUP E &QC; 
	   In Kiev, Ukraine, Serhiy Rebrov, Oleksandr Holovko and Andriy
Shevchenko scored on a wet pitch as Ukraine champions Dynamo Kiev
defeated their English counterparts Arsenal 3-1. The win gave
Dynamo five points in four games, the same as Arsenal and Lens.
Rebrov scored on a penalty in the 27th, Holovko made it 2-0 on a
header in the 62nd, and Shevchenko, regarded as the best striker in
Europe, showed why in the 72nd on a perfectly struck free kick.
	   In Athens, Leonidas Vokolos scored in the 52nd for a 1-0 win for
Panathinaikos over Lens and first place in the tightest of the six
groups. The Greeks have six points. Vokolos scored off a free kick
by Nikos Limberopoulos.
 &UR; GROUP F &QC; 
	   In Kasierslautern, Germany, the German champions rallied for a
3-1 win over PSV, which played two-thirds of the match a man down.
The Germans have 10 points atop the group with Heslinki No. 2 with
five. PSV has three in last place. Ruud van Nistelrooy gave PSV a
1-0 lead in the 18th, but Juergen Rische got the equalizer in the
68th, Marco Reich made it 2-1 in the 77th and Marian Hristov scored
another in injury time.
	   In Lisbon, Portugal, an equalizer four minutes from the end by
Brazilian striker Luiz Antonio secured a 2-2 tie for Finland's HJK
Helsinki against Benfica. Hannu Tihinen gave Helsinki a 1-0 lead in
the 4th. Nuno Gomes and Bruno Calado scored late goals for Benfica
before Anotio equalized. Benfica has four points.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Five members of Scottish sea rescue crews and a
Danish tugboat captain were honored Wednesday for their part in
saving the lives of 15 men on a storm-tossed freighter, in an
operation that cost the life of one rescuer.
	   Bill Deacon, a helicopter winchman swept to his death during the
Nov. 19 rescue attempt, and his three fellow crew members, Capt.
Norman Leask, Capt. David Gribben, and Paul Mansell, were awarded
the Edward and Maisie Lewis Award by the Shipwrecked Fishermen and
Mariners' Royal Benevolent Society at the central London ceremony.
	   Deacon's award was received on his behalf by Capt. John Follis,
operations director of Bristow Helicopters, based in Aberdeen,
Scotland, with whom Deacon had served for 10 years.
	   ``I am very honored to receive the award on behalf of Mrs.
Deacon,'' Follis said. ``I knew Bill for about 10 years and he was
an incredibly brave man.''
	   Hewitt Clark, 53, who works on the Lerwick, Scotland, lifeboat,
also received an award for his courage during the rescue.
	   Capt. John Gade, 57, from Soeborg, Denmark, received the Lady
Swaythling Trophy for his outstanding seamanship. The Danish
captain attached his tug, Maersk Champion, to the bow of the
stricken freighter, Green Lily, and managed to grapple her anchor
and tow the vessel to the shore.
	   ``I am very moved and highly honored to receive this prize. I
would like to say thank you on behalf of the whole crew,'' Gade
said after receiving the award.
	   The helicopter, rescue boat and tug responded to an S.O.S. when
the Green Lily was caught in a storm with 69-mph (111-kph) winds
and 30-foot (9-meter) waves east of the Shetland Islands.
	   Clark's rescue boat took five of the 15 crew members off the
freighter. Deacon was lowered onto the vessel and winched the 10
remaining Croat and Philippine crew to the rescue helicopter. But
before Deacon could be winched to safety, he was washed overboard
by a wave and drowned. He is survived by two children.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Ultranationalist Nikola
Poplasen was sworn in as president of the Bosnian Serb republic
Wednesday. Moderate Serbs took key assembly posts.
	   Poplasen heads the most extreme nationalist party in the
Serb-run half of Bosnia, and is a supporter of war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic.
	   He promised to honor the Dayton peace agreement and said he
would promote economic recovery through privatization and foreign
investment.
	   ``Our lasting orientation is certainly toward reaching
agreements with foreign companies and developing democracy,'' he
said.
	   Poplasen's victory nearly two months ago dealt a blow to
international efforts to cement peace, restart ethnic tolerance and
impose democracy in Bosnia after the 1995 agreement ended the 3-1/2
year war.
	   Poplasen defeated Biljana Plavsic, a former nationalist turned
moderate backed by the United States and other Western powers
	   An impasse between Serb moderates and hard-liners in the
parliament delayed the vote on a new assembly leadership, which is
required before the president-elect can take office.
	   Muslim and Croat deputies in the assembly broke the deadlock by
endorsing the moderates. Petar Djokic was named speaker, and two
other moderates were named to top leadership jobs as well.
	   Poplasen's next step is to name a premier, a post so far held by
Milorad Dodik, who has won praise from international officials for
implementing the Dayton peace agreement. Western officials have
insisted that Dodik remain in the post.
	   But the hard-liners have accused Dodik of betraying Serb
interests in Bosnia.

Brazilian government wins key test for austerity measures in
</HEADLINE>
Congress
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with outcome of first vote, will be topped if
parliament takes any further action. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
scored a crucial victory in his quest to approve a series of
belt-tightening measures Wednesday night, when Congress approved
the first of three measures in a social security reform bill.
	   Congress voted 337 to 119 to approve the measure, which would
put a monthly pension ceiling of 1,200 reals (dlrs 1,008) that
retirees can receive from the social security system. Any amount
above this must come from private pension funds.
	   The government must still vote on two more bills that are the
final touches of a social security reform bill introduced to
Congress nearly three years ago.
	   If approved, the bill is expected to save 3 billion reals (dlrs
2.5 billion), barely enough to make a dent in the deficit.
	   But it would go a long way toward proving that Brazil's Congress
is serious about cutting the country's ballooning budget deficit of
around dlrs 65 billion _ a worrisome 7 percent of the gross
domestic product.
	   Analysts say the vote will help the government measure its
chances of getting Congress to approve a package of fiscal
austerity measures unveiled last week.
	   ``If the articles are approved, the government will score an
important victory,'' said Bernard Appy of the LCA political and
economic consultancy firm. ``But more important will be the message
it will send the government _ a message that will say Congress is
willing to approve the fiscal austerity measures.''
	   If the government loses, warned Congressman Paulo Heslander,
``the fiscal adjustment measures will plunge into a black hole.''
	   Last week, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and spending
cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and some dlrs
80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by Congress.
	   On Tuesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso underscored the
importance of Congress's approval of the reform bill and the
multi-year fiscal stabilization plan.
	   ``The whole world is watching us, watching to see if we'll be
able to resolve the crisis,'' the president said.
	   If approved, the social security bill would also end so-called
``special retirements,'' which allowed certain workers to retire in
their 40s, and would keep workers from accumulating multiple
pensions.
	   The three items needed to complete the bill would institute a
minimum retirement age and require workers to contribute to the
social security system for a fixed number of years.
	   The government also wants to limit special benefits for workers
in hazardous jobs.

West Indies Cricket Board fires Lara as captain, Hooper as vice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
captain &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cricket board firing Lara as captain, Hooper as
vice captain; neither to take part in South Africa; will fine
players in London who continue with South Africa tour.

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ The West Indies Cricket Board fired
Brian Lara as team captain and Carl Hooper as his deputy Wednesday,
taking a tough stand against a revolt by players about fees for an
imminent three-month tour of South Africa.
	   Pat Rousseau, the board's president, said the two would not take
part in the South Africa tour and that selectors would meet Nov. 13
to replace them. The tour is scheduled to start Nov. 10 with a
one-day international.
	   Only seven of the team's 16 players arrived in Johannesburg on
Wednesday. The rest, including former captain Courtney Walsh and
paceman Curtley Ambrose defied the board's directive to travel to
South Africa on Tuesday.
	   Rousseau said senior players still in England would have 10
percent of their tour fee deducted and junior players 5 percent if
they went on to play in Africa.
	   Rousseau said the players' move ``has dealt a serious blow to
West Indies cricket and the public.''
	   There was no immediate response from the players, who were
represented at the Antigua meeting by David Holford, the newly
appointed chief executive officer of the West Indian Player's
Association and himself a former West Indies allrounder, and
association secretary Roland Holder, a West Indies batsman.
	   Walsh, who is president of the association, said in a telephone
call from his London hotel that the association would issue a
statement, probably from its Barbados headquarters on Thursday
morning.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the WICB implied that the dissent was
limited to Lara, a controversial but brilliant batsman who pulled
out of the team two days before its departure for the 1996
Aurstralia tour and abandoned the team following the third test
match on a 1995 tour of England, and Hooper, who also quit the
England tour.
	   But it has become clear that many more top players are involved,
enough that a pullout would hurt the West Indian's chances against
the tough South Africans, who beat them in Sunday's finals of the
Wills International Cup in Bangladesh.
	   The board also has a tougher task because it is not negotiating
with individuals but with the players' association, which recently
got a large cash contribution from the board, an office from the
Barbados government and on June 1 appointed its first executive
officer. The association could be looking for an opportunity to
show its mettle.
	   Neither side will discuss details of fees. But the Barbados
Nation newspaper on Wednesday said the players want to be paid
above their tour fee for one-day internationals and for a one-week
training camp to be held before the Nov. 10 start of the South
Africa tour; increased meal allowances; and some guarantee of
security in Johannesburg, where two Pakistani players were mugged
while on tour last year.
	   The Nation quoted unnamed Caribbean sources as saying that
players were upset that they would be paid less for the South
African tour than their 1996-1997 Australia tour, which also was a
five-test series. The Nation said those who had played in less than
15 test matches wouild be paid about dlrs 16,000 for South Africa,
compared to dlrs 22,000 to 25,000 for the Australia tour; and
senior players dlrs 50,000 to 60,000 compared to dlrs 60,000 to
70,000 for Australia.
	   Still, the West Indians are believed to be the highest paid
cricketers in the world, after the Australians.
	   The last major revolt by the West Indians came in 1978, when the
then-poorly paid islanders snubbed the regional team and contracted
to Australian magnate Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.
	   When that was disbanded, the West Indians negotiated
substantially better contracts with the board and began a 15-year
winning streak that had many thinking they were invincible.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A block of postage stamps claimed to be among the
world's oldest is up for sale in Britain at a price of 2.75 million
pounds (dlrs 4.5 million).
	   The 48 mint condition Twopenny Blues, which bear the image of
Queen Victoria, were issued in 1840 but were forgotten for more
than a century until they were discovered rolled inside an old
leather writing set by the Duke of Buccleuch's staff in 1945.
	   It is thought they were originally bought by Walter Francis, a
previous Duke of Buccleuch, to use on his household mail.
	   After its discovery, the set became part of two major private
collections before being acquired a few months ago by London stamp
dealers Spink and Sons Ltd., which is now selling them.
	   Dealers say it is the highest price ever asked for stamps. A
single Swedish postage stamp, dating from 1855, was sold at auction
in 1996 for 1.4 million pounds (dlrs 2.2 million), making it the
most expensive stamp ever sold, according to the Guinness Book of
Records.
	   But that could be eclipsed by the Twopenny Blue, which is
extremely rare in large blocks. And as the world's largest known
block of the world's first issue of postage stamps, the set should
attract not only collectors but also investors and speculators,
said Andrew Norris, managing director of Argyll Etkin, a dealer in
stamps and postal history.
	   The stamps were issued May 6, 1840, along with the Penny Black,
and have since become one of the great gems of philately. The
second largest block of Twopenny Blues is owned by Queen Elizabeth
II.
	   These stamps ``are probably the most important philatelic item
in the world,'' Spink director Richard Watkins was quoted as saying
in Wednesday's Daily Telegraph newspaper.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With the National Basketball Association season
slowly wasting away, collective bargaining talks went nowhere
quickly Wednesday.
	   The opposing sides in the labor dispute held their shortest
bargaining session since the lockout began, meeting for less than
two hours as commissioner David Stern seemed to be moving to a
divide-and-conquer strategy.
	   ``I believe the people we met with today would like to make a
deal,'' Stern said of union director Billy Hunter, president
Patrick Ewing and their attorneys.
	   ``Whether they'll be allowed to or not is going to be another
issue,'' Stern said, naming agents David Falk and Arn Tellem as the
main forces trying to scuttle a settlement that would benefit low-
and middle-income players at the expense of superstars.
	   The pointed comments by Stern represented one of his strongest
offensives to date in the increasingly contentious dispute that has
caused the league to cancel games for the first time in its
history.
	   Another 11 games were supposed to have been played Wednesday,
and with each passing day the likelihood increases that the season
will not start until late December or early January, if at all.
	   ``We estimate that we will pay out over a billion dollars (in
player) salaries. And the representatives that sat in the room with
us on behalf of those 400 players seem intent to have that billion
dollars, along with the sand in the hourglass, just drip away,''
Stern said.
	   ``My focus is trying to make the deal, not trying to cancel the
season. But we're just worlds apart, and NBA players are losing an
average of dlrs 14 million per game,'' Stern said.
	   From early in the day, when Stern and Hunter arrived minutes
apart on a chilly morning and immediately started sniping at each
other, it was apparent that the mood was negative and the prospects
for progress were remote.
	   Stern began his attack on agents before he even entered the
building, while Hunter blamed deputy commissioner Russ Granik for
the breakup of the previous round of talks Monday.
	   Less than two hours later, Hunter and his negotiating team were
exiting the building.
	   ``We're leaving quickly because we're not making any progress.
We need to back away until at least Friday,'' Hunter said. ``We're
just not going to capitulate at this moment.''
	   Stern, Granik and their attorneys then made their exit 30
minutes later.
	   Stern began his remarks by pointing out that the league had
offered increased minimum salaries for veterans, including a dlrs 1
million minimum for 10-year veterans, and a gradual phase-in of the
union's proposal for an average-salary exception to replace the old
dlrs 1 million exception.
	   He also explained that owners want to establish a maximum salary
equal to 25 and 35 percent of the salary cap.
	   ``I believe, with good reason, that agents for the high-end
players have now declared themselves, and they've decided that any
deal that has a limitation that would affect perhaps 30-40 players,
even though it would benefit the great mass of our 400 players, is
a deal that doesn't deserve to get done. That to me is what seems
to have changed the atmosphere of these talks since they ended last
Wednesday,'' Stern said.
	   Stern specifically named Falk and Tellem as the forces
preventing an agreement.
	   ``That statement is ludicrous,'' Tellem said. ``The union is
looking out for all the players.''
	   Stern announced one change in lockout policy, saying the league
will soon authorize teams to talk to their players.
	   ``We had prohibited them in the past because we didn't want
there to be any misunderstanding of our proposals,'' he said. ``At
this point with the season potentially hanging in the balance,
we're going to tell teams that they will be able to talk to players
who call and ask questions. It's important this not be viewed as
either undermining the union or disparaging our players.''
	   The league has already canceled the first month of the season,
although many agents and union officials believe Stern is bluffing
when he threatens to cancel the entire season.

Bills designate Flutie No. 1 quarterback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL PORTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ After playing savior for weeks,
Doug Flutie achieved greater status Wednesday: He was designated
the starting quarterback for the Buffalo Bills.
	   ``I know the question; the answer is Doug Flutie,'' Bills coach
Wade Phillips said. ``To me, it's an easy decision.'' He added that
injured Rob Johnson is now No. 2.
	   ``Rob will be working his way back as the backup, and that's
where we are,'' Phillips said.
	   ``I'm not a backup,'' said Johnson, who stopped just short of
saying he might seek a trade at some point if he isn't reinstated
as the starter. He said he would discuss the situation with his
agent, Leigh Steinberg.
	   But Johnson added that he understood the decision to go with
Flutie. ``Doug has his own cereal. He's on the cover of Sports
Illustrated,'' Johnson said.
	   ``Doug came in and did what he's supposed to do,'' said Bills
receiver Eric Moulds. ``Things are working out for us right now, so
I think Doug should get a chance.''
	   Ironically, Flutie said his decision to play for the Bills was
the only time he had joined a team ``and not been referred to as a
savior.''
	   Flutie has led the Bills to four wins. His performance, coupled
with Johnson's absence, were reasons enough to promote Flutie,
Phillips said.
	   The coach said he put the Bills first in relegating Johnson and
his dlrs 25 million contract on the bench. ``The team won four in a
row with a quarterback that is hot.''
	   Johnson completed 63.2 percent of his passes for five touchdowns
with three interceptions. But he was sacked 24 times to Flutie's
four.
	   ``He's come in to save the day,'' Phillips said of Flutie.
``He's a hero right now. He deserves to be playing.''
	   The Bills selected Johnson the starter last winter even before
he signed a 5-year contract. Flutie earns around dlrs 250,000 this
year, the National Football League minimum. Incentives already have
boosted his earnings on the season to about dlrs 1 million. He is
scheduled to make about dlrs 350,000 in base salary next year.
	   Flutie, the top-rated passer in the AFC and second in the league
behind Minnesota's Randall Cunningham, has played since Johnson
sustained a rib injury against the Colts on Oct. 11. The Bills have
won five games in a row, including a 26-21 victory over the 49ers
engineered by Johnson on Oct. 4.
	   Flutie, who led a fourth-quarter comeback against Miami last
week, faces the New York Jets on Sunday.
	   ``He's playing extremely well,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said.
``He certainly has a very good track record over the years, and
he's very unique. He's creative and I think he appears to have a
very good mind for the game.''
	   Flutie is undefeated at the Meadowlands, going 9-0 there. He led
the Patriots to a 14-13 win over the Jets at Giants Stadium on Nov.
13, 1988. Flutie won all seven games there for the USFL's New
Jersey General in 1985, and led Boston College to a 42-22 win over
Rutgers in 1983.

category codes:
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Unable to provide Hondurans such
basics as gasoline, food and water, a government overwhelmed by
Hurricane Mitch's destruction made an urgent appeal for
international aid Wednesday. Across Central America, Hurricane
Mitch has killed an estimated 9,000 people, and destroyed roads
leading to areas where thousands were still missing. A revived
Mitch was expected to hit Florida on Thursday as a tropical storm,
bringing 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cms) of rain. Mitch had sustained
winds of 45 mph (72 kph) Wednesday as it passed northwest of Cuba,
but there were no immediate reports of damage. (MITCH)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Blindsided by election setbacks, House
Republicans talked Wednesday of quickly wrapping up impeachment
proceedings against President Bill Clinton and raised the prospect
of challenges to Speaker Newt Gingrich or other party leaders.
Look, I'm the speaker, so I'll take responsibility,'' Gingrich said
at a morning-after news conference at home in Georgia as the names
of potential challengers began to circulate. ``We should probably
have aggressively pushed cutting taxes and saving Social Security
much harder than we did this year.'' At the same time, the Georgia
Republican spoke dismissively of any challenge to his own
leadership. House Democrats held a campaign-style pep rally at
which they depicted Tuesday's returns as a step on the road to
reclaiming a majority in two years. The Republicans lost five seats
in the House and the balance of power remain unchanged in the
Senate. It was the first time since 1934 that a president's party
had picked up seats in a midterm election. (US-ELECTION ROUNDUP)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Troops and shell-shocked civilians
surveyed the damage Wednesday after a three-day rebel siege that
dealt Colombia's beleaguered security forces perhaps their worst
blow in more than three decades of civil conflict. An estimated 150
soldiers and police were killed and 45 police officers captured in
the onslaught. The heavy losses underscored the military advantage
of the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and fueled
doubts about the sincerity of its professed interest in negotiating
peace. (COLOMBIA-REBELS)
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
scored a crucial victory in his quest to approve series of
belt-tightening measures Wednesday night, when Congress approved
the first of three measures in a social security reform bill.
Congress voted 337 to 119 to approve the measure that would put a
monthly pension ceiling of 1,200 reals (dlrs 1,008) which retirees
can receive from the social security system. Any amount above this
must come from private pension funds. The government must still
vote on two more bills that are the final touches of a social
security reform bill introduced to Congress nearly three years ago.
If approved, the bill is expected to save 3 billion reals (dlrs 2.5
billion), barely enough to make a dent in the deficit.
(BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fugitive Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden and a
top aide were indicted Wednesday in the U.S. Embassy bombings in
Africa and accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the
United States. Bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, identified as military
commander of bin Laden's organization, were charged in an
indictment returned in U.S. District Court. The U.S. State
Department announced rewards of up to dlrs 5 million for their
arrest and conviction. If convicted, both men could face the death
penalty. (US-BOMBINGS-CHARGES)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose Wednesday as gains by Democrats in
Tuesday's elections increased hope that the impeachment process
against President Bill Clinton will lose momentum and enable him to
focus on the U.S. economy and global financial crisis. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 76.99 points _ or by 0.9 percent _ to
8,783.14, regaining ground that was lost in a bout of late
afternoon selling that trimmed earlier gains to about 25 points.
The Dow rose as high as 148.30 and above 8,800 for the first time
since Aug. 3. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. economy is being held back by the
Asian crisis, but there are a number of pockets of strength, the
Federal Reserve reported Wednesday. The national survey of business
conditions left unanswered whether the central bank will cut
interest rates later this month. In a survey of business conditions
compiled by its 12 regional banks, the Fed said the ``pace of
economic expansion moderated in September and October amid signs of
slowing in some sectors.'' The biggest development was a continued
slowdown in manufacturing. Eleven of the 12 Fed regions reported a
slowing of production activity blamed primarily on foreign economic
turmoil, which has cut severely into U.S. exports. But the Fed's
report was remarkably balanced, noting numerous offsetting signs of
strength, ranging from stronger-than-expected retail sales in parts
of the country to robust residential construction. (US-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose against most major currencies
Wednesday as midterm election results suggested that the
Republicans' drive to impeach President Bill Clinton may falter. A
rebound on Wall Street also boosted the dollar. ``All in all, I
think the story is today that the election results ... quelled the
thought of impeachment proceedings,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a foreign
exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. In late New York
dealings, the dollar was quoted at 1.6657 marks, up from 1.6601
late Tuesday. The dollar also was changing hands at 116.60 yen, up
from 115.33. (US-DOLLAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After insisting it would pay its staggering
foreign debts this year and next, Russia gave up and announced
Wednesday it will have to ask its creditors to stretch out
payments. The government was scheduled to pay dlrs 3.5 billion this
year and dlrs 17.5 billion next year to foreign creditors. But
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said, ``Both tasks are
too much for our weakened economy.'' Russia's economy was swept up
in the global financial crisis last August. With its stock and
currency markets collapsing, the government devalued the national
currency, placed a moratorium on repayment of some debts and
shuttered some banks. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Industrial giant Siemens said Wednesday
that a major overhaul of its business cost 4 billion marks (dlrs
2.4 billion) in the financial year ended Sept. 30, causing 1.74
billion marks (dlrs 1.04 billion) more of extraordinary losses than
extraordinary gains. Consequently, Siemens said it had an adjusted
net profit of 92 million marks (dlrs 55.4 million), with an
unadjusted net profit of 2.66 billion marks (dlrs 1.6 billion). The
unadjusted net profit was a 2 percent increase over last year's
2.61 billion marks (dlrs 1.63 billion). Sales were 117.8 billion
marks (dlrs 73.6 billion) compared with 106.9 billion marks (dlrs
66.8 billion ) last year, an increase of 10 percent. But the
company said a restructuring plan announced last summer wiped out
much of the gains. (GERMANY-SIEMENS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The head of Pepsico Inc.'s North American
beverage division is putting his stamp on the managerial structure
of the second biggest U.S. soft drink concern. Philip Marineau,
president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America since
last December, notified employees Wednesday of organizational
changes and the people he has chosen for key posts. The changes
involved no layoffs or job cuts. Pepsi-Cola lost ground to industry
leader Coca-Cola Co. last year in its battle for share of the dlrs
54 billion U.S. soft drink market. (US-PEPSI-COLA-RESTRUCTURES)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by the turbulent global
economy and a pilot strike at U.S. partner Northwest, KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines on Wednesday posted a 25 percent drop in earnings.
KLM said operating profit for the second quarter ending Sept. 30
declined to 377 million guilders (dlrs 201 million). It said the
decline would have been only 11 percent if the figures included
results from its subsidiary, Martinair. KLM had issued a
profit-warning in which it said second-quarter results would be
hurt by the global financial turmoil and by extra costs related to
the strike at Northwest Airlines. (NETHERLANDS-EARNS-KLM)

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An arrest warrant was issued
Wednesday for Trevor Tutu, son of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, when he
failed to appear in court on charges of reckless or negligent
driving.
	   It was the second arrest warrant issued in the case. The first
was withdrawn after Tutu, 42, explained that he went to the wrong
court because he lost his summons.
	   The son of the Nobel Peace laureate is charged in connection
with a rush-hour traffic accident in Johannesburg on Jan. 22.
	   Tutu sustained minor injuries and his car was badly damaged.
Three other cars were damaged and one other driver was slightly
injured.

	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ Women's rights have increased in recent
generations, ``but there are many things that we have not
accomplished,'' Nobel Peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu says.
	   Menchu told her University of Arizona audience Tuesday that
there is a direct correlation between limited rights and high rates
of teen pregnancy and rape.
	   ``We have yet to accomplish institutional, global and legal
respect for women,'' she said. ``We have to begin with an effort, a
focus on education worldwide.''
	   Menchu, a Guatemalan leader internationally known for her work
in human rights and a leading Indian activist, was honored with the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 on the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
arrival in America.
	   ___
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Beatle wives Yoko Ono and Linda
McCartney liked each other. Really.
	   So says Ono, anyway. In a newspaper interview published
Wednesday, John Lennon's widow dismissed the commonly held belief
that she and Mrs. McCartney, who died of breast cancer in April,
didn't care for one another.
	   ``People always portrayed us as enemies, like two boxers on
opposite sides of the ring, but of course it was never really like
that,'' Ono was quoted as saying in the Liverpool Echo. ``In later
life especially, we became friends. We had an understanding of each
other. We had both married Beatles and we knew what that was
like.''
	   Ono and Mrs. McCartney _ wife of Lennon's songwriting partner,
Paul McCartney _ often have been portrayed as enemies, their mutual
disdain growing during the Beatles' final stormy days nearly three
decades ago.

Newspaper: Oasis star arrested after attacking photographer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oasis star Liam Gallagher has been arrested by
police after being accused of attacking a photographer and damaging
his camera equipment outside a pub, tabloid newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The Mirror said that Gallagher punched Mel Bouzad and smashed
his camera equipment after the photographer followed the singer to
a pub near his north London home. The newspaper said the incident
happened Wednesday after Gallagher had been on a 24-hour drinking
spree.
	   Gallagher, recently reunited with wife Patsy Kensit, was taken
to a police station where he was questioned. Scotland Yard said
Gallagher was bailed and must return to the station at a date to be
announced.
	   Johnny Hopkins, spokesman for Creation Records, Gallagher's
record label, said: ``Liam is fine. He is not injured. I don't
really want to comment until I have all the details.''
	   In November 1996 Gallagher, beloved by Britain's tabloid press
for his bad boy antics, was given a police caution after he was
caught in possession of cocaine.

Chaos swirls around efforts to get peace agreement launched
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Mideast peace agreement, scheduled to begin
this week, can't seem to get out of the starting blocks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing a surprisingly fierce
revolt on the right, has postponed Cabinet meeting after Cabinet
meeting set to approve the accord. He blames Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat for not coming up with promised security measures.
	   Palestinian negotiators see the stream of Israeli complaints as
stalling and an attempt to back out of the agreement. They appealed
for U.S. intervention.
	   American envoy Dennis Ross was expected to time his arrival so
that he came only after the Israeli Cabinet ratified the accord _
indicating an American reluctance to enter the fray.
	   Politicians from both Netanyahu's coalition and the liberal
opposition blamed the chaos on a lack of clarity, even sloppiness,
in the agreement reached at the Wye summit in Maryland.
	   For example, the published text does not refer to what Israel
says was a verbal agreement at Wye to arrest 30 Palestinians
suspect of terrorism, some of them serving in Arafat's police
force.
	   Netanyahu is demanding written U.S. assurances that they will be
rounded up, but there has been no U.S. backing so far for Israel's
claim that there was an understanding on this issue.
	   ``It's not a problem. Mr. Netanyahu made it a problem,'' said
Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. He said the Israeli
leader was ``trying to find pretexts and excuses for not
implementing.''
	   Arafat himself said that 12 of the Palestinian suspects were
already in jail.
	   Even though his aides repeatedly attacked Netanyahu in public,
Arafat himself played an unusually conciliatory role.
	   The Palestinian leader agreed to Netanyahu's request for a few
days delay in implementing the accord and then urged Israeli-Arab
members of the Israeli parliament to help Netanyahu get his budget
bill through parliament. The measure _ opposed by the liberal
opposition _ passed with Arab help by one vote.
	   Netanyahu's shaky coalition is made up of small right-wing
parties, many of whom oppose ceding land to the Palestinians and
have threatened to topple him if he carries out the accord. Failure
to pass the budget would be a no-confidence measure in Netanyahu's
government.
	   Also unclear was what the Palestine National Council, a
600-member parliament in exile, is expected to do about Israel's
demand that it cancel the PLO charter, which calls for Israel's
destruction.
	   Palestinians contend other bodies _ not the council _ will take
this action, and that the council will not vote on the accord
because it already did so two years ago. The Wye agreement says
council members will ``reaffirm'' decisions by the other branches
on nullification of the charter, but it doesn't say vote.
	   ``I'm telling you, if they don't vote, they won't receive
(territory),'' Netanyahu warned.
	   Adding to the confusion are arguments over the differences in
Hebrew and English texts of the Wye accord. Some reports suggested
Netanyahu's aides distributed texts that fudged key points, like
the PNC role.
	   Netanyahu said he was aware of the ``pain'' suffered by his
supporters over giving up land that was part of their Jewish
heritage. Jewish settlers like Mayor Ron Nachman of Ariel in the
West Bank said the Wye accord would endanger Jewish settlements.
	   ``There is a lot of disappointment among the people because they
never dreamt their government would give up land that has never
been in Palestinian hands,'' Nachman said. ``It will put many
Israeli communities in danger.''
	   Even some of Netanyahu's own aides are threatening to bolt over
the accord.
	   One is Rami Sadan, the prime minister's point man with the
religious voters who said on television that he was planning to
leave.
	   Influential rabbis, he later told The Associated Press, objected
to provisions of the accord, including the release of 750
Palestinian prisoners on the grounds that those involved in murder
could not be freed without a trial, according to Jewish religious
law.
	   In the end, Netanyahu is likely to force the agreement through
his 18-member Cabinet and the Knesset, where about 90 of the 120
members are expected to approve. But if he doesn't act soon,
Palestinian patience may evaporate, and the accord could begin to
unravel even before it gets off the ground.

	   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Ten-year-old Norlan Javier Ocejo
screamed in pain as a nurse lifted him onto his hospital bed. The
open wounds across his back were stuck to the bandages again, she
lamented.
	   ``I want to go home!'' he screamed, a trickle of blood flowing
down his leg from having been moved from chair to bed. ``I want my
mommy!''
	   Norlan's mother and father were in the hospital with him
Wednesday, but his older brother and younger sister were both
missing and presumed dead.
	   Hundreds of such survivors from a monstrous mudslide in
northwest Nicaragua packed a hospital in Chinandega after being
rescued from the region where as many as 2,000 people were killed
when soggy earth, trees and rocks came crashing down the side of a
volcano.
	   Norlan was brought to the hospital by helicopter Sunday from El
Porvenir, a community of about 150 families that was flattened when
pounding rains brought by Hurricane Mitch set off the tragedy
Friday morning.
	   Part of the 4,610-foot (1,405-meter) Casitas volcano's crater
collapsed, and water from its swollen lake cascaded down the face.
About 30 square miles (80 sq. kms) was transformed into an eerie
desert-like landscape, strewn with rotting corpses caked with mud.
	   Rescuers came out of the hills Tuesday with reports of 400
bodies found in a village called La Flor, said Dr. Juan Jose
Guadamuz, who tended to the injured in a sesame seed packing house
transformed into a shelter in Posoltega, 10 miles (16 kms)
southeast of Chinandega.
	   Guadamuz said the rescue workers told him 30 villagers were
still alive and had survived by eating dogs and pigs, which were
feeding on human bodies. The survivors told rescuers they did not
want to leave their homes for fear that what little they had left
would be stolen.
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega, the largest city near the
disaster area, said about 400 people have walked out of the region
since the mudslides began and 450 survivors in need of help were
believed to be elsewhere in the area.
	   Rescuers went out again Wednesday to search for survivors, but
hope was running out for anyone left alive after five days without
food or water.
	   Marcelo Narvaez Gonzalez rode into Posoltega on horseback from
El Ojochal, a town on the volcano slope where 10 families were
killed. Narvaez lost most of his relatives in the mudslide.
	   ``We have looked through the mud and we haven't found them,'' he
said.
	   The massive mudslide swept children from higher villages into El
Ojochal, he said. Residents managed to pull some out alive from the
mud and hoped that their parents had survived and would come for
them.
	   ``We've been taking care of them with the few chickens that we
have been surviving on,'' Narvaez said. Fifty-five families who
survived the disaster were waiting for help.
	   Rescue workers heard cries for help in the hills Tuesday, but
were unable to reach the people, said Isaac Travers, vice president
of the Red Cross in Chinandega. They were trying again Wednesday,
he said.
	   Travers described extraordinary rescue efforts, including
swimming across rivers to get to survivors and bringing them back
the same way.
	   Four farmers buried up to their chests in mud were screaming for
help late Monday, a Nicaraguan journalist and a local official said
Tuesday. But rescue workers could not reach the men, only 200
meters (yards) away _ the mud was too soft to walk on.
	   Zeledon told The Associated Press on Tuesday that 1,950 corpses
had been recovered in villages below the volcano. She said rescue
workers were burying and burning bodies in hopes of preventing the
spread of disease.
	   Other officials gave lower, but still ghastly tolls: The Red
Cross said 1,250, while the president's office said 1,338.
	   The government urged people living near Casitas and eight other
nearby volcanos to evacuate their homes Tuesday for fear of new
mudslides. Heavy rain has been falling in recent days.
	   Central American officials say more than 9,000 people died in
floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, which once was among the
strongest hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.

North Korea: No nuclear cooperation without U.S. action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ North Korea says it won't cooperate with
the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency until the United States keeps
its pledge to build two nuclear reactors, deliver heavy oil, and
lift sanctions.
	   North Korean Ambassador Kim Chang Guk told the General Assembly
that his country had kept its part of a 1994 agreement with the
United States and frozen its nuclear development program _ but he
accused the United States of not properly implementing any of its
obligations.
	   The United States has not taken steps to lift sanctions, has not
started construction on two light-water reactors, and has not
delivered heavy oil on schedule creating ``additional difficulties
in our economy,'' Kim said in a speech released Wednesday by the
North Korean embassy.
	   Now, he said, the United States claims it can't fulfill its part
of the agreement because Pyongyang is building a ``secret
underground structure for nuclear facility.''
	   U.S. and South Korean officials said in August they had detected
a huge underground construction site on a mountainside 40
kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Yongbyon, North Korea's main
nuclear complex.
	   The United States has said it suspects the construction is
nuclear-related, though it has no evidence. North Korea has denied
it, insisting the underground structure is for civilian use.
	   Kim repeated an offer to show the facility to the United States,
``on condition that when it is confirmed not to be (a) nuclear
facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering
and defaming my country.''
	   The United States negotiated the 1994 agreement after inspectors
from the International Atomic Energy Agency discovered that North
Korea was producing weapons-grade plutonium and had not given an
accurate accounting of its nuclear facilities.
	   The North Koreans, upset that the IAEA had gone to the council.
halted inspections of the nuclear facilities subjected to the
freeze. The Vienna-based organization has tried unsuccessfully for
the past four years to get permission from Pyonyang to allow its
inspectors back to verify how much plutonium the country has.
	   The North Korean ambassador spoke during a General Assembly
debate Monday on a resolution endorsing the IAEA report and
expressing deep concern about North Korea's refusal to allow IAEA
inspectors to monitor the freeze of nuclear facilities.
	   The resolution was approved by a vote of 113-1, with eight
abstentions. North Korea was the only country to vote against it.
	   Ambassador Kim argued that IAEA activities ``are inseparably
related'' to implementation of the 1994 agreement with the United
States.
	   North Korea ``does not have unilateral obligations to allow the
IAEA to conduct monitoring activities when the U.S. is not
fulfilling its obligations,'' Kim said.
	   For the IAEA and some countries to urge North Korea to resume
full cooperation with the nuclear inspectors ``without a single
word of the failure on the part of the U.S. to implement its
obligations of the agreement is none other than cowardly acts (cq)
of hypocrites bullying the weak,'' the ambassador said.
	   The United States is free to break the agreement if it regards
it ``as a nuisance,'' Kim said.
	   ``Once it is broken,'' he said, ``we will be free to develop our
independent nuclear power industry with our own technology and
resources without relying on the inconvenient technology of others
who would not readily share their technology with us.''

Iraq suggests revision of comprehensive review could ease impasse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council was poised to adopt a
resolution Thursday that demands Iraq resume cooperation with U.N.
arms inspectors but threatens no force if it doesn't.
	   Council members put the final touches on the draft Wednesday
evening, adding in a new element that appeared to address Iraqi
concerns about the council's willingness to consider lifting the
oil embargo on Iraq once U.N. inspectors have declared Iraq is
disarmed.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, suggested Wednesday that
Baghdad could reconsider its decision Saturday to halt cooperation
with inspectors if it got some indication from the council that
sanctions could be eased.
	   ``I think that would give us enough assurances,'' to reverse the
decision, Hamdoon said in an interview. ``We'll study that but this
is our basic requirement right now.''
	   The United States has prevented the council from giving Baghdad
those explicit assurances. But U.S. officials said Wednesday they
could go along with the revised draft resolution, which reaffirmed
the council's willingness to take up the matter of the length of
the embargo.
	   It wasn't clear, however, if that vague reference would be
enough for Iraq, which announced Saturday it was ending all
cooperation with inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, who
must certify Iraq has destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The draft, which diplomats said they expected to be adopted
Thursday, condemns Iraq's Saturday decision as a ``flagrant
violation'' of U.N. resolutions.
	   While it doesn't threaten any force, it notes past council
resolutions that threatened Iraq with the ``severest consequences''
if it failed to allow inspectors unfettered access to suspected
weapons sites.
	   Regardless, the United States has threatened Iraq with force if
it doesn't allow inspectors to do its work.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh called the resolution ``a
good, strong resolution,'' which condemns Iraq's decision as a
flagrant violation of U.N. demands. ``That's a very important
development from our point of view,'' he said.
	   Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the resolution by no means
authorizes the use of force.
	   Iraq said it halted all cooperation after the council released
an outline of how it would conduct a complete overview of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions that didn't allow for the
possibility that the oil embargo could be lifted.
	   Hamdoon said Iraq needed the council to conduct the
``comprehensive review'' under the context of so-called ``Paragraph
22'' of the 1991 resolution which set the terms for ending the Gulf
War, sparked when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   The paragraph allows for the oil embargo to be lifted once Iraq
is declared to have destroyed its banned weapons.

England slowly considers starting to _ gasp _ stay open late
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It never claimed to be the city that doesn't
sleep.
	   Even so, you might have thought you could manage in the capital
of ``Cool Britannia'' to order a martini after 11 p.m., catch the
subway home and then stop off at your local supermarket before
walking in your front door.
	   Good luck.
	   In London, and the rest of England, it has long been the
presumption that people will be tucked in bed by the time the clock
strikes midnight.
	   ``It is horrible _ but don't get me started,'' Gail Roslyn, 31,
said of the early closing hours as she sucked on a cigarette in
central London. ``They treat us like children.''
	   What she's complaining about is slowly being consigned to
history, nudged along by the American influence of round-the-clock
service. More and more segments of Britain are staying awake
outside banker's hours, though you sometimes have to look hard to
spot them.
	   There are rumbles about eventually allowing cities to set their
own hours, but licensing laws still require most pubs to close at
11 p.m. every day but Sunday, when they must shut at 10:30 p.m.
	   The London subway system, or the ``Tube'' as it is known, runs
its last train through the underground tunnels about 1 a.m. most
nights.
	   And forget about dashing to the supermarket to satisfy a
nocturnal snack attack. Though more markets are staying open later
now, the vast majority will be closed by 6 p.m., as will dry
cleaners, pharmacies and other service shops.
	   Outside London, the situation is even more pronounced.
	   In Lyme Regis, a small tourist community on England's southwest
coast, for example, the main grocery store proudly boasts
late-night hours: It stays open until 8 p.m.
	   ``There has always been a moralizing slant in English life _ a
traditional way of doing things that isn't easily changed,'' said
John Montgomery of Urban Cultures Ltd., a planning and design firm.
	   But merchants who have experimented with extended hours say
their customers love them.
	   A survey this summer of 20 areas in England and Wales by London
consultants Healey and Baker found that half the shops were now
open seven days a week, compared to only one-third last year.
	   Lakeside Shopping Center, a 320-store complex in southeast
England, decided in September to permanently extend its closing
hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays to Fridays.
	   ``We are seeing a lot of young professionals who work in central
London, get home and now still have time for three or four hours of
shopping,'' general manager Richard Belt said.
	   Similarly, Tesco and other large supermarket chains say
customers are demanding more flexibility about when they buy their
groceries, so many now provide at least limited 24-hour service.
	   ``I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was,'' said
Yvonne Court, Healey &AMP; Baker's head of retail research. ``Consumers
have got accustomed to being able to go buy a can of baked beans at
three in the morning.''
	   And while traditional pubs still abide by the closing
restrictions, most popular areas have at least a few clubs with
permission to pour drinks long past 11 p.m. _ although many require
an entrance fee or membership to get inside.
	   A government panel has even recommended ending the national
restrictions and letting each community decide closing hours for
itself, which could lead to 24-hour drinking establishments in some
areas.
	   ``It just seems unacceptable in this day and age to limit
people's choice and liberty,'' said Lord Christopher Haskins, who
chairs the panel.
	   Even the London Underground is experimenting. The subway will
yield to customer demand and offer its first-ever 24-hour run this
New Year's Eve, spokesman David Taylor said.
	   Most 24-hour advocates _ who plan a whole conference on the
concept in London this month _ know they have an uphill battle. And
they concede problems need to be worked out so that late hours
won't mean only more red-eyed staff members and increased noise and
traffic.
	   But the English are tired of early nights, they insist.
	   ``I think the majority of people would certainly like more
urbane and sophisticated leisure offerings,'' said Montgomery, the
development planner. ``Maybe we don't have to do the full 24 hours
_ but 18 hours would be nice.''

Stocks down, dollar higher in early Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices declined in early trading
Thursday as investors took profits following the previous day's
sharp gains. The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 182.65 points,
or 1.26 percent, to 14,320.16 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average gained 575.06 points, or 4.12
percent.
	   The dollar was traded at 117.12 yen, up 0.64 yen from late in
Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its late New York level of 116.60
yen overnight.
	   Tokyo stocks moved lower as traders locked in profits after the
Nikkei soared Wednesday on comments by influential Morgan Stanley
strategist Barton Biggs, who said Tokyo shares were undervalued.
	   Reports that the government will delay debating income,
corporate and housing tax cuts until the regular Parliament session
next year, rather than during an extra session this year, was also
hurting sentiment.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.37 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,102.99.
The TOPIX closed up 41.52 points, or 3.90 percent Wednesday.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar gained against the
yen as Japanese banks and investors bought the greenback following
the results of Wednesday's U.S. midterm elections.
	   The Democratic Party's stronger-than-expected showing blunted
worries over the possibility that President Bill Clinton would be
impeached, and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 76.99
points to 8,783.14.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.880 percent from Wednesday's finish of
0.870 percent, driving its price down to 108.15 yen from 108.24.

Republican double play: failed to energize base, helped Democrats
</HEADLINE>
rally theirs &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Democrats scored surprising midterm election
gains by courting voters with kitchen table issues like education
and Social Security, and watched gleefully as Republicans angered
their most loyal supporters and squandered millions in a failed
effort to make Clinton scandal the issue.
	   ``People were saying, `We want you to focus on quality of
life,'' U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday, as
chastened Republican leaders tried to explain the party's
disappointing showing. ``We need to listen more carefully.''
	   As ever, the campaign boiled down to turnout _ but with a twist.
Yes, Democrats did a better job of getting their core supporters to
the polls. Republicans accomplished an ignominious double play:
They failed to energize their base, yet helped Democrats rally
theirs.
	   Exit polls show turnout among self-described conservatives was
down 2 percent from 1994, though some Republicans cited anecdotal
evidence of a larger falling off. Conservative activists said a
capitulating Congress made many die-hard Republicans angry enough
to stay home.
	   The conservative agenda, including significant tax cuts,
anti-pornography legislation and a ban on late-term abortions, was
ignored or not accomplished. October compromises with President
Bill Clinton over the budget were especially rankling to
conservatives, who said they were taken for granted by party
leaders.
	   ``The accomplishments of the GOP (Republicans) in the last year
have been pathetic,'' said influential Christian broadcaster James
Dobson, who called for a shakeup of the leadership team.
	   ``Our people are not just wind-up dolls, that you just wind them
up and they go vote for certain, particular candidates,'' said
Christian Coalition director Randy Tate.
	   Perhaps sensing a problem in the last days of the campaign,
Republican leaders gambled by running TV advertising that attempted
to make the Lewinsky scandal an issue. They hoped it would tap into
anger among their base voters.
	   Yet even Dobson, who called the leadership cowardly for not
attacking Clinton sooner, dismissed the ads as ``too little, too
late. It was a Hail Mary at the end of the election.''
	   Said Tate: ``If that is your one obsession, and you have nothing
else to offer, and no other agenda, you're going to have
problems.''
	   Exit polls indicated voters thought Democrats had the winning
agenda. They held an advantage on three of the top four issues
cited by all voters _ education, Social Security and the economy.
Morality was a big issue, but it was almost exclusively a
Republican concern.
	   Republican leaders, now facing possible internal challenges,
said they learned their lesson.
	   ``We probably should have almost maniacally focused on cutting
taxes, reforming government, working on saving Social Security,''
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. The Georgia lawmaker also said
the party should consider devoting more resources to grassroots
get-out-the-vote efforts in the future.
	   That was the lesson for Democrats in 1996, when organized labor
spent millions of dollars on anti-Republican television ads in a
failed attempt to win back the House. This year, unions focused on
less glamorous door-to-door politicking that gets voters to the
polls, and it paid off: A healthy 22 percent of the electorate had
union members in their households.
	   Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts also paid dividends in the
Hispanic community, where turnout was 2 percent higher nationwide _
and significantly larger in California and New Mexico, where
Democrats scored big Tuesday night.
	   Black turnout nationally ran about even with 1994, but the
turnout was higher in states like Georgia and South Carolina, where
Democrats fared well, and in the districts of a few vulnerable
party incumbents.
	   Democrats believe the anti-Clinton ads gave blacks reason to
vote, given their sympathies with the president.
	   The ads didn't appear to do Republicans any good.
	   Of the 30 congressional districts in which the ads were aired,
Democrats won 18 of those races. Flush with cash, Republicans
bought time in races that they had little chance of winning. Some
Republican operatives say the money might have been better spent on
truly close races or poured into summertime ads, when Democrats
were not prepared to fire back.
	   ``Republicans had more money than common sense,'' said Rep.
Martin Frost of Texas, head of the Democratic House effort.
	   In addition, the ads were given more media attention than
intended _ exposing the Republican's anti-Clinton message to voters
who were turned off by it. That may explain Democratic gains among
independent and middle-class voters, a trend that especially helped
the party in competitive open districts.
	   ``It is clear that they had abandoned that moderate middle
ground and left it for Democrats to hold,'' gloated Democratic
Party co-chairman Roy Romer.

UN human rights report criticizes Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Voter intimidation and flat out bribery
marked Cambodia's recent elections, but the lack of media access
for opposition parties was of major concern, a U.N. human rights
report said.
	   ``Freedom of expression is a basic human right and one that is
essential if elections are to be free,'' the report said Wednesday.
``For them to be fair there is also a need for equitable access to
the media.''
	   All television stations and all but one radio station were
controlled by or afiliated with the Cambodian People's Party of
strongman Hun Sen, the report said. Opposition leaders were both
deprived of the right to broadcast their messages and were either
ignored or criticized by the CPP reports, the report said.
	   Hun Sen's party narrowly won the election but needs the
opposition's cooperation to attain the two-thirds vote in
parliament necessary to approve a new administration.
	   Opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
left Cambodia after Hun Sen's police started a crackdown on
anti-government demonstrators protesting the election results.
	   The report doesn't focus on the crackdown, but a previous report
released last week detailed 34 killings investigated by U.N. human
rights workers in August and September.

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ The West Indies Cricket Board fired
Brian Lara as team captain and Carl Hooper as his deputy for an
imminent three-month tour of South Africa, taking a tough stand
against a revolt by players about fees.
	   Pat Rousseau, the board's president, said Wednesday that
selectors would meet to name replacements as soon as possible. The
tour is scheduled to start Nov. 10 with a one-day international.
	   The decisions, which Rousseau told a news conference were
unanimous, caused an outcry. In Barbados, callers to a radio show
said the actions were draconian and called for the board to resign
or be fired.
	   Peter Short, a former cricket board president who is from
Barbados, predicted most of the team would abandon the tour.
	   He likened the crisis to a major revolt in 1978, when the
then-poorly paid islanders snubbed the regional team and contracted
to Australian magnate Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. The
ringleader then was Clive Lloyd, now manager of the team that is in
Johannesburg, and who captained the renegade team.
	   When that was disbanded, the West Indians negotiated
substantially better contracts with the board and began a 15-year
winning streak that earned it a reputation as the best team in the
world.
	   Only seven of the team's 16 players arrived in Johannesburg on
Wednesday.
	   The rest, including former captain Courtney Walsh and spaceman
Curtly Ambrose defied the board's directive to travel to South
Africa on Tuesday.
	   Rousseau said senior players still in England, including Walsh,
would have 10 percent of their tour fee deducted and junior players
5 percent if they went on to play in Africa. Rousseau said the
board had budgeted dlrs 555,000 for the tour. Another board
official said players were being paid up to dlrs 60,000, depending
on their seniority.
	   The Barbados Nation newspaper reported players want to be paid
above their tour fee for one-day internationals and for a one-week
training camp; increased meal allowances; and some guarantee of
security in Johannesburg, where two Pakistani players were mugged
while on tour last year.
	   The players' action ``has dealt a serious blow to West Indies
cricket and the public,'' Rousseau told reporters in Antigua, the
board's headquarters.
	   There was no immediate response from the players. Lara and
Hooper had been invited to the board's emergency meeting, but
pointedly stayed in London.
	   Instead, the players were represented by David Holford, the
newly appointed chief executive officer of the West Indian Player's
Association and himself a former West Indies allrounder, and
association secretary Roland Holder, a West Indies batsman.
	   Holder said after the meeting that, ``the players in England are
solidly behind Brian (Lara) and Carl (Hooper).''
	   Walsh, president of the association, said in a telephone call
from his London hotel that the association would issue a statement,
probably from its Barbados headquarters on Thursday morning. The
Caribbean News Agency reported that he was ``disappointed and
angry'' at the news.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the WICB implied that the dissent was
limited to Lara, a controversial but brilliant batsman who pulled
out of the team two days before its departure for the 1996
Australia tour and abandoned the team following the third test
match on a 1995 tour of England, and Hooper, who also quit the
England tour.
	   The board's hardball response Wednesday indicated they were
treating the two as troublesome ringleaders. Lara and Hooper have
been summoned before a disciplinary board in Antigua on Nov. 13,
Rousseau said.
	   But it has become clear that many more top players are involved,
enough that a pullout by the dissidents would hurt the West
Indian's chances against the South Africans, who beat them in
Sunday's final of the Wills International Cup in Bangladesh.
	   Thursday's promised statement will be the first occasion to
judge the mettle of the newly invigorated players' association,
essentially their union, which recently got a large cash
contribution from the board, an office from the Barbados government
and, on June 1, appointed its first executive officer.
	   Wednesday's decisions will provide more ammunition for critics
of the cricket board, often described as secretive, exclusive and
unwilling to account for its actions or expenditures. Recently it
has come under fire for drafting a new constitution without
consulting others and a decision to open an offshore bank account
on the British Virgin Islands that could further limit its
accountability.

Olympic Stadium unlikely to host IAAF final says official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The main stadium for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics is unlikely to host next year's IAAF track and field Grand
Prix final, an official said Thursday.
	   Athletics Australia competitions manager Brian Roe said the
event would probably prove too expensive for Sydney.
	   The venue for the Sept. 11, 1999 event _ one year and four days
out for the opening of the Sydney games _ will be decided later
this month on Nov. 18-19.
	   Sydney was considered an outsider anyway with Cologne, Germany,
tipped as the likely venue.
	   The IAAF requires host cities to pay all air travel for athletes
and agents and an extra U.S. dlrs 1 million in television rights.
	   ``Some years ago the IAAF actually used to give the successful
host city a grant to stage the event, but that went out some time
ago and we knew that when we bid,'' Roe said.
	   Roe said a failure to land the event would mean little to
Olympic organizers SOCOG. SOCOG is running test events in all
sports but the IAAF final was considered unsuitable.
	   ``It's not big enough to be a test event and also the IAAF
brings all of its own sponsors and suppliers so we wouldn't have
been able to test the timing or the computer systems, which are the
most important part of a test event,'' Roe said.
	   SOCOG's test event for track and field will be the New South
Wales schools track and field championships, which attract a large
number of athletes and a captive audience of schoolmates and
parents.

Anwar trial enters its fourth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's former
deputy prime minister, showed signs of weariness as he sat in a
straight-backed chair in the dock during the third day of his
trial, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Anwar appeared visibly tired during the closing hours of the
trial Wednesday, the Star daily said. He kept shifting, bending
forward and rubbing his forehead and the back of his head.
	   The trial was to resume Thursday with prosecution witnesses
continuing their testimony in an effort to establish that Anwar had
misused his position as Malaysia's No. 2 to force police to cover
up his illegal sexual acts.
	   A former head of police intelligence testified Wednesday that
Anwar forced Malaysian intelligence officers to use a secret method
called ``Operation Turning Over'' to intimidate people who had
accused the deputy prime minister of sexual misconduct.
	   Anwar, 51, faces five counts of corruption and five counts of
illegal sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were
fabricated because Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad considered his
popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, also his finance minister, on Sept. 2,
saying he was morally unfit.
	   Since Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20, tens of thousands of
Malaysians have participated in street protests demanding his
release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   During the trial, Anwar has been spending most of his time in
the dock taking notes on large sheets of paper and paying close
attention to the arguments.
	   During breaks, either for lunch or when the judge leaves the
courtroom, he talks to his family or diplomats who have been
attending the trial that is being closely watched by human rights
groups worldwide.
	   In another development, the national news agency Bernama
confirmed earlier reports that Mahathir is among the 52 people the
prosecution plans to call as witnesses.
	   Others in the list are Mahathir's chief economic advisor, Daim
Zainuddin, Malaysia's police chief, Abdul Rahim Noor, former
members of Anwar's staff and 20 policemen.

Wales producing thousands of maggots, leeches _ and that's not bad

<TEXT>
	   SWANSEA, Wales (AP) _ Amid the gentle, green hills of south
Wales, maggots and bloodsucking leeches are breeding at a shocking
rate, multiplying by the thousands.
	   And that _ believe it or not _ is a good thing.
	   The squiggly creatures, being bred in labs here, not only are
helping doctors save lives and limbs worldwide, they're drawing
attention to a region quietly developing into one of Britain's
leading biotechnology centers.
	   Once doctors and their patients overcome the squeamishness of
using fly larvae and bloodsucking worms to treat serious wounds,
they find maggots and leeches contribute to cleaning and healing
better than anything produced by man, distributors say.
	   ``More and more people are coming around,'' says Dr. Stephen
Thomas, a wound-therapy expert who heads the maggot-producing
Biosurgical Research Unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital in
Bridgend.
	   A resurgence in the use of the creatures _ both already had
established their place in medical history generations ago _ means
business is brisk in south Wales, home to what are billed as the
only commercial producers and exporters of maggots and leeches in
the world.
	   Inside Thomas' unit, white-coated workers are hunched over petri
dishes, separating fly eggs to be individually sterilized.
Sterilization is the hard part, he explains, and the process is a
closely guarded secret.
	   ``Our maggots are cleaner than the patient,'' Thomas boasts.
	   The sterile, 2-millimeter (0.08-inche) maggots that hatch _
offspring of a common coppery green housefly known as the ``green
bottle'' _ are herded into glass beakers labeled with the LarvE
brand name, and shipped around the world.
	   Price: 53 pounds (dlrs 90) for 80 to 100 hungry, squirming
maggots.
	   Since the unit opened three years ago, about 4,000 ``doses''
have gone out, primarily to Britain and the rest of Europe.
	   The larvae are applied to open wounds that have been stubborn to
heal, usually when all other treatments have failed. Covered with a
thin net bandage to keep them inside, the maggots eat dead,
decaying skin and make way for new tissue to grow. They get into
places antibiotics can't reach, don't attack living tissue and, in
about three days, are full and clamoring to get out.
	   David Powell, a 36-year-old musician from Porthcaul, Wales, is
sold.
	   Deep, stubborn ulcers on both of his heels got so bad over the
years that doctors were talking amputation. Desperate, Powell
agreed to have maggots applied. In three weeks, he says, they had
cleaned the wound ``quite dramatically,'' and will probably end up
saving his feet.
	   ``I was extremely nervous when they first brought them,'' Powell
says. ``But when I realized what the actual treatment entailed, now
it doesn't bother me in the slightest.''
	   The leeches bred and exported by Swansea-based Biopharm Ltd.
probably are a rung a two above maggots on the respect scale,
having gotten lots of publicity in the past decade for their unique
role in restoring blood circulation to grafted tissue and
surgically reattached digits, limbs and even ears.
	   Now, Biopharm has sales offices stocked with leeches in Japan,
Korea, Italy, South Africa and the United States. The U.S. office,
in Charleston, S.C., also houses the Medical Leech Museum.
	   The slimy black worms, eventually sold to hospitals for 10
pounds (dlrs 17) each, begin life in tanks in a modest building
behind the rural home of Roy T. Sawyer, an American-born scientist
known as the world's foremost authority on leeches.
	   With as many as 30,000 leeches always on hand, manager Marian
Gower is prepared to ship them out quickly, day or night. Biopharm
sells about 20,000 a year.
	   The use of leeches is at least as old as medical literature,
with the first references appearing as early as 130 B.C. At various
times, they were used to treat complaints ranging from epilepsy and
obesity to hemorrhoids.
	   Now, though, medicinal leeches are sought because they make
patients bleed. Sometimes when severed limbs or fingers are
reattached, delicate veins become clogged, causing a dangerous
buildup of blood.
	   A 3-inch (76-millimeter) leech _ Biopharm starves them for
months so they'll be ready to eat _ suctions itself to the skin
with one end and makes a Y-shaped pronged bite with the other. It
also releases strong anticoagulants, which cause the bite to bleed
for 10 hours after the 20-minute feeding.
	   ``What the leech does is create artificial circulation,'' Ms.
Gower says. While the wound bleeds, the veins have time to heal.
	   Leeches are back in vogue because researchers have been unable
to match the potency and effectiveness of their natural
anticoagulants, Ms. Gower says.
	   Joseph Upton, a Boston microsurgeon and Harvard University
professor, swears by leeches. He gave them medical credibility in
1986 when he used Welsh leeches to save a 5-year-old boy's
reimplanted ear, which had been bitten off by a dog.
	   ``There's really nothing new in science and medicine,'' Upton
says in the New York medical journal MD. ``The resourceful
physician looks to nature for solutions to biological problems.''
	   Opened by Sawyer 15 years ago, Biopharm now services 28
countries, but half the leeches produced stay in Britain for use in
the National Health Service, the country's universal health care
program.
	   ``Patients become quite fond of them,'' Ms. Gower insists, ``and
children even give them names.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The president of the Mexico's Red Cross has
announced he will resign in January to put an end to ``gossip''
over allegations that he diverted some dlrs 200,000 in funds.
	   Jose Barroso Chavez said he asked Red Cross leaders Tuesday to
move up their 1999 annual assembly from April, when he originally
was set to end his term, to early January, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   Barroso has denied mismanaging any funds.
	   In September, 10 members of the Red Cross executive board
resigned to protest management irregularities, including the
alleged misspending of two-thirds of a dlrs 300,000 donation from
the U.S. government in 1997.
	   Barroso had said the money was used to Biu medicine from the
Foundation for Social Support, another nonprofit group he heads.
But his critics said he could not prove that the Red Cross had ever
received the medicine.
	   The Red Cross supervisory board later said an additional dlrs
150,000 appeared to be missing.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Shining Path guerrillas killed three farmers
attending a religious festival in Peru's central jungle, possibly
in reprisal for the capture of one of their leaders, authorities
said on Wednesday.
	   The farmers, two men and a woman, were dragged from the
festival, taken to separate locations and shot. The Maoist rebels
hung signs around their necks saying ``soplon'' or ``informer'' in
Spanish, the army said.
	   The killings took place in the village of Pueblo Nuevo, about
200 miles (330 kms) northeast of Lima, on Monday, the same day that
President Alberto Fujimori announced the capture of a top Shining
Path leader.
	   Fujimori said that police captured Jenny Rodriguez Neyra, the
third-highest ranking rebel still in activity, in the same region
as the triple killing.
	   The once-powerful Shining Path rebels have suffered a series of
major setbacks in the past six years, including the capture of most
of their leaders.
	   Rebel columns continue to operate in remote parts of Peru's
north and central jungles, experts say.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The Dominican Republic
said it will free 59 murderers, rapists and other inmates deported
by the United States on Wednesday.
	   The Dominican government said the convicts had committed no
crimes in the country.
	   None of the convicts have completed the sentences they received
in the United States, but police said they had no information on
how much jail time each still owes.
	   The United States has infuriated Caribbean leaders with
increasing numbers of inmate deportations. Countries claim the
convicts are causing a surge in crime in their countries.
	   Their deportations came hours after a visit by John Hamilton, a
U.S. assistant secretary of state, to the Dominican Republic.
	   During his visit, Hamilton spoke with President Leonel Fernandez
about U.S. requests to extradite hundreds of fugitives hiding in
the Dominican Republic. Fernandez has said he would ask for a
reduction in inmate repatriations in exchange for extraditions.
	   In all, 1,508 criminals have been deported to the Dominican
Republic this year. Dominican officials say 10 deportees have been
killed by police this year as they tried to commit crimes.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ France's ambassador said a Peruvian court
ruling stripping a French company of its stake in Latin America's
largest gold mine has ``poisoned'' relations between the countries,
a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The French state exploration company Bureau de Recherches
Geoligiques et Mineres (BRGM) has lost dlrs 560 million due to the
ruling, which the French government thinks was unfair, said
Ambassador Antoine Blanca.
	   ``The French government is convinced that the case was not
handled with equity; that there were interventions in the judicial
process,'' he told the Lima newspaper Gestion.
	   He said he had asked his government to send a high-ranking
French minister to visit Peru next year to improve strained
relations.
	   Peru's Supreme Court in June ruled that BRGM had to transfer its
25 percent stake in the Yanacocha gold mine to Denver's Newmont and
Peru's Buenaventura mining companies.
	   The three companies had jointly owned Yanacocha until BRGM sold
its share to the Australian company Normandy.
	   Newmont and Buenaventura claimed they had pre-emptive rights to
block the sale, and the court upheld their position.
	   Peru's government has said it had no role in the ruling.

South Korean student jailed for drink-driving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTORUA, New Zealand (AP) _ A South Korean driving drunk who
almost hit a car carrying five Somali refugees has been sentenced
to six months' in jail.
	   Won Kyu Kang, 27, an Auckland-based student, pleaded guilty in
the Rotorua District Court to driving without a license, dangerous
driving, failing to give police information about himself and
driving drunk. He had four previous drunk-driving convictions.
	   Besides the jail term, handed down Wednesday, Kang was
indefinitely suspended from holding or obtaining a driver's
license.
	   Defense lawyer Paula Hayman-Halton said Kang was deeply
remorseful for what had happened and his 10 days in custody after
the incident had given him a short, sharp shock.
	   The Auckland student's behavior had occurred because his
loneliness in a foreign country had taken over his better judgment,
she said.
	   Judge Chris McGuire said a motorist saw Kang driving at 60 mph
(100 kph) on the wrong side of the road at night and had called
police. Kang stayed on the wrong side of the road and narrowly
missed a car carrying five Somali refugees.
	   McGuire said he had no doubt lives would have been lost if the

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A plane crash in Costa Rica killed
three people, one of them a Spanish citizen, aviation authorities
said.
	   The charter flight crashed Tuesday in a hillside area known as
Casquillo, 50 miles (75 kms) southwest of the capital, killing
Spanish pilot Jose Maria Arambu, co-pilot Eduardo Bolanos and
tourist guide Eric Salazar, Red Cross spokesman Marvin Hidalgo
said.
	   Aviation authorities said the crash of the Cessna light plane is
believed to have been caused by torrential rainfall and poor

Researchers give salmon glow-in-the-dark markers

<TEXT>
	   LAMAR, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Biologists working to restore New
England's Atlantic salmon runs will dump about 8 million sac-fry
into the Connecticut River next spring.
	   How many will make it out to the Atlantic Ocean? Beats them.
	   In a few years, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Jerre
Mohler hopes researchers will have answers. He wants to dunk every
hatchery-grown salmon in an orange chemical 60 days after the fish
wriggles out of the egg. That way, when a salmon is recaptured,
scientists could punch out a piece of tail fin, slide it under a
microscope and solve the mystery.
	   If it glows bright green, it must be hatchery produced.
	   Identifying the salmon they've stocked would tell biologists
whether their program to restore the decimated salmon population is
working _ something that's cloudy right now.
	   Consider the Connecticut, where they have stocked 32 million
inch-long (2.5 centimeter long) sac-fries since 1974. Only 4,378
have returned as 5-year-olds to spawn.
	   ``We really have no way of marking them right now,'' Mohler
said. ``You can measure your success now by the number of adults
that come back. But you don't know where you might have stocked the
fry that was best.''
	   By marking them with Mohler's chemical _ called calcein _
scientists would be able to track how many sac-fry survive certain
tributaries, how many go downstream to the Atlantic and how many of
the hatchery-grown salmon return to spawn.
	   ``The reason you want to be able to tell them apart is you want
to see what worked best,'' said Janice Rowan, coordinator of the
Connecticut River salmon project for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
If one tributary seems to be well suited for salmon sac-fry,
scientists could focus stocking efforts there.
	   But biologists will have to wait for that kind of information.
Mohler's marked fish won't be released anytime soon, because
calcein is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
	   ``The fact that it can't be used on humans is one of the
roadblocks we're facing with using it on fish,'' Mohler said. ``The
fish that we apply it to could potentially be food fish.''
	   For now, he's perfecting the process. The tiny fish are immersed
in an orange solution (``It looks like antifreeze,'' he says) for
24 to 48 hours. The process kills between 1 percent and 10 percent
of the salmon. But in the ones that survive, the chemical doesn't
seem to have an adverse effect.
	   The fish seem to ``grow equally well. We haven't noticed any
different behavior,'' he said.
	   Today, the Fish and Wildlife Service's Northeast Fishery Center
in Lamar has about 400 16- to 18-inch (40- to 46-centimeter) salmon
who received the treatment in 1996 and a few hundred more that have
been marked since then. In 2-year-olds, the chemical mark is still
visible under a microscope and lit by ultraviolet rays.
	   The challenge now is figuring out how to find the mark in an
adult fish. The entire tail of the inch-long (2.5-centimeter-long)
sac-fry is marked but, as the fish grows, the chemical mark remains
the same size _ just a few millimeters (less than an inch) _ and is
buried under new fin tissue.
	   If the FDA approval comes through, calcein marking would be a
giant step, Mohler and Rowan say.
	   Oxytetracycline, an antibiotic that turns human teeth yellow,
can be used to mark a fish's bones, but biologists have to kill a
fish and pull out the bones to find the mark.
	   In larger fish, especially striped bass, a 0.5-millimeter
(0.02-inch) wire is inserted in the snout, and captured fish can be
identified by a metal detector. But tagging inch-long
(2.5-centimeter-long) salmon is too difficult, and the wires often
lodge in the sac-fries' eyes or brains.
	   Scientists are experimenting with other identification options:
using the natural isotopes that young fish pick up from the rocks
around their home tributary, and using a fish's DNA mark.
	   ``The whole idea of marking fry is brand-new territory,'' Rowan
said.

South Korean student jailed for drunk-driving

<TEXT>
	   ROTORUA, New Zealand (AP) _ A South Korean driving drunk who
almost hit a car carrying five Somali refugees has been sentenced
to six months' in jail.
	   Won Kyu Kang, 27, an Auckland-based student, pleaded guilty in
the Rotorua District Court to driving without a license, dangerous
driving, failing to give police information about himself and
driving drunk. He had four previous drunk-driving convictions.
	   Besides the jail term, handed down Wednesday, Kang was
indefinitely suspended from holding or obtaining a driver's
license.
	   Defense lawyer Paula Hayman-Halton said Kang was deeply
remorseful for what had happened and his 10 days in custody after
the incident had given him a short, sharp shock.
	   The Auckland student's behavior had occurred because his
loneliness in a foreign country had taken over his better judgment,
she said.
	   Judge Chris McGuire said a motorist saw Kang driving at 60 mph
(100 kph) on the wrong side of the road at night and had called
police. Kang stayed on the wrong side of the road and narrowly
missed a car carrying five Somali refugees.
	   McGuire said he had no doubt lives would have been lost if the
Somali car had not swerved out of the way.
	   McGuire said that while Kang was not being sentenced for his
previous mistakes, the latest charges against him came only 26 days
after he was last sentenced for similar offenses.
	   McGuire said did not believe the student was an innocent abroad
unfamiliar with the laws of the country because he had come in
contact with them on four other occasions.

Researchers develop new test for measuring `unconscious prejudice'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE TIBBITS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Researchers at the University of Washington and
Yale University have developed a new tool to measure people's
``unconscious prejudice.'
	   They cautioned that results from the Implicit Association Test _
that unconscious prejudice occurs in nine of 10 people _ could be
disturbing, especially among those who consider themselves
prejudice-free.
	   The researchers, psychology professors Anthony Greenwald of the
University of Washington and Mahzarin Banaji of Yale University,
recently activated a World Wide Web site that allows people to test
their own levels of inadvertent prejudice and stereotyping.
	   People who take the test ``either say `Oh, my God,' or they say
`I don't believe it,' '' Banaji said. The ingrained prejudices, she
said, appear to be cultural influences learned over the course of a
lifetime.
	   Greenwald said he was especially bothered to find the test
uncovered subtle prejudices in himself, along with virtually
everyone else who takes it. And he fully understands those who
don't want to hear that message, he said.
	   ``I really don't believe I'm prejudiced, but I believe I have
what I conveniently describe as the unconscious roots of
prejudice,'' Greenwald said.
	   The test, which Greenwald said was an outgrowth of other
established techniques in social psychology, measures ``implicit
attitudes'': positive or negative thoughts about one object that
are powerful enough to rub off on associated objects. As an
example, a person may have a positive view of a company because a
loved one works for it.
	   Frequently, Banaji and Greenwald say, people are completely
unaware they have such attitudes, which can be the exact opposite
of a person's stated or ``explicit'' views.
	   The Web site (http://depts.washington.edu/iat/) offers four
tests, measuring unconscious prejudices of black vs. white people,
old vs. young, gender stereotypes, and self-esteem _ whether
there's an automatic preference for oneself.
	   In the race test, which is typical of the four, participants are
asked to classify as quickly as possible a list of names into those
that are most often considered black, such as Jamal or Lashonda,
and those most often considered white, such as Chip or Peggy. Next,
they are asked to rapidly classify a list of words as ``good'' in
meaning, such as love and happy, or ``bad,'' such as war or evil.
	   Participants then are timed as they group the names and words
into two new lists: white names and good words, and black names and
bad words. The test is then switched: participants group white
names and bad words, and black names and good words.
	   While on the surface the final two tests appear equally
difficult, in nearly all cases, Banaji and Greenwald say, people
take longer when grouping black names and good words than when
grouping white names and good words. That, they say, indicates an
automatic, unconscious preference for white names.
	   The latent prejudices appear stronger among whites and Asians
than among blacks, Banaji said, though more research is being done
on variations in responses by nonwhites.
	   Tests, including one administered to 1,300 incoming freshmen at
Yale, have consistently found unconscious prejudices in 90 percent
to 95 percent of participants, the researchers said.
	   Tests were checked to see whether the order of questions, name
or word familiarity or other factors affected how people responded,
but the results remained much the same. In some cases, the names
were replaced with pictures of black or white faces.
	   ``We believe it reveals something that is pretty
uncontrollable,'' Greenwald said.
	   Curtis Hardin, an associate professor of psychology at UCLA, has
been using the test both in research and teaching.
	   ``I use it as a class demonstration and it never fails,'' Hardin
said.
	   While there are other tests that demonstrate prejudice, ``This
is a beautiful, elegant way of showing it because people can see it
happening themselves,'' he said.
	   A description of the Implicit Association Test was published
earlier this year in the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology, and Banaji and Greenwald say it's being rapidly adopted
as a tool by other researchers.
	   Among such projects under way is a study in Germany of prejudice
between Bavarians and North Germans, research at Northwestern
University into attitudes toward the overweight, studies at Yale on
identity, favoritism and self-esteem among black Americans and
white Americans, and research at the University of North Florida on
attitudes toward mathematics by elementary teachers.
	   Scott Ottaway, an assistant psychology professor at Western
Washington University, tested whether subjects' familiarity with
the words used in the list affected results.
	   For white undergraduate students taking the racial prejudice
test, ``basically, what we found are even stronger effects'' when
adjustments were made for how familiar the students were with the
words and how often they had seen them, Ottaway said.
	   ``Once you've equated all those factors, there's really no
alternative explanation other than people associate white names
with pleasant words and black names with unpleasant words,'' he
said.
	   Ottaway said it's too early to tell whether the test can be used
to predict an individual's behavior.
	   ``This is a very important qualification,'' he said. ``It
appears these biases are automatic, but it doesn't mean they can't
be overcome.''
	   Because of that, Greenwald and Banaji caution that the test has
potential for being misused outside of research laboratories. They
especially are worried that it could be used to screen people for
jobs or try to probe people's unconscious likes or dislikes.
	   The goal of the new Web site is not so much fostering research
as it is self-awareness. People who take the tests via the Internet
don't have to identify themselves, or necessarily tell the truth in
their responses, Greenwald noted. Although some statistics will be
kept on the Web site, there are no plans at present to use the data
or the site for research, he said.
	   ``Right now, we want to use the Web site as a place to educate
people about themselves,'' Banaji said.
	   ``There's an old-fashioned term _ consciousness-raising,''
Greenwald said.

``Stingray shuffle'' is good advice, if not exactly scientific
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Florida (AP) _ Residents and tourists along the Gulf
shore of southwest Florida are greeted by signs advising beachgoers
to ``do the stingray shuffle.''
	   The signs are intended to help swimmers avoid the painful sting
of bluntnose stingrays, which bury themselves in the sand in
shallow waters near the shore. By shuffling their feet, the theory
goes, bathers can startle the stingrays into fleeing before
stepping on one.
	   Despite widespread acceptance of the ``stingray shuffle,''
there's no evidence to prove it works, according to Sarah Sedoruk,
a junior at Southampton College in New York who is pursuing a
degree in psychobiology and animal behavior.
	   She designed an experiment that would test at what distance the
stingrays would flee from people.
	   She spent her summer vacation on the project working with Deb
Chaffee, a microbiology student at the University of New Hampshire,
and Ron Swaim, a naturalist and volunteer at Rookery Bay National
Estuarine Research Reserve near Naples.
	   The trio spent six hours three to four days each week for seven
weeks catching and tagging the bluntnose rays' and studying their
behavior.
	   The sand-colored bluntnose ray averages six inches (15
centimeters) across the width of its body. The rays prefer a gentle
slope, shallow water with minimal surf.
	   In May and early June, the bluntnose stingrays give birth to
their young in the shallow waters along the southwest Florida
coastline. Records since 1996 from two hospitals in Naples
indicated the highest rate of sting incidents occur in May, with 63
reports in May 1996 and again in 1997, Sedoruk said.
	   Sedoruk offered a theory to explain the high rate of stings.
``The really young rays have no experience with people in the
shallow water,'' Sedoruk said.

 &UR; Shoe manufacturers making grinding easier
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Guerrilla attacks on the nation's curbs and
handrails may be set for a big slide forward.
	   Security guards who have to protect the curbs and railings may
be set for a big headache.
	   Up to now, the activity called grinding generally has been
reserved for adventurous skateboarders and in-line skaters. They
leap onto a curb or railing, trap it sideways between their wheels,
and slide down.
	   However, because of a technological step forward, grinders no
longer need boards or skates. Companies make shoes with special
grinding surfaces in the arches. With the shoes, a grinder can walk
to a site unobtrusively and attack without warning.
	   Pioneering grind shoe manufacturer Soap Shoes of Torrance,
California, has a grooved plastic plate. And Rollerblade, which
earlier pioneered the in-line skate, has expanded its line to
include a grind shoe with a pair of metal rollers.
	   Either way, the result is a tongue-in-groove effect designed for
sliding.
	   ``It's an exhilarating feeling,'' said grinder Matt Jacobsen,
22, of Concord, California, who tested shoes for Rollerblade.
``It's kind of like ice. It's a smooth feeling.''

 &UR; Teens caught smoking in Florida can end up in court
	   PLANTATION, Florida (AP) _ Seventeen-year-old Margarita
Psihogios started smoking two years ago because it was cool. All
her friends were doing it.
	   Besides, she only smoked a pack a week, she said.
	   But it wasn't so cool when the senior at Plantation High got
caught with a cigarette in her mouth as she was leaving the school
parking lot.
	   She received a written citation to appear before Judge Steven
Shutter in teen smoking court, a pilot program that is part of
Florida's new tough line against juvenile smokers.
	   Under Florida's new tobacco law for minors which took effect
last October, police can ticket those under 18 caught with tobacco.
	   On their first offense, they face up to 16 hours of community
service or a dlrs 25 fine _ the amount in Broward County is dlrs 53
because of court costs. Shutter said most choose community service
because dlrs 53 is ``a very expensive cigarette.''
	   In addition, the youngsters must attend a tobacco education
program.

Swiss report says anti-Semitism revived by Holocaust controversy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1000 GMT Thursday. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Latent anti-Semitism in Switzerland has come into
the open in the wake of controversy over the country's role in
World War II, a government panel said Thursday.
	   But after 50 years in which anti-Semitism was dismissed as
marginal, the controversy has forced the Swiss to come to terms
with the phenomenon, the Federal Commission against Racism said in
a 72-page report.
	   Switzerland is no exception to its European neighbors in having
a long tradition of underlying anti-Semitism, the panel said.
	   However, prejudice against Jews is unorganized and rarely has
links to right-wing extremism, it added.
	   Following prolonged international pressure, particularly from
Jewish groups, Switzerland's two biggest banks in August agreed to
pay Holocaust survivors dlrs 1.25 billion in compensation for
wartime losses.
	   Accusations that Switzerland acted as banker to Nazi Germany and
other criticism of its wartime record caused widespread resentment
in the country.
	   ``Comments by various politicians and a few flame-fanning
newspaper headlines helped to heat up the situation,'' the
commission said.
	   In early 1997, Switzerland's then-president, Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz, caused an international outcry by labeling as
``blackmail'' Jewish demands for a dlrs 250 million Holocaust
compensation fund. Delamuraz eventually apologized.
	   The statement ``gained the support of a large section of the
Swiss population,'' the report said.
	   Swiss Jewish leaders were among those who criticized U.S. Jewish
organizations in the talks with Swiss banks.
	   But last year, ``a wave of anti-Semitism manifested itself in
letters to newspapers, in threatening letters to prominent Jewish
figures and organizations, and in everyday situations in which Jews
were and continue to be insulted and ostracized,'' the report said.
	   Many of the anti-Semitic letters to the Jewish groups were even
signed, the report said. It did note, however, that Jewish groups
received hundreds of supportive letters as well.
	   Work on the study was completed shortly before the settlement.
But it cautioned that the accord ``may arouse new signs of
anti-Semitism in Switzerland.''
	   The report, commissioned by the government in March 1997,
estimated that about 10 percent of the population hold anti-Semitic
views but more could be influenced by propaganda.
	   Anti-Semitism in Switzerland this century has largely been
linked to the neutral country's resistance to the ``encroachment of
foreign elements,'' it said.
	   Detailing government, church and private initiatives to fight
anti-Semitism, the commission called on politicians to take a clear
position against it.
	   A planned 7 billion (dlrs 5 billion) Swiss franc foundation to
aid victims of genocide, war and natural disasters should also
promote projects to fight the problem, it said.
	   The subject must be dealt with in schools, workplaces and the
army, it added.
	   Switzerland's 1995 anti-racism law outlaws the belittling of the
Holocaust. Some 100 cases have so far been judged, 55 of them
involving anti-Semitism charges.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Rebels have yielded the Amazon basin
city of Mitu to government forces after Colombia sent hundreds of
troops to the remote jungle city to end a three-day guerrilla
onslaught.
	   The rebel takeover of the southeastern city _ unofficial counts
said 150 soldiers and police, seven civilians and five rebels died
_ dealt Colombia's security forces perhaps their worst blow in more
than three decades.
	   The seizure of the city of 15,000 people underscored the
military advantage of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, and fueled doubts about its professed interest in
negotiating peace.
	   As many as 1,400 guerrillas leveled Mitu's 125-man police
garrison on Sunday with a barrage of homemade missiles. They seized
Mitu's airstrip, blew up its communications tower and fought off
army reinforcements before retreating around midnight Tuesday. Some
45 police officers were taken captive.
	   Body bags carrying 16 dead officers were flown Wednesday from
Mitu to an army base at San Jose Guaviare, 190 miles (300 kms)
north.
	   President Andres Pastrana said he would fly to the devastated
town on Thursday. Television footage Wednesday night showed
two-foot-deep (60 cms) bomb craters, burned out hulks of buildings
and a handful of bodies scattered about Mitu's streets.
	   To retake the city, which is surrounded by jungle, about 500
soldiers fought their way in after refueling their transport planes
and helicopters at an airfield just across the border in Brazil,
said army spokesman Capt. Fernando Avila.
	   The Brazilian government protested the use of its territory for
the operation and recalled its ambassador for consultations.
	   Mitu hospital director William Vaquero said 150 soldiers and
police and seven civilians died in the fighting, which devastated a
four-block area including a bank, the prosecutors office, a school
and part of the hospital.
	   ``Here everyone knew the guerrillas were coming,'' Vaquero said
in a radio interview. ``The only thing we didn't know was the day
and the hour.''
	   The guerrillas said five rebels were killed and 15 wounded.
	   A 400-man army and police contingent walked into the devastated
Vaupes state capital on Wednesday after battling the guerrillas
since Monday.
	   Despite the fighting, Pastrana insists he will go ahead with
peace talks with the FARC in coming weeks to end the 34-year
conflict. Critics say the guerrillas' actions confirm that their
only real goal is toppling the government.
	   ``The war in Colombia has become a war for power. It's no longer
a war to make substantive changes in the lives of Colombians,''
said political analyst Rafael Nieto.
	   Many observers believe the FARC hopes to force Pastrana to cede
control over most of southern Colombia _ a vast area stretching
from the eastern Andean mountains to the eastern border with
Brazil.
	   The armed forces and police have struggled to explain why they
were not better prepared for the attack on Mitu, which local
residents said they had expected.

Brazilian government wins key test for austerity measures in
</HEADLINE>
Congress &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results of final vote. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's president scored a crucial
victory when Congress approved belt-tightening measures intended to
reign in spending and show the world's lenders the country is
serious about economic reform.
	   Congress voted Wednesday to approve two measures. One limits a
civil servant's pension, and the other sets the minimum retirement
age at 53 for men and 48 for women.
	   The government agreed to drop a third measure that would have
limited special pensions for people working under hazardous
conditions or in hardship posts.
	   Congress voted 343-125 to approve the pension measure, which
will set a dlrs 1,000 monthly pension ceiling for retirees from the
social security system and 346-131 to approve the new minimum
retirement age.
	   The measures are expected to save dlrs 2.5 billion.
	   While the amount is barely enough to make a dent in Brazil's
deficit, it would go along way toward proving that Brazil's
Congress is serious about cutting the country's ballooning budget
deficit of around dlrs 65 billion _ 7 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.
	   The vote helps the government measure its chances of getting
Congress to approve fiscal austerity measures unveiled last week,
analysts said.
	   ``If the articles are approved, the government will score an
important victory,'' said Bernard Appy of LCA, a consulting firm.
	   However, Congressman Paulo Heslander said, ``If the government
loses, the fiscal adjustment measures will plunge into a black
hole.''
	   Last week, the government unveiled a mix of taxes and spending
cuts in a bid to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and about dlrs
80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by Congress.
	   On Tuesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso underscored the
importance of Congress' approval of the reform bill and the
multi-year fiscal stabilization plan.
	   ``The whole world is watching us, watching to see if we'll be
able to resolve the crisis,'' the president said.
	   Brazil is hoping to win a rescue package of some dlrs 30 billion
from the International Monetary Fund.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's highest court is a new argument that
genocide and murder are universally recognized as crimes as five
judges decide whether the arrest of former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet is legal.
	   The judges said they would consider opinions from academics on
Thursday, the second day of an appeal of a High Court finding. The
High Court ruled last week that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest on a
Spanish warrant was illegal. The court said that as a foreign
former head of state, he has immunity from prosecution for murder,
kidnappings and torture of leftists by security forces while he
ruled.
	   On Wednesday, the judges overruled objections from Pinochet's
lawyers and agreed to hear new arguments that prosecutors did not
raise at the High Court hearing.
	   The prosecutors will attempt to throw doubt on whether Pinochet
was actually head of state throughout his 17-year rule,
particularly in the first violent hours after he seized power on
Sept. 11, 1973, and whether international law now calls for anyone
accused of genocide, torture and kidnapping to face a court.
	   The present Chilean government says some 3,000 political
opponents were killed or disappeared during the 17 years Pincohet
held power after ousting President Salvadore Allende, an elected
Marxist.
	   ``Our argument can be put in one sentence,'' said Alun Jones,
the lawyer representing a Spanish judge who initiated the arrest
warrant, the Spanish government and British prosecutors. ``It is no
part of the functions of a head of state recognized by English or
international law to behave like that.''
	   Jones also argued that even if Pinochet has immunity for
tortures and killings carried out in Chile by DINA, his secret
police, he remained legally responsible for killings of opponents
in other countries, including Spain, Italy, and the United States.
	   The son of Allende's foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, killed
in a 1976 car bombing in Washington, is among a delegation of
Chilean lawmakers and human rights activists now in London
highlighting human rights abuses under Pinochet.
	   The hearing in the House of Lords, originally scheduled to end
Thursday, was expected to last until Monday. The Lords, who do not
sit on Fridays, may not decide the case immediately.
	   Pinochet, who underwent back surgery Oct. 9, remained under
police guard in a north London hospital.
	   In Chile, the government said Wednesday that when Pinochet
returns he should quit politics totally and ask for forgiveness.
Pinochet has had immunity from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated.

Former U.S. Olympic track coach Larry Ellis dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Larry Ellis, the coach for the 1984 U.S. Olympic
men's track team and a past president of USA Track and Field, died
at his home in Skillman, New Jersey on Wednesday, his wife said. He
was 70.
	   The high school coach of 1968 Olympic long jump gold medalist
Bob Beamon, Ellis also was track coach at Princeton for 22 years.
	   Ellis made a trip to Virginia over the weekend and didn't feel
well after returning home on Monday, his wife, Shirley, said.
	   Ellis, who had a heart transplant in 1995, was examined at a
hospital on Monday and sent home, but he continued to feel ill on
Tuesday and Wednesday, his wife said.
	   Sitting in his kitchen on Wednesday afternoon with his daughter,
Lesley Smalls, ``he just put his head on the table and passed
away,'' Shirley Ellis said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   ``He was a warm person, an intelligent person and he really,
really cared for people,'' said Ollan Cassell, vice president of
the International Amateur Athletic Federation, track's world
governing body, and a former executive director of USATF when Ellis
was president.
	   ``He loved athletes and coaching and teaching and his family,''
he added.
	   A middle distance runner at NYU, Ellis came from a running
background. He was a cousin of track hall of famer Stan Wright, who
also was an assistant Olympic track coach in 1968 and '72.
	   Ellis coached Beamon at Jamaica High School in New York City.
Beamon set an Olympic record with a memorable leap of 29 feet, 2
1/2 inches (8.90 meters) in the 1968 Games at Mexico City.
	   Ellis was one of the most successful Ivy League coaches during
his days at Princeton from 1970-92.
	   Among his athletes at Princeton was Craig Masback, the chief
executive of USATF. Masback was the 1980 U.S. indoor mile champion.
	   The 1984 Olympic team he coached was by led by Carl Lewis, who
won four gold medals at Los Angeles. He also led a U.S. team in the
memorable USA-USSR dual meet at Berkeley, California in 1978.
	   Ellis, who celebrated his birthday on Oct. 29, was president of
USATF from 1992-96. His last coaching assignment for the
organization was just two months ago, leading the U.S. men's track
team in the World Cup in South Africa.
	   ``He was extraordinarily well liked throughout track and
field,'' USATF spokesman Pete Cava said in a telephone interview
from Indianapolis. ``He was a dedicated worker and a good family
man.''
	   Besides his wife and daughter, Ellis is survived by two other
daughters, Robin Williams and Joanne Glenn and a son, Lawrence.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Jim Courier, once was ranked No. 1 in
the world, upset top-seeded Felix Mantilla 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 Wednesday

tournament.
	   Now 93rd in the ATP Tour rankings, Courier converted the only
service break of the second set at 5-5, then held to close out the

Mahathir, Goh to meet amid frosty bilateral ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after news conference scheduled at 0300 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Singapore's Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong was scheduled to fly to Malaysia on Thursday for talks
with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, indicating a thaw in frosty
relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   The surprise visit by Goh comes at a time when the two nations
have squabbled over a host of bilateral issues ranging from using
airspace to locating a railroad station.
	   It will be the first top-level meeting between the two countries
since relations, testy even in ordinary times, started to
deteriorate rapidly in August. They last met in April.
	   The one-day visit was initiated at Mahathir's invitation, Goh's
office said in a statement late Wednesday.
	   The two were scheduled to meet in Sepang on the outskirts of
Kuala Lumpur, the national news agency Bernama said. A news
conference was scheduled after the talks.
	   There has been no official comment ahead of the meeting. Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi when contacted by Bernama on
Wednesday said: `` Just wait for tomorrow.''
	   In recent months, the neighbors have argued over the location of
a border post and a cancellation of automatic flyover rights for
Singaporean military aircraft using Malaysian air space.
	   Malaysia's withdrawal from joint military exercises, and a halt
to trading of Malaysian stocks and currencies in Singapore have
also strained ties.
	   Comments about past Malaysian leaders in the recently-released
memoirs of former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew also added
to the tensions.
	   Last month, Mahathir said his country will find it difficult to
be friendly again with Singapore, saying the island republic has
not shown the sensitivity of a good neighbor.
	   Soon after, Goh urged the people of his small city-state to
remain mentally tough amid tensions with its larger neighbor.
	   But in recent days the two leaders have spoken of improving
ties.
	   The bilateral meeting comes ahead of a summit in Kuala Lumpur
later this month of the Asia-Pacific Economic forum.

Border says Warne likely to miss three tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian cricket captain and
current selector Allan Border says star spinner Shane Warne may be
left out of the opening three Ashes tests against England for his
own good.
	   Border doused Warne's optimism that he might recover from a
shoulder injury in time to play in the opening test in Brisbane
from Nov. 20.
	   Writing in a syndicated newspaper column Thursday, Border said
Warne would likely miss the first two tests to prevent him causing
further damage to his injured shoulder.
	   ``Given an incident-free comeback to first class cricket and a
spotless report from the specialists, the best-case scenario is for
Warne to return in the third test in Adelaide from Dec. 15,''
Border wrote. ``But, in my view, the more realistic date is the
fourth test in Melbourne on (Dec. 26).''
	   Warne bowled for the first time since surgery in April during a
district cricket match last weekend. He got a wicket with his third
ball and finished with 1-13 from six overs.
	   He had hoped to make Victoria's team for the Sheffield Shield
match being played against New South Wales in Melbourne but was
left out and has one more Shield chance before the first test.
	   But Border's statements were the strongest indication yet that
the selectors would take a hard-line on Warne.
	   ``Only last week there were headlines about Shane bowling 30
balls in the nets,'' Border wrote. ``You simply cannot go from
bowling 30 balls at moderate intensity to delivering 80 test match
overs at maximum intensity within three weeks.''
	   Border said he had spoken to Warne on the phone and the
match-winning leg-spinner had raised the possibility of a return
for the first test.
	   ``I have said to him `you have some serious talking to do to
convince me that would be possible,''' Border wrote.
	   Border played a record 156 test matches and is the highest
run-scorer in test cricket. He said Australia had begun to adopt a
tougher stance on injured players.
	   ``We want him for five to seven years,'' said Border. ``One
extra month on the sidelines is not a big price to pay.''
	   Warne has dominated England since his first ball in Ashes
conflict, a leg-spinner which knocked over Mike Gatting's off
stump.
	   England team management made a special effort to counter Warne
on this tour, handing out an extensive document detailing the art
of leg-spin. The tourists brought former Australian test bowler
Peter Philpott on tour as their spin doctor and shortly after
arrival the squad had a clinic where they were shown how to bowl
like Warne.
	   Australia unveiled another promising leg-spinner in Pakistan
last month when Stuart MacGill took nine wickets in Australia's
decisive first test victory in Rawalpindi.

Main Tokyo stock index down, dollar rises in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo's main stock index declined in morning
trading Thursday as investors took profits following the previous
day's sharp gains. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 83.07 points,
or 0.57 percent, to finish the morning session at 14,444.74. On
Wednesday, the average surged 575.06 points, or 4.12 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.76 yen, up 1.12 yen from late in Tokyo on
Wednesday and also above its late New York level of 116.60 yen
overnight.
	   The Nikkei moved lower as traders locked in profits after the it
soared Wednesday on comments by influential Morgan Stanley
strategist Barton Biggs, who said Tokyo shares were undervalued.
	   Reports in a major Japanese business daily on Thursday that the
government will delay debating income, corporate and housing tax
cuts until the regular Parliament session next year, rather than
during an extra session this year, also hurt sentiment.
	   ``The market's uncertain situation is continuing,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shrugged off the Nikkei's decline, rising 1.96
points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,109.32. The TOPIX closed up 41.52
points, or 3.90 percent Wednesday.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar gained against the
yen as Japanese banks and investors bought the greenback following
the results of Wednesday's U.S. midterm elections.
	   The Democratic Party's stronger-than-expected showing blunted
worries over the possibility that President Bill Clinton would be
impeached, and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 76.99
points to 8,783.14 at Wednesday's close.
	   Traders said investors who had held short, or oversold dollar
positions ahead of the midterm election were now buying back the
U.S. currency.
	   Also hurting the yen were news reports that Japanese banks are
having trouble raising funds overseas amid concern over the health
of major Japanese financial institutions, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.865 percent from Wednesday's finish of
0.870 percent, driving its price up to 108.29 yen from 108.24 yen.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Taking an ideological war to
cyberspace, South Korean police have arrested a high school dropout
who created an Internet web site eulogizing communist rival North
Korea.
	   Kim Suk-joon, 19, a self-proclaimed communist, was arrested late
Wednesday by police who stormed his home in Yesan, 100 kilometers
(62 miles) south of Seoul.
	   Kim faces charges of violating Seoul's strict national security
law, which outlaws ``possessing or distributing data that can
benefit, eulogize or encourage the enemy.''
	   Police have blocked all links to Kim's web site, which featured
a large red and blue North Korean flag and depicted South Korean
flags being burned and urinated on.
	   Entitled the ``Forum for People Who Love North Korea,'' the home
page also displayed North Korea's constitution, pro-Pyongyang news
reports and a profile of supreme leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``Secretary General Kim Jong Il, please be my father and father
of all South Korean workers!'' read a screen message which appeared
as a background graphic of the divided Korean Peninsula slowly
turned red.
	   Police said they had been searching for Kim and the 4,000 people
who have visited his home page since it was opened late last month.
	   The two Koreas remain technically at war, although a 1953 truce
ended three years of fighting. The end of battlefield hostilities
set off a bitter propaganda war which is still being fought.
	   The two sides have been known to float balloons loaded with
propaganda material over each other's territory and explode them.
	   Fearing that North Korea will use the Internet to disseminate
propaganda, South Korean authorities regularly search cyberspace
for web sites it deems subversive.

Honduras finds more victims, scope of disaster growing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. UPDATES with president's remarks, official
estimate of 6,500 dead.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Hondurans buried more of their dead
and formed blocks-long lines for water and gasoline as officials
struggled to feed and shelter a population still in shock from
Hurricane Mitch.
	   An estimated 13,000 people were missing in the region.
	   Medical workers buried 13 flood victims in a common grave
Wednesday in Tegucigalpa, making signs of the cross and placing two
wooden crosses among the plastic-shrouded bodies before a bulldozer
plowed earth over them. The bodies were too decomposed to identify,
officials said.
	   They were among the latest in a national death toll estimated at
6,500, with as many as 1 million homeless. All told, Hurricane
Mitch killed an estimated total of nearly 9,000 people in its
rampage through Central America.
	   ``We really don't know what the numbers are. There are places we
haven't reached yet,'' said Col. Rene Osorio of Honduras' national
emergency committee.
	   A revived Tropical Storm Mitch plowed across the Gulf of Mexico
on Wednesday toward Florida, where it was expected to strike
Thursday with heavy rain and wind and the possibility of floods and
tornadoes.
	   Rain already was falling across much of the state as moist air
streamed ahead of the advancing storm. A tropical storm warning
extended from the Keys, still recovering from Hurricane Georges,
northward to Tarpon Springs on the state's west coast and New
Smyrna Beach on the Atlantic coast.
	   While officials previously estimated 7,000 dead in Honduras,
President Carlos Flores said in a nationwide broadcast late
Wednesday that some 6,500 people were confirmed dead and more than
11,000 were missing. Mitch destroyed more than 60 percent of the
nation's infrastructure, he said, adding the government was seeking
aid from Europe and the United States.
	   ``We have receded many years'' in terms of national development,
Flores said. ``The capital of the republic is in a precarious
condition.''
	   Also Wednesday, the first foreign relief aid trickled into
Honduras. Hondurans in Texas sent 15,000 pounds (6,803 kilos) of
supplies Wednesday. The Mexican government and the U.S. military
joined an airlift to towns cut off by nationwide flooding. But the
obstacles to delivering that relief were daunting.
	   In northern Nicaragua, the grisly task of burying or burning
bodies continued in massive mudslides near the Casitas volcano,
where a crater lake collapsed Friday. About 200 more corpses were
found there Wednesday, boosting the confirmed death toll there to
1,568. As many as 2,000 are feared dead.
	   More than 750,000 people lost their homes or possessions across
Nicaragua, and 1,804 are listed as missing nationwide.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman _ who turned aid distribution over to
the Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday after government relief
efforts were criticized _ said he would ``respect the will of local
residents'' in deciding whether to declare the Casitas area a
national cemetery.
	   A small magnitude-3.2 earthquake centered near the Casitas peak
was reported Wednesday, while lava flows from the nearby Cerro
Negro volcano appeared to have stopped Tuesday. No injuries or
damages were reported in either incident.
	   In Honduras, main highways connecting Tegucigalpa, a city of
800,000, to the rest of the country were cut, creating shortages of
gasoline, drinking water and food in the hard-hit capital. Without
gasoline, aid can't be delivered by truck. Nearly all aircraft are
being used in continuing searches for survivors.
	   ``The people's desperation is growing,'' said Andres Aguiriano
Duarte, deputy commissioner of the emergency committee. ``This
storm has broken the entire basic structure of our response
capabilities.''
	   Honduran roads sustained dlrs 2 billion in damage, nearly a
third of the country's gross domestic product and double the
government's budget, said Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez.
	   In Tegucigalpa's city morgue _ operating from a refrigerated
trailer after flooding swept through the morgue building _ anxious
residents awaited word of missing loved ones.
	   Along the banks of the Choluteca River, residents shoveled muck
from debris-packed homes and stores and sifted for whatever they
could salvage. Bulldozers cleared streets of mounds of rock, mud
and garbage.
	   All too often, there was nothing left to save.
	   ``How do we continue, without water, without food, without
sleep?'' said Yolanda Marvella Arraya, 35, who has spent nights
outside on a soggy mattress next to the river since flooding
destroyed her home.
	   Citing food and other shortages, the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa
authorized the voluntary departure of all dependents of embassy
personnel. The U.S. Peace Corps, with about 207 members in
Honduras, was pulling up stakes to Panama under a mandatory
departure order.
	   Aid was eagerly awaited by the 4,000 people crowded into a
shelter at a government-run trade school in Tegucigalpa, where many
stunned families waited out the day on mattresses. Some mothers
cried silently, trying to hide their grief from their children.
	   ``I'm fighting to control my nerves,'' said a tearful Santos
Antonio Perez, 57, whose family of 10 was uprooted by the storm.
``I lost all I have. This dress was given to me,'' she said,
pulling at the thin fabric.

Crewmen of allegedly hijacked vessel engaged in smuggling, China
</HEADLINE>
says

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Under fire for having set free 12 Indonesians
suspected of piracy, China defended its decision Thursday,
contending that the ship was actually involved in smuggling oil.
	   There was insufficient evidence to show the Indonesians, who
were deported from China on Oct. 16, had hijacked the
Malaysian-registered oil tanker, the state-run China Daily
newspaper reported.
	   The Petro Ranger varied from its set course to smuggle oil into
China, not because it had been hijacked, Foreign Ministry and
officials in southern Hainan province were cited as saying in the
report.
	   After the deportation, the International Maritime Bureau
condemned China for releasing the Indonesians, accusing Beijing of
violating international pacts on piracy and suggesting the move was
part of a plot to cover up Chinese involvement in criminal
activity.
	   The Malaysian government had sought to extradite the 12
Indonesians to stand trial on charges of armed robbery and
hijacking.
	   In a statement published in the China Daily, however, the
Foreign Ministry contended that Malaysia had never filed a formal
extradition request.
	   The Petro Ranger disappeared April 17, one day after it set sail
from Singapore to Vietnam with a cargo of 11,000 tons of diesel and
kerosene worth an estimated dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Chinese marine border police discovered the ship off the
southern port of Haikou on Hainan Island on April 26 operating
under another name, the Mt. Wilby, and a Honduran flag, according
to the newspaper.
	   At the time, it was loading fuel onto a Chinese ship. The Petro
Ranger's cargo of 3,000 tons of diesel and 1,600 tons of kerosene
were not documented, nor was the 500 tons of diesel aboard the
Chinese ship, the report said.
	   The Foreign Ministry statement said China was cooperating in
efforts to crack down on piracy and other international crimes as
well as to prevent rampant smuggling along its porous sea borders.

Creditor banks approve Hyundai's takeover of Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks on Thursday approved
Hyundai Motors Co.'s takeover of fellow South Korean automaker Kia
Motors Corp., ending a months-long process of auctioning off the
bankrupt firm.
	   Kia's creditors have been studying Hyundai's takeover terms
since Hyundai outbid Ford Motor Co. and South Korea's Samsung
Motors and Daewoo Motors in October to win the right to buy Kia.
	   Korea Development Bank and 27 other creditors said Hyundai
agreed to scale down its debt writeoff request from 7.3 trillion
won (dlrs 5.6 billion) to 7.17 trillion won (dlrs 5.5 billion).
	   Kia's total debt is estimated at dlrs 9.1 billion.
	   Most of the creditor banks are controlled by the government, and
long before Thursday's decision government officials had given
Hyundai their tacit endorsement.
	   Kia's collapse last year was widely believed to have been a key
trigger for the onset of South Korea's economic crisis which forced
the country to call in the International Monetary Fund to bail out
its economy.
	   The takeover was expected to spur a reorganization of South
Korea's troubled auto industry, which has been plagued by
over-supply problems.
	   With a combined capacity of 3.5 million vehicles a year, South
Korea is the world's fifth largest car producer.
	   Hyundai is the largest South Korean car maker with a dlrs 1.8
million-car capacity. Kia produced 780,000 cars annually before it
collapsed last year.
	   Hyundai won the auction after two earlier rounds of bidding
failed to find a suitor that satisfied creditor banks.

Philippine Airlines willing to give Cathay Pacific management
</HEADLINE>
rights

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines is willing to
give Cathay Pacific Airways management rights in exchange for a
sizable investment in the ailing air carrier, a PAL official said
Thursday.
	   Manolo Aquino, senior vice president of PAL, said the two
companies are discussing an initial buy-in offer which was made by
Cathay Pacific.
	   ``We met yesterday and we will continue meeting today on what we
can agree upon on the first proposal of Cathay Pacific,'' he said
in a radio interview. He did not provide details on the proposal.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control over PAL as
part of any deal with Asia's oldest airline.
	   PAL has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in
debt. It was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the
outbreak last year of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``If Cathay Pacific comes in, we will give them a free hand
because they will run Philippine Airlines,'' Aquino said.
``Whatever they see that could improve the operations of Philippine
Airlines, if they see the need to retrench some people, I think we
should give them a free hand here.''
	   ``Everything is being considered,'' Aquino added.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of its collective
bargaining agreement in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the
airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international
flights Oct. 26.
	   Abel Capili, a leader of PAL's ground crew union, said employees
are planning a protest on Friday because of fears of mass layoffs
and reduced benefits.
	   ``Despite the suspension of the CBA, there is still no security
of tenure, there is no assurance that a majority of the employees
will be retained,'' Capili said.
	   He claimed the airline would retain only 3,500 of its 8,000
employees under a proposed rehabilitation plan.
	   Aquino said the airline and the union are continuing talks on a
memorandum of agreement and dismissed the fears of mass layoffs as
speculation.
	   He appealed to the union to avoid any protest, saying this would
``reinforce fears'' among passengers about PAL's reliability.

Canadiens down Rangers; Lightning stop Capitals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mark Recchi scored the tiebreaking goal and
assisted on another as the Montreal Canadiens beat the New York
Rangers 4-1 Wednesday night.
	   Shayne Corson, Martin Rucinsky and Vincent Damphousse also
scored for Montreal. John MacLean got the only goal for the
Rangers, who have scored only three goals in their last four games.
	   The Rangers have just 18 goals in 12 games this season _ second
worst in the league to the Washington Capitals, who have 16 in 10
games.
	   New York is 3-2-3 in its last eight games after losing for the
second straight night. The Canadiens, who have outscored the
Rangers 11-2 in their two games this season, stopped a four-game
winless streak.
 &UR; Lightning 5, Capitals 2 &QC; 
	   In Washington, Wendel Clark scored two goals as Tampa Bay
extended Washington's winless streak to five games.
	   Daren Puppa made 34 saves for the Lightning, which finished a
four-game road trip 2-2-0. It was the first Southeast Division
victory for Tampa Bay, which had been 0-2-1 against division
opponents.
	   Joe Juneau had a goal and an assist for the Capitals, who are
0-3-2 in their last five games. Washington is 3-5-3 overall, the
first time in coach Ron Wilson's 93-game tenure that the team has
slumped two games under .500.
	   Andrei Nazarov, Steve Kelly and Daymond Langkow also scored for
the Lightning. Brian Bellows scored for Washington, and Adam Oates
got his 800th career assist.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Avalanche 0 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Curtis Joseph got his first shutout of the season
and first regular-season victory over Colorado as the Toronto Maple
Leafs beat the Avalanche.
	   Steve Sullivan, Mats Sundin and Steve Thomas scored for the
Maple Leafs, who ended a three-game losing streak.
	   Joseph, who played for St. Louis and Edmonton before signing
with Toronto in the offseason, stopped 24 shots for his 20th career
shutout. He had been 0-11-1 against the Avalanche in the regular
season.
	   The Maple Leafs scored all their goals in the second period to
beat Colorado in Toronto for the first time since Jan. 6, 1996.
Patrick Roy made 25 saves for the Avalanche, who fell to 3-7-1.
 &UR; Panthers 2, Blackhawks 1 &QC; 
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Bill Lindsay intercepted a blind clearing
pass and beat goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick with 2:16 left as the
Florida Panthers handed the Chicago Blackhawks their fourth
straight loss.
	   With the two-referee system in use, there were six roughing
penalties and two fights with five unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties called, including a near brawl after the game ended.
Chris Chelios was involved in four tussles, including one with Rob
Niedermayer at the end of the game.
	   Chicago's Tony Amonte scored a third-period goal to tie it 1-1
at 6:09 of the third.
	   With Scott Mellanby and Blackhawks defenseman Eric Weinrich
battling for the puck behind Chicago's net, Weinrich blindly
backhanded a clearing pass which Linday intercepted at the left
faceoff circle. His wrist shot sailed over Fitzpatrick's shoulder
for the game-winner.

Indonesian Muslims demonstrate in support of government assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 70,000 pro-government
demonstrators from Muslim groups gathered Thursday in a soccer
stadium to support a government assembly next week that will plan
1999 elections.
	   The big turnout far exceeded the numbers of student activists
who have protested outside Parliament in recent weeks, demanding
that the government move faster on democratic reform.
	   Last week, 8,000 students demonstrated against the People's
Consultative Assembly, which they say is full of holdovers from the
era of former President Suharto. Riots and pro-democracy protests
helped force the authoritarian leader to quit in May after 32 years
in power.
	   At the rally in Senayan Stadium, Muslim preachers urged
religious unity and declared support for the assembly, Indonesia's
highest legislative body, at which 1,000 delegates will draw up
electoral laws.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is dismantling his predecessor's
legacy of rigid rule, has allowed political parties to form ahead
of general elections scheduled for May.
	   ``God is great,'' shouted the demonstrators, who arrived in
dozens of buses. Many of them carried Muslim flags and women wore
Muslim head scarves.
	   ``As Muslim people, we have to support a successful outcome of
the special session of the assembly,'' said demonstrator Muhamad
Fauzi.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. Dozens of
Muslim-based political parties plan to contest the parliamentary
elections.
	   The tarnished military, which is grappling with allegations of
widespread human rights abuses, has deployed tens of thousands of
police and soldiers in the capital to guard the Nov. 10-13
assembly.
	   Student leaders plan to protest against the assembly, and there
are fears that demonstrations will trigger unrest.
	   On Tuesday, a government fact-finding team released a report
that said some members of the military had instigated riots in
parts of Jakarta in May, apparently in an attempt to destabilize
the government.
	   Many of the rioters were angry over sharp rises in the prices of
basic commodities caused by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades.

Anwar trial will not derail APEC forum meeting: Downer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim probably won't derail the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur next week, Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Thursday.
	   ``I don't think it will derail APEC, no,'' Downer said at a news
conference after a meeting with his Japanese counterpart Masahiko
Koumura.
	   Downer said Anwar's trial had been discussed at the meeting.
	   ``We had a broad discussion about quite a lot of regional
issues, about Indonesia, about Malaysia and so on,'' Downer said.
	   ``You can't ignore the fact that what is happening in Malaysia
is a significant issue.
	   ``It is an issue which is of great interest to the Asia Pacific
region as a whole and every government in the region is devoting a
bit of time to seeing how this issue in Malaysia is going to
unfold,'' he said.
	   Australia was concerned that Anwar's trial was free and fair,
Downer said.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. His trial began Monday.
	   He has denied the charges and says they were fabricated to
eclipse his challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year
rule.
	   Downer said he had not considered meeting Anwar's family while
he is in Kuala Lumpur for the APEC meeting.

Yugoslav crown prince says the West gave Milosevic ''new lease on
</HEADLINE>
life''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia on Wednesday
accused the West of giving Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
''a new lease on life.''
	   Milosevic ''provoked NATO to threaten air strikes and then in
the last moment, he 'saved' Serbia from the missiles,'' the prince
said in a speech to journalists in London. ''Yet again, the state
propaganda machine portrays him as a savior, a great peacemaker and
a statesman.''
	   The prince called on the West to stop negotiating with Milosevic
and work to install a true democratic government in Yugoslavia.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes on Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo to pressure
Milosevic to agree Oct. 12 to halt a seven-month crackdown on
Albanian separatists.
	   The crackdown killed hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic
Albanians _ and left an estimated 300,000 homeless in the Yugoslav
province, which is ethnically 90 percent Albanian.
	   Under the agreement, Serb police and Yugoslav army forces in
Kosovo must cut back to levels before the offensive and refugees
must be allowed to return to their homes.
	   The agreement also calls for international agencies to move
freely in Kosovo.
	   But Crown Prince Alexander charged that the West has only
''provided simplified solutions.''
	   He also spoke against Milosevic's continued crackdown on the
media.
	   Last month, the Serbian parliament passed a media law severely
restricting press freedom and instituting severe fines for those
publishing ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   ''Serbia remains in darkness and ignorance and the state run
media is singing praise to the president,'' the prince said. ''Any
hope of democratic reform is on hold and that is serious.''
