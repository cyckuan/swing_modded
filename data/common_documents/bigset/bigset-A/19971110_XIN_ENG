<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council has
recently approved the third-phase construction of the huge Shenhua
Project for coal shipment in north China.
</P>
<P>
The third-phase construction of Shenhua, a passage
to transport coal from western to eastern China, includes a 586-km
railway from Shuozhou city in Shanxi province to Huanghua city in
Hebei province and a port in Huanghua with an annual handling
capacity of 30 million tons.
</P>
<P>
An official source said that the third phase of the project is
scheduled to be completed by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng wrote for the project: "Speed up
construction of the Shuozhou-Huanghua Railway and the Huanghua
Port, and build the country's second-largest west-east passage for
coal shipment."
</P>
<P>
The Shenhua Project, with an investment of nearly 90 billion
yuan, includes construction of coal mines, a railway, power
plants, and a port. When completed, the railway will have an
annual hauling capacity of 100 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
The project will play an important role in stepping up energy
development in western China and in ensuring energy supplies in
eastern and southern China.
</P>
<P>
The Shuozhou-Huanghua Railway is expected to be linked to the
north-south Beijing-Kowloon Railway by 2000. And, the Huanghua
Port will have a yearly handling capacity of 60 million tons in
future.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, the Huanghua Port will build four 35,000-ton

<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua)-- One in ten British young children
are suffering brain damage from lead pollution, The Independent On
Sunday reported today.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence of over 440,000 of children under six has been
diminished by exposure to the toxic metal at a time when their
brains are developing, the newspaper quoted a report to be
published this week as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, by Dr Erik Millstone, Senior Lecturer at Sussex
University says that British government have been negligent and
culpable in doing little to tackle the two main causes of this
exposure, lead in paint and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
It says some 10 million homes receive drinking water through
lead piping, either within the house or in the water company's
system, or both.
</P>
<P>
Britain allows 50 micrograms of lead per litre of water, five
times the level recommended by the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement in Three Gorges Area Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
will give all-round support to the resettlement of the people
affected by the construction of the gigantic Three Gorges Dam
Project.
</P>
<P>
The commission will help speed up economic growth, increase
investment and cooperation, prevent water from contamination and
carry out sustained development strategies in the Three Gorges
area.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaobang, vice minister of the State Planning Commission,
made the remarks today at the State Council Three Gorges
Resettlement Working Conference.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 the commission has made on-the-spot research in the
Three Gorges area and drew up a program for its economic
development. The program provides a scientific guideline for
economic growth, relocation of production facilities, and
resettlement of residents and national support for projects in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The commission has increased investment in the area'
agriculture, infrastructure construction and basic industrial
development. Since 1991 the commission has committed 800 million
yuan for the resettlement of residents and small-sized
irrigation and water conservation projects in the area.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 billion yuan will have been invested in
transportation, energy, raw materials and urban infrastructure
construction in the Three Gorges area. The completed projects
include the Three Gorges airport in Yichang and a new bridge over
the Yangtze River in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The commission also has attached importance to the improvement
of the environment and the protection of water quality in the
Three Gorges area. During recent years it has joined hands with
other departments in planting trees on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze and investing 500 million yuan to prevent
soil erosion in a 39,000-square-kilometer area.
</P>
<P>
The commission also has cooperated with other departments to
set up a committee in charge of overseas investment and
cooperation, which is expected to aid the resettlement
program.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Deports 15,000 Zimbabweans This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,735 Zimbabweans who had
been illegally settled in South Africa, were deported between
January to October this year, the South African Home Affairs
Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six more Zimbabweans involved in criminal activities
ranging from theft, robbery, murder, fraud, housebreaking to
possession of protected game were also deported during the same
period, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the South African Home
Affairs Office as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The South African Home Affairs Office said, " The majority of
illegal persons residing in South Africa enter clandestinely and
so it is difficult to quantify the number of illegal settlers."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and South Africa had started bilateral talks in an
effort to curb the flow of illegal migrants while border control
measures were also being stepped up.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in 1995 estimated that between 2.5 and 4.1
million illegal migrants resided in South Africa were attracted
by the better economy and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa sees a large number of illegal settlers from
Zimbabwe and Mozambique who were picked up during police raids.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reduce the number of illegal aliens, South Africa
introduced new and stricter visa regulations in November 1996.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges UN to Take Strong Action against Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
urged the United Nations to take "very strong and unambiguous
action" against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein so that he could
comply with U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the United Nations to take very strong and
unambiguous action to make it perfectly clear he has to comply
... If he doesn't comply then the world community will have to
take some action," Clinton said in an interview, taped after he
met his top foreign policy advisers on Saturday and released on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has turned away U.N. weapons inspection
teams that included Americans in nine consecutive days. And
Clinton said he would not be bullied by Iraqi President Saddam's
defiance.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a military strike against Iraq was necessary, Clinton
said: "I don't want to rule anything in or out. I think it's -- at
a moment like this -- it's very important that the president
maintain all options. And that's where I want to be."
</P>
<P>
"But I think that Saddam Hussein needs to understand that this
is a serious business and this is not just the president of the
United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on Arab nations and U.N. Security Council
members Russia and France to support the U.N. in order to present
a united front in dealing with Saddam Hussein. Russia and France
have been reluctant to take military action against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Ex-UN Chief Urges Non-stop of UN-Iraq Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Former United Nations Secretary
General Boutros Boutros Ghali today called on the UN and Iraq to
maintain their dialog to avoid the outbreak of new confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Ghali was speaking to reporters here before leaving for Hanoi
to take part in the Francophone summit due to open on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The veteran Egyptian diplomat urged the world community to take
into consideration of sufferings of the Iraqi people before any
decision is made.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis, in fact, are the ones who are suffering from the
economic sanctions imposed on the country and who will also be
victimized by any additional military sanctions which could be
imposed on Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is threatening to take action against Iraq following
Iraq's decision last week to expel Americans from the UN Special
Committee in charge of scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
under terms of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says it has done well in cooperating with U.N. inspectors
and wants the easing of the crippling sanctions imposed after the
Gulf War. Rejecting Baghdad's claims, the U.S. led a campaign two
weeks ago in the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution
threatening further sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who is vying for a nomination as the Francophone
Secretary General, said he now enjoys the support of various
African, European and Latin American states.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leaders Promise Reply on Settlements, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders today
stressed that Israel would give its reply on the contentious
issues of suspension of its settlements and implementation of
further troop pullouts in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign
Minister David Levy made the announcement during today's weekly
Cabinet meeting, which was briefed on the just-concluded peace
talks held with the Palestinian side in Washington early this week.
</P>
<P>
Levy defended his talks with Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), saying both sides have agreed to
more work to deal with various issues in the interim accords,
including the suspension of Jewish settlement and troop
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to think that we will return from Washington
with an agreement that wraps everything up," he was quoted by the
the Cabinet satement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Levy added Israel would have to give a reply on the issues of
settlement time-out and further troop redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the cabinet that efforts would continue to try
to work out a settlement on the above-mentioned issues despite the
difference of opinions between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Israel would stand by its position that
"the right thing to do is to enter the final-status talks."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been floating the idea of entering the
final-status talks by bypassing the difficult phase of the
interim stage, in order to wrap up a final settlement on all
issues. The PNA has rejected the proposal and insists on Israel's
implementation of the interim accords.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office today issued an update on the schedule of
his upcoming visit to Britain and the United States, confirming
his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Friday in London before heading to the U.S. on Sunday
morning. Netanyahu is to attend the conference of the Federations
of Jewish Organizations in the U.S. and Canada held in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
But the update still fell short of announcing the much-expected
meeting between Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is
reportedly refusing to see Netanyahu because of his disappointment
with the slow pace of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Netanyahu-Clinton summit would
probably be set up by Netanyahu's meeting with Albright in
London. In his comments, Netanyahu only said his meeting with
Clinton would be arranged in coordination between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA have different assessments of the results
of the Washington talks held under the auspices of the
U.S. government. While Levy hailed the talks as a "great
progress" in providing a good atmosphere for future talks, Arafat
described them as a failure that achieved nothing.
</P>
<P>
Although the nine joint Israeli-Palestinian interim committees
resumed their work today, Israeli officials have downplayed the
prospect of quick progress in the talks, citing that only
Netanyahu would have the authority to make concessions on the
most controversial issues of settlements and further troop
pullouts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected Albright to pressure Netanyahu to ease down
his tough stance on continuing settlement expansion, in order to
pave the way for progress in the peace talks.

ABU DHABI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Oman today clinched a
military deal with Britain's Vickers Defense System Corporation on
purchasing 20 "Challenger 2" main battle tanks, the Oman News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked in the Omani capital Muscat today by
Omani Defense Minister Bader bin Saud bin Harib al Busaede, and
Vickers' representative Kris Wood Werk.
</P>
<P>
The news agency gave no details about the agreement, but
informed sources said that under the agreement, the Oman's royal
army is expected to get the tanks earlier next year.
</P>
<P>
It is Oman's second import order for the tanks manufactured by
Vickers.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1993, the tiny Gulf island state spent some 225
million dollars to buy from Vickers dozens of the "Challenge 2" as
the new generation of main battle tank for its army.

<HEADLINE> Four Million Ethiopian Children Facing Various </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- About four million
Ethiopian children, of whom 100,000 are street children, are
facing various types of problems, Ethiopia's monthly magazine
''Merewa''reported.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund in 25
Ethiopian towns shows that another 500,000 children, who have no
one to look after them, are on the brink of joining others on the
street, reported the Ethiopian News Agency today, quoting the
Amharic language magazine.
</P>
<P>
A protracted civil war, natural calamities, displacement
caused by man-made and natural disasters and the break of
families were cited by the magazine as the main causes of the
suffering of the children.
</P>
<P>
The study revealed that only 25,000 children are being catered
for in 106 chidlren centers in the country and out of the two
million disabled children, only 3,000 are getting social
services.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the suffering of the chidlren, the magazine
said, is the abandonment of the traditional extended family
systems, especially in cities and towns, which traditionally
provided welfare to the elderly and children.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, which was published by the Ministry of
Information and Culture, stressed the need to carry out a
cultural rehabilitation to revive older traditions.

<HEADLINE> Macao Trade Delegation Arrives in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Macao business and trade
delegation arrived here this afternoon to explore the possibility
of investment in the Portuguese-speaking African country.
</P>
<P>
Victor Pessoa from Macao's Economic Coordination Department,
and head of the 19-strong delegation, said at the airport that
the visit is aimed at establishing trade relations with
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
According to Pessoa, there had been a close trade relationship
between Macao and Mozambique in the first half of 1970s. Later,
due to internal strife in Mozambique, trade volume was brought
down greatly. The current visit by the Macao delegation is to
renew bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, he added, is that Mozambique is now in
a period of economic rehabilitation and development, which offers
great prospects to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The trend of globalization has prompted Macao's enterprises to
increase their investment in southern China and other regions,
Pessoa noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the small scale of Macao's economy, it
has the ability to invest in foreign countries. he expressed his
belief that Macao's entrepreneurs would make contributions to
Mozambican economy.
</P>
<P>
Pessoa said that the Macao delegation shows much interest in
textile, civil architecture and fishery and it will do its best
to work out trade and investment deals during the visit.

<HEADLINE> Merger Value Reachs Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The value of Worldwide company
mergers has reached a record high of 760 billion U.S. dollars so
far this year, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of mergers grew each year since 1993 when it
stood at only over 200 billion dollars, a U.S. consulting firm
Securities Data Corporation was quoted by the Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
Based on its survey, the Computer Science Corporation (CSC)
Index, another U.S. consulting company said a successful merger
could be the one aimed at consolidation in which a dominant player
folds smaller companies into its already finely tuned machine.
</P>
<P>
Other successful cases include pioneering mergers in which two
companies unite to enter a market neither was equipped to enter
alone, and talent-scout mergers in which one company buys another
to obtain access to its people, patents or processes.
</P>
<P>
CSC Index found a difference in financing patterns between
mergers in the 1980's and today. Previously, many of the acquirers
financed their deals through debt, but today's deals are generally
financed with stock or cash.
</P>
<P>
The debt pattern was proven vulnerable to financial turmoil in
the 80's as many of the companies were unable to meet their debt
payments without slashing staff and operating budgets or selling
aspects at rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
Companies have learned to avoid the risks of overpayment and
they tend to be more successful than those in the 80's, analysts
say.

<HEADLINE> CBI Survey Confirms Clear Majority for EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 9 (Xinhua) - A clear majority of CBI
(Confederation of British Industry) members support the principle
of UK membership of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), according
to a CBI survey published here today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two of the firms questioned said the UK should plan to
join EMU as soon as economic convergence is in place, while 16
percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
When asked if their business would be prepared for the
potential impact of EMU if most of Europe moves ahead in 1999,
68 percent said yes, and 13 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
The CBI 1997 Member Survey was conducted to coincide with its
three-day National Conference which opens here today.
</P>
<P>
The Survey also shows that business believes better primary and
secondary education are key to the improving of their ability to
compete as the world enters the next century.
</P>
<P>
Business also prefers any additional spending on publicly
financed services to be funded through specific charges rather
than higher general taxation.
</P>
<P>
And the survey sends a clear message that business understands
the need to respond to the challenge of world climate change.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey, Colin Marshall, CBI President said at
a press conference: "The response of EMU gives a clear message
from CBI members, following the Chancellor's statement to
Parliament. A large majority want the Uk to join EMU provided the
conditions for success are in place.".

<HEADLINE> Movement Formed in Israel to Lobby Withdrawal from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Party MP Yossi
Beilin announced in Tel Aviv today that a movement was formed to
lobby the withdrawal of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) from
Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The movement includes politicians, artists and other
representatives from the grassroot units of the whole country,
Beilin told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The formation of this body is to continue persuading the IDF
to pull out from Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
For the IDF withdrawal, he announced a nine-point program
which could be the alternatives to the Israeli military measures
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The alternatives include carring out IDF's unilateral
withdrawal from Lebanon over a six-month period, seeking an
arrangement to ensure the safety of the South Lebanese Army
soldiers, improving the defense and security arrangements for the
Israeli soldiers and local residents along the northern border,
and seeking security arrangement with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
The program would give Israel a greater chance to safeguard
its security and people in the north and reduce the losses of
lives of the IDF soldiers in South Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in South Lebanon in 1985 with
an area of about 1,100 square kilometers. Since then, the IDF
have been facing strong resistance from the Lebanese army,
particularly from the Hezbollah (Party of God).
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, about 40 IDF officers and soldiers
have lost their lives there, which caused a heated debate in
Israel on whether the IDF should be pulled out from Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Germany Holds Ceremonies to Mourn Victims of Nazi Pogrom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany today held a number of
ceremonies to mark the 59th anniversary of the so-called "Crystal
Night" of November 9, 1938 at which the German Nazis started mass
atrocities against Jews.
</P>
<P>
At the night of November 9, 1938, German Nazi supporters
launched the pogrom against Jews by torching numerous Jewish
synagogues and looting Jewish shops across the country.
</P>
<P>
Up to 30,000 German Jews were arrested and 91 of them were
killed at the night which heralded the mass killings of millions
of Jews later under the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony in a former Nazi concentration camp at
Sachsenhausen near Berlin, leader of the German Jewish community,
Ignatz Bubis, today called for a serious analysis of the problem
of right extremism and warned against playing down the harm of the
Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
A Jewish museum was reopened today at the former concentration
camp after restorations had been completed at two of the camp's
war-time barracks which were destroyed by German neo-Nazis during
an arson attack five years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the eastern German city of Leipzig, Mayor Hinrich
Lehmann-Grube said at a wreath-laying ceremony that only those who
kept alive the memories of the past were well prepared for the
future.
</P>
<P>
In another eastern German city Erfurt, some 300 demonstrators
marched to a local synagogue where they stood in silence for a
minute to mourn the victims of Nazi persecutions.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns US Sanctions against Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned the
economic sanctions by the United States against Sudan and itself,
saying that they were doomed to failure, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The American plots, stemming from its hostility to Muslims,
violated international norms and principles, Iran's Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmmud Mohammadi told reporters in Saudi
capital Riyadh, where he was accompanying Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on a visit.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for U.S. sanctions against Sudan were "totally
baseless and unfounded," he was quoted by the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced last Tuesday that it decided to impose
economic sanctions against Sudan, which included freezing Sudanese
assests in the U.S., barring U.S. investment in Sudan and bans on
U.S. bank loans to Sudan and doing business with it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. based the sanctions on Sudan's alleged support for
international terrorism, its attempts to disrupt stability in
neighboring countries, and its human rights records.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran's solidarity with Muslim Sudan was in
line with its independent policies and refusal to bow to the world
power's pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman attacked U.S. Undersecretary of State for
Trade Stuart Eizenstat for his threat to punish foreign companies
doing business with Iran, saying that it was a clear example of
U.S. intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. "monopolistic and selective policies" against
Iran were doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided last year that it would punish foreign
companies if they invested more than 20 million U.S. dollars in
Iran's oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, French, Russian and Malaysian companies rejected the
U.S. decision, and announced to cooperate with Iran in the South
Pars Gas Deal of 2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> PNA to Send Negotiation Team to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The leadership of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today decided to send the PNA
negotiation team to Cairo to work out a joint plan with other Arab
nations to face the hardline policy of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when the Palestinian-Israeli Washington
peace talks held early this week yielded no progress because of
Israeli inflexibility.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center also quoted PNA
leadership as saying that the Washington talks covered the Israeli
troop redeployment in West Bank and the halt of unilateral
activities such as settlement by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The nine PNA-Israel joint committees resumed their work today
to settle their differences on troops redeployment, Jewish
settlement, airport and seaport in Gaza, safe passage route
between Palestinian self-rule areas and other issues as agreed
upon at the Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the impasse of the peace talks,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to hold
talks with Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London
this Friday and with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Geneva a day
later.

LOS ANGELES, November 9 (Xinhua)--About 10,000 residents in San
Francisco of the United States, in response to their mayor's plea
for clean streets, picked up brooms Saturday to join the city's
first "Great Sweep".
</P>

According to the city's Department of Public Works, a total of
150 tons of litter was cleared away from the streets. In his State

may get into the habit of feeling responsible for their streets.

Volunteers swept away cigarette butts, broken glass, banana
peels and other litter from sidewalks, streets and parks during
the cleanup day which the mayor wants to make into a semiannual

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Delegates to Doha Receive Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli delegates to next
week's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference
have received strict security guidelines on the threats of
attacks during their stay in Qatar, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an Israeli security source as saying that
specific threats have been received that attacks would be
attempted at the conference, in particular on the Israelis
attending the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation is still expected to be headed by
Foreign Minister David Levy despite his statement that he is
reconsidering the issue.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky is also
to make the trip along with 30 public sector officials and 30 to
35 businessmen from private companies.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that the terror organization Abu Nidal had
announced that it would take actions against the conference,
which is scheduled to be held in the Qatari capital of Doha on
November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the security arrangement for the
conference was not perfect, saying that the event is to take
place at the Sheraton Hotel in Doha, but because of the shortage
of guest rooms, most of the participants are to be hosted on three
large marinas docked at the nearby port.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number of participants in the
conference could be between 1,800 and 3,000. However, the
unstable Arab-Israeli relations would contribute to the
uncertainty over the final number.
</P>
<P>
Four Arab countries -- Jordan, Oman, Yemen and Kuwait --
have confirmed their participation in the conference. And
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy will also attend the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Staying Out EMU Poses Serious Costs to UK: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 9 (Xinhua) - Staying out of the single
currency poses serious long term and short term costs, according
to a group of economists surveyed by the European movement.
</P>
<P>
A majority of them believe that the costs will include
exclusion from economic decision making and loss of inward
investment.
</P>
<P>
The balance of opinion within the panel is that the British
economic cycle is currently too out of line with other EU
economies to be able to join in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of the panel believes the cycles will come
gradually into line over the next two years, enabling British
membership of EMU shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
There is a consensus that EMU will go ahead on 1 January 1999,
and that membership will be broad, with most estimates being that
EMU will include ten or eleven.
</P>
<P>
The only definite "out" countries identified by the economists
are Britain, Greece, Denmark and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The European Movement's Economists Panel is made up of eleven
senior economists from a variety of backgrounds and with a range
of views on EMU.

<HEADLINE> Berger: U-2 Expected to Resume Flights Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger said on Sunday that American U-2 planes
were expected to resume flights over Iraq for U.N. inspections
missions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be my expectation" to resume on Monday the flights of
U-2 planes over Iraq, Berger told a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 flights were scheduled last week, but were postponed as
a U.N. three-man mission was in Baghdad to hold talks with Iraqi
officials in an effort to defuse impasse triggered by Iraq's
refusal to allow U.N. arms inspection teams that include Americans
to discharge their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Berger warned Iraq there would be "consequences" if it tries to
shoot down any of the planes.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope the Iraqis would not shoot at a plane on the U.N.
mission," he said. "It would not only be an attack on that plane,
it would be essentially an attack on the international
community... there will be consequences."
</P>
<P>
Berger also rejected Iraq's request that the United Nations
reduce the number of Americans in the inspection teams and replace
U-2 with non-American planes for the reconnaissance flights.
</P>
<P>
"This operation has proceeded for six years with great
professionalism," he said. "It is not for Saddam Hussein to
dictate who the inspectors are."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Leaders, Iranian Minister Discuss Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian leaders today
held meetings with visiting Iranian foreign minister on improving
the lukewarm bilateral relations, reports reaching here from Saudi
capital Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Kharrazi, who arrived here Saturday, also delivered
letters from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to Saudi King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
The letters focus on bilateral relations, Saudi Press Agency
said, but without disclosing details of the letters.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Kharrazi as assuring Abdullah of "Iran's
commitment to improving relations with Saudi Arabia and opening a
new page based on good neighborliness and promotion of common
interests."
</P>
<P>
He also said Iran is willing to forge good and strong ties with
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states and keen on opening a
new page of cooperation and protection of mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi would meet his Saudi counterpart Saud Al-Faisal Monday
to discuss bilateral, regional and Iran-GCC relations.
</P>
<P>
Then he will leave for Kuwait to continue his GCC visit, which
will also bring him to the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors have been
warming up since the start of this year after nearly two decades
of strained ties which were resulted from the presence of Western
forces in the Gulf, Tehran's arms strengthening program and the
ramifications of Iran's Islamic revolution launched in 1979 as
well as territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Saudi Arabia were quoted as saying Kharrazi's Gulf
tour is a new sign of a thaw in ties between Iran and the GCC
states.

the Regent, held a two-hour meeting here today with visiting
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon on both sides'
cooperation to develop water and other projects in the Jordan
Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
They discussed technical agreements in the 1994

implementation of the accords signed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Sharon arrived here today for an official visit, which comes
at a time when the Jordanian-Israeli ties were damaged by a
failed assassination attempt by Israeli intelligence agents
against a leader of the anti-Israeli Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) in Amman in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is unable to manufacture
chemical weapons, a spokesman of Iraq's Ministry of Culture and
Information said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the denial while commenting on a statement by Richard
Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
for dismantling Iraq's mass destructive weapons, Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Butler said recently that Iraq still had the capability to
produce items that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons
within days.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Butler was "not accurate" in his statement
because he knew "quite well" that the UNSCOM had destroyed
everything that was directly related to chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM must verify that Iraq has eliminated chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons before the U.N. Security Council
could decide to lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We do not claim that he is unaware of the facts, but rather
say he is ignoring them," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Peace Process Reaches Stage of Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt warned today that the
Mideast peace process has reached the stage of political crisis
because of current intransigent policies of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, at the monthly forum of the
Egyptian Tourism Companies Chambers Federation this evening, said
he is not optimistic about reaching a solution in the near future.
</P>
<P>
On the Doha Arab-Israeli economic conference scheduled for
16-18 this month in the Qatari capital, Moussa said it comes at a
time the peace process "has never been so crippled" over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
Moussa voiced astonishment at the logic that it is possible to
go on with economic cooperation and defer political issues till
later. "This is warped logic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab presence at the Doha conference will be very limited,
Moussa said, adding that very few Arab countries have agreed to
participate.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the annual regional economic gathering is being
used as a political cover for "other non-economic matters."
</P>
<P>
"Economic gatherings are supposed to provide a chance for
businesspeople to meet. But the fact is that ever since the
regional economic conference was held in Casablanca (Morocco, in
1994), it has been tinged with politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has since been fighting such politicization attempts,
Moussa said, adding that Egypt's hosting of the economic
conference last year took place on the understanding that it was
no summit meeting but an economic event.
</P>
<P>
The fourth Middle East and North Africa economic conference has
divided the Arab world due to Israel's participation. Most Arab
countries are lukewarm to the gathering when the peace process has
been on ice for eight months.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has criticized the conference, the fourth since its
initiation in 1994 as a spinoff of the Mideast peace process, but
decided to reserve its own decision until the last moment.

<P>
AMMAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
today called for a balanced solution to the crisis incurred by
Iraq's expulsion order of U.S. weapon inspectors, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
Such a solution should help carry out United Nations Security
Council resolutions on Iraq, and lift the U.N. sanctions imposed
on the country since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, he said while
meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz was on route to New York to explain before the U.N.
Security Council Iraq's stances on the current crisis, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis should be ended in a way that would guarantee the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, and the dignity of
its people, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided last month to expel the 10 U.S. inspectors working
with the U.N. Special Commission for eliminating mass destructive
weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to strike Iraq with military
force if it goes ahead with its decision. The U.N. Security Council
is making efforts to defuse the crisis by dispatching envoys to
Iraq and it is scheduled to discuss the situation Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Says No Change in its Mideast Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said today that its
decision to attend the controversial Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) economic conference does not mean a change in its Middle
East policy.
</P>
<P>
Attending the conference along with Israel does not mean to
establish any kind of relations with the Jewish state, Kuwaiti State
Minister for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz Dakhil Al-Dakhil said at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait announced Sunday that it would send an under-secretary
of the Finance Ministry to the MENA conference, which Israel would
also attend, due to be held on November 16-18 in Qatari capital
Doha.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dakhil stressed that Kuwait had set concert progress in the
Middle East peace process as a necessary condition for normalizing
its relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait does not have economic ties with Israel and has halted
its normalization process with the Jewish state following Israel's
Jewish settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem last March.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it would not
participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The MENA conference was initially aimed at promoting economic
cooperation between the Arab world and Israel along with the
progress in the peace process. The previous three MENA gatherings
were held in Morocco, Jordan and Egypt from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
But due to Israel's hard-line policies blocking the peace
process, some Arab countries, including Syria and Lebanon, have
declared to boycott the Doha conference, and Egypt is waiting to
see if there is any headway in the Palestinian-Israeli talks and
will make clear its attitude at the last minute.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A memorandum of understanding
was signed here today by the European Union (EU) and Albania,
which is aimed at establishing a legal framework for the
activities of the Customs Assistance Mission set up by the EU in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Assistance Mission was established as part of the
European Commission's request for support that the Albanian
government addressed to the international community following the
unrest in the country in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the recent unrest in Albania, sparked off by the
collapse of pyramid savings schemes, the government lost control
of Albania border crossings, and the customs authorities were
unable to collect customs duties and taxes on imported goods.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, signed by the EU Customs Commissioner Mario
Monti and Arben Malaj, minister of finance of Albania, notes that
one of the pre-conditions for international donor assistance to
Albania was that the government should take control of the border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
During the donors conference on Albania which was held in
Brussels on October 22, 1997, the participants noted that this
pre-condition had been met.

<HEADLINE> Nordic Countries Divide on Baltic Countries' EU Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Prime ministers of five
Nordic countries continue to hold different views on the entry
into the European Union (EU) by three Baltic countries, namely,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Five prime ministers from Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and
Iceland, who met here today to discuss European integration, entry
into European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the Schengen
Accord, voiced at a press conference their disagreement over
admitting the Baltic states into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Finish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said Finland favored the
suggestion by the Commission of the European Union of including
Estonia into the group of countries for the next round of
negotiations on EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Demark and Sweden, however, hoped the negotiation would also
include Latvia and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Denmark Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen said the entry issue
should be decided by politicians instead of the Commission of
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson insisted on Latvia and
Lithuania's participation in the negotiations, viewing it as an
important political signal.
</P>
<P>
The Nordic prime ministers will also hold talks with prime
ministers from the three Baltic countries, which will mainly focus
on the cooperation between North European and Baltic countries, EU
integration and regional security.

<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The '97 International Gingko
Seminar opened today in Beijing under the joint sponsorship of the
State Science and Technology Commission, the Beaufour Ipsen Group
from France and Schwabe Corp from Germany, two major international
pharmaceutical manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 scientists from gingko research institutions and
pharmaceutical enterprises from France, Germany, the United
States, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Japan and China are
attending the three-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
The event is the world's first large-scale international
seminar on the comprehensive development of gingko. Participants
will discuss the latest developments related to plant propagation,
techniques for processing leaves, research on application of
gingko pharmaceuticals and trends in the gingko pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also exhibit new production technology and
new products.
</P>
<P>
The gingko tree, or the "longevity tree", is a specialized
plant species which survived the glacial period.
</P>
<P>
Gingko pharmaceuticals are used for the prevention and
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, senile dementia and organic
neurosis.
</P>
<P>
Clinic research currently focuses on the application of gingko
pharmaceuticals for the treatment of respiratory tract allergies,
the formation of thrombus and rejections of human organ
transplants.
</P>
<P>
The current annual sales volume for gingko products exceeds two
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The species originated in China and the country has currently
over 70 percent of the world's gingko trees. The annual output of
gingko fruit and leaves in China stands at 12,000 tons and 15,000
tons respectively. China's output of gingko extracts approaches
one million tons annually.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Civil Rights Nomination in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. Senate will consider, and probably kill, the nomination
of Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division this week, the committee chairman says.
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican, rejected on Sunday a request
by Democrats on the committee for another hearing to let Lee
answer charges that he has been an advocate of racial and gender
preferences.
</P>
<P>
"An additional hearing won't add a thing, and we are not going
to have an additional hearing. We'll just go to a vote and let the
chips fall whichever way they may," Hatch said on CBS' "Face the
Nation." The vote was set for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee last week sought the
further hearing and postponement of the vote on Lee when it became
apparent it would turn out 9-9. Tie votes count as a rejection.
</P>
<P>
"As far as right now this nomination is dead," Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
In his current position as Western regional counsel for the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, based in Los Angeles,
Lee has opposed California state efforts to end affirmative action
programs for schools and jobs.
</P>
<P>
Hatch called Lee a "very nice person" but said "this man has
pushed preferential rights and special treatment throughout his
life."
</P>
<P>
"It's not about Bill Lann Lee, it's about the positions he's
advocated," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on "Fox News
Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Senator Patrick Leahy, a ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, accused Republicans of using Lee for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Republican leaders want to kill this nomination as a trophy,"
he said. "They are out to please extremists in their party who
oppose relief when equal opportunity is denied to women or
minorities in the workplace."

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Want Action on Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Canadians want
the government to act on climate change even if it slows the
economy, a new poll suggested.
</P>
<P>
The survey is part of a massive international poll of
environmental attitudes in 24 countries. It found support in 15 of
the countries, including Canada, for concerted action on climate
change, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one Canadians agreed that "we should assume the worst and
take major action now to reduce human impacts on climate even if
there are major costs," the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Yet, 32 percent of the 1,530 Canadians surveyed said no major
action should be taken until more is known about the science.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say growing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases are warming the earth's surface, which
would lead to disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that "Canadians are very confused about the
science of climate change, but in the face of scientific
uncertainty, their leaders should err on the side of environmental
caution," said Doug Miller, head of Environics International Ltd.,
which conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey found public support for immediate action on climate
change was highest in France (74 percent), Germany (71 percent),
Italy (71 percent), Switzerland (70 percent), Japan (69 percent),
Australia (67 percent), New Zealand (65 percent) and Canada (61
percent).
</P>
<P>
The Americans were evenly divided between those who want
immediate action and those who believe major action should be
shelved until the science is better understood.
</P>
<P>
The poll results are considered accurate within 2.5 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Britain Prepares For EMU Membership: Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 10 (Xinhua) - British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown announced today his country's first
practical steps in preparation for joining the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said that ministers are planning a public
education exercise to familiarize British people with the use of
euro notes and coins early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Brown made the announcement in his speech at the National
Conference of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The British government will take all steps necessary to
encourage the use of the euro when the single European currency is
introduced on January 1, 1999, said the Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"We will play our part in shaping (EMU) so that if we wish, we
can join the single currency early in the next parliament," he
said. The current parliament expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the chancellor is trying to cement
the Labor government's growing links with business by delivering
what is seen as the most pro-EMU speech.
</P>
<P>
Brown also said business circles and government will work
together to prepare Britain for the monetary union. The CBI will
play a "crucial role" in the practical preparation work, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a growing consensus for the principle of a
single currency. These preparations are not cosmetic but real,"
the Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
He also told the conference that from the launch of the euro,
British companies will be able to file company accounts, issue
shares, have bank accounts and pay taxes all in the euro
currency.

<HEADLINE> Canadian FM Calls for Caution in Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy today urged the U.S. and Iraq to take
caution in handling the crisis caused by Baghdad's decision to
expel Americans in the U.N. weapons inspection teams in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Axworthy told reporters that they held the same view that the
development in Iraq should be handled cautiously to avoid further
escalation.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq should comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions while expressing the hope that the U.S. should take
the matter to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
When asked about a possible U.S. strike against Iraq without
referring to the Council, the Canadian foreign minister said the
situation is different this time because the crisis over weapons
inspection teams is a "pure U.N. affair."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who also attended the
meeting, expressed the hope that the crisis can be resolved
diplomatically and that the Security Council puts an end to it
through a constructive solution between the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction and the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. weapon inspection teams that included
Americans for a seventh day and threatened to shoot down an
American U-2 surveillance plane that resumed flights over Iraq
today as part of U.N. monitoring operations in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While the United States has insisted that there will be no
negotiations with Iraq on the issue of inspections, and
U.S. President Bill Clinton reiterated Sunday that the United
States would not tolerate any attempt to attack the U-2 flights.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has charged that the American inspectors are spies trying
to prolong the U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy, who arrived here Sunday, will also visit Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to
highlight Canada's interest to help break the present standstill
plaguing the Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Nordic Stocks: Bears Not Ready for Hibernation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Nordic stocks are seen
extending Friday's losses in the week ahead amid concern that
turbulence in Asian markets will hurt earnings for exporters such
as forestry companies and ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering
company, according to press here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are now putting a question mark on next year's earnings
outlook because of the Asian turmoil and also weaker growth
outlook," said Bjoern Germer, head of equities at Matteus
Fondkommission. "The trend is now downwards and engineering,
forestry and steel companies are most battered."
</P>
<P>
Nordic forestry firms were among the biggest decliners in the
week. Sweden's "Stora" fell 4.8 percent while Finland's "Enso"
slumped 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications equipment maker which
makes up 40 percent of Finland's benchmark index, fell 4.2 percent
Friday. Nokia generates about one-fifth of its sales in Asia, as
does Sweden's Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
Blue-chips like Norsk Hydro and Petroleum Geo-Services led the
Norwegian losses. Similarly, Kvaerner, a Norwegian construction
and shipbuilding firm with one-quarter of its sales in Asia, fell
1.4 kroner on Friday.

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton urged the United Nations to take "very
strong and unambiguous action" to force Iraq to comply with
international weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The president also warned Iraq not to follow through on threats
to attack American spy planes on United Nations missions.
</P>
<P>
-- In an apparent sign of Washington's displeasure with the
pace of peace talks, no meeting has been planned between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Clinton next
week during Netanyahu's scheduled visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- It was crisis time again for Clinton as he and Republican
congressional leaders worked late into the evening, urgently
trying to scrape together a majority for the plan to give Clinton
the expanded authority he sought to negotiate free-trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
With a vote expected in the early morning hours, both sides
said they anticipated the proposal to pass or fail by a hair.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton says campaign money undermined public confidence,
but he bears some responsibility since the Republicans did the
same thing and, if anything, pushed the limits of the law even
further.

<P>
The two-week strike officially ended Sunday afternoon, after the

</P>
<P>
The unions said the strike had drawn public and media attention
to the provincial government's reform legislation and it is time now
to protest in other ways.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, still under discussion, would allow the
government to cut one billion dollars (710 million U.S. dollars)
from the education system and layoff 10,000 teachers, the unions
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the government said that the reforms are intended to

<HEADLINE> Germany Opposes New EU Spendings on Job Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Bonn would oppose any European
Union project to boost state spendings on job creation at the
upcoming EU job summit in Luxembourg on November 20-21, German
officials indicated here today.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, a senior aide to German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, said at an expert panel on employment today in Bonn that
more state spendings on job creation would not help cut the EU
record unemployment of 18 million, but would instead make things
worse.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the idea of imposing higher job creation
targets on EU states.
</P>
<P>
Instead of more coordinated intervention from Brussels, EU
states should take more decentralized approach to job creation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The German central bank, known as the Bundesbank, as well as
the Federal Labour Office today also stressed at the panel
discussions that job creation should be the responsibility of
individual EU states.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is due to make clear Germany's position on the EU
employment summit in a speech to the parliament on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Hard Hit by Lack of Petrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 10 (Xinhua)-- The economical status of the
Somali capital is still facing hardships due to lack of petrol
despite the end of the strong southeast winds of the Monsoon
early in the month.
</P>
<P>
Several commercial vessels and boats carrying miscellaneous
food items and other commodities from the Gulf countries are
moored at the natural ports of EI-Ma'an and Merca town controlled
by Ali Mahdi and Hussein Aidid respectively.
</P>
<P>
As the food prices remain stable in the main markets of the
capital, Mogadishu is facing its harshest fuel shortage for many
years.
</P>
<P>
The fuel prices in Mogadishu has tripled today, especially the
petrol. Each liter of petrol which was valued at 0.30 U.S. Dollar
three days ago is today sold on 7,000 Somali Shillings, nearly
one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Administration officer of one of Mogadishu fuel importing
enterprises SOPICO Hussein Mohamud Omar said their petrol
reservoirs are almost empty. "this is what causes the prices to
rise," he said, "but we're expecting more fuel to arrive within a
few days."
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Omar, they imported the fuel from the Gulf
countries, mainly from the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the high prices is also attributed to the
strengthened sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United nations
where cheap fuel was leaked out from smuggling tankers.
</P>
<P>
The streets of the Somali capital today are deserted by the
public transport which uses petrol.
</P>
<P>
All mini-buses have stopped operating, but large diesel
vehicles are seen circulating in the rain-flooded streets of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
People walk one after another in the streets leading to and
from the green lines that divide Mogadishu owing to the fuel
shortage.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Rejects Netanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
party leader Ehud Barak today rejected the call from Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for national reconciliation,
according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Barak was reacting to the statements Netanyahu made overnight
at the Likud party Convention in Jerusalem. In an unprecedented
move, Netanyahu openly acknowledge the Labor's contribution to the
country's security and historic achievements.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who opened the convention with one-minute silence
to mark the second anniversary of the assassination of former
Labor premier Yitzhak Rabin, called for national unity, saying
he was extending out his "hand of peace and conciliation to all
parts of this nation."
</P>
<P>
Barak was quoted by Israel Radio as responding that there is a
gap between Netanyahu's statements and deeds. He added that the
real opportunity for Netanyahu to do so is for him to offer an
apology, at the Knesset (Parliament) memorial ceremony Tuesday
held for Rabin, for his incitement that preceded Rabin's
killing.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was shot dead on November 4, 1995, at a Tel Aviv peace
rally by a radical Jew named Yigal Amir, who claimed he killed
Rabin in order to prevent him from handing over more Israeli
land to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is widely blamed for partially responsible for
organizing the inciting campaign against Rabin and his government
over his peace policies. The Labor party is demanding Netanyahu
make a formal apology for the incitement campaign.
</P>
<P>
At the biggest ever peace rally in the country's history held
in Tel Aviv Saturday night, about 200,000 people gathered at the
Rabin Square, where Rabin was murdered, to show their support for
peace and demand Netanyahu apologize for his role in the Rabin
affair.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, Barak vowed to carry on Rabin's peace
legacy and strive to replace the Netanyahu government "with a
responsible leadership."
</P>
<P>
Another opposition leader Yossi Sarid, head of Meretz party,
directly called for Netanyahu's resignation to take
responsibility for one of the biggest tragedies the Jewish state
has experienced.
</P>
<P>
The ruling and opposition parties are expected to trade slurs
at the Knesset ceremony to mark Rabin's assassination. Today, a
group of Labor Knesset members laid wraths at Rabin's graveside
on Mourt Herzl, western Jerusalem, to pay their tributes to the
pioneering peacemaker.

and protect investment is to institute an investment regime that
is free, open, transparent and stable.

said, noting that the Basic Law, which has delineated and
institutionalized the unprecedented concept of "one country, two
systems," protects the rights, freedoms and lifestyle of the SAR
people.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.S. Envoy's visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
welcomed a forthcoming visit to the island by the
U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus and said it expects positive
results.
</P>
<P>
Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian peace deal, is
coming to Cyprus later today for meetings with the leaders of the
two communities, including a joint meeting which will be held
Tuesday, Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his
daily press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Holbrooke will have a meeting
with President Glafcos Clerides and will then cross into northern
part of the island for a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Christofides welcomed international interest, especially on
behalf of the U.S., in a settlement to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time there is so much international interest,
on behalf of the U.S., the U.N., the European Union and many
others," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added the "American interest in a settlement is
expressed at the highest possible level, from President (Bill)
Clinton to the Secretary of State and other officials."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Turkish intransigence would be
overcome and a settlement to the protracted Cyprus question would
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Miller, U.S. State Department Special Coordinator for
Cyprus, arrived here Monday night to make preparations for
Holbrooke's discussions on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Clerides this morning, Miller
said he is trying to "make progress" toward a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Holbrooke comes to Cyprus to hold discussions,
not negotiations with the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, declined to make any optimistic predictions
on the results of Holbrooke's first visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third part in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup in
Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> WHO Favors More Funds for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A WHO official said today
Africa needs more than double its annual budget allocation of 76
million U.S. Dollars for effective disease control and
implementation of other health programs in the poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
Regional director of the World Health Organization (WHO) for
Africa Ebrahim Samba said here that the ever-growing poverty
militated against efforts by both WHO and other health
organizations trying to improve the state of health in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, this year all of Africa could be hit by a
severe drought that will inevitably multiply the malnutrition
rate and open the way for the spread of diseases," said Samba.
</P>
<P>
He said the spread of AIDS is on the increase in southern and
central Africa where experts estimated the rate of infection to
average 10 percent of national populations.
</P>
<P>
As a result life expectancy is already being estimated to drop
from 50 years at present to 40 years by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
However, Samba paid tribute to African leaders, who, through
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) made an undertaking to
fight diseases by allocating more funds to the health sector.
</P>
<P>
"In 1995, OAU resolved to fight for the eradication of AIDS
and although the disease is still ravaging economies, the effort
against it is noticeable at national and continental levels," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OAU resolution in 1996 to fight polio had
also received tremendous support from governments and "I am happy
to say very very soon polio will be eradicated in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"However, malaria is still a problem, hence the declaration in
June in Harare, by OAU heads of state to allocate more resources
to programs against its spread," said Samba.

<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here for Riyadh today for coordination with Saudi leaders on
the controversial economic conference to be held in Qatar later
this month.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, Mubarak is expected to meet with King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdallah Ibn Abdul-Aziz on
the Mideast peace developments, bilateral ties, the outcome of his
recent tour of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The president has said that he did not discuss with leaders of
the UAE, Oman and Bahrain the topic of the forthcoming Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference, scheduled for
November 16-18 in Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
"I've preferred to let the matter be decided on by every
country in accordance with its interests," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will take an appropriate decision (on whether go to the
conference) at the opportune time," he added, noting that any
Egyptian stance on that score will spring from the view of how far
the gathering will benefit the region that is bogged down in a
peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said on November 1 that Israel's failure to honor peace
pledges rendered the MENA conference meaningless.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have said
they would boycott the controversial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The annual gathering, initiated in 1994 as a spinoff of the

<HEADLINE> Lanchang River in SW China Dammed for Construction of Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DACHAOSHAN (Yunnan Province), November 10 (Xinhua) -- The
Lancang River in southwest China was blocked this morning for
construction of the Dachaoshan Hydropower Station, the second of its
kind on the river.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang attended today's damming ceremony
and noted that the event symbolizes that China has turned a new
page in developing hydropower resources of the river.
</P>
<P>
The river originates in the Tangula Mountain in northwest
China's Qinghai Province and is named Mekong after it enters into
Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-km Lancang River, which offers vast potential hydropower
resources and untold advantageous conditions, has been listed as a
national hydropower development base. Plans call for construction
of 14 tiered hydropower stations on the river with a combined
generating capacity of 22 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The Dachaoshan Hydropower Station will be the second one being
built on the river, following the one at Manwan.
</P>
<P>
Dachaoshan will have an installed capacity of 1.35
million kw and will be able to generate 5.9 billion kwh of
electricity a year. The first generator is scheduled to go online

<HEADLINE> Liberalization, Globalization Not One-way Street-Gujral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said today that liberalization and globalization
cannot be a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day meeting of the Council of the Socialist
International here, Gujral said that for both these processes to
be sustainable, they must be based on a genuine appreciation of
different points of view and different objective conditions.
</P>
<P>
"If, to the developed countries, globalization is a means to
optimize profits by locating factories near the areas of
consumption or a way to overcome high labor costs and escape high
tariff barriers, it is equally important that to developing
countries this process means better terms of trade and market
access and a greater inflow of resources for critical
developmental needs," Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent exchange rate fluctuations across Asia,
Gujral termed it as a significant pointer to the need to insulate
the developing economies from the aggressive flow of global
finance. "It is only if these factors are kept in mind that global
change can take place on the resilient foundations of long-term
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century must be a period when the issues arising out
of the process of globalization are systematically and equitably
dealt with and resolved, he said.

<HEADLINE> Big Powers Asked to Mediate in U.N.-Iraq Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Big countries such as Russia,
Britain, France, China and Japan should offer their mediation and
help end the conflict between the United Nations and Iraq, an
Indonesian legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Big countries other than the United States could see how Iraq
could improve its economy. And they could do so without (being
influenced) by U.S. interests stipulated in U.N. decisions,
particularly in the U.N. Security Council," deputy chairman of the
House Committee on Domestic and Foreign Affairs, Abu Hasan Sazili,
said.
</P>
<P>
Sazili expressed concern over the escalating U.N.-Iraq
conflict, with U.S. interests in the shadow.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations fears that a war might break out
following the war of words between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to shoot down any
U.S. plane carrying out reconnaissance mission for a U.N. special
committee.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the U.S. government has warned that shooting down any
U.S. plane would be a declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
The conflict was renewed after Iraq banned U.S. experts on a
U.N. team from inspecting its weapons sites, on the grounds that
Washington is using the U.N. Security Council to keep in place the
sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is expected to escalate further now that American
experts claimed that Iraq has been found developing chemical
weapons, Sazili said.
</P>
<P>
"If the conflict becomes an open war, it will damage all sides.
Thus, the world community should seek ways to establish a dialogue
between the United Nations and Iraq to settle the conflict
(peacefully)," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The fact that five summits

social basis in China, Qiao said, adding that both common people
and deputies to the National People's Congress are interested in
Russia and welcome the establishment of the Sino-Russia strategic
cooperative partnership.

parliament to push for constant advancement of bilateral friendly
ties of cooperation.

relations," he said.

<P>
During his last visit to China in April 1996, he said, the two
sides signed a joint statement and more than 10 cooperation
agreements. In review of this, both sides are doing well in

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Cahora Bassa, Africa's most
powerful hydro-electric station based in Songo County in
Mozambique's northwestern Tete Province has been trial-supplying
power to Zimbabwe since last week.
</P>
<P>
Noticias, the local daily today quoted Goncalves Guedes,
director of the services department of the station as saying that
the trial-supply, which started Monday last week, will come to an
end early this week.
</P>
<P>
Guedes said, "everything is fine and the effect ideal."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that 150 mwh would be supplied at the first
phase, and it plans to supply Zimbabwe with 500 mwh after the
final trial in late November and early December.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the beginning of October, the station had
trial-supplied electricity through the power line extending some
1,000 km to South Africa, which is the first of its kind in 14
years.
</P>
<P>
Guedes said that they had tried to use the western line to
deliver 640-650 mwh to Zimbabwe last week, and will make a test
of the eastern line again this week, planning to trial deliver
electricity to South Africa in December.
</P>
<P>
The Cahora Bassa Hydro-electric Station, which started its
commercial operation in 1977, is claimed to be one of the largest
hydro-power stations in the world.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is in a position to buy three-quarters of the
total capacity of the giant 2,000 megawatt dam. Along with
Zimbabwe and South Africa, Malawi is also interested in getting
electricity from the huge dam.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 pylons had been destroyed during the Mozambican
civil war which ended in 1992. The entire job consisted of
putting up 2,200 pylons along the 900 km transmission line
running from Cahora Bassa in Mozambique's Tete Province to South

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin held a session with the
press shortly after their talks here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in the talks the two sides exchanged views on
bilateral relations and major international issues of common
concern in an indepth manner, and reached consensus on a wide
range of matters.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang said, Sino-Russian relations have
enjoyed comprehensive and healthy development through concerted
efforts of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The joint statement between China and Russia signed just now
by President Yeltsin and me summarizes the treasurable experience
and important achievements in the sound development of bilateral
ties in the last six years." he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Chinese saying "friendly neighbors are treasurable
to a country," Jiang stressed that the good-neighborly relations
between China and Russia are not only the choice of politicians of
the two countries, but a common desire of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived here last night for a two-day state
visit. said that Russia-China ties have scored sound growth in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state have just concluded the fifth summit in
a candid, sincere, friendly and constructive atmosphere, which
demonstrate that mutual trust has been established between the two
countries and their leaders, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, is of great importance to the development of
the friendship between the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, speaking of the strategic cooperative partnership
between Russia and China, which is oriented to the 21st century,
said that the relationship features full equality, mutual trust
and long-term good-neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Established with good study of historical experience in
Sino-Russian relations, the relationship is in the fundamental
interests of the two peoples and will benefit world peace and
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated that China pursues an independent foreign
policy of peace, and develops relations with other countries by
following the principle of non-alignment and not being directed
against any third nation.

As the national conditions, historical backgrounds and
geographical positions vary from one country to another, China's
relations with them do not follow the same pattern, Jiang
said. However, he added, the relations do share one point in
common, that is the aim to maintain world peace and promote common
development.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, as each other's largest neighboring nation

countries which first signed an air services agreement in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reflection of the genuine desire of the governments
of Malaysia and New Zealand to liberalize and develop efficient,
viable and mutually beneficial international air services," Ling
said.
</P>
<P>
The main principles of the open skies agreement include
multiple designation of airlines and no limitation on the level of
frequencies that can be operated by designated airlines.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the new agreement will also facilitate further
development of trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people
contact between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Botswana President to Step Down: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Botswana President
Ketumile Masire is expected to announce his retirement from
office today at the opening session of parliament, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted sources within the Botswana National Assembly as
saying that Masire had ordered an unusual number of personal
invitations to be sent out for the afternoon ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Masire, who has been president for 17 years, was expected to
hand the reins of power to his Vice President and Finance
Minister, Festus Mogae before the end of the year, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, Mogae could succeed Masire at least
until the next election, which must be held in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Masire had consistently refused to step down. But in an
interview two weeks ago he made it clear that he would not go
beyond the 1999 election.
</P>
<P>
The newly amended constitution limited the president's term to
10 years. But Masire could serve two five-year terms after the
1999 elections since the measure was not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he would not do so, saying: "I am not
going to carry on for another 10 years. The law is not
retroactive... but that would not be the letter of the law, nor
the spirit of the law."
</P>
<P>
Masire expressed his confidence in the leadership of his
party, the Botswana Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"There are equally competent, if not more competent, people to
take the initiative. I am confident that they'll push this
country ahead."
</P>
<P>
He also promised not to interfere with the running of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he saw Botswana after 1999, Masire said: "It depends
on the outcome of the election. If we win, as I wish and hope we
shall, we are blessed with having some very good men in the
leadership of the Botswana Democratic Party even if I'm not
there."

<HEADLINE> China Seeks More Foreign Investment for Primary Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to
encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) for projects related to
new agricultural technology and primary industries, including the
energy, transportation and major raw materials sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will accelerate the construction of
agricultural infrastructure in order to improve production
conditions, with priority placed on water conservancy," according
to Song Mi, director of the Fixed Assets Department of the State
Planning Commission. Song made the remarks during the ongoing
international seminar on China's Investment policies and project
financing.
</P>
<P>
Song said the government will place greater emphasis on
environmental protection in order to achieve a sustainable
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, water conservancy and environmental protection will
both hold an important position in terms of investment and
construction, and foreign friends are welcome to participate in
related fields," said Song.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government considers primary industries as the
focal point of the state's investment program and has drafted a
series of preferential policies to facilitate investment in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Song noted that China's investment in the capital construction
of the primary industries has surpassed one trillion yuan since
the early 1990s, with said figure accounting for more than 40
percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China will maintain rapid economic growth in the
coming years calls for increased investments in primary
industries, said Song adding that the government will continue to
carry out effective policies to support development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The 3-day seminar, sponsored by the State Planning Commission,
has attracted delegates from more than 20 member countries of the
Berne Union, as well as Chinese officials and
experts. Participants will discuss China's economic policies, the
nation's investment environment and the prospects for primary
industries.

<HEADLINE> Nordic and Baltic Prime Ministers to Meet in Helsinki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Prime Ministers of five
Nordic and three Baltic countries will meet today in Helsinki,
Finland, to discuss European integration and regional economic
cooperation, according to local press reports here.
</P>
<P>
Economic stability in the Baltic states is seen on both sides
of the Atlantic as a key ingredient in regional security.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers will also discuss Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's proposal made on October 24 to engage the Nordic and
Baltic states in a pact covering the region's economy, ecology and
military security.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which is viewed by some as an attempt to prevent
a further enlargement of NATO, has not received much enthusiasm in
the Nordic and Baltic countries. Swedish Deputy Foreign Minister
Pierre Schori said his country sees "no need to link confidence
building to a regional security arrangement."
</P>
<P>
The Nordic and Baltic countries are Finland, Sweden, Denmark,
Norway, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows to Stick to Bank Liquidation Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
today that it will adhere to its decision of liquidating 16 ailing
banks to uphold the law and restore the country's credibility in
the international community and accept the consequences of that
decision.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is a law-based state, so if one feels actions are
being taken to their detriment, he or she is free to pursue it
through legal channels," Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told a
plenary session of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the government had followed proper
procedures, including issuing advance warnings, before finally
deciding to close the 16 banks on November 1.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on the owners, management and
employees of the liquidated banks to cooperate with the government
and obey government rules on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie pointed out that the government closed the banks for
insufficient assets to cover their obligations, particularly
because of bad debts.
</P>
<P>
The weight of bad debts that burdened the banks made them
unable to cover their expenses so they suffered losses, the amount
of which ballooned year by year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the banks' ability to collect funds from
their clients had weakened, causing their finances to mostly
depend on the short-term money market, with high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of the losses was very big, causing capital to
drop below zero. Warnings and proposals for improvement issued by
the Bank of Indonesia, the central bank, received less than
positive response from the management of the banks.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation of the 16 banks constituted an important
element in the government's program to restore health to the
banking sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the current monetary crisis, which has badly hit
the country's economy, the Indonesian government has taken many
measures including seeking 23 billion U.S. dollars in aid from the
International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's External Reserves Hit $8bn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external reserves,
which doubled in less than two years, hit the mark of eight
billion U.S. Dollars in September this year.
</P>
<P>
This stretched the nation's capacity to finance its imports to
over six months, a source at the Finance Ministry said at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The reserves were quadrupled in 1996 after going up to 4.07
billion Dollars from 1.44 billion Dollars from 1995, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the task of building the external reserves has
been a priority of the government.
</P>
<P>
The positive outlook in the reserves position was accounted
for by the tight fiscal and monetary policies of the federal
government, which led to general mood of improvement in the
country's macro-economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate went down to 12 percent in August this year
from 28 percent at the end of last year and 72.8 percent in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exchange rate dropped from 82.5 Naira to one U.S. Dollar to 80
Naira to one dollar las week. The rate had stabilized at 82.5
Naira for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier targeted an exchange rate of 75
Naira to one Dollar for December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Increases in price and volume of oil exports, which earn more
than 80 percent of the country's foreign exchange, also added to
the stock of the external reservers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the external debt stock declined to about 27
billion Dollars from 28 billion as at the end of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Over one thousand Students
of Bethlehem University went to the streets today to
show their solidarity with Palestinian prisoner Ataf Alayan.
</P>
<P>
Shouting anti-Israeli slogans, the students marched from the
university campus to the center of the city of Bethlehem to demand
the release of Alayan, who is on a hunger strike in Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
For fear that the situation might run out of control, Israeli
security forces and police fired tear gas into the crowd, forcing
the students to disperse.
</P>
<P>
Alayan was re-arrested by the Israeli police about three weeks
ago after being released from Israeli prison under the Oslo
Agreement signed between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her arrest, she went on a hunger strike to
protest against the arrest and the her placement of
administrative detention without charge by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Her health is continuing to deteriorate due to the hunger
strike, causing worries among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Echoing a call by the Palestinian prisoners organization, about
800 Palestinian prisoners staged a one-day hunger strike today in
various Israeli prisons to show their solidarity with Alayan.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad Movement of Palestine issued a statement in Gaza
Strip on Sunday holding Israel full responsibility for the life
of Alayan.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Air Force Chopper Downed by Rebel Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Mi-24 attack helicopter of
the Sri Lankan Air Force was brought down by a rebel missile this
morning at Kokkilai Lagoon in the northeastern coastal area, with
its two pilots killed, the military said this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said the incident took place when the
ill-fated chopper was escorting three Mi-17 helicopters
transporting troops from Vavuniya to Elephant Pass in the north.
</P>
<P>
The fleet left Vavuniya at 11:15 a.m. local time. The escort
chopper observed four boats of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) at sea off the Kokkilai coast and decided to change
course to ensure the safety of the troops on board.
</P>
<P>
When the choppers were over the Kokkilai Lagoon, the LTTE
rebels fired two missiles, one of which hit the Mi-24 and brought
it with its two pilots and two gunners down into the lagoon. A
Mi-17 chopper sustained damage to the rotor and tail boom due to
the explosion of the missile.
</P>
<P>
The other choppers activated the anti-missile system and evaded
the second missile.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Army and Navy personnel rushed to the lagoon
and rescued one pilot and two gunners from the crashed Mi-24.
</P>
<P>
But the pilot later succumbed to his injuries in hospital. The
Defense Ministry told Xinhua that the other pilot on board the
Mi-24 which sank in the waters of the lagoon was presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
The three Mi-17s later returned safely to Vavuniya with all
soldiers on board. Military sources said each of the choppers
could carry as many as 35 soldiers in addition to its crew.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate state of their own in
the north and east of the country since 1983. Missile attacks by
the rebels have caused great losses of aircraft and personnel to
the military.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The unidentified ships and
helicopters spotted along the coast of northern Mozambique's Cabo
Delgado Province is very worrisome, a high-ranking officer said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Raimundo Macie, police commissioner of the province was quoted
by the local daily Naticias as saying that the ships and
helicopters might be involved in robbery and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the provincial government revealed
such incidents in a month. Earlier on October 10, the
commissioner of Palma county said that within a period of four
weeks, ships and helicopters had been seen popping up and off
along the coast line of the county.
</P>
<P>
Macie said that the criminal rate in the province had
increased by 14 percent from January to October with 2,414 cases
recorded, adding that smuggling and drug trafficking are out of
control in the province for the special geological position and
the lack of supervision measures.
</P>
<P>

<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Germany is to provide Jordan with a soft loan of 43
million Deutch marks (about 25 million U.S. dollars) to finance
the construction of a water network project in Amman,
semi-official Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
An agreement signed by both sides on Sunday stipulates that
the German Bank for Development and Reconstruction will finance
part of the project for replacing the worn-out water network which
runs some 500 kilometers within the city.
</P>
<P>
The whole project is expected to cost 24 million dinars (about
34 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Jordanian Minister of Planning Rima
Khalaf and German Ambassador to Amman Peter Mende.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The United Nations Security Council's Sanctions
Committee on Iraq has approved requests by a number of Jordanian
firms to export goods worth 1.74 million U.S. dollars to Iraq
under the oil-for-food deal, semi-official Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The latest approval allows Jordan to export more medicines,
table salt and galvanized metal, the paper quoted an unidentified
source in the Jordanian Ministry of Industry and Trade as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Iraq concluded contracts with 35 Jordanian
industrial institutions to purchase goods worth more than 83
million dollars within the framework of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Since Israel and Canada began implementing a free
trade agreement in January, bilateral trade volume in the first
eight months of the year reached 295 million U.S. dollars, a 50
percent increase over that of the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post newspaper today reported that in the period,
Israel's imports from Canada totaled 95 million dollars and its
exports to Canada amounted to 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The free trade agreement's purpose is to substantially
increase trade in both directions, and it seems to be doing
that," said Canada's Ambassador to Israel David Berger Sunday in
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the upcoming visit to Israel by Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy is also expected to boost the bilateral
trade dramatically, he added.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Optimistic on Peace Talks With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) today expressed optimism that its talks
with the Philippine government this week will remove obstacles to
the implementation of an earlier cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF deputy chairman for political affairs,
was quoted by local television reports as saying he believed the
upcoming meeting will lead to the signing of a document on
cease-fire ground rules, key to the implementation of the truce
signed by the two sides on July 18.
</P>
<P>
On November 12-13, peace panels from the MILF and the
government will meet in the city of Marawi in central Mindanao to
discuss the much-delayed drafting of ground rules and guidelines
for carrying out the accord on the cessation of hostilities
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Abdulhaziz Minbantas, MILF deputy chairman for internal
affairs, will replace Jaafar as MILF chief peace negotiator in the
Marawi meeting, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said the MILF has already prepared its proposed agenda
for the meeting, the eighth round of their exploratory peace talks
with the government.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the MILF and the government to forge an agreement on
ground rules regarding the comprehensive cease-fire accord failed
due to two incidents last month -- the controversial public
execution by the MILF of alleged criminals and an attack by two
alleged Arab terrorists on a military camp in central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government force in
the country, with an estimated membership of nearly 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the extremist Abu Sayyaf are the two remaining
Muslim rebel groups fighting the government troops. The MNLF
signed a peace agreement with Manila in September last year.

Yeltsin offered his congratulations on the smooth return of
Hong Kong to China and the successful convocation of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He also
expressed the hope that China will record new progress in its
modernization drive under the guidance of the spirit of the party
congress. "Russia hopes to see a prosperous and strong China,"
said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed sincere appreciation for Yeltsin's
congratulatory words and best wishes. China and Russia, two great
neighboring countries which share a long border, have an important
positive role to play in safeguarding the regional and world peace
and stability as they gain ever greater prosperity, wealth and
strength, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President briefed Yeltsin on his recent state visit
to the United States. Jiang addressed the international situation
by noting that China stands firm in its belief that a country
should have the final say in its own affairs, and world affairs
should be decided upon by all countries.
</P>
<P>
Great powers have a major responsibility for safeguarding world
peace and promoting international development, and should
therefore abandon a Cold War mentality, respect the reality of a
diversified world, conform to the trend of world
multipolarization, and establish cooperative relations based on
mutual respect, equality and trust, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China will continue to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's
thoughts on foreign affairs, unswervingly uphold an independent
foreign policy of peace, actively develop friendly cooperative
ties with countries throughout the world, and work jointly to
create a new century featuring world peace and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Singapore: Southeast Asia Can Rebound From Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asia will be able
to rebound from the currency and stock market crisis after a
period of adjustment and consolidation, Singapore Trade and
Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the recent economic difficulties in the region, the
prospect for future growth remains bright for the ASEAN countries
especially after a period of adjustment and consolidation," the
minister told the opening session of the inaugural ASEAN-European
Union Partenariat.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) now consists
of nine countries in the region -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
"Although the financial sectors in some ASEAN countries have to
make tough adjustments, there are few structural impediments to
future growth which is expected to remain high after this period
of correction," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he pointed out that the currency devaluation has
made the exports from ASEAN countries more competitive in world
markets, especially those products with high local contents.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that the ASEAN economies have high
saving rates and their governments have invested heavily in
education and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
On the just-launched first ASEAN-EU Partenariat, which aims to
promote long-term business and trade ties between the small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from both regions, he called on
companies to form strategic alliances in order to be regionally
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-EU Partenariat is one of the largest business
matching meetings involving some 500 SMEs from ASEAN and European
Union members.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Offer Opportunities For Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The current volatility in
Asian financial markets would calm over the next 12 months,
offering new opportunities for Australia's domestic fund managers
to invest in Asian interest rate markets, a manager of an
investment firm says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, domestic funds have been reducing their
domestic fixed interest asset allocations in line with falling
interest rates, said investment director Michael Clarke of
Equitilink Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
And with cash in hand the search by funds for better investment
opportunities was on, he said. "There will be ongoing shocks,
surprises and uncertainties coming out of the region over the next
six to nine months at least," Clarke said of Southeast Asia at a
conference on debt capital markets in Sydney, the Australia
Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a period of confusion while they reorganize, and
then we expect them to come out of this. We should see that in a
year or two things will certainly be more stable," Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said investment rates in Southeast Asia offered
potential for "tremendous rewards" over a medium-term horizon.
</P>
<P>
"The yield there is very attractive...they are very, very
attractive yields," Clarke said, referring to short-term interest
rates of between 10-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, short-term rates are around 15 percent, compared
to 5.0 percent in Australia, Clarke said, "So if you are prepared
to look at it...tremendous rewards are possible in the next five
years."
</P>
<P>
But this outlook did not ignore glaring inefficiencies in some
Southeast Asian markets. For instance, some countries do not have
a clear timetable for the release of economic data and this can
disadvantage bond traders' views of what is happening in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"There are many inefficiencies, there are many problems, and
you need to be alert and not trust almost anything you get but the
compensation for this is a 1,000 basis point yield pick-up," said
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
As Clarke saw, yields in Australia were likely to remain low
for at least another four to five years.

<HEADLINE> Modernization Project for Karachi Port Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
approved the second five-year modernization project for the
Karachi Port.
</P>
<P>
The five-year project, formulated by the Karachi Port, is
expected to start in 1998 at a cost of 350 million U.S. dollars,
said Khalid M. Mir, chairman of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the Jinnah Bridge in Karachi
today, Mir said the cost of the five-year plan has a 50-percent
foreign currency financing from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes improvement and deepening of the navigable
channel; procurement of harbor craft like tugs, pilot boats,
dredges, survey launches and pollution control equipment; setting
up of a new hazardous cargo terminal with related equipment; and
construction of a container freight station, according to Mir.
</P>
<P>
He said preparations for various schemes under this plan are
under way and physical implementation will begin at the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The KPT chairman said that at present the Karachi Port handles
about 75 percent of the country's maritime cargo trade and
supports the livelihood of more than 100,000 people by employing
about 20,000 port workers.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-97 fiscal year, the port handled 24.2 million
tons of cargo carried by more than 1,700 ships with almost zero
off-port waiting time, he said.

<HEADLINE> Call for Better Social Care Caused by Family Tragedy in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The tragedy of Macao family in
which the parents killed themselves following their two children's
death has touched off a call for more social care.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chak-keung, 39, a decoration worker, and his wife Tong In
Chan, 35, were found to have hanged themselves together on Sunday
morning after their son and daughter died of a fire on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The incident has caused a wide-spread call to improve social
care and psychiatric help for those needed.
</P>
<P>
While giving front-paged coverage of the incident, all eight
local Chinese newspapers have carried some form of editorials
today, either urging the government to establish psychiatric aide
center, or provide more care to those needed.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said in a commentary that many
lower-income families commonly leave their children unattended
while both parents are out working, posing great danger for the
kids. But that is the only choice they can make.
</P>
<P>
"The first incident of the death of the children has sounded
the alarm for negligence," it said. "But again negligence has
caused the death of the couple. That teaches us a profound
lesson."
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper said that the Government should pay more
attention to the caring of children in families of double working
parents and single-parent families.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said that social psychiatric help center
should be established to meet the needs of those suffered from
natural disasters. It also urges residents to help each other to
prevent similar tragedies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, social workers said that the tragedy means a warning
that Macao needs better psychiatric crisis service and more
professional psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
Top executives of the Macao Charity, the Macao Better Family
Promotion Association, and some members of the Macao Legislative
Assembly, all made remarks urging the Government and social
welfare centers to establish a quick-action mechanism offering
necessary social help.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM on Constitutional Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard today urged republicans and monarchists to use next
year's constitutional convention to find an alternative to the
current system of government.
</P>
<P>
Howard said there is no point in republicans and monarchists
using the convention, scheduled for February next year, to try to
persuade each other to change their mind on the main issue.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Howard said they should try and thrash out an
agreement on an alternate system of government, which could then
be put to a national vote.
</P>
<P>
"There's no point at the convention in convinced republicans
trying to persuade convinced anti-republicans to change their mind
on the threshold issue," he said over the Nine Network.
</P>
<P>
"I think the convention should spend its time, both republicans
and non-republicans alike, trying to reach agreement on the
alternative to the present system."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) welcomed Howard's
comments, claiming that the prime minister has rejected the
negative approach being taken by the monarchists.
</P>
<P>
But Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) said there
would be no negotiations on any alternative to the current
government system.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no negotiation by no-republic-ACM delegates on
any change to our current constitutional arrangements and all
republican alternatives will be refuted in the strongest of
terms," ACM Executive Director Kerry Jones said in a statement,
available here today.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed to the solid foundation for Sino-Russian economic
and trade relations, and said the two sides should make even
greater efforts to fully tap their respective vast potentials and
advantages by creating new fields and forms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Breakthroughs should be made in long-term cooperation related
to large and medium-sized projects," said Jiang, adding that the
two sides are fully capable of conducting large-scale cooperation
in such fields as petroleum, natural gas, electricity, aerospace,
machine-building and high technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will actively approach related efforts, and
stressed that the Commission for Regular Meetings Between the
Heads of Government of Russia and China will play an important
role in promoting economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries. He noted that enterprises from the two countries should
expand contacts in order to find partners for cooperative ventures.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin pointed to the high complementarity of the Russian and
Chinese economies. He said the two countries have entered a number
of economic cooperation and trade projects and have put forward
many proposals in this regard. The two sides should further
strengthen cooperation and implement the proposals as soon as
possible, according to the Russian President.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed full confidence in further promoting
bilateral trade through continued joint efforts, with both
expressing their belief that it is perfectly possible for the
Sino-Russian trade volume to hit 20 billion U.S. dollars by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Presidents on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin held a session with the
press shortly after their talks here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in the talks the two sides exchanged views on
bilateral relations and major international issues of common
concern in an indepth manner, and reached consensus on a wide
range of matters.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang said, Sino-Russian relations have
enjoyed comprehensive and healthy development through concerted
efforts of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The joint communique between China and Russia signed just now
by President Yeltsin and me summarizes the treasurable experience
and important achievements in the sound development of bilateral
ties in the last six years." he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Chinese saying "friendly neighbors are treasurable
to a country," Jiang stressed that the good-neighborly relations
between China and Russia are not only the choice of politicians of
the two countries, but a common desire of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived here last night for a two-day state
visit. said that Russia-China ties have scored sound growth in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state have just concluded the fifth summit in
a candid, sincere, friendly and constructive atmosphere, which
demonstrate that mutual trust has been established between the two
countries and their leaders, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, is of great importance to the development of
the friendship between the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, speaking of the strategic cooperative partnership
between Russia and China, which is oriented to the 21st century,
said that the relationship features full equality, mutual trust
and long-term good-neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Established with good study of historical experience in
Sino-Russian relations, the relationship is in the fundamental
interests of the two peoples and will benefit world peace and
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated that China pursues an independent foreign
policy of peace, and develops relations with other countries by
following the principle of non-alignment and not being directed
against any third nation.
</P>
<P>
As the national conditions, historical backgrounds and
geographical positions vary from one country to another, China's
relations with them do not follow the same pattern, Jiang
said. However, he added, the relations do share one point in
common, that is the aim to maintain world peace and promote common
development.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, as each other's largest neighboring nation
and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
shoulder a special responsibility for world peace and development,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed satisfaction with the progress made in the
fruitful cooperation of the two countries on many important
issues, saying that the Chinese side is ready to work with the
Russian side to further enrich the existing partnership.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China and South Africa
signed 18 trade and investment contracts and protocols totaling
540 million U.S. Dollars in Johannesburg this morning.
</P>
<P>
The agreements covered finance, trade and investment, said
Zhou Jie, an official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The largest deal was an agreement between China's Northeastern
Power Transmission and Transformation Group and South Africa's
Eskom company to import from China power transmission and
transformation equipment worth 130 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to set up 12 joint ventures in South
Africa, Shi Guangsheng, head of a massive Chinese trade and
economic delegation, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who is deputy foreign trade minister, said the agreements
sealed today represented only part of the trade and economic
achievements between the two countries and that more deals are
under way.
</P>
<P>
He said these agreements were the starting point and provided
a foundation for future cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of diplomatic relations, he said, there
would be more trade and economic cooperation.

He said the agreements will contribute to South Africa's
economic development, job creation and improvement of housing
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Strong buying in resource
stocks and relative stability in Asian trading pushed the
Australian sharemarket higher today in defiance of predictions
that it would head for the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index rose 8.2 points to close at 2521.6
although it opened lower on the back of Friday night's fall on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said takeover rumors surrounding some major resource
stocks, including MIM and WMC, were responsible for strong buying
interest in these stocks today.
</P>
<P>
"With some of the resource stocks as low as they are, there
were some takeover rumors on Friday and it looks as though some of
that has flowed through to today's market and perhaps some people
are suggesting some of those stocks are pretty under-priced," a
Brisbane broker said.
</P>
<P>
The All Resources Index rose 15.6 points to 1171.6 with WMC
leading the gainers by improving 29 cents to 5.54 Australian
dollars on a turnover of 4.3 million shares.
</P>
<P>
BHP gained 51 cents to 14.78 Australian dollars on a turnover
of 5.3 million shares while Rio Tinto rose 5 cents to 17.05
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks fell as the bullion price dropped to 308.75 U.S.
dollars per ounce compared with Friday's close of 312.35.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index improved marginally, up half a point
to 4226.2.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were mixed. National Australia Bank rose 40
cents while ANZ dropped 19 cents, Commonwealth 18 cents and St.
George 21 cents.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 234.71 million shares worth 747.21
million Australian dollars (523.04 million U.S. dollars). Falls
outnumbered rises by 720 to 428.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Eye Tanzania's Furniture Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South African and
Zimbabwean wood and furniture companies have been exploring ways
of setting up firms in Tanzania, which imports much of its
top-quality furniture from Kenlyawean, Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Bell Equipment and ING Barings from South Africa and
Zimbabwe's Border Timbers have made formal contracts with
Tanzanian timber and wood companies, some of them soon to be
privatized, for possible joint partnership deals.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission and
Salvatore Nindi of Zenith Furniture company here told The East
African weekly that two senior officials from South Africa have
come to Tanzania for discussions on setting up plants to produce
quality furniture.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed terms, the South Africans will establish
small modern plants worth about 2.4 million U.S. Dollars in Dar
es Salaam to make top quality wood products.
</P>
<P>
Border Timbers, one of the biggest such companies in Africa,
is also interested in setting up plants in Tanzania, the weekly
said today.
</P>
<P>
Nindi said: "Mr Stock Niersk of Bell Equipment was astonished
to hear that many diplomatic offices are equipped with imported
furniture in a country endowed with all sorts of timber."
</P>
<P>
Because most of these imports are duty-free, Nindi said,
Tanzania loses in more ways than one, including the loss of job
opportunities and the transfer of skills that would be provided
by the new investors.
</P>
<P>
Imported wood products from Europe and Kenya are 50 percent
cheaper than comparable Tanzanian-made goods, Nindi said, giving
the example of an imported Danish-made office chair priced at
6.50 US Dollars (FOB) compared to a Tanzanian hardwood chair
which would sell at a price between 18 and 25 US Dollars in Dar
es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Up to the late 1980s, diplomatic missions used to order
household and office furniture from local wood and furniture
marts. However, the trend changed with the fall of the timber and
wood industry and the liberalization of the market.
</P>
<P>
The objective of Tanzania Wood Industry, a holding company of
six wood and timber subsidiaries, is to raise production of
softwood to 253,982 cubic meters by the year 2020.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Meets President Yeltsin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
his wife Zhu Lin had a cordial and friendly meeting today with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his wife Naina at the
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his belief that Yeltsin's state visit will further
advance the overall development of the strategic cooperative
partnership between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier warmly welcomed Yeltsin to China and
expressed his delight with seeing the Russian President once again
within only one year.
</P>
<P>
The international situation and relationships are experiencing
intensive change, with an acceleration in the positive and
irreversible trend towards a multipolar world. Large countries
should follow the trend by establishing healthy and stable
cooperative relationships on the basis of mutual respect,
equality, mutual interests and the spirit of seeking common ground
while reserving differences, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that this will be essential for guaranteeing peace
and stability in the 21st century, and noted the Sino-Russian
relationship is proceeding healthily and steadily towards the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Li said this morning's talks between President Jiang Zemin and
President Yeltsin were highly fruitful and reached agreement in
extensive fields which will be highly significant for promoting
the further development of Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that China treasures the great achievements made
in bilateral relations, and is ready to join with Russia to create
a brighter future which will benefit the peoples of the two
countries and promote world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted his delight in visiting China for a third time,
and expressed great satisfaction with today's talks with President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that he and Jiang not only discussed politics,
economics and cooperation for large projects, but also issued an
important statement concerning a survey of the eastern section of
the Sino-Russian border, and signed a highly significant joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said his visit will without doubt be fruitful and will
have far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed to his visit to Russia last December, and noted that
the two countries established a mechanism ensuring regular
meetings between the Chinese Premier and Russian Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin held their
second meeting during the latter's visit to China in June this
year. Respective committees from the two countries worked actively
on many cooperative projects and tabled numerous suggestions, said
Li, adding that the meeting mechanism will play an even more
positive role in strengthening future relations between the two
countries.

JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Closed-circuit

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Cash Selling Rate Tops 1,000 Won </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar's cash selling
rate topped the 1,000-won level for the first time Monday, opening
the era of 1,000 won per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Largely hit by psychological factors, the won started the day's
trading at 985.00 won per dollar, down 5.10 won from last week's
close of 979.90 won.
</P>
<P>
It then plunged to an all-time intraday low of 999.00 won,
mainly because of strong demand for U.S. dollars among domestic
exporters to settle their imports and foreign investors' continued
low confidence in the South Korean financial market.
</P>
<P>
At 9:50 a.m., Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) posted again the day's
dollar basic rate and cash selling rate at 999 won and 1,013.98
won, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the central bank's intervention, the won slightly
recovered to 996 won but fell again back to 998.50 won.
</P>
<P>
"The won's continued fall is mainly attributable to foreign
investor's waning confidence in the domestic financial market,"
said Lee Kang-nam, assistant governor of the Bank of Korea (BOK).
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the international credit standing of
Korean financial institutions fell significantly, mainly owing to
a spate of large corporate bankruptcies and the consequential
reduction of their borrowing of foreign capital. This resulted in
a dire shortage of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, which has repeatedly receded from previous
resistance levels over the past three weeks, however, said it
would not allow the won to decline below the 1,000-mark.
</P>
<P>
Government officials also said that the government would not
let any South Korean financial institutions default on foreign
debts, while it would work out steps to help foreign
currency-strapped merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the won against the dollar has led to
higher inflation since the country depends heavily on the import
of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The falling won has also sparked a sharp decline in stock
prices on the Korea Stock Exchange as a slew of foreign investors
try to dump their shares in efforts to avoid exchange losses
resulting from the won's steep depreciation, they said.

<HEADLINE> Lithium Salt, New Treatment for Schizophrenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at a mental hospital in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have discovered
that lithium salt is an effective treatment for schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
Psychiatry has long held that lithium salt can curb the
symptoms of mania, characterized by excessive excitement and
hallucinations, but not schizophrenia, or "split personality."
</P>
<P>
However, researchers at a psychiatric hospital in Xinjiang have
determined that lithium salt can alleviate symptoms of
schizophrenia.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) denied today that certain local banks are
experiencing financial difficulties, saying the banking system
remains "strong" in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"The banking system in Hong Kong is strong and highly
capitalized" and "profits for local banks in the first nine months
 of this year compared well with those in the previous year," The
HKMA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
All this provides a cushion for these banks to cope with the
current financial challenge, it added.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing rumors that some banks here are facing financial
difficulties, the statement said, "The HKMA has been monitoring
the situation closely and considers that these rumors are without
foundation."
</P>
<P>
Since late October, the stock market here has seen ups and
downs because of a speculative attack following the financial
turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"As the International Monetary Fund recently concluded after an
 assessment of the (Hong Kong) economy," the HKMA said in the
statement, "the strength of the banking system in Hong Kong means
that 'it will be able to withstand the effects of the recent
financial market volatility'."

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. U-2 spy plane has
left Iraq's airspace after three hours of flight over the country
without any incident happened.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi military said in a statement that its troops were
standing by to gun down the plane, which was flying outside the
range of their missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 surveillance plane entered Iraqi airspace at 8:21 local
time (0521 GMT) from Saudi Arabia on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has threatened to shoot down the aircraft, accusing that
the United States has used the flights to garner information and
select targets for attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The American plane was used by the United Nations Special
Commission on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction for
monitoring missions.
</P>
<P>
It resumed flights over Iraq Monday in spite of Baghdad's
threat and its standoff with the United Nations over banning
Americans from U.N. inspection teams.

<HEADLINE> Early Sex Education Called for in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese education experts
have stressed that sex education at an early age is necessary in
Lebanese schools, local Daily Star newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Sex and health education should begin early in a child's life
and continue gradually each year as part of a child's development
and growth," said Wafica Mansour Doueiri, vice president of
Lebanon's Family Planning Association (FPA), at a day-long
workshop Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said the FPA would attempt to find the proper means to
implement sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
Faysal Qaq, a university professor, said that the latest U.N.
study found the more sex education students get at school the more
likely they are to have control of their sexual behavior and
less likely to be subjected to disease and pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Qaq said that people must wake up and admit that students in
Lebanon, and around the world, are becoming sexually active at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were no statistics on sexual activity in
Lebanon, but that an ongoing study of high school students showed
that a "good percentage of students are sexually active."
</P>
<P>
Qaq also highlighted the important role the government had in
collaborating with the media to raise awareness of sexually
transmitted diseases and protection.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah: Israel Attack Likely After Doha Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah chief Sheikh
Hassan Nasrallah has said that he expected a major Israeli
military operation in south Lebanon, but not before the Doha
conference, the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
militant group said at a gathering in northeast Lebanon Sunday that
Israel feared an immediate offensive would turn Arab countries
away from the planned fourth Middle East and North Africa economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Doha conference, which includes Arabs, Israelis and their
major trade partners in the world, is due to be held on November
16-18.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah urged Arab nations to boycott the conference. "The
United States is unable to force other countries to attend," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speculations have been high since reports appeared on Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's alleged remarks during his
Middle East tour last month that Israeli troops would stage a
major military operation against Hezbollah in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to end Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nasrallah called on all Lebanese to join the
newly-established multi-confessional Lebanese Brigades to resist
Israeli invasion.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday Nasrallah announced the creation of the new
resistance group that would accept people regardless of their
religious or political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
"The telephone numbers through which people can join the
brigades have been busy ever since our announcement and this is
evidence of the people's confidence in Hezbollah's credibility,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the resistance's determination to fight Israel's
occupation troops until the territory is liberated.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Seeks Fair Treatment, Not Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Iraqi diplomat here
has said Iraq does not seek confrontation with the U.N. but rather
wants a fair treatment and have the seven-year-old economic
sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency today, Nabil Negm,
Iraq's chief delegate to the Cairo-based Arab League (AL), made
the remark on Sudan during a meeting with AL Assistant Secretary
General for Arab Affairs Ahmed Ben Holai.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq does not seek a confrontation with the U.N. Security
Council or UNSCOM, but only wants the world body to adopt a fair
stand to lift the siege imposed on Iraq," Negm said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has had an objective cooperation with UNSCOM in
charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction over the
past six years and provided all information available.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM dismantled all Iraqi weapons and even destroyed some of
the civil installations and facilities needed by Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. has declared that Iraq's compliance with all U.N.
Security Council resolutions won't even lead to lifting sanctions,
Negm said.
</P>
<P>
Negm said the American policy has been adopted by the UNSCOM
and posed a real threat to the Arab national security.
</P>
<P>
The current confrontation is a product of Iraq's insistence
that it has satisfied U.N. demands to scrap weapons of mass
destruction and has allowed over 600 U.N. monitoring sessions
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is requesting the U.N. to fulfil its commitment to lift
the economic embargo imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
which triggered the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq barred Americans from taking part in U.N. weapons
inspections for the seventh day in a row Sunday and threatened to
shoot down American U-2 spy plane flying into Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said all options, including a military action,
is open to overturn the Iraqi defiance.
</P>
<P>
Negm said Baghdad called for dialogue with the Security Council
and UNSCOM and offered related proposals to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Those include holding dialogue under Annan's supervision and at
the presence of Iraqi experts to brief the U.N. chief on Iraq's
concerns and practices constituting a violation of Iraq's
sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described continuation of international sanctions on Baghdad
as a "continuous aggression on the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
In an official letter to Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul Maguid, Iraq suggested that an Arab facting-finding mission,
including countries at odds with Baghdad, be sent to Iraq to
refute American allegations.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister is to meet with Annan and argue its
side of the standoff before the U.N. Security Council, which meets
today to decide on next steps to end the crisis.

<HEADLINE> 162 Arrested in Belgium After Protest Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgian police have arrested
162 youths, mostly immigrants, who were protesting against the
police shooting to death a Moroccan immigrant claimed to be a drug
dealer.
</P>
<P>
Local television RTBF reported today that the arrests were made
late Sunday within the Anderlecht district of Brussels, where the
youths were protesting against the administrative authorities.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who acted at the call of the Labor Party of Belgium
(PTB) after the death of Said Charki in a local hospital, sieged the
administrative office of the district authorities.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Moroccan youth was seriously wounded as he tried to
run away from a police manhunt.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the drug dealer, with 50 grams of heroin
in possession, rammed his BMW into a police car when police attempted
to arrest him in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Said Charki died in hospital Friday after being hit by 15 bullets,
television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Interior Minister Johan Vande Lanotte said that the
violence over the weekend was unacceptable and that police were
ordered to take a tough line should riot burst out again.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction on Friday was condemnable but understandable,"
television reports quoted the interior minister as saying, "but it
became something else on Saturday and Sunday. It was agitated and
manipulated by drug dealers and traffickers."
</P>
<P>
Sunday's riot was the third in the country's recent history.
Similar events took place in the Molenbeek district of Brussels in
1995 and at Saint-Gilles back in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Non-Beijing Natives Cooperative in On-going Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- When she heard about the the
news of census on non-Beijing residents, Xu Hulan, who sells
clothes in Beijing's Fengtai District, asked her husband to
quickly bring her mother-in-law and children back to the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the project, Xu's family sat inside their
rented house, waiting for the surveyors to come.
</P>
<P>
"I have been in Beijing for nine years. I hope all my family
members can be registered," Xu said. "If the Beijing Municipal
Government gives preferential policies to the migrant population,
we all can benefit from them."
</P>
<P>
Wang Xilin, Xu's friend, was initially afraid of what might
happen as a result of the census: he has changed homes twice,
telling the surveyors that he was worried about being forced to
leave Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the past several days, many non-Beijing natives have
placed high hopes on the project, while some have their
concerns. However, the majority changed their minds once they
clearly understood the purpose of the work, according to the
census-takers.
</P>
<P>
Tian Yumei, a surveyor in the Haidian District, has to repeat
time and again when she visits families of non-Beijing natives
that the city just wants an accurate number of migrant
population. "We are neither giving you Beijing permanent residence
certificates, nor driving you out of Beijing," she tells them.
</P>
<P>
An Boyu, a native from Jiangsu Province, who learned of the
census from newspapers and TV, is more active, saying members of
the migrant population should take the initiative to register
themselves. "It is our duty to do so."
</P>
<P>
An not only registered on his own, he asks his employees to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
People like An helped a lot in carrying out the census, which
ends on November 15, surveyor Tian Yumei said. A census official
in charge of the work said that more than 90 percent of
non-Beijing natives are cooperative.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the aim of the census is to obtain an
accurate number of migrants living in the city, which will help
the local government to deal with wide range of matters.
</P>
<P>
Results of the census will help the Beijing Municipal
Government when it comes to making plans for economic development,
urban construction, providing facilities and better serving all
city residents.
</P>
<P>
Surveyors said that most non-Beijing natives are concerned
about whether Beijing can provide a stable, safe environment for
living and working. They also ask to be treated fairly and with
respect and want their children to receive proper education.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Call for Better Social Care after Family Tragedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incident has caused a wide-spread call to improve social
care and psychiatric help for those in need.
</P>
<P>
While giving front-paged coverage of the incident, all eight
local Chinese newspapers have carried some form of editorials
today, either urging the government to establish psychiatric aide
center, or provide more care to those in need.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said in a commentary that many
lower-income families usually leave their children unattended
while both parents are out working, posing great danger for the
kids. But that is the only choice they can make.
</P>
<P>
"The first incident of the death of the children has sounded
the alarm for negligence," it said. "But again negligence has
caused the death of the couple. That teaches us a profound
lesson."
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper said that the Government should pay more
attention to the caring of children in families of double working
parents and single-parent families.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said that social psychiatric help center
should be established to meet the needs of those who have suffered
from natural disasters. It also urges residents to help each
other to prevent similar tragedies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, social workers said that the tragedy means a warning
that Macao needs better psychiatric crisis service and more
professional psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
Top executives of the Macao Charity, the Macao Better Family
Promotion Association, and some members of the Macao Legislative
Assembly, all expressed their opinions, urging the Government and
social welfare centers to establish a quick-action mechanism
offering necessary social help.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) will set up an innovation and
technology management center in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted Kadress Vencatachellum, UNIDO
program manager, as saying Sunday that feasibility studies for
the center had been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Vencatachellum, who is based in Vienna, Austria, is in the
country to officiate the UNIDO-sponsored National Innovative
Prize Award Ceremony scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNIDO would next year start an engineering and
consultancy project in Kenya because the country is lack of
institutional capacity.
</P>
<P>
It was concerned that major engineering contracts like road
construction were won by foreign consultants, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO official pointed out that the National Innovative
Award was part of UNIDO's efforts to encourage industrialization
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The program for the Award was started in 1995 and incorporates
Egypt, Ghana, Mauritius, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The program involves selecting the most innovative enterprises
nationally with nine winners getting the National Innovative
Prize Award in various categories.
</P>
<P>
The winners will participate in a regional prize award
ceremony later this month in Mauritius.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has taken vigorous steps to eliminate poverty for its
remaining 600,000 poor by 2000, provincial source said.
</P>
<P>
According to deputy-governor Ou Guangyuan, the province has
supported 223,000 agricultural projects this year by appropriating
112.4 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 the province has pooled funds topping 4.3 billion
yuan to aid poverty-stricken counties in the mountainous areas. By
the end of 1996, the population living on 500 yuan or below a year
had been reduced from 1.2 million in 1994 to 600,000.
</P>
<P>
A provincial source said the province's output in rural areas
totaled 666.5 billion yuan in 1996, with average annual per capita
incomes for farmers hitting 3,183 yuan, which is expected to reach
4,000 yuan by 2000.

LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Acting President Sebastian
Zulu of the opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP)
said he will advise UNIP leader, former President Kenneth Kaunda
not to return so long as the state emergency remains effective.
</P>
<P>
Zulu told Zambia Daily mail Sunday that Kaunda, currently in
London, will be detained and tortured if he comes back.
</P>
<P>
"As acting president, I will advise him not to return until
the state of emergency is lifted because if he does, he will be
tortured and even if he is proved innocent in the end," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kaunda had nothing to do with the coup attempt and
that allegations to that effect are merely malicious propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Zulu said his party condemned such lawlessness in the
strongest terms just as it had always done throughout its 27
years of reign.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that government is connecting UNIP to the
coup when we have always stood for peace. Dr. Kaunda as leader of
the party is not involved in any way, he has always been against
assuming power through coercive force," Zulu said.
</P>
<P>
One day after the October 28 coup was foiled the government
announced the state of emergency to facilitate the investigation
of the circumstances leading to the coup.

<HEADLINE> Americans in UNIKOM Move to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Americans working with
the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) have
been moved from the Iraqi territories to the Kuwait side of the
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by informed sources close to the mission,
according to local English daily Arab Times today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the measure is precautionary in nature and
was taken last week after "some inquiries were made by Iraqi
officials about Americans working with the UNIKOM."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the UNIKOM refused to confirm or deny the news.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Americans have been instructed by the
UNIKOM command to carry out their patrolling duties only on
the Kuwaiti side of the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
The move is against the backdrop of the recent confrontation
between Iraq and the United Nations over Baghdad's insistence that
Americans be removed from U.N. weapons inspection teams in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq banned all U.S. inspectors on the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in
the country, in response to U.N. resolution 1134 that threatened
new sanctions if Iraq continued hampering U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also said it would shoot down American U-2 surveillance
plane flying over Iraq, but Washington warned of serious
consequences if the plane is fired on.
</P>
<P>
"To avoid any unwanted incident, the UNIKOM command decided to
move the Americans," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of observers from several countries, including the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, guard the
15-kilometer wide DMZ along the 200-kilometer long borders between
Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The DMZ extends five kilometers inside Kuwait and 10 kilometers
inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang's Border Trade with Russia Prospers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The total volume of border
trade between northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and Russia
has topped nine billion US dollars in the last decade, according
to the local Chinese trade adminsitration statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang Provincial Border Trade Administration said
the volume of border trade between the province and Russia from
January to October is twice that of the same period in last year.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two sides was formerly done by simple
bartering, but now has shifted to include cash trade, economic and
technical cooperation and invited investment.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government, facing the slump in Sino-Russian
border trade since 1993, has taken counteractive measures, such as
setting up a light industry products and agro-products processing
base on the border port, quality control checks on the exported
goods, and offering special training to the managers of those
companies engaged in border-trade.
</P>
<P>
These practices have helped the Sino-Russian border trade to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The amount of border trade goods has grown from several hundred
to nearly 20,000 varieties, and the quality of the products has
improved, according to Ji Qingfu, head of the Heilongjiang
Provincial Border Trade Administration.
</P>
<P>
The economic structures of China and Russia are
complementary. Russia has a great demand for China's light
industry products, such as textiles, household appliances and
food, while China needs Russia's raw materials and mechanical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The boundary between Heilongjiang and Russia is 3045-km long,
constituting 70 percent of the total length of Sino-Russian
border.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Holds 6 for Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Six Zambians have been
arrested for illegal imports and trafficking in about 4.5 kg "of
very high grade" Columbian cocaine with a street value of 3.47
billion Kwacha, or 2.6 million U.S. Dollars, an official said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua here, Zambia's Drug
Enforcement Commission (DEC) spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani said that
the suspects, including a young white couple, a businessman, a
computer manager, a clearing clerk and a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
They were arrested on November 6 at the Lusaka International
Airport by DEC in a joint cooperation with Britain's Customs and
Excise Department.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, whose number is likely to go up as more are
going to be arrested, will appear in court in the capital today,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Friday, Sinyani told reporters that the
haul represented a new threat to the country.
</P>
<P>
"The high cocaine straight from Colombia represents a new
threat to our country and therefore the urgent need to intensify
the efforts to stem the tide of this scourge," Sinyani said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that nobody would be safe if this country were to be
engulfed in money and property derived from drug trafficking.
"our pride and integrity both at home and abroad would be
severely dented," said Sinyani.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was ingeniously compacted in 12 heavy duty 6
voltage torch batteries which were laced with a small battery so
that the internal laser torches could be lit with power from the
dry cell battery embedded in the expertly packed drug.
</P>
<P>
The contraband was meant for both local and export
consumption, according to Sinyani.
</P>
<P>
DEC had been monitoring the contraband at the airport
warehouse where it has been lying for the past two weeks since it
was imported into Zambia before the commission closed in and
pounced on two suspects who later led officers to various places
where the rest were picked up.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that last month, the DEC arrested 136
suspects in connection with drug trafficking in the country.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Makes Strides in Jilin Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry in
northeastern China's Jilin Province, a leading grain producer, has
become a major means to propel its rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Jilin owns four million hectares of cultivated land. Corn output
makes up 75 percent of the province's grain output, and 16 percent
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
After a long period of development, animal husbandry has
emerged as a pillar industry of the province's rural economy. The
province has also become a leading center of animal products.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the meat output of the province was 1.8
million tons in 1996. Large amounts of pork, chicken and beef,
have been transported to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the value of animal husbandry will account for 49
percent of the province's total agricultural output, according to
a recent projection made by the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to be a leading producer of animal
products by 2010, and 40 percent of farmers' average income will
be derived from that sector.
</P>
<P>
To achieve its goal, the province has taken a series of
measures to open domestic and overseas marketing, spread improved
breeds and develop feed-processing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investment has played an important role in
the development of the province's animal husbandry. A joint
venture -- involving 700 million yuan of investment by Chia Tai
Group Companies of Thailand and Jilin -- has set up farms for
raising chicken, factories to produce feed and meat processing
plants. In 1996, the joint venture accounted for seven billion
U.S. dollars in exports.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Pacific Make Progress on Social Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that Asian and Pacific economies have made
substantial progress in the sphere of social development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Fifth Asian and Pacific
Ministerial Conference on Social Development, Ramos said the
region's economic dynamism during the final decade has not only
raised many economies to the threshold of economic modernization,
but has also significantly improved the well-being of millions of
people.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty incidence has been dramatically reduced in many
countries. And just as important, education and health levels have
improved across the board -- enhancing the efficiency,
productivity and equality of labor in many economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the part of the Philippines, Ramos said the government has
formulated policies and programs addressing poverty, unemployment
and underemployment, social inequity and family disunity.
</P>
<P>
The country's poverty rate has been reduced from 40 percent in
1991 to 34 percent in 1996 while the life expectancy has been
raised from 66.6 years to 69.4 years and the infant mortality rate
has decreased from 52 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 45.8 in
1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Rising employment has come hand in hand with our economic
recovery and growth during the past four years. The unemployment
rate dropped from 9.8 percent in 1992 to 7.7 percent as of the
first semester of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, significant progress does not mean that Asian and
Pacific economies are not facing any problems and challenges, he
said, adding that in the Philippines, it is still hard to say
whether absolute poverty can be eradicated by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Asian and Pacific economies to make more
sound policies, launch more appropriate programs, devote more
resources and strengthen cooperation with each other to secure a
better future for the region.
</P>
<P>
During the ministerial conference organized by the UN Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, delegates of 26
economies will review the region's social development situation
and prospects, examine progress made by the economies in achieving
social development goals and discuss measures to accelerate social
development in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou Industrial Park,

During the past three years, 4.2 billion yuan (506 million
U.S. dollars) has been pooled for such purposes as transportation,
city greening, postal system, water supply, heating and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Another 1.5 billion yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) has been
injected into building banks, schools, hospitals, shopping and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
Investors say they are impressed by the efficiency of the
park's administrative commission.
</P>
<P>
It only took 12 months for Samsung Electronics (Suzhou)
Semiconductor Co. Ltd., one of the earliest registered overseas
enterprises in the park, to complete construction and begin
production in its 100,000-square-meter building.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenxiang, general manager of the Solectron (Suzhou)
Technology Co. Ltd., spoke highly of the park's clear policies on
fees.
</P>
<P>
The park's success can be attributed partly to help from
Singapore. During the last three years, 446 staff members in the
park have been to Singapore for training and a number of
managerial experts from Singapore have given a lot of assistance
to their Chinese colleagues.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, Suzhou Industrial Park plans to
introduce 2.5 billion U.S. dollars of investment and transfer 550
hectares of land, including 450 hectares for the industrial
sector, 300,000 square meters for commercial purposes and 450,000
square meters for residential housing.

FUZHOU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Sandu'ao Harbor in east China's
Fujian Province, potentially the largest port on the western
shores of the Pacific Ocean, has taken shape over five years of
development.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary design and hydrologic and geological surveys have
been completed, and the initial port with a handling capacity of
20,000 tons has been constructed.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will include the construction of six major
infrastructure projects involving ports, highways and a water
plant, as well as a transformer substation, and post and
communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for the development of local tourism resources,
raising production and increasing the annual export volume for
stone to 50 million U.S. dollars over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The Sandu'ao Development Zone, which will cover 124 sq.km., was

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Get Equal Treatment in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners in Shenzhen, the
pioneer of China's reform and opening to the outside world, have
seen their business jacked up and living cost cut down since
granted the equal treatment as Chinese companies at the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The equal treatment measure taken by Shenzhen was aimed at
providing a fair competitive environment for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 foreign companies, which engage in high-tech
products and agricultural products manufacturing, are allowed to
sell their products inside China. Formerly, most or all of their
products had to be exported.
</P>
<P>
The foreign companies' electricity cost went down by 0.01 yuan
for one watt to 0.88 yuan, the same rate local companies pay.
</P>
<P>
To the city, however, the move means a reduction of 350 million
yuan in electric earnings this year, because foreign companies
consume 3.5 million kilowatts electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, also benefitting from the new equal policy, no
longer have to pay a higher rate than local people for park
entrance tickets, medical treatment, buying and renting houses and
other forms of service.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Dwells on Asia-Europe Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today put stress on forging a partnership between
Asia and Europe for the 21st century to construct a global
prosperity process which will bring prosperity not to a select few
but prosperity for all.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address at the two-day Global Panel Kuala
Lumpur 1997 which opened here today, Mahathir said the reasons for
Europe and Asia to work together in partnership are:
</P>
<P>
"First because in a shrunken world we are going to be
uncomfortably close neighbors. The Far East is no longer far.
</P>
<P>
"Second because over a broad range of issues, we have and will
increasingly have a common purpose and a shared interest.
</P>
<P>
"Third, there are many challenges which neither Europe nor Asia
can on their own tackle or resolve."
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "Asia and Europe: Forging a Partnership
for the 21st Century", Mahathir reminded Asians that there should
be greater partnership with Europe because Europe is strong,
influential and rich.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reminded Europeans that Southeast Asia, Northeast
Asia and other regions of Asia will become much stronger, much
more influential, much richer in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging there are other critical challenges to mankind in
the 21st century, Mahathir spelt out three which he thank need
particular emphasis -- challenges of "building a more peaceful and
more just global commonwealth; ensuring global prosperity; and
ensuring cultural tolerance in a multi-cultural world and ensuring
not only no clash of civilizations but instead, a joyous
celebration of civilizations".
</P>
<P>
On global prosperity in the 21st century, Mahathir said this
can only be achieved through the most massive expansion of trade
in human history and the most massive flows of productive foreign
investment across borders that this planet has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
"Trade and productive investment must be the arteries, the
veins, the tissue, the mussel and the bone of our global
prosperity of the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
On multiple civilization and multiple cultures, the Malaysian
leader said "Cultural and civlizational pluralism will be the
hallmark of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Noting that there obviously are universal core human values
which have been accepted, indeed cherished, by societies
throughout history, he said that most of these universal core
human values should continue to be cherished.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up 3rd Export Processing Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to set up the third export processing zone (EPZ) at
Comilla, 90 kilometers from the capital, with a view to boost
export for rapid economic growth of the country, it was learned
today from the Board of Governors of the Bangladesh Export
Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA).
</P>
<P>
At present, there are only two EPZs (Chittagong and Dhaka) in
this South Asian country, and they are unable to cope with the
increasing demand from investors.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at the BEPZA's 14th meeting held Sunday
at the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Comilla EPZ will be set up on the unused lands of
the Comilla Airport, where some 182.1 hectares of land has been
acquired for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The land already acquired by the government is suitable for
establishing an EPZ, because it has infrastructural facilities and
scope for developing direct communication with the Chittagong
Port, according the BEPZA.
</P>
<P>
The BEPZA board of governors meeting also decided to set up a
central treatment plant for industrial wastes at the Dhaka EPZ and
discussed the progress in setting up another two EPZs at Ishwardi
and Mongla.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98 fiscal year, a target has been fixed for exporting
goods worth 700 million US dollars from the two existing EPZs,
BEPZA governors' board secretary Moazzen Hossain Khan told the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> HK Currency Must Keep Link with U.S. Dollar, Says Tung Chee Hwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong dollar must be and
will continue to be linked with the U.S. dollar, Tung Chee Hwa,
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
reaffirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Describing it "a fundamental issue", Tung said that there is
absolutely no need for Hong Kong to change such a link.
</P>
<P>
Tung predicted that once Hong Kong has got over the current
economic turmoil, its recovery would be faster than any of the
surrounding economies.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive was speaking at the opening of a one-day
economic cooperation meeting of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Osaka here
this morning. Experts and executives from the "three most
important cities in Asia", as Tung put it, will discuss and share
their ideas on the economic future and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tung cited strong economic fundamentals, continuous economic
expansion of five percent, low unemployment rate of 2.5 percent,
the world's fourth largest foreign exchange reserve of 88 billion
U.S. dollars, a conservative financial management and a budget
share this year of about two percent of Hong Kong's GDP as the
factors backing the decision.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled the vulnerability, fluctuation and uncertainty
of Hong Kong's economy before Hong Kong began to peg its currency
with the U.S. dollar some 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With 83 percent of Hong Kong's GDP from service sector, he
said, "a competitive devaluation of our currency will not make us
more competitive in the overall economic point of view."
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive said he does not share the argument of a
proposed devaluation as it creates uncertainly, instead of
stability, especially on the economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa also mentioned Hong Kong's geographical position
which makes it possible to reach the outside world as well as
China's mainland, "which is unique and other cities can not
match."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the comparative lift of rates to maintain Hong
Kong's competitiveness is painful to many including those who had
invested into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
With these being "short-term pains", Tung said that as soon as
it is overcome, Hong Kong's recovery would be faster than all the
other economies around us and Hong Kong will surely achieve its
goal of making it more competitive.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Crisis in Iraq "Serious" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan Sunday said he would try to find a diplomatic
solution to the serious crisis in Iraq, and urged Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who returned to the U.N. headquarters in New York one
day earlier from his meeting with Latin American leaders in
Venezuela, met the three emissaries he sent to Baghdad last week
to meet with Iraqi leaders for a solution to the conflict on
U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief told reporters that the situation in Iraq
remained "serious."
</P>
<P>
"It is serious; no one should underestimate it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan confirmed that he had received a letter brought to him
from Saddam Hussein but declined to disclose any details.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said that Baghdad's reply was not an
enthusiastic "yes" to the U.N. request to cooperate with the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reportedly turned back the U.N. inspection team including
Americans on Sunday for the seventh time, a day before the U.N.
Security Council is scheduled to meet on the controversy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors are trying to verify whether Iraq has
destroyed its long-range missiles and biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned that Baghdad
could face military action or economic sanctions if it continues
to block the U.N. inspectors from its weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he would meet the Security Council on Monday to
brief it on the failed diplomatic mission, and hoped a diplomatic
solution could be reached next week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General said that he also expected to meet
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz sometime early next week
in New York.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Economy Recovers Strongly: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan economy has
recovered strongly in 1997 from the prevailing depression in 1996
with all key indicators showing favorable trends, according to the
latest economic condition report of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank was quoted today by the local press as saying
available production data for the first eight months indicated the
country could achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate
of close to 6.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The report, the State of the Economy, said investor confidence
increased because of corporate profitability and a favorable
economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The average Colombo consumer price index declined from 16
percent in December 1996 to 11.7 percent in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
An improvement in domestic food supply, higher imports and a
slowdown of monetary expansion were the main reasons for the
decrease of inflation, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented manufacturing sector has grown faster. Export
of textiles and garments rose by 23 percent during the first eight
months while total industrial exports went up by 20 percent, the
bank pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say Sri Lanka has been able to maintain its
export competitiveness due to the depreciation of the rupee
against the U.S. dollar by 5.1 percent in the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
The tea sector continued to enjoy attractive prices in
international markets. The January to August export prices were 11
percent higher than the corresponding period last year while the
Colombo auction prices jumped by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said telecommunication services expanded with the
number of subscribers soaring by 29 percent during the first nine
months.
</P>
<P>
Port services continued to grow with the arrival of ships
increasing by 17 percent and the volume of container traffic
rising 36 percent, it added.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today rejected a resolution expressing U.S.
concern about violations of rights of minority religious groups in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged President Bill Clinton to express U.S.
concern about Germany's treatment of minority religions,
particularly "discrimination against members of the Church of
Scientology."
</P>
<P>
The resolution was rejected by a vote of 318-101 after a brief

During the debate, some legislators expressed their opposition
to singling out Germany while some other countries in Europe took
similar approaches to those minority religions.

<HEADLINE> India Yet to Decide on Attitude to Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- India is not in a hurry to
accede to Morocco's demand to withdraw its 1985 recognition of the
Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), The Hindustan Times
quoted External Affairs Ministry sources as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
India would wait for the result of a referendum, likely to be
held in the fall of 1998 to decide whether Western Sahara should
become independent from Morocco, before making a decision on the
recognition issue. The 24-year-old civil war, which began in 1976
when Spain ended its colonial rule in Western Sahara, may be over
at last if the referendum is held and its outcome honored by the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
While talking to The Hindustan Times, Moroccan Ambassador
Mohammed Belmahi and SADR Charge D'affaires Mohamed Salem blamed
each other for the long delay in preparing for the referendum.
According to Salem, the Moroccan offensive seeking India's
withdrawal of the recognition of the SADR is linked to the likely
outcome of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
India recognized the SADR in 1985 which pre-dated the United
Nations-sponsored settlement plan, which calls, among others, for
the referendum on self-determination by the people in Western
Sahara.

<HEADLINE> Indian Inflation Touches Record Low of 3.45 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- India's annual inflation
plunged to an 11-year low of 3.45 percent for the week ending
October 25, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation, calculated on a point-to-point
basis, fell by 0.52 percentage points during the week to 3.45
percent from 3.97 percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the inflation based on the wholesale price index
during the week is mainly due to relative stability in the prices
of primary food articles compared with a substantial increase in
the prices of the same in the corresponding week last year. The
prices of primary food articles went down by 0.2 percent during
the week compared with a 1.8-percent increase for the same in the
corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the low levels of inflation may be due
to the slackening of demand in the economy, which is quite evident
from the relative stability in the prices of primary articles and
manufactured goods.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Malaria on Rise in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,300 South Koreans were
stricken with malaria as of the end of October this year, almost
quadruple the total infected for all of last year, according to
statistics from the Health and Welfare Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers accounted for 83 percent of the 1305 victims. Experts
explain that solders are especially vulnerable to mosquitos during
night-time duties, when the insects prefer to feed.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, a kind of infectious disease, which is most often
transmitted by the bite of the infected Anopheles mosquito, once
declared eradicated in South Korea, now is rapidly rising.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, malaria had not been reported in South Korea and
WHO once declared the country malaria-free. However, the epidemic
mysteriously appeared again in 1993 when a soldier stationed in
Paju, a city near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), was found infected.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the number of cases has risen, with two in 1994,
107 in 1995 and 356 last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has been conducting research since last year - on
antibodies, or the body's immune system, of residents living in
malaria-stricken areas, and on the mosquitos, - to find out the
cause and why it has appeared only in front-line areas.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike other types of malaria, the strain now appearing in
South Korea, Vivax Malaria, is not fatal," said a ministry
official, "Historically, no one has died of it here."
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that a big flood in Yonchon nearby the DMZ
about two years ago and global warming have had a big hand in
creating conditions for the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that blood transfusions are to blame. The
ministry banned blood donations by civilians who resided in areas
near the DMZ, and personnel discharged from military front-line
service during the last two years.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chuan Faces Tough Tasks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Democrat Party leader Chuan
Leekpai returned to power on Sunday, but he will have to face
tough tasks ahead, in particular the economic woes in the country
which pushed his predecessor Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to resign.
</P>
<P>
Chuan won a hard victory after a fierce race with Chatichai
Choonhavan, leader of the Chart Pattana (national development)
Party. Yet he would find his road ahead harder as the country
remains in a deep economic slowdown which is drawing concerns both
domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to see a slower economic growth this year.
Caretaking Finance Minister Kosit Panpiemras last Friday predicted
that Thailand's economic growth this year will be 0.6 percent,
lower than 2.5 percent predicted early this year. The latest
prediction is also far lower than the figure of 6.8 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is predicted as high as 12 percent compared with a
9.5 percent forecast earlier this year due to the weaker baht,
which tumbled to a record low of more than 41 baht to one US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports are forecast to rise by 3.2 percent in value
from last year, but the increase is meager, mainly due to the
calculation under the depreciated rate of the baht against the US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index last weekend posted 493.04
points, compared with more than 1,400 points in February last
year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current economic slowdown may be traced back to last
year when the country saw almost no increase in its exports, an
economic growth rate of 6.8 percent, a declining stock market and
the sluggish property sector.
</P>
<P>
Banharn Silpa-Archa was forced to resign from the premiership
and dismiss parliament to hold a general election on November 17
last year. But Banharn's departure was mainly due to failed power
maneuvers within the coalition government and not to economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh took over the post from Banharn after
winning the election with two seats more in the lower house than
the Chuan-led Democrat Party, yet he also inherited the problems
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chavalit coalition government early introduced measures,
including injections of large sums of funds, to prop up the
troubled property sector and the declining stock market, but the
measures seemed generating less positive and long-lasting
responses from the markets than expected.
</P>
<P>
Until May this year, the looming liquidity problem in
Thailand's financial sector began to float onto the surface and
the stability of the baht began to shake. The Chavalit government
then chose to mobilize its foreign exchange reserves to defend the
baht.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the initial success in defending the baht, the
government found that the country's limited foreign reserves could
not win the battle in the long run, so it chose to float the baht
and seek financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Yet, floating the baht is a measure that the previous
governments had never chosen over the past 13 years and the IMF
aid is conditional.
</P>
<P>
The baht slumped to a record low of more than 41 baht against
the US dollar earlier this month, dealing a fresh blow to the
already shaken confidence of investors, which is believed to be
the most direct factor that forced Chavalit finally to decide to
leave his post.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Chuan put the restoration of investors' confidence
and the stabilization of the baht as the tasks of priority of his
government immediately after he was appointed as the country's new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Also, Chuan has to face a coalition government which might
consist of as many as seven or eight political parties. How he
could manage to handle the multi-party coalition will also test
the statesman's talent.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chuan is now Thailand's favorite choice for a new
prime minister and the public opinion widely praised him as a
person of honesty and principle. As Thailand is predicted to enter
the most difficult period next year, Chuan has no choice but to
do, as he said, his best to refresh the country.

<HEADLINE> Census on Migrant Population Aids Beijing Policymaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing officials will use new
census information on the city's migrant population to develop
plans for the city's economic future.
</P>
<P>
The census of non-Beijing natives, which started November 1,
will end on November 15.
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview with Xinhua, an official in charge of
the census said Beijing has nearly 13 million natives but the
local government has to take into consideration of the impact of
millions of migrants when planning for the supply of food, coal
and gas, transport, public health and family planning.
</P>
<P>
The current census is the first of its kind in China. In
Beijing, the migrant population refers to those who live and work
in the capital but do not have permanent regitration cards issued
by the local police.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 survey shows that Beijing has 3 million migrant
residents.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government urgently needs to discuss ways
to make better arrangement for non-Beijing natives who can
contribute to the development of the city.
</P>
<P>
Migrant people play an active role in Beijing's urban
construction, economic development and services for local
residents, the official said. The migrants have become an
important part of Beijing's economic and social development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 40 percent of construction
workers in the city are migrants, who also represent a majority in
the textile, sanitation and coal mining industries as well as
service sectors such as clothing and vegetable sales and child
care.
</P>
<P>
Migrants also are among those who have made outstanding
achievement in science, technology, commerce, investment and the
arts, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one-third of Beijing's retail purchases
is made by non-Beijing natives.
</P>
<P>
Results of the census, including the total number, location,
structure, cultural backgrounds and professions of the migrant
population, will be made public at the end of December.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Sees Deficit for Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panama City, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal saw a
deficit of up to 3.9 million U.S. dollars in the last two years,
the Panama Canal Commission said.
</P>
<P>
A recent statistics released by the commission showed deficits
of 2 million dollars in fiscal 1997 that ended in September and
1.9 million dollars in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was mainly caused by the huge amount of wages for
the employees, the commission said. It paid 356 million dollars
as wages this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the transit fee charged for crossing the canal was
raised by 8.2 percent in January, and starting in July the fee
collected was counted on the number of containers, the income
still fell short of expenditure as the number of ships and the
tonnage crossing the canal dropped, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, the number of ships crossing the canal
totalled 13,700, 563 ships less than last year and the tonnage was
11 million less.

JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Diarrhea and malaria have
killed at least 80 villagers in a week in Indonesia's easternmost
province of Irian Jaya, where drought and a lack of clean water
continue to threaten the lives of thousands, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from diarrhea in the Merauke district in
southern Irian Jaya has claimed from 58 to 74 lives in less than a
week as smoke from smoldering fires continued to hamper relief
efforts, Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the mountainous region of central Irian Jaya, six people
were reported to have died from malaria over the past week,
according to Jaya Wijaya district chief Jo Buas Wenas.
</P>
<P>
Wenas warned that malaria was spreading rapidly and threatening
the lives of 90,000 people in the district, where more than 400
people this year have died from drought-related diseases and
famine.
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths bring the number of fatalities to more than
500 this year throughout Irian Jaya where most of the 2 million
inhabitants adhere to a traditional way of life and depend on what
they grow for survival.

<HEADLINE> Official on Electing Deputies to National People's Congress in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The election of deputies of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) of China should implement the
principle of "one country, two systems", a senior NPC official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The election should help maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability, give full play to democracy and proceed strictly
according to law, said Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the Standing
Committee of the NPC, at the first session of the Conference for
Electing Deputies of the HKSAR to the Ninth NPC, which opened at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election process should be open, just and fair
and that those who support "one country, two systems" and love
the country and Hong Kong would be elected.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the election is an embodiment of the principle
of "one country, two systems" as well as the right of Chinese
citizens among HKSAR residents to participate in the management of
state affairs according to law.
</P>
<P>
Cao told members of the Election Conference that the NPC and
its Standing Committee attach great importance to this election as
it is the first time for Hong Kong to elect deputies to the NPC as
an independent constituency since the Chinese government resumed
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC
formulated the Method for Electing Deputies of the HKSAR to the
Ninth NPC. Not long ago, the 28th Meeting of the Eighth NPC
Standing Committee approved the list of members of the Conference
for Electing Deputies of the HKSAR to the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Cao, who is entrusted by the NPC Standing Committee to chair
this election, said that the Constitution of the People's Republic
of China, the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the Election Method
constitute the basis for this election.
</P>
<P>
The NPC, China's supreme organ of state power, and its
permanent body, the NPC Standing Committee, exercise the
legislative power of the state, make decisions on important
national affairs, supervise the work of the State Council, the
Central Military Commission, the Supreme People's Court and the
Supreme People's Procuratorate, and elect and decide on
functionaries of state organs.
</P>
<P>
"The system of the people's congress is the fundamental
political system practiced in China," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the NPC are members of the supreme organ of state
power, and they participate in exercising state power according to
the functions and powers endowed to the NPC by the Constitution
and the law. When the NPC is in session, the deputies attend
meetings, review motions and reports on the agenda of the session,
submit motions and raise opinions and suggestions according to
law, and take part in various elections. When the NPC is not in
session, the deputies participate in activities organized by the
NPC Standing Committee and associate with ordinary citizens and
heed their opinions and raise proposals, opinions and criticisms
to the NPC Standing Committee with regard to the work in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
According to the principle of "one country, two systems" and
provisions in the Basic Law of the HKSAR, the HKSAR does not
practice the system of the people's congress, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens among HKSAR residents elect according to law
deputies to the NPC to participate in the work of the supreme
organ of state power.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exercising the above-mentioned functions and
powers according to law, HKSAR deputies to the NPC are entitled to
submitting motions on amending the Basic Law of the HKSAR and
joining the committee for electing the Chief Executive and the
Legislative Council of the HKSAR in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that the HKSAR deputies to the NPC are not entitled to
supervising the HKSAR government, and should neither interfere in
the work of the HKSAR government nor interfere in the affairs
which are within the framework of the high degree of autonomy of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Method adopted at the Fifth Session
of the Eighth NPC, Chinese citizens among HKSAR residents at age
18 or above can apply for the election of deputies to the Ninth
NPC.
</P>
<P>
The applicants will run as individual candidates and should not
represent any political parties or organizations, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The elected deputies of the HKSAR to the NPC, as members of the
supreme organ of state power, should love the country and love
Hong Kong, support the principle of "one country, two systems",
support and abide by the Constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law
and laws of the HKSAR, and perform the duties of the deputies in
line with the procedural rules of the NPC and other legal
provisions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cao expressed the hope that, in the election, both members of
the Election Conference and the applicants will put to good use
their rights and obligations according to law and in the spirit of
being responsible for the country and for Hong Kong.

BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A large irrigation works in
Gansu Province is expected to lift 280,000 people out of poverty
and benefit more than one million people by the turn of the
century, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Yindaruqin Project is a large-scale transbasin gravity
irrigation scheme, which diverts water form the Datong River in
Qinghai Province to Qinwangchuan Plain, about 60 km away from
Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
After the main part of the project was completed in 1995, more
than 27,000 ha. of farmland had been irrigated, said Gu Qijie,
general engineer of the project.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual average precipitation in Qinwanchuan Plain
is 285 millimeters, but the annual evaporation reaches 1,888
millimeters. Because of the severe shortages of water and low
productivity, the grain output per ha. used to be only about 1,500
kg.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the project, the average per ha. output in the region
has been sharply increased to 9,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
By June this year, another 680 ha. of forest were established
as water supply improved. And more than 35,000 people moved to the
irrigated area, with 70 percent of newcomers setting up houses and
digging water cellars.
</P>
<P>
The Yindaruqin Project includes 884 km of feeder canals, main
canals and branch canals, with a length almost half of the Beijing
Hangzhou Grand Canal. It has 71 tunnels with a total length of 110
km, and is called the longest "underground canal" in China.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the project will exceed one billion yuan (120
million U.S. dollars), nearly half of it coming from World Bank
loans.

<HEADLINE> Thirty Big US Investors Tour China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty US institutional
investors managing 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars in assets toured Hong
Kong, Shanghai and Beijing last week to get a close look at the
Chinese investment environment in the wake of the severe financial
crisis in Southeast Asia, today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time that JP Morgan Securities Asia Ltd had
held such a roadshow for investors of fixed-income bonds. Jointed
by 40 Asian and European fixed income investors, the roadshow
began in Hong Kong last Monday, and was scheduled to continue on
today to Seoul, the final destination.
</P>
<P>
The investors met a number of officials from the Ministry of
Finance, State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China
International Trust and Investment Corp and policy banks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the dialogue that we will initiate here will be a
step towards developing a clear understanding of what is happening
here in Asia and improving Asia's access to the international
credit markets," said Martin Mastsui, head of JP Morgan's fixed
income business in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Their concerns included: relations between the interior and
Hong Kong; progress of State-owned enterprises' restructuring;
whether China can continue its current high economic growth with
its low inflation rate; and to what extent China's enterprises'
openness could be improved.
</P>
<P>
Matsui said that compared with other Asian countries, China was
a relatively stronger performer which would be a favourite target
for international investors.
</P>
<P>
JP Morgan plays one of the top roles in the world commercial
banking and investment banking business, serving for more than 150
years as financial advisor, underwriter and lender to governments,
institutions and major international firms.

SANTIAGO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Julian Alonso toppled
top seed Marcelo Rios of Chile 6-2, 6-1 to win the Santiago Open
men's tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alonso, ranked 45th in the world and seeded fourth in the
tournament, denied Rios both a victory at home and a chance to
qualify for next week's Masters Tournament in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
This was the first win for the 20-year-old Spaniard as "this is
the first year that I have played big tournaments."
</P>
<P>
Rios, who has lost in the final here three years in a row,
hardly displayed any of his talents during the final.
</P>
<P>
In the first set both played erratically, but the Spaniard
committed less errors. Alonso broke Rios' service in the fourth
and the eighth games to take the set 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The second set was almost a replay of the first, except that
Alonso made less mistakes. He broke Rios' service in the second
and the fourth games to seal the competition in 47 minutes.

MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will present

<HEADLINE> Russia's Economy Recovery Advances Tourism to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) - Prosperous trade and economic
exchanges have greatly enhanced Sino-Russian tourism in
Heilongjiang Province in recent years, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas travellers to northeastern Heilongjiang,
which shares a 3,000-km-long border with Russia, increased 60
percent to 259,000 last year, said Bo Xiru, deputy director of
Heilongjiang Tourism Administration (HTA).
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the number increased by
42 percent over the same period last year, with 215,900 tourists
flowing in. The industry generated 61 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The number of travellers form Russia to Heilongjiang is
expected to exceed 250,000 by the end of this year, Bo predicted.
</P>
<P>
Most Russians travelling to Heilongjiang are on shopping sprees
-- purchasing food, clothes, electronics and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
Russia's recovering economy has led to an increased number of
Russians visiting the province, Bo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province will spend 230 million yuan (27
million U.S. dollars) to improve Heilongjiang's tourist facilities
and highways.
</P>
<P>
He continued: "We tightened the administrations on
qualification, charges and quality of services of local tourist
agencies serving Sino-Russian tourism."
</P>
<P>
"Only agencies of strong economic basis are granted permission
to conduct business in this field."
</P>
<P>
A tourist agency has to pay 600,000 yuan (70,588 U.S. dollars)
security deposit to the HTA to receive a permission.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used as compensation if a complaint is filed
against the agency by overseas tourists.

<HEADLINE> 20 Weak Banks Likely To Merge In Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
decisive move to close 16 ailing banks early this month is
apparently a shock therapy as 20 banks have reportedly planned to
conduct merger and consolidation.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation will force weak banks to merge among themselves
or with larger ones, Thomas Suyatno, chairman of the Association
of Private National Banks said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Merging would be the best alternative for weak banks to escape
a government closure order, local press today quoted Suyatno as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that at least 20 banks would merge in the near
future to solve their financial difficulties. But he could not
specify which banks would merge.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's decision to shut the 16 banks, as part
of the International Monetary Fund's economic reform package, was
an impartial move and would prompt other banks to consolidate to
prevent themselves from being forced into liquidation too.
</P>
<P>
According to the government regulation on bank liquidation,
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, has rights in overlapping the
authority of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia drew up criteria or check lists on the country's
239 banks before it made the decision, and those which did not
meet the criteria were closed down, he said.

life-threatening illnesses, provides for accelerated approval of
some drugs and medical devices and allows the Health and Human
Services secretary to accredit independent third-party groups to
speed up reviews of low-risk devices.
</P>
<P>
It also reauthorizes a five-year program under which fees paid
by drug companies have gone to hire 600 new reviewers who have
helped cut the backlog in new medicine approvals. Incentives are
included for developing and testing medicines for children.
</P>
<P>
Senator Edward Kennedy, who held up the legislation for weeks
this fall while fighting for changes in provisions he thought were
detrimental to consumers, called the final bill "a victory for
public health, for patients, and for industry alike."
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan agreement came after extensive negotiations on a
number of controversial issues.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Infrastructure Costs Seen to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
expected to revise its capital spending pattern next year as the
cheaper peso is expected to drive up the cost of infrastructure
projects with imported inputs.
</P>
<P>
In a report published today, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary
Cielito Habito said the government would need an additional 5.7
billion pesos (164 million U.S. dollars) next year to fund all of
projects in its 1998 infrastructure program.
</P>
<P>
The peso depreciation has resulted in more expensive imported
inputs, which are "almost always" needed for local infrastructure
projects, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
The peso has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since its de facto devaluation on July 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
The government's infrastructure and capital spending is
projected to increase by 633 million pesos (18.2 million dollars)
for every one peso depreciation, according to Habito.
</P>
<P>
The peso devaluation will force the government to increase by
5.7 billion pesos in the required infrastructure and capital
outlays in the 1998 infrastructure budget, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed 1998 budget, the government's infrastructure
program gets 140 billion pesos (4 billion dollars), compared with
the 103 billion pesos (3 billion dollars) allocated for 1997.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the impact of the more expensive dollar, Habito
said project managers, if possible, should try to look for locally
produced materials as an alternative.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States defeated
Canada 3-0 in a World Cup qualifier in Vancouver on Sunday,
securing its berth in the 1998 World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
With Jamaica drew El Salvador 2-2 in San Salvador, the match
between the United States and El Salvador next Sunday will just be
a celebratory festival.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes into the first half, Roy Wegerle raced down the
left side and sent a low rolling cross to Claudio Reyna, who
kicked the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
Canada had the majority of possession throughout the game, but
rarely looked dangerous. As time wore on, Canada pushed forward
and exposed itself to counterattack when Wegerle took advantage.
</P>
<P>
Wegerle took a pass from midfield and moved in unmarked on the
Canadian goal, calmly scoring with a low shot to send the
Americans to the World Cup finals for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
In the closing seconds, Wegerle scored the third to add to the
celebration.

<HEADLINE> British Business Offered Chance To Back World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- British companies are being
offered an opportunity to back England's bid to host the World Cup
soccer finals in 2006 at this week's CBI (Confederation of British
Industry) national conference.
</P>
<P>
No more than 10 companies will be given the opportunity to
become corporate sponsors, giving them sponsorship of the bid
until the final decision in June 2000, the Football Association
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They will also be able to use the England 2006 logo on
literature and packaging and their names will appear on most
England 2006 materials, the FA said.
</P>
<P>
Support from British business for the 2006 Campaign will add
credibility and strength as well as give the bid a stamp of
"British excellence". The Campaign will also seek expert advice
and support from the sponsors and get them involved in exporting
the bid internationally.
</P>
<P>
Other companies can associate with the bid by becoming
corporate friends. These companies will be encouraged to work with
the Foreign Office and local embassies to drive up recognition and
knowledge of the bid abroad.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Campaign, its Director Alec Mcgivan
said: "The economic benefits to the whole country of staging the
World Cup will be enormous."
</P>
<P>
"Business will get the opportunity to be part of a dynamic
campaign around our most popular sport and the FA will profit from
their expertise and international contacts," he added.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Kim Do-Hoon scored twice to
lead South Korea's 3-1 victory over the United Arab Emirates in a
World Cup Asian group B qualifier here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the South Koreans already into next year's finals in
France and UAE out of run for second place, which the Japanese
secured, the game was only a formality.
</P>
<P>
Lee Sang-Yoon opened the scoring for South Korea in the 11th
minute with Kim Do-Hoon making it 2-0 in the 42nd for a
comfortable half-time advantage.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates launched several attacks in the second half, and
their star striker Zuhair Bakhit pulled one goal back in the 52nd
minute, tapping the ball in after a defensive lapse.
</P>
<P>
However, the technically superior South Koreans regained their
two-goal cushion when Kim Do-Hoon fired his second goal in the
67th minute.
</P>
<P>
Only the two Asian group winners automatically qualify for the
finals.
</P>
<P>
The runners-up of the two groups will meet to decide a third
Asian berth. Japan will now go to Malaysia to meet Asian Group
A's runner-up in a crucial playoff on November 16.
</P>
<P>
Japan's opponent will be decided next week from among Iran,
Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
