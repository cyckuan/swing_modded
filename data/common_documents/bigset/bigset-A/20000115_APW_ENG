<HEADLINE> Late night talk show host David Letterman undergoes quintuple  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - David Letterman, late-night television's 18-year veteran
of wisecracks and after-dark celebrity interviews, was resting Friday evening
after undergoing emergency quintuple bypass surgery.
<P>
	   Spokesman Steven Rubenstein said: "He's fine. In recovery."
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to operate was made after Letterman underwent an angiogram
because of high cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family. The
test, during which a flexible tube is inserted into an artery and dye is
injected, revealed one artery was seriously constricted.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman underwent successful surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital
where Dr. O. Wayne Isom performed the procedure. The doctor said it went
smoothly and predicted a rapid recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave has the heart muscle of a 20-year-old," Isom said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician, Dr. Louis J. Aronne, and his cardiologist,
Dr. Martin Post, said it was too early to determine how long recovery would
take.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Amarkanth Saxena, a cardiothoracic surgeon at St. Joseph's Medical
Center in Paterson, N.J., said if there are no complicating factors Letterman
should be hospitalized for three or four days, then recuperating at home for six
to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxena, who is not involved in Letterman's case but has performed bypass
surgery many times, said he would advise such a patient to control risk factors
like high blood pressure and cholesterol in the future, in part by avoiding
fried foods and red meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman also may need medication to control his cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else, Letterman has made a long-running joke of his health,
starting years ago when he discovered he had high cholesterol. For a month he
went on an oat-bran diet, complaining nightly about the taste and consistency of
the stuff. Comically, it played. Health-wise it didn't. At the end of the
experiment Dave said he hadn't improved much.
</P>
<P>
	   During Thursday night's taping of the program - which aired Friday - he
joked about it again with guest Regis Philbin, who asked about Letterman's
cholesterol level.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman quipped. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, was born in Indianapolis on April 12, 1947. He broke into
network TV on CBS in 1978 as a guest on Mary Tyler Moore's variety show, "Mary."
</P>
<P>
	   From there, it was "The Tonight Show" starring Johnny Carson, long regarded
as THE place for aspiring standup comedians to catch their big breaks. Letterman
also guest hosted "Tonight" numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   After a brief stint as the host of daytime's "The David Letterman Show," his
after-dark career took off with "Late Night with David Letterman." It premiered
in 1982 in the time slot following "Tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   During his 11-year run on NBC, Letterman won five Emmy awards, but moved to
CBS in 1993 shortly after Carson retired and NBC gave the coveted "Tonight Show"
host position to rival Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
	   The slightly flashier, slightly softer "Late Show with David Letterman" has
continued Letterman's Emmy streak, including at least one for Outstanding
Variety, Music or Comedy program.
</P>
<P>
	   Mujibur Rahman, who runs a shop near The Ed Sullivan Theater where "Late
Show" tapes, and who has frequently appeared on the show as a straight-man for
the host, said he watched television all day in hopes of catching an update
about his friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm praying for him and his good health. I hope nothing will happen," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg James, a 27-year-old fan from Portland, Ore., who apparently shares
Letterman's sense of dark comedy, blamed the entertainer's condition on the
stress of hosting first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the show earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess Hillary did it to him," James said. "Too much pressure."
</P>
<P>
	   Next month marks the 18th anniversary of Letterman's late-night debut as a
host.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubenstein said the "Late Show" would telecast re-runs while Letterman
recovers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. students spending a semester of study, community service in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Guided by a Vietnam War veteran, the State
University of New York is sending students into the heart of old enemy territory
in central Vietnam to attend classes and join in community projects helping
street children, flood victims and lepers.
<P>
	   None of the first batch of seven students departing today for Da Nang was
alive when the war ended in 1975, but their four-month adventure could be a
small step in "closing the circle on the war," said Kenneth Herrmann Jr., a
social work professor at the State University College at Brockport.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann, an infantry sergeant who helped resettle refugees in central
Vietnam during a one-year tour of duty in 1968-9, said the residential-education
program he developed is the only overseas project of its kind in Vietnam that
mixes academic study and community service.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since I came up with this idea 16 months ago, the Vietnamese have made it
very clear to me they think the time is opportune now, on the 25th anniversary
of the end of the war, to heal wounds that have not yet been healed," Herrmann
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've also made it clear the only way to do that is through youth, so
that there's ... an emotional connection made between the 75 percent of their
population who were born after the war and the 75 percent of ours born after the
war."
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY network of public universities around New York will operate three
semesters a year in Da Nang. The first group to venture there will be one
graduate and four undergraduate students from the State University of New York,
plus two students from the University of Maryland and Swarthmore College in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know it will not be plush or easygoing, but that's the attraction,"
Jessica Morris, 22, a SUNY graduate completing a master's degree at American
University, told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. "This is not a tourist
deal. This will be a real immersion in the culture and the society."
</P>
<P>
	   Students will attend classes and seminars at the University of Da Nang, the
Duy Tan People-Founded University or the School of Politics in Da Nang, and
assist instructors teaching English.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four days a week, their community work will include developing
activities for homeless children, creating a festival for a leprosy colony and
distributing food and clothing to nearby mountain villages ravaged by flooding
late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Herrmann wants to bring poor students from the region to study
in Brockport, 25 miles west of Rochester, and create a distance-learning
curriculum linking Da Nang with Brockport.
</P>
<P>
	   At his wife's urging, Herrmann made his first trip back to Vietnam in 1998
to carry out research into illegal adoptions there. He revisited the village of
Hiep Duc, 35 miles southwest of Da Nang, where he had served as a liaison
between the 196th Light Infantry and U.S.-allied South Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Da Nang was the scene of the initial U.S. military buildup in 1965 and, by
the end of the decade, Herrmann said the region "saw the heaviest fighting of
the war." The two countries normalized diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising money from foundations and corporations to support the academic
program has been an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, Vietnam is still a word that's connected with a war, not a
country," Herrmann said, vowing to "drive these people crazy until I finally get
the money I need."

<HEADLINE> Court TV trying to get cameras into Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Court TV plans to ask an Albany judge to allow
television cameras into the murder trial of the four New York City police
officers charged in the killing of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   A Bronx judge already has refused another network's request to allow
television coverage of the trial. However, a state appeals court moved the
officers' trial to Albany, allowing Court TV to make its request to a different
judge.
</P>
<P>
	   "The basic cable network is asking New York state Supreme Court Justice
Joseph C. Teresi to declare unconstitutional the New York statute barring
cameras in the courtroom," Court TV officials said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not immediately known when Teresi would hear arguments or rule on the
issue. Jury selection begins Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Bronx Supreme Court Justice Patricia Williams refused a similar request from
the Regional News Network, WRNN-TV, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vendor, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999. Diallo was hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder.
All pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been almost three years since trials and criminal court hearings were
televised in New York. Audio and video recording was first allowed into New
York's trial courts in 1987, but only on an experimental basis. The law was
extended a few years at a time. The last extender expired in June 1997 and state
lawmakers have, thus far, refused to renew the law allowing television and audio
recording equipment back into the state's trial courts.

<HEADLINE> More public Hillary Clinton agrees to appear at satire show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Continuing to venture out of the White House cocoon
that has shielded her for the past seven years, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
agreed to take the stage at the nation's longest-running political gridiron
show.
<P>
	   The first lady, fresh from her star turn on the "Late Show with David
Letterman" and set to formally enter New York's Senate race next month, accepted
an invitation to be part of the 100th annual Legislative Correspondents
Association show on June 10 in Albany. Through political satire performances,
reporters and LCA alumni poke fun at politicians and government officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll have to get the home office in Chappaqua working overtime on this,"
Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign committee, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who had never lived or worked in New York before, recently
moved into a house in Chappaqua in Westchester County just north of New York
City to establish New York residency for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's expected opponent for the Senate race, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has also been invited to appear at the LCA show. There was no
immediate response Friday from the mayor on whether he planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   As a featured guest, Republican Giuliani did a lengthy monologue at the
LCA's 1991 show.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, as she draws closer to formally entering the Senate race,
the notoriously media-shy Mrs. Clinton has begun conducting regular
question-and-answer sessions with reporters during campaign stops. She mixes
easily with people who happen to show up at her events. The first lady is also
planning a series of in-depth interviews in the days leading up to her early
February campaign kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a far cry from her early forays onto the New York political stage
last year when she rarely left the security of her Secret Service detail and
contact with the public generally involved little more than some handshaking
along a rope line. Questioning by reporters was rare.
</P>
<P>
	   That is in sharp contrast to Giuliani, who holds a "media availability"
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown the mayor leading the first lady among New York
voters and some of her aides have been advising a more open approach to
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to appear at the LCA show, Mrs. Clinton is accepting what has
become almost a rite of passage in New York politics for major candidates. In
1998, then-U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer took a turn. Five months later, Democrat
Schumer defeated Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato in that year's U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, once the reporters have finished skewering the politicians
with songs and skits, the governor and two guests, one Republican and one
Democrat, are invited to offer responses - generally humorous speeches or more
elaborate skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson said Friday that he wasn't yet sure what Mrs. Clinton would do.
</P>
<P>
	   The black-tie, $175-a-person dinner and show raises money for charity and to
support LCA operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the Hillary Clinton campaign team appeared to have rejected the
LCA's invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 10 letter to LCA President David Hepp, co-host of the "Inside
Albany" television show, Mrs. Clinton's scheduling director, Paul Rivera, had
written that "Mrs. Clinton's official schedule will not permit her to accept the
invitation."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the rejection, Wolfson had said Thursday that he believed there
had been a mistake. By this morning, Hepp had a new letter in hand from Rivera
stating that the first letter "was sent in error."
</P>
<P>
	   "Please be assured that we plan to participate in the show," Rivera wrote in
the second letter.

<HEADLINE> Snow's arrival means ski time, if it's not too cold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LATHAM, N.Y. (AP) - Mike Lilleberg stood before the long rack of skis at
Ski Market, fingering the multicolored runners with a determined look.
<P>
	   "I've skied in Tahoe and Montana and I was planning on buying skis anyway,"
he said, "but the snow was a good motivator."
</P>
<P>
	   Like dozens of other customers, Lilleberg made a late Friday run to the ski
store envisioning newly frosted slopes. With up to ten inches of snow having
fallen in Albany in two days, he knew the time had come.
</P>
<P>
	   With the new snow falling on top of the manufactured snow that ski resorts
have been producing for a month, mountains in eastern New York and neighboring
states seemed a skiers paradise. But there could be one problem: high winds
accompanied the first snow of the season. That meant some would-be skiers were
reluctant to hit the slopes and resort operators worried they might have to
close down trails because of the intense cold.
</P>
<P>
	   A Whiteface Mountain employee said temperatures early Friday night reached
17 degrees below zero at the summit and four at the base. The ski resort was
considering closing lifts to the summit if the wind continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Employees at ski shops across eastern New York said business picked up
steadily through the week as the first big storm of the season approached and
finally coated the landscape picture-perfect white.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cut the staff back by 40 percent last week," Ruth Strothers, assistant
manager at the Ski Market said, laughing. "Now we're too busy."
</P>
<P>
	   Customers milled through the Ski Market in the Albany suburb of Latham,
sticking their hands into bin after bin of big leather gloves and ski masks,
eyeing racks of designer sunglasses and goggles and staring up at walls covered
with brightly-colored parkas and jackets.
</P>
<P>
	   Others ran in from the windy parking lot to pick up skis they dropped off
for repairs, pausing to chat about conditions before running back to their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Winds of 15 to 20 mph were expected in Buffalo this afternoon on top of a
high of around 30 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Slopes
around Syracuse are expected to be only slightly friendlier, with winds of 10 to
15 mph on top of a high of between 20 and 25 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Albany area, the wind chill Friday night made for brutally cold
weather. Winds were expected to decrease this afternoon, but the high was still
expected to hang on to the underside of 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   That was bad news for Christine Jevons and her son Aaron, who were shopping
for snow boarding supplies at the Ski Market.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him it's going to be bitter, bitter cold," Mrs. Jevons said, adding
she wasn't about to accompany her son on the slopes of Massachusetts' Brodie
Mountain today.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron added, "If I wasn't skiing, then I wouldn't like this weather."

<HEADLINE> NBA Would Welcome Jordan As Owner  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The NBA would be receptive to Michael Jordan returning to the league as a
part-owner and director of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've made it clear that we think it'd be a terrific thing to have Michael
Jordan involved in the NBA in whatever capacity he wants to be involved in.
That's no secret," deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Friday. "That would be
wherever and whatever he was interested in doing."
</P>
<P>
	   A shroud of secrecy continued to hang over negotiations between current
Wizards owner Abe Pollin, minority owner Ted Leonsis and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post reported Friday that an agreement in principle had been
reached for Jordan to take over as president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
	   If negotiations continue to progress, Jordan could be running the team
before the Feb. 24 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he'd be great in the job, I really do," Indiana Pacers general
manager Donnie Walsh said. "He knows the players, he knows what it takes to win.
In dealing with his own franchise he'll know why they are winning or not winning
and what he needs to win."
</P>
<P>
	   One major part of the deal yet to be resolved is the amount of equity in the
franchise Jordan would assume from the minority ownership group.
</P>
<P>
	   Another snag is the potential conflicts of interest between Jordan and his
agent, David Falk, who reporesents several NBA players.
</P>
<P>
	   ""That's a concern," an NBA official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said in Saturday's editions of the Post. "That's one of the many things we have
to work through on this matter."
</P>
<P>
	   Leonsis, an executive at America Online, and two partners bought 100 percent
of the NHL Washington Capitals and part of Washington Sports and Entertainment,
which includes the Wizards, the WNBA's Mystics and the MCI Center, from longtime
owner Pollin last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Leonsis' group also has the right of first refusal to buy the rest of WSE
when the 76-year-old Pollin decides to sell.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was forthcoming with details about the deal Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have nothing to say about the details of any current discussions," Granik
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollin, Leonsis and Jordan's agent, David Falk, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no announcement scheduled and no comment," Wizards spokesman Matt
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the seemingly impending return of Jordan to the NBA was creating
quite a buzz. No name in basketball commands attention like that of Jordan,
whose mere presence would bring instant excitement to a moribund franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards, 12-24 this season, haven't won a playoff game in 12 years and
haven't had a sellout this season at the 2-year-old downtown MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
	   As head of basketball operations, Jordan would oversee the trading, signing
and drafting of players and the hiring and firing of front-office personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he would be a newcomer to that end of the business, no one was
expecting him to be a pushover in trade talks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you're going to take advantage of Michael Jordan. Nobody has
so far," Walsh said. "You're dealing with a basketball person who understands
what you're talking about. Once you establish a relationship with him, you both
know what each other are talking about.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the same as asking whether a great player can be a great coach, like
Larry Bird. Guys who have been players in the league have ended up being good
coaches and general managers. What's going to make Michael Jordan any different?
I think he'll be a great general manager," Walsh said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Mull Late-Term Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reclaimed center stage in the legal and
moral war over abortion Friday by agreeing to decide whether states may ban a
surgical procedure opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for
doctors to perform such abortions. A federal appeals court has blocked
enforcement of that law, calling it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but courts have
blocked enforcement of most of them. Congress enacted a federal ban on
partial-birth abortions but President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
	   The court has not issued a major abortion ruling since 1992 when it
reaffirmed the core holding of its 1973 decision in a case called Roe vs. Wade.
That landmark decision said women have a constitutional right to end their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the legal controversy swirls around a specific procedure, far more
may be at stake. Abortion-rights advocates say the court's eventual decision
could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion rights, depending
on what state legislatures can consider when regulating abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the Nebraska case in April. A decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgical procedure involves partially extracting a fetus, legs first,
through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining its contents.
Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the method dilation
and extraction, or D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
	   In unanimously striking down the Nebraska law, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the law's wording could also outlaw a more common procedure called
dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose
whether to have an abortion,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after the Nebraska law was struck down along with those in Iowa and
Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin were upheld
by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   That created a direct conflict legal experts predicted would require the
Supreme Court's final word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A constitutional crisis is calling out for a remedy,'' said
abortion-rights advocate Janet Benshoof of the Center for Reproductive Law &AMP;
Policy. ``What's at issue is whether a woman's interest in her health can be
trumped by a state legislature's moral and political statement about a fetus.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the other side of the argument, James Bopp Jr., general counsel of the
National Right to Life Committee, said the case is important ``because it will
set the outer limit of the so-called right to abortion, but it is not a
challenge to Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said, ``I feel strongly that states should
have the right to legislate in the area of partial-birth abortion. It's a
barbaric procedure that I hope is brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Don Stenberg agreed, adding, ``It shocks the
conscience that in the United States of America a human child can be literally
pulled from the womb and cruelly killed by having his or her skull punctured and
brain suctioned out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stenberg's Supreme Court appeal was bold. He not only urged the court to
reinstate the ban on the D&AMP;X procedure but also asked the justices to reverse
past rulings and give states a free hand to more stringently restrict, or even
outlaw, all abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief order issued by the court Friday indicated the justices will not
consider that request.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers representing a doctor who performs abortions in Nebraska urged the
justices to reject Stenberg's appeal because the appeals court correctly
concluded that the law would interfere with most abortions performed after a
woman's third month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, reached by a 5-4
vote, upheld partial-birth abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin by
``rewriting'' the state laws in an attempt to limit their impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The 7th Circuit court said state abortion laws can be motivated by ``moral''
revulsion to some procedures so long as they ``do not harm women's legitimate
interests.'' An abortion law can pass constitutional muster even if it outlaws
procedures that may be the safest method of ending a small number of women's
pregnancies, that court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case granted Friday is Stenberg vs. Carhart, 99-830.

<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Shawn Kemp scored five of his 24 points
in the final three minutes to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to an 82-80 win over
the Vancouver Grizzlies on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brevin Knight added 16 points while Lamond Murray scored 13 as the Cavaliers
improved to 7-0 all-time against the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Dickerson scored 23 points and Grant Long scored a season-high 13
points off the bench for the Grizzlies, who suffered their second straight loss
and fourth in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
	   After squandering a nine-point lead and missing 10 of their 11 first
field-goal attempts of the fourth quarter, the Cavaliers rallied.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 74-72 following Long's 20-foot jumper, the Cavaliers scored the
next two baskets on a layup and an 18-footer by Murray.
</P>
<P>
	   After Othella Harrington tied the game on the Grizzlies next possession,
Kemp -- fed by one of Bobby Sura's 11 assists -- put the Cavaliers ahead for
good with a massive dunk with 2:58 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp, who played the final four minutes of the game with five fouls, then
hit an 18-foot jumper, giving Cleveland an 81-78 lead with 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   After Dickerson missed a 3-point attempt, Sura sank one of two free throws
to make it a four-point game.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver managed just two field goals in the final three minutes, including
Shareef Abdur-Rahim's layup with a second left.

<HEADLINE> Possible Mob Victims' Remains Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY LINDSAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Acting on a remarkably precise tip early Friday,
investigators digging in a Boston field unearthed the skeletal remains of two
men and a woman believed to be victims of mobsters.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators knew exactly where to look and came upon the grave almost
immediately. U.S. Attorney Donald Stern called the discovery an important step
toward unraveling the tangled history of Boston's underworld.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people may view this as a bit of Boston history that ought not be
revisited,'' he said. ``I feel the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies are believed to be victims of reputed mobsters Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi and fugitive James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities believe the woman is Deborah Hussey, Flemmi's 26-year-old
stepdaughter, who allegedly was about to expose an affair with him when she
disappeared in 1984, The Boston Globe reported Saturday. Flemmi was the
common-law husband of Hussey's mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators found weapons Thursday during a search at Flemmi's mother's
home in South Boston, according to news reports. Stern would not say whether
that was related to the search for the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Flemmi, who was jailed in 1995 on federal racketeering charges, worked as an
FBI informant for decades while conducting mob business.
</P>
<P>
	   Flemmi, Bulger and their FBI handler were charged in December in another
federal racketeering indictment. It alleges that former Agent John J. Connolly
Jr. protected Flemmi and Bulger from prosecution and tipped them to the earlier
indictment. Bulger has not been captured.
</P>
<P>
	   The search began Thursday afternoon, after the investigators were tipped to
the location. The Boston Herald reported the source was Kevin Weeks, a former
associate of Bulger who was arrested on racketeering charges in November. Stern
would not comment on the source.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe reported that officials were searching for the bodies of
Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett and John McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Barrett was one of six men who stole $1.5 million in a
1980 bank robbery. He disappeared in 1983. Bulger and Flemmi are suspected of
killing Barrett and stealing his share, the Globe reported.
</P>
<P>
	   McIntyre disappeared in 1984 after Bulger and Flemmi learned that he was
assisting federal agents investigating a botched plot to provide guns to the
Irish Republican Army, the Globe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flemmi is also a suspect in the 1981 disappearance of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1995 indictment charges Flemmi with killing four men in the 1960s. The
bodies of two victims -- brothers Walter and Edward Bennett -- have never been
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Bennett's daughter, Susan, visited the scene Friday, hoping to learn
something about her father's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't even know why I came down here,'' she said. ``I don't usually come
to these. Something just feels funny about this one.''

</P>
<P>

the defending NBA champions got within one point at 60-59 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle beat San Antonio for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sonics finished the game without their best big man, Baker, who fouled
out with 2:34 to go with his team ahead 87-81.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio got 20 points from David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruben Patterson had 15 points and Brent Barry 12 for Seattle. Horace Grant
and Baker each had nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter, Robinson cut Seattle's lead to 83-79 with a
17-footer, but Baker answered with two free throws after being fouled by Samaki
Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Spurs' Antonio Daniels threw the ball out of bounds, Barry scored
on a fastbreak dunk after a steal by Terry Porter.
</P>
<P>
	   Avery Johnson made another critical San Antonio turnover when he dribbled
the ball out of bounds with 2:34 left and the Sonics ahead 87-81.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan scored 14 points in the third quarter when the Spurs crept to 60-59
with 6:04 gone in the period. The Sonics came back to take a 73-63 lead on a
free throw by Baker before San Antonio got the last six points of the quarter,
four on a pair of baskets by Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sonics led 49-42 at halftime after going ahead by 21 in the opening
quarter when they scored 18 unanswered points after Robinson opened the game
with a 15-footer. In that 18-0 run, Barry and Payton each hit 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaren Jackson of San Antonio sank a 3-pointer, but Payton hit consecutive
3-pointers to give Seattle a 24-5 advantage with 7:06 gone in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Spurs came back in the second period and cut Seattle's lead to five
at 41-36 on two free throws by Duncan with 3:12 left in the first half.

Supreme Court To Rule on Late-Term Abortion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reclaimed center stage in the legal and
moral war over abortion Friday by agreeing to decide whether states may ban a
surgical procedure opponents call "partial-birth abortion." The justices said
they will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for doctors to perform such
abortions. A federal appeals court has blocked enforcement of that law, calling
it unconstitutional. Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but
courts have blocked enforcement of most of them. Congress enacted a federal ban
on partial-birth abortions but President Clinton vetoed it.

Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Rows upon rows of Cuban mothers -- hundreds visibly pregnant,
others carrying small children -- marched along a seaside boulevard in Havana on
Friday as Fidel Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. "Bring back our son!" the women cried, waving
Cuban flags. Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in what
it called the "March of the Combatant Mothers." Elian, the boy at the center of
the international dispute, was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the
coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others died in a failed
attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been staying with relatives in Miami who do
not want to send him back to Cuba.

Ecuador Braces for Indian Protests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Bracing for massive protests in Ecuador's major
cities, the government on Friday deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to deal
with Indians demanding the ouster of President Jamil Mahuad and the closure of
Congress and the courts. Leaders of the indigenous organization that represents
4 million Indians in this Andean nation of 12 million said they expect 40,000
Indians to march into Quito on Saturday to seize control of Congress when Mahuad
makes his state of the union address. Mahuad, a Harvard-educated centrist who
took office 17 months ago, has been the target of increasing calls from across
the political spectrum to resign because of his failure to stop Ecuador's
economic decline.

Indian Land To Be Returned
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The government is returning 84,000 acres to the
Northern Ute tribe as part of a deal to clean up millions of tons of uranium
waste along the Colorado River, one of the biggest givebacks of Indian land in
U.S. history. The deal is subject to approval by Congress. The land, which is
next to the 4.4 million-acre Ute reservation, is believed to contain oil-rich
shale deposits. It was given to the Utes in 1882, but in 1916, on the eve of the
nation's entry into World War I, the federal government took it back to create a
reserve supply of oil for the Navy fleet. Under the agreement, the Indians can
open the land to oil and gas drilling. But they will have to pay a percentage of
the royalties to the government.

Oil Prices Reach 9-Year High
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices roared 5 percent higher to a new nine-year high
Friday, topping $28 a barrel for the first time since 1991 and the Gulf War. The
gain came after OPEC removed virtually all doubt it will extend its agreement on
lowered production for several more months. Frigid weather in the northeastern
United States also contributed to a sharp rise in crude as well as gasoline,
heating oil and natural gas futures. Crude climbed as high as $28.10 a barrel,
the highest since Jan. 16, 1991, before the Allied military strikes on Iraq that
brought about an end to the Gulf War.

<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers overcame eight technical fouls
and the ejections of Rasheed Wallace and coach Mike Dunleavy to beat the Phoenix
Suns 105-83 Friday night for their fourth straight victory and 10th in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Scottie Pippen scored all 13 of his points in the second half, including a
three-point play and 3-pointer as Portland turned the game into a rout in the
fourth quarter. He also had nine rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers outscored Phoenix 62-31 in the second half, 33-13 in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Arvydas Sabonis, back after missing three games with a viral infection,
scored 23 points on 6-for-7 shooting from the field and 11-for-11 at the foul
line. He also grabbed 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith, out of the starting lineup for the first time this season,
scored 22 for Portland, which trailed by as many as 15 in first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace scored 16 on 8-for-11 shooting before he was thrown out with 9:17
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen's steal and layup for a three-point play highlighted a 12-0 run that
put Portland up 86-74 on Sabonis' two free throws with 6:24 to play. Pippen
added a 3-pointer and Smith two free throws to make it 91-76 with 5:02 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Cliff Robinson scored 23 for the Suns, who have lost four of five and eight
of 11. Jason Kidd had 17 points and eight assists but was 0-for-8 from the field
in the second half after going 6-for-7 in the first. Rodney Rogers added 16
points and 10 rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace got two quick technicals from referee Ted Bernhardt for complaining
about an offensive foul call with Phoenix leading 52-49.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace went after Bernhardt after the ejections and had to be restrained by
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunleavy, who drew his first technical 21 seconds into the game, got his
second from referee Tony Brothers with 8:49 to play in the third. Kidd made all
three free throws on the third-quarter technicals to put Phoenix up 55-49.
</P>
<P>
	   After Dunleavy left, the Blazers scored the next seven points to take their
first lead, 58-57, on Pippen's 3-pointer from the top of the key with 6:22 left
in the third quarter. Portland led 72-70 entering the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams won't play again in the regular season. Portland won the series
3-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers scored six in an 8-2 spurt that put Phoenix ahead 41-26 with 6:09
left in the half. Kidd's left-handed drive through traffic with 26.5 seconds to
play gave the Suns a 52-43 lead at the half.

<HEADLINE> Late night host David Letterman undergoes quintuple bypass  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - While trading quips with a guest during a taping of his
late night show, David Letterman mentioned he was about to undergo heart tests -
joking that at worst, doctors would have to "open daddy's rib cage."
<P>
	   His prediction to fellow talk show host Regis Philbin became reality Friday
when doctors performed emergency quintuple bypass surgery on the 18-year veteran
of wisecracks and after-dark celebrity interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say Letterman is recovering from the surgery, but they are unsure
when the late-night television stalwart will return to his interviewing chair.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's very good," said operating surgeon Dr. O. Wayne Isom, when
asked of Letterman's outlook during an interview on CNN.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman spokesman Steven Rubenstein said CBS will telecast reruns of the
"Late Show with David Letterman" while the host recovers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're thrilled that Dave's surgery went well," said his network in a
statement. "He is a valued member of the CBS family, and we love him. We are
concerned first and foremost about his health, but we can't wait until he's back
behind his desk where he belongs."
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to operate was made after Letterman, 52, underwent an angiogram
because of high cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family. The
test, during which a flexible tube is inserted into an artery and dye is
injected, revealed one artery was seriously constricted.
</P>
<P>
	   Isom performed the successful surgery on Letterman at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center. The doctor said it went smoothly and predicted a rapid recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave has the heart muscle of a 20-year-old," Isom said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician, Dr. Louis J. Aronne, and his cardiologist,
Dr. Martin Post, said it was too early to determine how long recovery would
take.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Amarkanth Saxena, a cardiothoracic surgeon at St. Joseph's Medical
Center in Paterson, N.J., said if there are no complicating factors Letterman
should be hospitalized for three or four days, then recuperating at home for six
to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxena, who is not involved in Letterman's case but has performed bypass
surgery many times, said he would advise such a patient to control risk factors
like high blood pressure and cholesterol in the future, in part by avoiding
fried foods and red meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman also may need medication to control his cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else, Letterman has made a long-running joke of his health,
starting years ago when he discovered he had high cholesterol. For a month he
went on an oat-bran diet, complaining nightly about the taste and consistency of
the stuff. Comically, it played. Health-wise it didn't. At the end of the
experiment Dave said he hadn't improved much.
</P>
<P>
	   During Thursday night's taping of the program - which aired Friday - he
joked about it again with Philbin, who asked about Letterman's cholesterol
level.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman quipped. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman was born in Indianapolis on April 12, 1947. He broke into network
television on CBS in 1978 as a guest on Mary Tyler Moore's variety show, "Mary."
</P>
<P>
	   From there, it was "The Tonight Show" starring Johnny Carson, long regarded
as THE place for aspiring standup comedians to catch their big breaks. Letterman
also guest hosted "Tonight" numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   After a brief stint as the host of daytime's "The David Letterman Show," his
after-dark career took off with "Late Night with David Letterman." It premiered
in 1982 in the time slot following "Tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   During his 11-year run on NBC, Letterman won five Emmy awards, but moved to
CBS in 1993 shortly after Carson retired and NBC gave the coveted "Tonight Show"
host position to rival Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
	   "I and everyone at The Tonight Show wish Dave a speedy recovery," Leno said.
</P>
<P>
	   The slightly flashier, slightly softer "Late Show with David Letterman" has
brought the longtime host three more Emmy awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Mujibur Rahman, who runs a shop near The Ed Sullivan Theater where "Late
Show" tapes, and who has frequently appeared on the show as a straight-man for
the host, said he watched television all day in hopes of catching an update
about his friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm praying for him and his good health. I hope nothing will happen," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg James, a 27-year-old fan from Portland, Ore., who apparently shares
Letterman's sense of dark comedy, blamed the entertainer's condition on the
stress of hosting first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the show earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess Hillary did it to him," James said. "Too much pressure."

<HEADLINE> Auto Crackdown Tries To Tame Athens  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN MURPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Suddenly, there's something missing from downtown
Athens. Cars and motorbikes aren't jammed onto sidewalks. Double-parked vehicles
don't linger for hours. Traffic is actually moving in one direction on one-way
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   What's left are the sounds of police scratching out tickets and motorists
gnashing their teeth over an abrupt halt to Athens' notorious traffic
free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's this?'' complained motorist Takis Choropoulou as he plucked a
parking ticket from his car, which was left perched over a curb. ``Since when
are there parking rules?''
</P>
<P>
	   The change came after traffic enforcement authorities decided this week to
assign hundreds of police to roam central Athens in search of scofflaws. Since
Monday, more than 5,000 parking tickets have been issued in a new no-tolerance
zone covering areas near the Acropolis and parts of the city's central business
district.
</P>
<P>
	   Police promise to keep up the pressure. Foot patrols are nudging along
double-parked vehicles and intercepting drivers zipping up one-way streets as a
shortcut. Even the thousands of motorbike drivers who weave through central
Athens are feeling the squeeze. Many sidewalks have been declared off limits to
scooter parking.
</P>
<P>
	   The blitz is part of a larger attempt to tame Athens' unruly reputation. The
mayor, Dimitris Avramopoulos, has promoted ideas such as pedestrian zones and
saving the limited green space in the urban maze. A long-delayed subway
extension is expected to go into service later this month with hopes of easing
the monumental gridlock in a metropolitan area that holds nearly half of
Greece's 10.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   But order is not always easily imposed on Greeks -- especially when it comes
to their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, there has been a tacit understanding between motorists and
officials in Athens. Drivers could generally set their own traffic rules and
wedge their vehicles almost anywhere without a serious risk of being fined.
Enforcement was held in check in an apparent acknowledgment that motorists had
no other options. Parking lots are very scarce, public transportation is
traditionally weak and the rampant growth of greater Athens since the 1950s has
put nearly 2 million vehicles onto a road network designed for a fraction that
number.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is anarchy,'' said Giorgos Kanellaides, a professor of highway
planning at the Athens Polytechnic University.
</P>
<P>
	   Some drivers believe the chaos is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's its Greek way,'' said Manolis Psaropoulos, a delivery man for an
electrical supply company. ``The situation forces us to drive and park like
madmen. Where is the parking? Why does it sometimes take hours just to get
somewhere in the city?''
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1970s, Athens has imposed an odd-even number system that limits
daytime circulation in the city center depending on the last digit of license
plates. But officials have so far resisted trends in other European cities to
strictly curb private vehicle access to the center.
</P>
<P>
	   Some urban planners say blocking most traffic from the center may be the
only solution, particularly when Athens begins to spruce up to host the 2004
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a little while we will have so many cars that we will not know where to
put them,'' said Andonis Statopoulos, an associate professor of traffic
engineering at the Polytechnic University.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Medicare Advance  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is greeting with cautious optimism a
pledge by drug makers to cooperate on a new Medicare prescription benefit for
older Americans, saying the companies must follow it up with action.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take their offer in a positive way, and I just hope they'll come and sit
down with us," Clinton said Friday. But he said his worries about high drug
prices, which have raised industry fears of price controls, remain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think what they're worried about is the fact that if the government
becomes a big buyer that we'll be able to bargain for lower prices at greater
volume. I don't think that's a bad thing," the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug industry leaders told administration officials at a White House meeting
Wednesday that they want to try to find a compromise on a Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no indication that the companies are changing their fundamental
position, which has been to support improved drug coverage for the elderly
through the private sector, not directly from the government. The industry
worries that a government-run program could lead to price controls.
</P>
<P>
	   They said Friday for the first time, however, that they would be willing to
support drug-coverage legislation separate from a wholesale redesign of Medicare
in which more senior citizens would get all their health care through private
health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has proposed having the government run a Medicare drug benefit by
contracting with the same drug-purchasing management firms used by many private
health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have very serious concerns ... about the president's plan,"
said Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, who was at the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry leaders pledged to tone down rhetoric against the administration's
proposal, including commercials featuring an elderly woman named Flo who insists
on keeping the government "out of my medicine cabinet."
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of our advocacy, including any advertising we might be involved
in, we intend to be very positive and constructive in our support of bipartisan
solutions," said Holmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Congress and the White House can agree on the design of a Medicare
drug benefit and enact it this year remains doubtful. Congress has a shortened
session, and the two political parties are looking to emphasize their
differences as elections near.
</P>
<P>
	   "The outlook for Medicare reform in 2000 remains almost as cloudy and
overcast as before the statement put out by the pharmaceutical industry," said
Marty Corry, lobbyist for AARP, the nation's largest organization of older
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Many consider the failure to cover drug costs for patients who are not in
hospitals is a serious gap in Medicare, the nation's health insurance program
for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   There is growing concern that senior citizens are being left behind as more
new drugs to treat diseases of aging are introduced, but prescription costs are
rising by more than 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic polling has found Americans of all ages worry about rising drug
prices, and Clinton has expressed anger at the hard line drug companies were
taking against his Medicare proposal and the negative tone of their ads. He has
promised a government study of drug pricing and is expected to feature the issue
in his State of the Union address, scheduled Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders, meanwhile, have said they support helping the elderly
pay for drugs but don't want to displace the private coverage some now have
through retirement benefits or HMOs. They have promised hearings in Congress
this year.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 3, Blues 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Marty McInnis got the go-ahead goal and Paul Kariya
scored his first power-play goal in nine games as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks ended
the St. Louis Blues' eight-game unbeaten streak with a 3-1 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Guy Hebert, who played for the Blues until the Ducks made him their first
pick in the 1993 expansion draft, made 36 saves, and Ladislav Kohn ended a
12-game goal-scoring drought to help Anaheim snap a seven-game winless streak
and hand the Blues their third loss in 17 games (10-3-4).
</P>
<P>
	   Stephane Richer played his first game with the Blues after being obtained on
Thursday from the Tampa Bay Lightning. The 15-year veteran right wing, playing
for his fourth NHL team, assisted on Pierre Turgeon's second-period goal.
</P>
<P>
	   McInnis opened the scoring 4 1-2 minutes into the second period with his
eighth goal. Antti Aalto, playing for the first time in 16 games since spraining
his left elbow on Dec. 4, sent the puck behind the net while taking a hard check
against the right boards. McInnis then converted Mike Leclerc's cross-ice pass,
beating Jamie McLennan to the stick side.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya made it 2-0 at 10:15 of the period, scoring his 19th goal just 14
seconds into a two-man advantage. Teemu Selanne carried the puck around the left
circle and set up Kariya with a little backhanded flip through the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   It could have been worse for the Blues, but McLennan slowed the Ducks'
momentum with sprawling saves against Leclerc and Jeff Nielsen during the next
minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert stopped the first 25 shots by the Blues, who took 14 in each of the
first two periods after recording only 16 in Thursday night's 3-2 victory at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   But Turgeon narrowed the gap to 2-1 at 14:52 of the second with his 22nd
goal and 100th since joining the Blues in a trade from Montreal in October 1996.
He stuffed a rebound under Hebert after the Ducks' goalie stopped Richer's wrist
shot from the top of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohn restored Anaheim's two-goal margin at 2:08 of the third period with his
third goal, helping the Ducks beat St. Louis at home for the first time in seven
tries (1-5-1). Kohn beat McLennan high to the glove side with a 15-foot wrist
shot after Matt Cullen set him up with a slick drop-pass between his legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Al MacInnins, last season's Norris Trophy winner as the NHL's top
defenseman, left the game with a bruised chest after getting slammed into the
boards by Leclerc behind the St. Louis net early in the third period.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Roundup  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is adding two explosive cases to an
already high-profile term, agreeing to decide whether states can ban a procedure
opponents call ``partial birth abortion'' and whether the Boy Scouts can exclude
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices announced Friday they will hear arguments in the two cases this
spring; decisions are expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The abortion case could yield the court's most important ruling on the issue
since it reaffirmed women's constitutional right to abortion in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for doctors to
perform the controversial procedure. A federal appeals court struck down the law
as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A constitutional crisis is calling out for a remedy,'' said
abortion-rights advocate Janet Benshoof of the Center for Reproductive Law &AMP;
Policy. ``What's at issue is whether a woman's interest in her health can be
trumped by a state legislature's moral and political statement about a fetus.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said, ``I feel strongly that states should
have the right to legislate in the area of partial-birth abortion. It's a
barbaric procedure that I hope is brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the current controversy involves a specific procedure,
abortion-rights activists contend far more may be at stake. They say the court's
decision could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion rights,
depending on what state legislatures are allowed to consider when passing laws
to regulate abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The procedure involves partially extracting a fetus, legs first, through the
birth canal, cutting the skull and draining its contents.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty states have enacted bans on the procedure, but most have been blocked
in court. A month after the Nebraska law was invalidated along with laws in Iowa
and Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin were
upheld by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress passed a federal ban on partial-birth abortions, but President
Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boy Scout case involves an assistant scoutmaster in New Jersey whose
leadership role was revoked when the organization learned he was gay.
</P>
<P>
	   James Dale sued, and the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last summer that the
Boy Scouts' denial of membership to homosexual boys and leaders violated a state
law banning discrimination in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Scouts' lawyers contend that law violated the organization's rights of
free speech and free association under the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Scouting adheres to a moral belief ... that homosexual conduct is not
moral,'' the Scouts' lawyer, George A. Davidson, said Friday. An openly gay
person would not be a proper role model for the Scouts, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dale's lawyer, Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, said opposition to homosexuality is not one of the Scouts' main purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As gay people we know how important the First Amendment is,'' Wolfson
said. ``Their First Amendment rights are not being interfered with.''
</P>
<P>
	   Entering another high-profile area Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to
review an appeal in which five Branch Davidians challenged their sentences for
using firearms during a gun battle that began the 1993 standoff at the cult's
compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will hear the Davidians' argument that they could not
be given longer sentences for using machine guns, rather than some other kind of
firearms, because a jury never decided what type of weapons were used.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Friday, the court had a number of major cases on its calendar.
This week, the justices further trimmed the federal government's power over
states, ruling that state employees cannot sue in federal court over age bias.
</P>
<P>
	   They also broadened police officers' authority to stop and question people
who run at the sight of an officer, and ruled that Congress can protect
motorists' privacy by barring states from selling the personal information on
drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Still to come by summer are rulings on:
</P>
<P>
	   --State laws that give grandparents broad rights to seek court-ordered
visitation with their grandchildren against the parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   --Whether a federal law, in effect, overturned the 1966 Miranda ruling that
requires police to warn criminal suspects of their right to remain silent and to
get a lawyer's help.
</P>
<P>
	   --Limits on financial contributions to political candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   --A federal law that lets rape victims sue their attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Food and Drug Administration's decision to regulate tobacco as an
addictive drug.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain, Forbes Spar Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush is accusing Sen. John McCain, his
chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination, of ``Washington
double-accounting'' with his tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Texas governor aired a new ad in response to
intensifying criticism of his own big tax-reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Facing accusations from McCain and fellow contender Steve Forbes, Bush said
simply, ``They're both wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The charges and countercharges came as the six GOP presidential hopefuls
prepared for an afternoon debate today sponsored by The Des Moines Register.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had a new tax ad, too. Speaking directly into the camera for a spot
airing in New Hampshire, he said: ``There's one big difference between me and
the others -- I won't take every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax
cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Forbes claimed that Bush, as governor, broke a 1994
anti-tax pledge by supporting failed legislation that included business and
sales tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Not guilty, Bush said in his Iowa ad. ``In Texas, you're only as good as
your word.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes camp dismissed that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once again, Governor Bush has ducked the issue,'' said Bill Dal Col,
Forbes' campaign manager. ``It's simple -- he just has to come clean.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the attack himself, Bush said in Glenwood, Iowa, that McCain was
targeting the same special-interest tax benefits to pay for both his tax cuts
and an education proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like he's going to fund his education reform with ethanol and
he's going to fund his tax cut plan with ethanol,'' Bush said of the Arizona
senator's plan. ``It sounds like Washington double-accounting to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The education program in question concerns vouchers that could be used to
help certain students attend private schools. And the McCain camp was quick to
respond.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain includes the needed money, said spokesman Howard Opinsky. Bush knows
it and ``is doing a Texas two-step on vouchers and taxes. He said he is for
vouchers, but he never funded his plan in Texas,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself was in New Hampshire on Friday speaking to College Convention
2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The major reason I'm running for president of the United States is right
here in this room,'' McCain told the group, which included college and high
school students from as far away as Alabama. ``I want to get young people back
into the political process and part of the government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iowans hold their first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses on Jan. 24.
Eight days later, New Hampshire voters go to the polls in the first primary.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stump, Bush is touting a plan that would cut income taxes by $483
billion over five years. Earlier this week, McCain announced a proposal to cut
taxes by $237 billion over the same period, while setting aside $729 billion for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush argues that McCain's plan leaves too much surplus tax revenue in
Washington, where Congress will be sure to spend it. McCain argues that Bush
doesn't preserve enough to buoy Social Security in the face of the baby boom
generation's retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll use the bulk of the surplus to secure Social Security far into the
future to keep our promise to the greatest generation,'' McCain says in his new
TV ad. ``I'll begin to pay down the national debt so we don't threaten the
future of our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arriving in Des Moines, Bush replied: ``If I can paraphrase his plan, his
plan is the best to maintain the status quo in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush started his day with a speech in a corrugated tin community center in
Red Oak, Iowa. He made a special appeal for votes in this agricultural state,
arguing that one way to help farmers is to open more markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that might not only raise farm prices but also counteract the move
from family farms to ones owned by conglomerates. ``If you're able to sell your
product overseas, to me it almost makes the conglomeration you're worried about
moot,'' the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The grandmother of Elian Gonzalez said she is willing to go
to Miami to bring the six-year-old boy home to Cuba, while Fidel Castro's point
man on U.S. relations expressed impatience at Washington's failure to enforce a
repatriation order.
</P>
<P>
	   In a massive demonstration demanding Elian's return, tens of thousands of
Cuban women -- hundreds visibly pregnant and others carrying small children --
marched along Havana's seaside boulevard on Friday to the U.S. mission, waving
Cuban flags and chanting ``Bring back our son!''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, flanked by his two grandmothers, was at the
head of the ``March of the Combatant Mothers,'' pushing his half-brother in a
stroller. Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in the
march.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December,
when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba's biggest
gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought President Castro to
power 41 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute, was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother,
stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been
staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had ruled that Elian must be
returned to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and set Friday as the deadline for
his repatriation to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But this week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give
Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy
with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man
on U.S.-Cuban relations, told The Associated Press that Cuban authorities are
frustrated by Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's failure to
enforce its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No enforcement action was ever announced by the INS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon, former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed
suggestions by some U.S. politicians and Elian's relatives in Miami that Elian's
father travel from Cardenas, Cuba, to Miami to pick up the boy. He said Cuba has
not prohibited Gonzalez from going to Miami to retrieve Elian, American
attorneys -- and even American officials -- have counseled against it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have gotten the same message from U.S. officials -- in private --
several times that it is not advisable for this man to appear in U.S.
territory,'' said Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
	   The concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez goes he will
immediately become involved in political and legal problems that will prevent
his speedy return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told reporters that she was willing
to go to Miami to retrieve her grandson if it was assured to her that she could
pick him up and return immediately to Cuba without become embroiled in legal or
political problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would go there just for one minute to get him. To get him. Nothing
more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his sea rescue, Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as
``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological
battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash between two governments,
the dispute over Elian is a battle between Cubans of differing political views
living on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno allowed the extension of the deadline after rejecting a Florida state
court order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his
American relatives. Reno said the state court had no jurisdiction in the case,
but that the Miami relatives should be able to make their case in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting to keep the boy
with him in Miami, saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba. He
and others who oppose the boy's return to Cuba say that Elian's mother died to
give the boy freedom in the United States.

<HEADLINE> No Consensus Yet on U.N. Iraq Post  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed to get Security
Council approval for his top candidates to lead the United Nations' new weapons
inspection agency for Iraq, and more names may have to be considered, diplomats
and U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia and China told Annan they opposed his top choice, Rolf Ekeus of
Sweden, the first chief weapons inspector, to be executive chairman of the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC, the diplomats
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan's other main candidates, Brazil's former U.N. ambassador, Celso
Amorim, and Finland's ambassador to Israel and Cyprus, Pasi Patokallio,
similarly didn't receive the full support of council members, the diplomats said
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Consultations were expected to continue by telephone over the weekend, and
other names could be floated, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard would only say: ``The secretary-general hasn't
given up.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials, meanwhile, said they hadn't ruled out any candidates,
including Ekeus, who is retiring in June as Sweden's ambassador to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   UNMOVIC was formed in December to replace the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM, which was charged after the 1991 Gulf War with uncovering Iraq's
efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   UNSCOM inspectors pulled out of Baghdad in December, 1998, ahead of U.S. and
British airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution that created UNMOVIC, Annan was given until Sunday to
find an executive chairman for the agency. It wasn't clear Friday night if the
council would meet Sunday to extend the deadline or let it simply pass without
formal action if a candidate wasn't found.
</P>
<P>
	   Several new names were floated Thursday and Friday, and others thought to
have been passed over were resurrected, including South Africa's deputy
director-general for multilateral affairs, Abdul Minty.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African mission to the United Nations on Thursday had said Minty's
services were required at home, but diplomats said Annan was asked Friday to
approach the government and ask it to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
	   New names proposed included two Indonesians: the former Indonesian foreign
minister, Ali Alatas and the former U.N. ambassador, Nugroho Wisnumurti, both of
whom were deeply involved in the U.N.-organized referendum in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear if they received support of the key five
permanent members of the council.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Hoops It up on Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- There was no laser light show, only glow-in-the-dark
letters on black posterboard. But the pulsating music as Bill Bradley loped
toward the school auditorium was the same beat that sends the New York Knicks
charging into Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
	   That beat had 71-year-old Bob Kusy dancing in his seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Long before he started following Bradley's Democratic presidential campaign,
Kusy followed his career in pro basketball. ``I knew all the guys back then, but
Bill more than most because he was so good,'' Kusy said before Bradley's
appearance at Johnston High School, with his wife, Donna, a campaign volunteer,
beside him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly squeamish about being seen more as a jock than a president, Bradley
encourages fascination with his old athletic career. He regales every crowd with
at least one tale from his years with the Princeton Tigers, the United States'
1964 Olympic gold-medal team and the Knicks. His first political ads showed
footage from the Olympic game and he sometimes brings old teammates like Dave
DeBusschere along on the stump.
</P>
<P>
	   He joked to a high school boy in Exira that coach Phil Jackson moved from
the Chicago Bulls to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of the strategy to win
Southern California for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How much did you pay him for that,'' the boy asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Not missing a beat, Bradley replied, ``We were roommates on the Knicks. I
just agreed not to tell a few stories.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's the fans who can be sheepish.
</P>
<P>
	   Jessica Paindiris, 16, and her father recently traveled from their home in
Connecticut to a Bradley campaign stop in New Hampshire, hoping for autographs
on the two basketballs they carried hidden in shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Jessica said she's drawn to Bradley not just by his sports celebrity but by
his integrity. ``We need that now, after Bill Clinton,'' the girl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Professional athletes running for office is not a new phenomenon--
ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura is governor of Minnesota and former Buffalo Bills
quarterback Jack Kemp's bid for president and vice president -- but it remains
something of a novelty.
</P>
<P>
	   Much like Bob Dole would visibly cringe each time Kemp, his 1996 running
mate, stripped off his coat to throw footballs, a touch of envy for Bradley's
sports appeal sometimes creeps into the remarks of Vice President Al Gore,
Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   At a New Hampshire house party late last year, Gore joked: ``I played
basketball in college, too. The difference is I didn't make a big deal about
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's campaign posters, featuring a vintage photo of him
dribbling in his No. 24 Knicks jersey, proclaimed him a scholar, a star athlete
and ``basically the guy you hated in high school.''
</P>
<P>
	   Friday night found him watching a basketball game at Theodore Roosevelt
High. At halftime, he remembered learning discipline and courage as a boy by
spending ``most Friday nights in the winter in a gym just like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roosevelt coach Michael Holmes told a reporter that, growing up, he would
pretend he was Bradley when he and the neighborhood boys played hoops in the
driveway. Today, Bradley, who attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar
after Princeton, ``is the perfect role model'' and helps make the point that
ball players need to study too, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley loves to tell the story about asking a Princeton professor to teach
him the Russian phrase for ``Watch it, big fella'' -- one he repeats for
campaign crowds in a throaty shout -- so he could fool the Soviet Olympic team
into thinking he understood when they called their plays aloud.
</P>
<P>
	   Athletics is good training ground for commander in chief, said Holmes.
``Anybody who can block (former Boston Celtic John) Havlicek and (Cincinnati
Royals Hall of Famer Oscar) Robertson, he's the guy I want by the button. He's
seen pressure.''
</P>
<P>
	   For all the stories, Bradley mostly won't touch a basketball in front of the
news cameras except for autographs.
</P>
<P>
	   If he wants to look like a winner, better to demur from shooting baskets
than miss one.

<HEADLINE> Shulman gets 25 to life on top of death penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A prosecutor says she pursued the case of
convicted killer Robert Shulman - who is already on death row - to ensure he
spent his life behind bars.
<P>
	   "This will guarantee that he dies in prison, either way," said Westchester
District Attorney Jeanine Pirro. "He'll go by lethal injection or by natural
causes."
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, who has admitted killing five women, was sentenced Friday to 25
years to life in prison for murdering the two victims whose bodies ended up in
Westchester. He is appealing the death row sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The sister of one victim stood up in court to denounce Shulman, saying,
"What this gentleman has done has torn up my family completely."
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't forgive him and we certainly can't forget it," said Dawn Paul, 28,
of Brooklyn, younger sister of victim Lori Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, eyes downcast, stood as County Court Judge Joseph West said, "This
is a horrible case. These are heinous crimes. ... You have served as judge, jury
and executioner."
</P>
<P>
	   He sentenced Shulman to 25 years to life for second-degree murder and
ordered the term be served only after any other sentence he faces.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, 45, is appealing a death sentence in Suffolk County in the killings
of three other women at his Hicksville apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   The case ended up in Westchester because Shulman and his brother Barry
dumped Ms. Vasquez and another victim, who was never identified, in Yonkers.
They were found in 1991 and 1992, crammed into plastic trash cans. There was no
death penalty law at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Shulman, who has admitted helping his brother dispose of the bodies,
faces two years in prison. Lawyers said Robert Shulman pleaded guilty to murder
for a deal that spares his brother additional time.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Paul told the judge that her sister, a prostitute, "wanted to change
her life and this gentleman here took her life away."
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court, she said she had learned of her sister's killing a day after
they were supposed to get together for an outing at Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "She didn't show up, so I knew she was missing, and then the next day we got
the news," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Paul said her fifth child, a 10-month-old girl, was born on Ms.
Vasquez's birthday and was named for her.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Anti-Drug Efforts  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said his drug adviser's effort to
insert anti-drug messages in prime-time television programs was not an attempt
to rob networks of creative freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no attempt to regulate content or tell people what they had to
put into it," he said Friday. "Of course, I wouldn't support that."
</P>
<P>
	   Fallout over the policy extended to California, where the bosses of several
studios said they were unaware that networks were offered financial incentives
if certain programs preached against drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Five studio executives, responsible for shows like "ER," "The Simpsons" and
"The Drew Carey Show," objected to the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's appalling," said Gail Berman, president of Regency Television,
which makes "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Roswell." "It's inappropriate for
government to participate in this way in the production of television."
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television, which makes "ER" for
NBC, said neither he nor "ER" producer John Wells was aware of the government's
efforts. Roth said he would never demand his producers or writers reflect a
particular point of view on a social issue, even if there were a financial
benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's drug advisers said they had consulted with "ER" writers, and even
said they believed a recent episode in which a teen-ager came into the emergency
room suffering from alcohol abuse was a result of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The government spends millions of dollars each year to buy ads on network TV
for anti-drug public service announcements. Recently, it has been forfeiting
some of the ad time if the networks could prove they inserted anti-drug messages
into programs. That enables the networks to make more money by selling ad time
to other clients.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the WB have all acknowledged letting the White House
press office review the scripts of some of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his drug office has done a good job of getting young people to
hear anti-drug messages, and that drug use is dropping as a result.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've talked to a lot of people in the entertainment community who like the
idea that, without compromising the integrity of their programs, they might be
involved in all kinds of public service efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Clinton's drug office were in Pasadena on Friday to release a
study that concludes television generally does better than movies or music in
depicting drug, alcohol and tobacco use responsibly. The study encompassed a
period in which the officials were quietly working with the networks to get
their message across.
</P>
<P>
	   David Kissinger, president of Studio USA, who oversees production of "Law &AMP;
Order" and "Xena: Warrior Princess," said he believed the cooperation between
the government and networks is both wrong and destined to be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way for television shows to reflect values the society regards as
important is for the producers to actually care about them and not for the
government to impose it on them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Newman, president of 20th Century Fox and responsible for "The
Simpsons" and "Ally McBeal," said he was unaware of the government's efforts and
opposed to them, as did Steve McPherson, executive vice president of Touchstone
Television, which produces "Sports Night" and "Felicity."

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Cincinnati 73, Ohio 59  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ohio's slowdown offense lulled Cincinnati for a half, but
Pete Mickeal led a second-half run that rallied the nation's top-ranked team to
a 73-59 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati (16-1) allowed its fourth midnight game during coach Bob Huggins'
11 seasons to turn into another late-night scare. The Bearcats' last midnight
game turned into their last home-court loss, 87-79 to Arizona State on Nov. 21,
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio (9-8) kept Cincinnati's lead to single digits throughout the first half
and trailed only 34-29 at the break. Mickeal and Jermaine Tate got Cincinnati
energized early in the second half, setting up the Bearcats' 39th straight win
at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Tate hit a couple of baskets and Mickeal rebounded Tate's missed free throw
for a putback. Mickeal's 3-pointer finished a nine-point run that made it 45-32,
Cincinnati's first double-digit lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   After Ohio cut it to six points again, Mickeal hit two more driving baskets
and a free throw to prevent a relapse. Ohio never got closer than 11 points
again.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickeal had 18 points and eight rebounds, while Tate added 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Esterkamp scored 13 points and Sanjay Adell had 12 for Ohio, which
broke with its history of getting overwhelmed by top-ranked teams. The Bobcats
had played a No. 1 team five other times and lost by 24, 42, 47, 30 and 21
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati also was ranked No. 1 when the teams played on Dec. 29, 1962. The
instate schools have played 75 times, but had not met in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The loudest crowd of the season at the Shoemaker Center greeted Ohio with a
profane chant, then went uneasily quiet as the Bobcats slowed down the pace and
stayed right with the country's top team for more than a half.
</P>
<P>
	   Huggins, who played for Ohio as a freshman in 1973 before transferring to
West Virginia, remained composed as the Bearcats struggled through their second
slow start in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati fell behind by nine points in the first half Wednesday night at
Tulane before rallying for a 72-59 win. Ohio set a deliberate pace Friday,
running down the shot clock with each possession.

	   Sluggish Cincinnati made only 2-of-12 3-point shots and shot 36.7 percent in
the half. Ohio dominated the boards 20-14 against the Bearcats' celebrated front
line, with Shaun Stonerook getting eight. Stonerook finished with 14 rebounds as
Ohio outrebounded Cincinnati 40-36 overall.

	   As the game stayed close, Ohio went from an unnerved team -- seven turnovers
in the first seven minutes -- to one that wouldn't back down. Several players
traded words after one foul in the second half, and Mickeal later popped up and
gestured toward Esterkamp after he was fouled hard and hit the floor.

Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Rows upon rows of Cuban mothers -- hundreds visibly pregnant,
others carrying small children -- marched along a seaside boulevard in Havana on
Friday as Fidel Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women
participated in what it called the "March of the Combatant Mothers." Elian, the
boy at the center of the international dispute, was found clinging to an inner
tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others
died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been staying with
relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.

Possible Mob Victims' Remains Found

<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Acting on a remarkably precise tip early Friday,
investigators digging in a Boston field unearthed the skeletal remains of two
men and a woman believed to be victims of mobsters. The bodies are believed to
be victims of reputed mobsters Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi and fugitive James
"Whitey" Bulger. Authorities believe the woman is Deborah Hussey, Flemmi's
26-year-old stepdaughter, who allegedly was about to expose an affair with him
when she disappeared in 1984, The Boston Globe reported Saturday.

Clinton Welcomes Medicare Advance
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is greeting with cautious optimism a
pledge by drug makers to cooperate on a new Medicare prescription benefit for
older Americans, saying the companies must follow it up with action. "I take
their offer in a positive way, and I just hope they'll come and sit down with
us," Clinton said Friday. But he said his worries about high drug prices, which

Court To Rule on Late-Term Abortion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reclaimed center stage in the legal and
moral war over abortion Friday by agreeing to decide whether states may ban a
surgical procedure opponents call "partial-birth abortion." The justices said
they will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for doctors to perform such
abortions. A federal appeals court has blocked enforcement of that law, calling
it unconstitutional. Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but
courts have blocked enforcement of most of them.

Clinton Supports Anti-Drug Efforts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said his drug adviser's effort to
insert anti-drug messages in prime-time television programs was not an attempt
to rob networks of creative freedom. "There was no attempt to regulate content
or tell people what they had to put into it," he said Friday. "Of course, I
wouldn't support that." Fallout over the policy extended to California, where
the bosses of several studios said they were unaware that networks were offered
financial incentives if certain programs preached against drugs.

Ecuador Braces for Indian Protests

cities, the government on Friday deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to deal
with Indians demanding the ouster of President Jamil Mahuad and the closure of
Congress and the courts. Leaders of the indigenous organization that represents
4 million Indians in this Andean nation of 12 million said they expect 40,000
Indians to march into Quito on Saturday to seize control of Congress. Mahuad has
been the target of increasing calls from across the political spectrum to resign
because of his failure to stop Ecuador's economic decline.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Late Show" host David Letterman underwent emergency
quintuple bypass surgery Friday after a test found one of his arteries was

   BEIJING (AP) -- Two earthquakes collapsed about 4,000 buildings in southwest
China on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring 220, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yao'an County, in province of Yunnan, was first hit by a 6.0-magnitude quake
that sent people scurrying out of their homes in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1 1/2 hours later, the county was hit by an even stronger aftershock,
of 6.5 magnitude, said a county seismologist who gave only his surname, Su.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Returning Land to Utes  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT GEHRKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Eighty-four years after the federal government
confiscated thousands of acres of potentially oil-rich land from the Northern
Ute Indian tribe, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says the government is ready
to give it back.
</P>
<P>
	   If Congress approves the deal, the 84,000 acres will be the largest return
of Indian land in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The land is not needed for national security anymore,'' Richardson said
Friday after announcing the agreement at the tribe's headquarters in Fort
Duchesne, about 110 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. ``The right thing to do
is turn it back. They're the rightful owners.''
</P>
<P>
	   But there's a caveat. Under the agreement, the tribe can open the land to
oil and gas drilling, but will have to pay a percentage of the royalties to the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will help the government cover the $300 million cost of relocating
10.5 million tons of radioactive rock and soil along the Colorado River left
over from the mining of uranium during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is actually a moral issue in that the government has finally returned
to us what was taken from us without our consent,'' said O. Roland McCook,
chairman of the tribe's governing body.
</P>
<P>
	   The land, believed to contain oil-rich shale deposits, was given to the Utes
in 1882. But in 1916, on the eve of the nation's entry into World War I, the
federal government took it back to create a reserve supply of oil for the Navy
fleet. The reserve was never tapped.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department estimates that the land holds 6 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas, equal to about 30 percent of the natural gas used in the United
States during 1998. There are no estimates of how much oil is there.
</P>
<P>
	   The royalty percentage is still being negotiated but is expected to be about
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just a big step in the direction of solving the problem,'' said
Rep. Chris Cannon, whose district includes both the 4.4 million-acre reservation
and the radioactive waste, known as the Atlas tailings. He expects Congress to
approve the deal and a proposal to move the tailings.
</P>
<P>
	   The radioactive waste sits 750 feet from the Colorado River just outside
Arches National Park and about 50 miles south of the land being returned to the
Utes.
</P>
<P>
	   A study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that toxins such as
arsenic and ammonia are leaching from the pile and contaminating the river,
threatening endangered fish.
</P>
<P>
	   California lawmakers also have raised concerns that the contamination is
tainting drinking water used by people in Arizona, Nevada and Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver-based Atlas Corp., the company that operated the mine from 1962 to
1984, has declared bankruptcy, leaving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
clean up the pile. The cleanup bond Atlas left behind was woefully inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   The NRC planned to cover the tailings with an earthen cap and drain 500
million gallons of water from the pile. But state and federal officials and
environmentalists argued that would not stop contamination. They pressed the
Energy Department to take control of the pile and move it 18 miles north of
Moab.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a huge breakthrough, and we're very heartened,'' said Bill Hedden,
chairman of the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group that had sued to have
the tailings moved.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the agreement, the Utes pledged to protect a quarter-mile
corridor along 75 miles of the Green River. The tribe also has agreed to abide
by federal protections for wild horses on the land.

<HEADLINE> Albright's Mexico Trip a Mystery  </HEADLINE>
   By LISA J. ADAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) -- When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
arrives in this quaint tourist capital famous for its colonial architecture and
Indian ruins, there will be no billion-dollar aid proposal to discuss as there
was in Colombia, nor any important canal handover to review as in Panama.
</P>
<P>
	   But on this, the third stop in her three-day Latin American visit, Albright
does have an opportunity to tie up loose ends in the Clinton administration's
relationship with its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright and Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green, who will meet Sunday,
had a close working relationship when the two of them were at the United Nations
several years ago. But there was a ``clear distancing'' between them when
Albright didn't attend last year's meeting, said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a
Mexican-U.S. relations specialist at Mexico City's private Autonomous Technical
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have gotten together very little,'' Fernandez said. Albright has not
directed much attention to Mexican issues, nor Green to U.S. issues, he said.
``So it is very interesting to see in this difficult climate the two are getting
together.''
</P>
<P>
	   But what they'll talk about is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican Foreign Relations secretariat said it had no statement to
release, while a U.S. Embassy spokesman referred inquiries to the State
Department's Internet Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   A synopsis of Albright's trip on the site cryptically stated that her
meetings would focus on ``ongoing discussions and review of this crucial
bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have a high official stopping in an important country for the U.S. and
it's not very clear what the purpose is,'' said John Bailey, a Mexican
specialist and government professor at Georgetown University in Washington.
``Usually there's some kind of leadup to it with some announcements and some
expectations created, so this is either peculiar or careless ... or both.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico's government news agency Notimex reported that Albright would review
``the most important themes in the bilateral relationship, such as drug
trafficking, immigration and commerce.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's trip comes after opposition politicians stymied Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo's planned White House visit in December, which was to involve
discussions on trade, drug trafficking and immigration. Six months ago, Albright
was absent from a meeting of the Binational Commission on U.S.-Mexico relations
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Now with both countries on the verge of presidential elections, Bailey said
their governments are dealing with other issues. ``So I would be surprised if
there was something really important that got talked about'' by their top
diplomats, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Panama, where Albright stops off today for several hours, officials see
the visit as an attempt by the top U.S. diplomat to make amends for skipping a
ceremony in December for the handover of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright canceled plans to attend the Dec. 14 event here because of Middle
East peace talks in Washington. President Clinton had earlier said he could not
attend the ceremony marking the end of a 96-year U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in Panama believe U.S. officials avoided the ceremony because of
conservative opposition to the transfer of the canal to Panamanian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since she did not come for political reasons, she is coming now to repair
the damage,'' said former Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter.
</P>
<P>
	   During today's six hour visit, Albright will visit the canal's Miraflores
Locks and hold talks over dinner with President Mireya Moscoso.

<HEADLINE> Political cartoonist sues for $10 million over botched surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Ranan Lurie's cartoonist career began sixty years ago,
taking him from his homeland in Israel onto the pages of The New York Times and
more than 1,000 other newspapers.
<P>
	   But the world's most widely published political cartoonist claims a botched
surgical procedure on his hand has left him crippled and cut his cartoon output
in half. Because of the damage to his hand, Lurie filed a $10 million lawsuit
against the doctor on Thursday in Manhattan State Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie, 67, said the operation on his right hand left his pinkie finger
curved inward, making drawing awkward and painful.
</P>
<P>
	   His work appeared in The New York Times when he was 21, while he was cited
by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most widely syndicated
political cartoonist. In 1993, he appeared in 1,018 newspapers in 79 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, Lurie injured a ligament his right pinkie while in
an airport in Seoul, South Korea, in 1997. He consulted Dr. Richard G. Eaton
after a friend, New York Yankees pitcher David Cone, recommended the doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   The cartoonist checked into the C.V. Starr Hand Surgery Center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital on Aug. 29, 1997, where Eaton performed surgery on the
swollen hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the hour-long operation, done under a local anesthetic, Lurie
said, "I was left on my own. I didn't get any therapy afterward. The finger
stiffened so that it formed an inward circle, a very sharp crescent."
</P>
<P>
	   When he returned to Eaton, Lurie said, "He didn't know what to do. He
recommended to me that it be amputated and I almost fainted. He tried to
convince me that it would be a good thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie said other physicians opposed amputating the finger, and Dr. Andrew
Weiland eventually operated a second time, relatively successfully.
</P>
<P>
	   "The end result is that the finger can move," said Lurie. "It's obviously
damaged, but I'm limited in what I can do. I used to do eight to 10 cartoons a
week; now I can hardly do four. I used to paint my cartoons; now I use a
computer."
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, Lurie said Eaton was "negligent" and the surgery was
"inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
	   "(Lurie's) livelihood is entirely dependent upon his use of his right hand,
which he has used during his entire professional career to draw political
cartoons and caricatures," court papers say.
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie said that apart from his right hand, "My health is A-1."
</P>
<P>
	   Annie Ting, the manager of the hand surgery center, said only Eaton could
comment on Lurie's lawsuit and he is out of town until Jan. 24.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of E.Timorese Turn Violent  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Thousands of East Timorese scrambling to apply for
U.N. jobs threw rocks at international peacekeepers and police officers in the
capital Saturday after their applications were rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Many U.N. administrative officials took shelter behind walls, while about 70
U.N. civilian police and foreign peacekeepers protected them.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying rocks injured an Australian soldier with the peacekeepers and a
television cameraman.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd of about 7,000 people had been waiting at Dili's main sports
stadium since dawn to apply for 2,000 or so jobs with the United Nations, which
has a two to three-year mandate to prepare East Timor for self-government.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployment is chronic in East Timor, after militia gangs devastated much
of the country's infrastructure in suppressing the territory's movement for
independence from Indonesia. Tens of thousands of people are living in tents and
makeshift huts, and lack the money to rebuild their ruined homes.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.N. official said on condition of anonymity that many of the applicants
became angry when told they needed at least a basic understanding of English,
which some didn't have. Indonesian and Portuguese are mainly spoken in East
Timor, along with the local language, Tetum.
</P>
<P>
	   About an hour after the violence started, Nobel Peace laureate Jose
Ramos-Horta arrived at the stadium and appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To come here and see people using violence makes me feel ashamed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But one East Timorese man interrupted, calling out that he was being treated
unfairly despite having fought 24 years for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   The peacekeepers dispersed the crowd after U.N. officials postponed its job
interview program by a week.
</P>
<P>
	   East Timor overwhelming voted in an Aug. 30 U.N.-supervised referendum to
break away from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations took over the administration of the territory, a former
Portuguese colony, after the peacekeepers arrived on Sept. 20.

	   That he did reflects well on Vermeil, whose Rams take a 13-3 record, the
best in the NFC, into Sunday's playoff game with the Vikings (11-6).
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no question how good a job Dick has done with the Rams," Green
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a 180 percent turnaround from last year to this year," added Rams
linebacker London Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's Rams were 5-11, then 4-12 in his first two seasons after a 14-year
hiatus from coaching. Questions of whether Vermeil, 63, could still handle the
rigors of coaching -- he left the NFL in 1982 with burnout -- dominated summer
talk.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil adapted, making changes in staff, players and style. And the Rams
now have the inside track to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I talked to Bill Parcells on Wednesday," Vermeil said. "He said, 'I'm
excited to see our generation of coaches experience success.' (Colts coach) Jim
Mora and myself, and the way he experienced success a year ago and finished so
strong this year. He says it proves the old way isn't a bad way, and I agree
with him. We aren't done yet."
</P>
<P>
	   While Vermeil's job security was minimal before the season, Green didn't
have such worries heading into 1999 -- for the first time in a long while. Each
year, his Vikings would get to the postseason, then underachieve.
</P>
<P>
	   But last year's 15-1 mark and record-setting offense eliminated talk of
Green's job being in jeopardy. Then the Vikings started the season 2-4.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think our guys played hard," Green said. "I never had any question about
our guys' attitude. I just don't think we were playing as clean a game as we
should have been playing. When you're playing Tampa Bay and Detroit and Green
Bay, those are teams that you play twice every year. They have a great
understanding of how they want to play you. If you make a few mistakes, they can
beat you.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been around long enough to know not to panic. You either know your
team or you don't."
</P>
<P>
	   Green knew enough to bench Randall Cunningham for Jeff George at
quarterback. He also knew that if he relied on his stars, they would begin
coming through.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota won five in row.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went 8-2 down the stretch and we won our last three games," he said. "In
the history of the Vikings, I don't know how many times we won three consecutive
games at the end of the regular season."
</P>
<P>
	   It's five times, but now they have won four straight after the 27-10 playoff
victory against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know him personally, but I do as a coach," Vermeil said of Green,
whose games Vermeil occasionally broadcast while Vermeil worked for ABC and
Green was coaching Stanford. "He has done a great job at Minnesota. He is a
leader within the coaches' organization and with his role on the competition
committee. Everybody in the profession has a lot of respect for Dennis Green."
</P>
<P>
	   If Vermeil lost some of his players' respect, he quickly recaptured it this
year. Success -- and a slightly less intense approach -- will do that.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always know where you're coming from with coach Vermeil," defensive end
Grant Wistrom said. "He's never going to beat around the bush with you and
everybody appreciates that he's so straightforward with you. It is kind of nice.
You see so many coaches who are so stoic, and you know when he's excited and
when he's upset. He's not too difficult to read."

<HEADLINE> US Students Learn, Help in Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Guided by a Vietnam War veteran, the State
University of New York is sending students into the heart of former enemy
territory to study and join community projects to aid street children, flood
victims and lepers.
</P>
<P>
	   None among the first batch of seven students were alive when the war ended
in 1975. But their adventure will serve as one small step in ``closing the
circle on the war,'' said Kenneth Herrmann Jr., a professor of social work at
State University College at Brockport.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann, an infantry sergeant who helped resettle refugees in central
Vietnam during a one-year tour of duty in 1968-69, said the
residential-education program he developed is the only overseas project of its
kind in Vietnam mixing academic study and community service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Vietnamese have made it very clear to me they think the time is
opportune now, on the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, to heal wounds
that have not yet been healed,'' Herrmann said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've also made it clear the only way to do that is through youth,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
	   One graduate and four undergraduate students from the State University of
New York, plus two students from the University of Maryland and Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania, are to depart today for a four-month semester in Da
Nang in central Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it will not be plush or easygoing, but that's the attraction,''
Jessica Morris, 22, a SUNY graduate completing a master's degree at American
University, told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. ``This is not a tourist
deal. This will be a real immersion in the culture and the society.''
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY network of public universities around New York will operate three
semesters a year in Da Nang.
</P>
<P>
	   Students will attend classes and seminars at the University of Da Nang, the
Duy Tan People-Founded University or the School of Politics in Da Nang, and
assist instructors in teaching English.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four days a week, their community work will include developing
activities for homeless children, creating a festival for a leprosy colony and
distributing food and clothing to nearby mountain villages ravaged by flooding
late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Herrmann wants to bring poor students from the region to study
in Brockport, 25 miles west of Rochester, and create a distance-learning
curriculum linking Da Nang with Brockport.
</P>
<P>
	   At his wife's urging, Herrmann made his first trip back to Vietnam in 1998
to carry out research into illegal adoptions there. He revisited the village of
Hiep Duc, 35 miles southwest of Da Nang, where he had served as a liaison
between the 196th Light Infantry and U.S.-allied South Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Da Nang was the scene of the initial U.S. military buildup in 1965 and, by
the end of the decade, Herrmann said the region ``saw the heaviest fighting of
the war.'' The two countries normalized diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising money from foundations and corporations to support the academic
program has been a struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, Vietnam is still a word that's connected with a war, not a
country,'' Herrmann said.

<HEADLINE> China Quakes Kill 4, Injure 220  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Two earthquakes collapsed about 4,000 buildings in southwest
China on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring 220, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yao'an County, in province of Yunnan, was first hit by a 6.0-magnitude quake
that sent people scurrying out of their homes in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1 1/2 hours later, the county was hit by an even stronger aftershock,
of 6.5 magnitude, said a county seismologist who gave only his surname, Su.
</P>
<P>
	   Four people were killed, said a Yunnan government seismologist, surnamed Wu,
without specifying how they died. Another 220 were injured and 4,000 buildings
collapsed, said the State Seismology Bureau in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   The main compound of Yao'an's government headquarters was seriously damaged,
and power in the area was cut, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   The authorities and media did not specify which tremor caused which damages
and injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the town of Guantun, 18 miles from Yao'an, the early morning quakes woke
tens of thousands of people and sent residents flocking into the streets, Xinhua
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong tremor also was felt in the provincial capital Kunming, about 125
miles to the east of Yao'an, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yao'an was also hit by a 6.5-magnitude quake in 1962, and a 5.6-magnitude
quake on August 14, 1993, Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> 'Common Cold' Virus Drug Is Near  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EXTON, Pa. (AP) -- Certainly a cure for the common cold would be a big story
all by itself. But how about a medicine that also stops viral meningitis? The
summer flu? Deadly newborn infections? Even polio?
</P>
<P>
	   One drug that does all this is surprisingly close. It is called pleconaril,
and if large-scale testing turns out well, it could be in drugstores within a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pleconaril (pronounced plah-CONN-ah-rill) is the latest in a short list of
medicines that kill viruses. This drug, in fact, blocks an entire category of
them, a collection of 169 distinctly different nasties that together cause more
human disease than any other.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost as remarkable as what pleconaril does, however, is how it came to be.
This drug was not so much discovered as designed. Developers worked their way
through 1,500 different versions of pleconaril before settling on the one now in
human testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Once drug development was a kind of organized serendipity, screening
thousands of random compounds to see what happens. But over the past decade, a
quiet series of breakthroughs has transformed the way drugs are developed. Now
scientists explore the shape and innards of their target right down to the last
molecule. Then they fashion chemical monkey wrenches to throw into the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Pleconaril is the latest, and one of the most impressive, examples of this
new way of creating medicines. It is an exquisitely precise sort of monkey
wrench. The drug fits neatly into a groove on the surface of the virus, gumming
up the machinery it needs to infect the body's cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts believe the same research techniques will lead to treatments for
many other kinds of viruses, predators that are still mostly beyond the powers
of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pleconaril represents a class of drugs that were designed with the
knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the virus," says Dr. Catherine
Laughlin, chief of virology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases. "It provides a lot of hope for the eventual design of drugs for
virtually every viral infection."
</P>
<P>
	   Pleconaril is made by ViroPharma Inc., a 5-year-old, 102-employee
pharmaceutical firm in the Philadelphia suburbs. The publicly traded company is
sponsoring two large studies, due out in the spring, that will determine whether
the drug works well enough to win Food and Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The company wants to get the drug approved first for viral meningitis, but
it is the common cold -- the most prosaic of infections -- that is likely to be
the medicine's biggest market. "Everyone talks about the cure for the common
cold," says Dr. Jose Romero of Creighton University in Nebraska, who has tested
the drug on patients. "This IS the cure for the common cold." Some might quibble
over that word. "Cure," after all, implies that pleconaril will make the
sniffles evaporate instantly, which it won't. Still, the research indicates the
medicine can shorten a bad cold by three or four days and help people feel
considerably less miserable along the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Pleconaril does this by disabling the rhinovirus, the most common human
virus. But that's just the start.
</P>
<P>
	   It also neutralizes the second most common human virus, the enterovirus.
Various versions of enteroviruses cause an amazingly broad range of illnesses:
lingering summer colds, head-splitting meningitis, childhood fevers,
inflammation of the heart, polio, plus overwhelming infections that sometimes
kill newborns.
</P>
<P>
	   One drug can stop both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses because they are close
cousins, members of a large family called the picornaviruses.
</P>
<P>
	   "There have been a number of anti-picornavirus agents over the past 25
years, but they've had all sorts of problems," notes Dr. Mark Pallansch, an
enterovirus expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"Pleconaril is the first true, viable product that is potentially licensable."
</P>
<P>
	   ViroPharma estimates that every year, Americans get between 400 million and
500 million picornavirus infections that are serious enough to make them feel
bad. It plans to charge between $50 and $100 for enough medicine to cure one
infection.
</P>
<P>
	   You do the math.
</P>
<P>
	   Certainly other drug makers have. However, only one other company appears to
be close to ViroPharma for now. Agouron Pharmaceuticals, a part of
Warner-Lambert Co., is experimenting this fall on 900 cold victims to see if its
nasal spray, code named AG7088, will speed their recovery. Agouron's drug is a
protease inhibitor, a lot like the ones that revolutionized AIDS treatment, but
is intended only for colds. And that ailment is the least of the reasons why
many doctors are so enthusiastic about pleconaril.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 2,000 people ranging in age from 84 to under a week have taken
pleconaril. Almost all of them have been in formal studies of viral meningitis
or colds, neither of which is a dire illness in otherwise healthy people.
</P>
<P>
	   However, enterovirus infections are occasionally medical emergencies. Over
the past two years, the FDA has allowed the company to dispense pleconaril
outside of organized experiments for infections that are life-threatening or
especially gruesome.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, nearly 100 people have been treated this way, often with seemingly
spectacular results. Doctors say these back-from-the-almost-dead anecdotes offer
some of the most impressive hints of the drug's potency. Among the apparent
success stories are Carter and Skyler Stephens, twins born September 9, 1998 in
Topeka, Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   Everything seemed fine until four days after their birth. The boys' mother,
Lisa Stephens, woke at 4 a.m. to nurse Carter. He wouldn't eat and had a boiling
fever. The parents took his temperature -- a scary 104 -- and raced to the
emergency room. By then, Carter was having trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hours later, he was flown to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.
But things only got worse. Now Skyler, who was also at the hospital with his
mother, wouldn't eat, either. Suddenly, he stopped breathing and had to be
revived. So Skyler caught the next evacuation flight to Kansas City, right
behind his brother.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mom and I drove to Kansas City," Mrs. Stephens remembers. "That was on
the 13th, the worst and longest day in the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The problem eventually turned out to be overwhelming enterovirus infection.
This is a mercifully rare condition, but it can happen if a mother catches the
virus late in pregnancy and unknowingly passes it to her baby. Uncontrolled by
the newborn's immature immune system, the virus may eventually attack the liver,
the heart and other organs. There has been no treatment, and the death rate is
high, somewhere between 40 percent and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the next three days in intensive care, the babies' blood counts dropped,
and they received transfusions. Spinal taps found the virus in their central
nervous systems. This was especially worrisome, because there it can lead to
brain damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, do nothing for viral infections. Then
someone mentioned an experimental antiviral drug that might help.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know how, but one of the doctors had heard of pleconaril," says
Mrs. Stephens. "It was some sort of a miracle. On Wednesday they gave them the
drug. The next day we saw improvement. They were awake five minutes out of the
whole day, but it was improvement. Friday they were awake a little more, and
Saturday they were taken off oxygen."
</P>
<P>
	   The next Monday, the babies were sent home, and "since then, they are just
perfectly healthy, normal guys," the mother says.
</P>
<P>
	   About two-thirds of the babies like these getting pleconaril have survived,
even though many were desperately ill before treatment started.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug has also been given to adults with defective immune systems who
suffer enterovirus brain infections that simply will not go away. The usual
course is inexorably downhill. Doctors say some of these people have fully
recovered after a few days of pleconaril. Their symptoms go away, leaving no
trace of the virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have also successfully treated people with myocarditis, an
inflammation that can destroy the heart, and with polio, which is also caused by
an enterovirus. Overall, doctors estimate that about three-quarters of these
emergency cases appear to have benefited from pleconaril.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of these patients had been ill for years, and they appeared to improve
with seven to 10 days of treatment," says Dr. Harley Rotbart of the University
of Colorado Health Science Center. "Without overstating the results, I am very
encouraged."
</P>
<P>
	   Compelling as these cases are, they actually prove little about pleconaril's
worth. Even the sickest enterovirus victim may spontaneously recover. For proof,
the FDA requires large, carefully designed experiments to compare the medicine
with standard care.
</P>
<P>
	   ViroPharma hopes first to prove that pleconaril cures viral meningitis. This
common infection, which doctors sometimes called aseptic meningitis, is an
inflammation of the covering of the brain and spine. Bacteria can also cause it,
but vaccinations have made that form of meningitis rare.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC estimates that about 50,000 Americans are hospitalized each year
with viral meningitis, but perhaps 500,000 actually get it, many of them
probably riding it out at home without seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond painkillers, there is little a doctor can offer. Even though rarely
fatal, this is a miserable disease. Many feel desperately ill with pounding
headaches, stiff necks, fever and nausea.
</P>
<P>
	   Small studies on victims of viral meningitis certainly have looked
promising. One of them suggests the drug begins to ease headaches within a day.
People felt completely back to normal within seven days, compared with nine days
in those getting dummy pills.
</P>
<P>
	   The results of two large meningitis studies on adults and adolescents are
expected in the spring. If they turn out as ViroPharma hopes, research director
Mark A. McKinlay says, the company will immediately seek approval to sell the
drug. With a speedy FDA review, this could put a liquid form of pleconaril on
the market by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Next would come a pleconaril pill, intended for treating colds, that the
company hopes to sell in 2001. ViroPharma estimates Americans make between 30
million and 36 million doctor visits a year for colds, making this the most
common medical complaint doctors hear. But the fact is, doctors can do nothing
for the common cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that this stops them from trying.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates vary, but doctors prescribe antibiotics for perhaps half of all
cold victims they see. These drugs will not cure colds. Except in the rare cases
where people have bacterial complications, they do nothing to ease the symptoms.
They are just expensive placeboes. Yet one recent study found that 12 percent of
all antibiotic prescriptions for children are for colds.
</P>
<P>
	   All of this suggests that if pleconaril actually does something to ease a
cold, it will be avidly prescribed. The results of cold studies so far suggest
it may truly help.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first of these, doctors intentionally infected intrepid volunteers
with coxsackie virus, a kind of enterovirus that causes an especially obnoxious
cold. Treatment began the day before they were exposed to the bug. Thirteen
percent on pleconaril developed colds, compared with 65 percent taking dummy
pills.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers actually weighed the volunteers' nasal drippings. The averages:
10 grams of gook daily for the unlucky placebo folks, one gram for those taking
pleconaril.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the first evidence that a medicine could change the course of a
cold. But it was hardly a fair test. After all, most people will not take drugs
in advance to ward off a cold.
</P>
<P>
	   So Dr. Frederick G. Hayden of the University of Virginia tested pleconaril's
effects on victims of garden-variety sniffles. Just over 1,000 who went to
doctors with fresh colds agreed to be randomly put on pleconaril or placeboes.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on pleconaril got better an average 3 1/2 days sooner, plus their
colds were less severe. This time the researchers counted tissues. On day 2 of
treatment, those on pleconaril blew their nose half as much as those on the
dummy medicine. By day 3, they felt 40 percent better than the others.
</P>
<P>
	   "Up until this point, there has been no proven antiviral therapy of
documented effectiveness in common cold treatment," says Hayden.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Hayden began another comparison study to accumulate the kind
of detailed data needed by the FDA to decide whether to approve pleconaril pills
for cold.
</P>
<P>
	   If that study pans out and the pills are approved, they will almost
certainly be used for more than colds. For instance, experts expect they will
work on what are called summer colds or summer flu. This is not really the flu
but a bad, lingering, often feverish cold that hits in the summer or fall.
Enteroviruses are a frequent culprit.
</P>
<P>
	   The same viruses are also the most common cause of vague summertime fevers
in children. "These are hot babies and toddlers who fill emergency rooms
everywhere in the country beginning in late May and going through October," said
Rotbart.
</P>
<P>
	   While the fever goes away in time, children under age 2 are usually
hospitalized to rule out more serious bacterial causes of their temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Before any drug is routinely given to millions of mildly ill people,
however, the FDA must be convinced it is extremely safe. In testing so far,
pleconaril seems to be free of side effects. Problems like upset stomachs happen
just as often in people on dummy pills as in those getting the drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Laughlin says if pleconaril does do rare unwanted things, they may not be
noticed until it is already in wide use. But since the drug thwarts a biological
process that is unique to viruses, human ill effects are unlikely, at least in
theory.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually the major problem with antiviral drugs is safety," she says.
"Viruses subvert cells for their own uses. It's hard to find something that
kills the virus and doesn't kill the cell. This drug is targeted at something
that is unique to viruses. There are no similar cellular processes in the body.
But you never know."

<HEADLINE> Drug Researchers Form Own Company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EXTON, Pa. (AP) -- The inevitable layoffs began six years ago when a
European company bought Sterling Winthrop's prescription drug business, and
among those to go were the team developing pleconaril.
</P>
<P>
	   This was not because the new owner, the French firm Sanofi Pharmaceuticals,
thought the drug worthless. Pleconaril was already in early-stage human testing,
and while no sure thing, all the indications looked good. But the company's
expertise was in heart disease and other areas, and it had no interest in
developing drugs for infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other drug companies would like to have taken over pleconaril. But
eventually, Sanofi decided to turn the drug over to the Sterling scientists who
had been working on it for years.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fought very hard," said Mark A. McKinlay, a virologist who directed
pleconaril work at Sterling. "No one will give it more of their energy than we
will. They gave us a chance. The rest is history."
</P>
<P>
	   Ten former Sterling scientists formed the research core of ViroPharma, which
paid Sanofi $1 million for U.S. and Canadian rights to the drug. More payments
will follow if the drug wins final approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Proving a drug safe and effective is hugely expensive, and so far,
ViroPharma has spent more than $50 million, most of it raised from venture
capital firms and stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanofi is likely to benefit from ViroPharma's research, since it still has
the right to sell pleconaril outside of North America.

<HEADLINE> Discovery of Viral Makeup Spurs Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EXTON, Pa. (AP) -- The viruses responsible for most colds and meningitis are
icosahedrons. But that is just one of the things no one knew in the early 1980s
when the search began for a cure.
</P>
<P>
	   Icosahedrons? For the non-geometry whizzes among you, that's a 20-sided
solid.
</P>
<P>
	   The quest for the drug that eventually became pleconaril started the
old-fashioned way, with no clue to what rhinoviruses and enteroviruses look
like. Chemists at Sterling Winthrop Inc. tested thousands of off-the-shelf
chemicals against the rhinovirus to see if any of them did anything.
</P>
<P>
	   It turned out that one of them seemed to slow down a few of the 101
different varieties of rhinovirus, but it was not very potent. The work inched
along until a big breakthrough in 1985: Michael Rossmann of Purdue University
led a team that mapped the three-dimensional structure of the cold virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, Sterling scientists knew what their target looked like, and it
quickly became apparent what their research drug was doing.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20 sides of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are dented by a meandering
crater. Inside the crater is the precise spot where the virus squirts its genes
into the cells it infects so it can make new copies of itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug plugs up this crater, acting like a key broken off in a lock.
Unable to pull away its outer coat and insert its genes, the bug is harmless.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, the scientists learned that the outside of the virus has 60
spots where pleconaril can potentially lock on. At least five of these need to
be filled with the drug to stop the virus from infecting.
</P>
<P>
	   Knowing how the drug should work, the scientists could begin what's called
rational drug design. They tinkered with the molecule every which way to make it
fit perfectly into the slot. Since the cavern varies in size between viruses,
they settled on an average size plug that would nicely fit them all.
</P>
<P>
	   They fiddled with the drug some more to make it resist quick breakdown in
the bloodstream. Since no animals get colds, they decided to test it first on
mice to see if it would protect them from the polio virus, a form of
enterovirus.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten mice got pleconaril. Ten did not. All the pleconaril mice remained
healthy, while the rest were paralyzed and died. This was the first clear
evidence that the drug actually stops these viruses in living things.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, the French drug firm Sanofi bought Sterling and stopped the
pleconaril research. Several Sterling employees formed ViroPharma Inc., bought
U.S. and Canadian rights to pleconaril and continued development of the drug.

Thousands of East Timorese Turn Violent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Thousands of East Timorese scrambling to apply for
U.N. jobs threw rocks at international peacekeepers and police officers in the
capital Saturday after their applications were rejected. Many U.N.
administrative officials took shelter behind walls, while about 70 U.N. civilian
police and foreign peacekeepers protected them. The crowd of about 7,000 people
had been waiting at Dili's main sports stadium since dawn to apply for 2,000 or
so jobs with the United Nations, which has a two to three-year mandate to
prepare East Timor for self-government. Unemployment is chronic in East Timor,
after militia gangs devastated much of the country's infrastructure in
suppressing the territory's movement for independence from Indonesia.

Air Force Scraps Rocket Launch

	   VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- Officials scrubbed the launch of
an Air Force rocket that was primed to carry nearly a dozen tiny satellites into
space late Friday after low voltage was detected in on-board batteries. Liftoff
of the Orbital Suborbital Program rocket was canceled at 9:40 p.m. PST, just 14
minutes before the close of its launch window. The launch was rescheduled for
Jan. 22. Before the cancellation, takeoff had been delayed at least three times
due to a glitch in the system that commands the countdown, said U.S. Air Force

Cuban Mothers March for Elian's Return

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Rows upon rows of Cuban mothers -- hundreds visibly pregnant,
others carrying small children -- marched along a seaside boulevard in Havana on
Friday as Fidel Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women
participated in what it called the "March of the Combatant Mothers." Elian, the
boy at the center of the international dispute, was found clinging to an inner
tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others
died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been staying with
relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Colts, Titans Have Few Veterans  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis tight end Ken Dilger, at 27 years old,
will be the oldest starter on offense when the Colts play host to the Tennessee
Titans on Sunday at the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   No, there's not a lot of experience in this matchup of two teams with six
losses between them.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts have 13 wins and the Titans 14, the extra win being the "Music
City Miracle," that 22-16 wild-card victory over Buffalo decided by Kevin
Dyson's kickoff return after taking a lateral from Frank Wycheck.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a time when our veterans have to step up," said Colts quarterback
Peyton Manning, one of many stars on both sides in their first playoff season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a learning experience for us and the only way to learn is to go
out there and play and experience it."
</P>
<P>
	   The problem for the Colts is that those veterans are primarily on defense.
Not only that, but Cornelius Bennett, who's played in five Super Bowls with the
Bills and Falcons, will miss this game with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans are a little more experienced.
</P>
<P>
	   They have eight players back from the Houston Oilers team of 1993, the last
time the itinerant franchise made the playoffs. And they have nine more who had
postseason experience with other teams.
</P>
<P>
	   And, of course, they all played last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The most experienced Titans player is one of the most experienced in NFL
history -- 38-year-old guard Bruce Matthews, who this season set an NFL career
record for games by an offensive lineman with 264. He has 11 playoff starts,
including last week, more than any player on either team but Bennett, who has
played in 20 postseason games.
</P>
<P>
	   But a lot of players on both teams don't think that matters much given their
big-game college experience.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans start two rookies on the defensive line -- Jevon Kearse, the
former Florida star who was defensive rookie of the year and an All-Pro and John
Thornton, their second-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jevon played for a national championship every year," said Thornton, who
played at West Virginia. "We have a whole lot of guys that come from winning
programs in college."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts, meanwhile, have a small group of veterans left from the 1995 and
'96 playoff teams, including Dilger, defensive linemen Bernard Whittington and
Ellis Johnson, and safety Jason Belser. The other starters in the secondary also
have playoff experience -- Jeff Burris with Buffalo and Tyrone Poole and Chad
Cota with Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   That seems to make Sunday's game a wash in terms of experience, or lack of
it. That doesn't make it very different from the rest of this weekend's four
games in the Super Bowl countdown.
</P>
<P>
	   "I read in the paper where there's not much fan interest because the Denvers
and the Dallases and the 49ers and teams like that are not playing now, but I'm
not sure that's right," Indianapolis coach Jim Mora said. "We have fans.
Tennessee has fans. The Rams have fans. People want these teams to win, too. So
I think it's good. I think it's great.
</P>
<P>
	   Mora himself has some playoff experience, all of it bad -- he was 0-4 in 10
seasons in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   "That makes no difference," Mora says. "I'd feel the same way about this
game if I was 4-0. This is one you want to win for the team."

<HEADLINE> Tables Turned on Vikings  </HEADLINE>
    By ARNIE STAPLETON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The talk was familiar, the source foreign.
</P>
<P>
	   The spirited discussion in the locker room was all about the opponent's
high-octane, quick-strike offense with its Pro-Bowl studded cast of superstars
and how to best confront such a multitude of ability.
</P>
<P>
	   Only this time, it was the Minnesota Vikings doing the talking.
</P>
<P>
	   "You definitely want to control the ball as much as you can, keep it away
from an offense like that," running back Robert Smith said of the powerful St.
Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams' offense is led by MVP Kurt Warner, the second player in history to
throw 40 or more touchdown passes; Offensive Player of the Year Marshall Faulk,
the second player ever to post both 1,000 yards receiving and rushing; and Pro
Bowl receiver Isaac Bruce.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever you have weapons like they have, you want to keep them off the
field," Vikings quarterback Jeff George said.
</P>
<P>
	   The best way for the fastbreak Vikings to do that is by running the ball,
and Minnesota (11-6) at long last has the means to chew up yards and time when
its faces the top-seeded Rams (13-3) in the Trans World Dome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who rushed for a team playoff-record 148 yards against Dallas last
Sunday, will do his best to keep Warner &AMP; Co. on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
	   But he'll be facing the NFL's top-ranked rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're just going to have to go out and play them like we can play," coach
Dennis Green said. "They're very good against the run. They have outstanding
people. We never go in trying to establish one specific area. If we can throw
the ball and win, we will. If we can run the ball and win, we will.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't go in with anything other than we like to have balance."
</P>
<P>
	   That's exactly what the pass-happy Vikings have now that they've ditched
much of their multiple receiver sets for a standard two-receiver, two-tight end
formation.
</P>
<P>
	   Four times in the last five weeks, the Vikings, who have 26 touchdown
receptions between Randy Moss and Cris Carter, have run more than they've
passed.
</P>
<P>
	   During that span, Smith has averaged 111 yards on 21 carries for a 5.2-yard
average.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't remember any stretch in my career where I've gotten the ball 20, 25
times so many games in a row," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has fully recovered from a double hernia operation that slowed him
early in the season and cost him three games. His signature cutback and
breakaway abilities are there again as he's averaging nearly 5 yards per carry
since returning in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
	   That will be crucial if the Vikings hope to overcome the Rams' explosive
offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Vikings backup defensive tackle Joe Phillips played in St. Louis last year
and said he wasn't surprised by Warner's rags-to-riches season.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was on scout team last year and he showed just a lot of accuracy and
great vision," Phillips said. "It was difficult for us to stop him."
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips even told Warner that he reminded him of another great passer he'd
played with early in his career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him he kind of reminded me of Dan Fouts," said Phillips, only adding
to the raves about the Rams' exceptional artillery.

<HEADLINE> Tom Donahoe Resigns From Steelers  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Finally, after two seasons of offseason friction and
on-field failures, the Pittsburgh Steelers decided Tom Donahoe or Bill Cowher
had to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Donahoe went.
</P>
<P>
	   In a remarkable development that caught even team employees by surprise,
Donahoe resigned under pressure as director of football operations Friday after
the Steelers decided he and Cowher could no longer work together.
</P>
<P>
	   The Steelers promised change following their worst season in 11 years, but
this is a transition virtually nobody predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Cowher keeps his job despite a 13-19 record the last two seasons and 15
losses in 21 games. But Donahoe, one of the NFL's most respected talent
evaluators, is out.
</P>
<P>
	   The ouster -- the Steelers called it a resignation, but it essentially was a
firing -- would be a major development in any NFL city. But it was a stunning
one for a stable organization that has had two coaches in 31 years and never had
a general manager until Donahoe took the job, except in title, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were aware there was tension and, to some extent it's natural and it's
healthy," said team vice president Art Rooney II, a lawyer named for the
Steelers' founder. "But when it gets to the point where communications don't
exist ... and the organization can function, that's when tension crosses the
line into something that doesn't work anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   Cowher and Donahoe each offered to resign following a 6-10 season, and team
president Dan Rooney initially weighed alternatives under which both would stay.
</P>
<P>
	   But after opting against bringing in a middle man or restructuring the front
office, the Steelers accepted Donahoe's resignation, only two days after
announcing Cowher would remain as coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "We looked at shuffling some things around and bringing somebody else in to
serve as a go-between, but we came to the conclusion that was putting a Band-Aid
on something we felt wouldn't work," said Art Rooney II, who is Dan Rooney's son
and heir apparent. "So we felt we had to go in this direction."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if the Steelers were forced to choose between the two, Art Rooney II
said, "In some ways, you could say we looked at it that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Further explaining the move, Dan Rooney said, "I'm not saying we're going to
the Super Bowl, but I confident Bill Cowher can take us there."
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe, a longtime high school coach who moved into the front office in
1986, drafted or traded for most of the players who led the Steelers to three
AFC title game appearances in four years from 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe drafted players such as Chad Brown, Levon Kirkland, Leon Searcy and
Joel Steed and swiped star running back Jerome Bettis for a fourth-round draft
pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of all, Donahoe fit in well with a franchise that has the leanest front
office in the NFL. In a league where power, big money and constant TV exposure
can easily inflate egos, he wouldn't allow his biography to be published in the
media guide. He had a temper, but he never showed it publicly as Cowher so
readily does on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Dan Rooney understands that Donahoe, who signed a 10-year contract only
two years ago, won't be out of a job long.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has opportunities in the NFL," said Dan Rooney, who has known Donahoe
since his high school days and once hired him as a training camp ballboy.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe, a lifelong Pittsburgh resident, turned down a big-money offer from
the Seattle Seahawks two years ago and was given a big pay raise and the new
contract. But his relationship with Cowher got only worse and so did the
Steelers' record, as their inability to retain star free agents led to their
first successive losing records since 1985-86.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe did not attend a hastily called news conference Friday night, but
issued a short statement: "Change is often necessary. In this particular
instance, the change involves me, which I believe will be positive not only for
the organization, but for myself as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Rooney said the Steelers' front office structure won't change and a
successor to Donahoe will be chosen as soon as possible. Cowher will not gain
any additional say in talent matters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Steelers do not have an obvious successor in place. Tom Modrak, who
worked for them for 20 years, left in 1998 to run the Philadelphia Eagles'
football operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Donahoe's successor is hired, front office staffers Dan Ferens and
Mark Hart will oversee plans for the free agent signing period that begins Feb.
11.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- If general managers could eliminate one day from the
calendar, it would be this one: the day players file for salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety players filed Friday, and the Colorado Rockies and New York Mets took
another step in their makeovers. In another deal, Cincinnati and Milwaukee
swapped outfielders in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to cut their huge payroll a bit, the Mets sent right-hander Masato
Yoshii to the Rockies for left-hander Bobby M. Jones and minor league
right-hander Lariel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   While getting rid of Yoshii's $3 million salary, the Mets doubled their
Bobby Joneses; they already have Bobby J. Jones, a 29-year-old right-hander. The
two faced each other last May 11, becoming the first starting pitchers to share
the same name in a major league game since April 16, 1899, when Cincinnati's
John B. Taylor met Chicago's John W. Taylor.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoshii, a 34-year-old right-hander, went 12-8 with a 4.40 ERA in 29 starts
and two relief appearances last season. Bobby M. Jones was 6-10 with a 6.33 ERA
in 20 starts and 10 relief appearances for the Rockies last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yoshii fits into the plan of what we want to do," said Rockies general
manager Dan O'Dowd, whose team heads to spring training with seven potential
starters. "We want a staff that throws strikes and doesn't defeat itself."
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati acquired Alex Ochoa from Milwaukee for Mark Sweeney and a player
to be named. Sweeney spent most of last season with Triple-A Indianapolis, while
Ochoa hit .300 with eight home runs and 40 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Alex gives us depth in the outfield," Reds general manager Jim Bowden said.
"Our bench is strong from the left side ... but since we lost Jeffrey Hammonds
in the Dante Bichette deal we needed a right-handed bat."
</P>
<P>
	   Unless they settle in the next few days, the players who filed for
arbitration Friday will swap figures with their teams Tuesday, as will first
baseman David Segui, who became a free agent after the season and then accepted
Toronto's arbitration offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Teams, especially the small-market clubs, dislike arbitration because they
have little control over what salaries they pay, forced to give their players
larger raises in many instances because of other settlements or arbitrators
decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona closer Matt Mantei agreed after the filing to a one-year deal worth
$2,831,000, nearly four times his $725,000 salary last year. And Montreal
right-hander Anthony Telford agreed to a $2 million, two-year deal that contains
a team option for 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Four players who had been eligible for arbitration, all right-handed
pitchers, agreed to one-year contracts before the filing: Oakland's Jason
Isringhausen ($825,000), Baltimore's Al Reyes ($620,00), Seattle's Frankie
Rodriguez ($580,000) and Tampa Bay's Jim Mecir ($350,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Among free agents, reliever Ricky Bottalico agreed to a $1.5 million,
one-year contract with the Kansas City Royals, right-hander Mike Morgan agreed
on a minor league contract with the Diamondbacks, infielder Dave Hollins agreed
to a minor league deal with the Devil Rays and infielder Jeff Huson got a minor
league contract from the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bottalico became a free agent Dec. 20 after the St. Louis Cardinals failed
to offer him a contract by the deadline. He was 3-7 with 20 saves last season,
but walked 49 in 73 1-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Fisk Wearing BoSox Cap into Hall  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Carlton Fisk had a simple request when he came to Fenway Park
after being elected to the baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said, 'Do you have a 7 3-8 (inch) hat? I think it would look pretty good
on me,"' Fisk told Boston general manager Dan Duquette on Friday, ending
speculation about whether he would wear a Red Sox or White Sox cap on his Hall
of Fame plaque.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to say that this has always been my favorite hat, and I will
be wearing this hat probably for the rest of my career," Fisk said, pulling the
blue wool cap with the red "B" over his head. "I think I've known for a long
time. It's not like a light bulb came on or I had a vision. I think this has
always been a part of me."
</P>
<P>
	   But that wasn't the only surprise of the day, because Duquette then told
Fisk that the team would retire the No. 27 the star catcher wore with the Red
Sox before an acrimonious split led him to finish his career in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think I met the criteria," said Fisk, who now works for the team
as a special assistant to Duquette. "It gives me goosebumps to think about it. I
didn't think it was at all possible."
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, the Red Sox said they would only retire a number for a player
who is in the Hall, spent more than 10 years with the team and finished his
career with Boston. When the last criterion raised eyebrows at the news
conference, Duquette said: "On the basis of him working for us, he's with the
club."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk's number will be retired during "Carlton Fisk Night," an August game to
be determined. It will be mounted onto the right-field roof facade with Ted
Williams' No. 9, Carl Yastrzemski's No. 8, Bobby Doerr's No. 4, Joe Cronin's No.
1 and the No. 42 all teams have retired in honor of Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a very, very elite club," Duquette said. "And that's what makes it
special."
</P>
<P>
	   As a child growing up in New Hampshire, Fisk said he and his friends played
home run derby in the fields, taking turns who would get to be Williams and
Doerr.
</P>
<P>
	   "Never in my wildest dreams did I think my number would go alongside
theirs," said Fisk, whose No. 72 has already been retired by the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk didn't expect any hard feelings in Chicago. But it was clear that he
still was angry at the organization that released him in 1993 at age 44 and then
wouldn't let him into the clubhouse when he came back to visit former teammates
before a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk caught the most games in major league history (2,226) and hit a record
351 of his 376 career home runs as catcher. He and former Cincinnati Reds star
Tony Perez will be inducted on July 23 during ceremonies at Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Fisk had been coy about which cap he would choose, most thought he
would go with the team where he had his greatest moment: his 12th-inning homer
that won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   The replay of Fisk waving frantically for the ball to stay fair, then
leaping when it struck the foul pole, is one of the sport's enduring images.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like this is where I'm supposed to be," said Fisk, a native
Englander who spent 13 years with the White Sox and only nine full seasons with
the Red Sox. "I'd like to think I spent more years in Boston than just the years
I was in uniform."

<TEXT>
<P>
	   The streaking New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers apparently got
caught looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Devils lost for the first time in 10 games, and the Flyers had a
six-game winning streak snapped Friday night, as the top two teams in the
Atlantic Division enter tonight's showdown in New Jersey on a down note.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Oates scored on a breakaway with 22.6 seconds left in overtime as the
Washington Capitals beat the Devils 3-2, snapping New Jersey's NHL-best
nine-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's frustrating to lose the game, we had the lead, and to lose it is
disappointing," said Devils defenseman Sheldon Souray, whose giveaway led to the
game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlanta, Norm Maracle, returning from an exile to the bench, stopped 26
shots and Dean Sylvester scored the only goal early in the third period as the
Thrashers beat Philadelphia 1-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia lost for the first time since Dec. 22 at New Jersey, going
6-0-1 the next seven games and winning four times on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "They (the Thrashers) worked hard and once they got their goal, they were
fired up," Flyers coach Roger Neilson said. "We had a lot of good chances,
really, but we just couldn't pull the trigger."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games, it was Florida 5, Carolina 1; Montreal 2, Buffalo 1; Toronto
3 Edmonton 2; and Anaheim 3, St. Louis 1.
</P>
<P>
	   At New Jersey, Oates' game-winner was set up when Souray broke his stick
while trying to keep the puck in the Capitals zone, allowing Oates to block his
weak pass and break in alone on Devils goalie Chris Terreri.
</P>
<P>
	   "As soon as I saw him go to his backhand, I took off hoping it would
bounce," Oates said. "Four-on-four you gamble a little bit and I just took off."
</P>
<P>
	   That left it to Terreri to save the Devils' nine-game unbeaten (7-0-2).
Oates skated patiently toward him and flipped the puck over his left shoulder
for his seventh goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Maracle was benched for five games after a 6-0 loss at Nashville on Dec. 30.
He spent the time working with goalie coach Bob Mason, improving the angle on
shooters and not flopping to the ice quite so often.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was huge for me," Maracle said. "I've been struggling the last couple
of weeks. ... Now, my confidence is back up and hopefully it will continue."
</P>
<P>
	   The Thrashers posted one of their biggest victories before a raucous crowd
of 18,571 -- the largest in team history.
</P>
<P>
	   Pavel Bure and Scott Mellanby scored power-play goals to lead host Florida
to its fifth win in six games.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-place Panthers opened up a 14-point lead over second-place
Carolina in the Southeast Division and snapped a seven-game winless streak
against the Hurricanes (0-3-4).
</P>
<P>
	   Rookies Jason Ward and Francis Bouillon each scored their second career
goals and Jose Theodore made 14 saves to lead visiting Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   Stu Barnes scored and Martin Biron stopped 25 shots for Buffalo, which is
2-6-1 since Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   Mats Sundin scored at 2:59 of overtime as Toronto rallied from two goals
down to win at Edmonton. Garry Valk and Igor Korolev scored in the third period
for the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Marchant and Ryan Smyth scored in the second period for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Marty McInnis got the go-ahead goal and Paul Kariya scored his first
power-play goal in nine games as host Anaheim ended St. Louis' eight-game
unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Guy Hebert, who played for the Blues until the Ducks made him their first
pick in the 1993 expansion draft, made 36 saves, and Ladislav Kohn ended a
12-game goal-scoring drought to help Anaheim snap a seven-game winless streak.

	   The Los Angeles Lakers kept insisting they weren't thinking about their
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Well, now they have something to think about.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers lost for the first time in 36 days Friday night, dropping a
111-102 decision to the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
	   "All good things come to an end," said Glen Rice, who led the Lakers with 23
points, including 11 in the final 4:13 as Los Angeles attempted to rally but
fell short and had their 16-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Travis Best scored all 12 of his points in the fourth quarter as part of a
major performance by Indiana's reserves, who outscored the Lakers' reserves
37-20 and outrebounded them 18-6.
</P>
<P>
	   Best and Austin Croshere scored 22 of Indiana's last 26 points after both
were scoreless in the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just came out and wanted to play hard, wanted to establish ourselves
early," said Reggie Miller, who led six Pacers players in double figures with 22
points. "We hung in there and we fought. It was one of those gritty wins."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games, Toronto beat Milwaukee 115-110, Philadelphia downed Orlando
102-100, Portland defeated Phoenix 105-83, Detroit beat Washington 105-98,
Atlanta topped Chicago 89-83, Miami rallied past Denver 92-87, Seattle defeated
San Antonio 91-85 and Cleveland edged Vancouver 82-80.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal had 23 points and 14 rebounds but shot just 10-of-25 as he
consistently failed to hit after muscling his way underneath.
</P>
<P>
	   "We beat ourselves. I take the blame for this loss. I don't usually miss 15
shots. Those were shots I usually make and should make," said O'Neal, who had to
battle the defensive efforts of veteran Sam Perkins much of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers went into the game with the second-longest winning streak in team
history, having matched a 16-game streak recorded in 1990-91. They were stopped
less than halfway to the league record of 33 straight wins by the 1971-72
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   At Philadelphia, Eric Snow's 20-foot jumper with 14 seconds left gave the
Sixers the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Iverson led the Sixers with 35 points and had no turnovers, while Theo
Ratliff had a big night in his second game back from another leg injury with 18
points, 14 rebounds and five blocks. Snow had 10 points and 11 assists to lead
Philadelphia back from an 18-point second-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic got the ball out of bounds with 3.6 seconds left. Darrell
Armstrong took the inbounds pass and juked Snow with a between-the-legs dribble,
but his 29-foot jumper to win it bounced off the front rim.
</P>
<P>
	   At Toronto, Vince Carter scored 47 points in his first matchup with Ray
Allen since Allen was selected over him for the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who shot 20-for-32 from the field, set a franchise record and
totaled the most points in an NBA game this season. The previous high was 46 by
Allen Iverson and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Robinson had 37, Allen scored 25 and Sam Cassell 24 for the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
	   At Phoenix, the Trail Blazers overcame eight technical fouls and the
ejections of Rasheed Wallace and coach Mike Dunleavy for their fourth straight
victory and 10th in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Scottie Pippen scored all 13 of his points in the second half, including a
three-point play and 3-pointer as Portland turned the game into a rout in the
fourth quarter. He also had nine rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers outscored Phoenix 62-31 in the second half, 33-13 in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   At Auburn Hills, Mich., Jerry Stackhouse had 32 points and a career-best
seven steals, and Grant Hill added 30 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill has scored 29 or more points in six straight, averaging 35.7 in that
stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was Detroit's seventh in its last eight, while the Wizards lost
their sixth in a row on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   At Chicago, Isaiah Rider scored 13 of his 24 points in the third quarter,
and his 15-foot jumper with 45 seconds left sealed Atlanta's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The win snapped a seven-game road losing streak for the Hawks. They hadn't
won on the road since beating Toronto on Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   At Denver, Alonzo Mourning scored 28 points and Voshon Lenard came off the
bench to score 24, fueling a fourth-quarter rally that gave Miami the win.
</P>
<P>
	   Lenard scored 14 points and Mourning 11 in the final period as Miami
outscored Denver 19-7 over the last 6:33.
</P>
<P>
	   At Seattle, Gary Payton scored 25 points and Vin Baker added 23 as Seattle
won its fourth straight. The Sonics never trailed after grabbing an 18-2 lead in
the first 5:20.
</P>
<P>
	   At Vancouver, Shawn Kemp scored five of his 24 points in the final three
minutes to lead Cleveland. Brevin Knight added 16 points while Lamond Murray
scored 13 as the Cavaliers improved to 7-0 all-time against the Grizzlies.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBA commissioner David Stern came up with the image first as
he tried to express what he sees for the changing sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunities for employment in sports will explode in the digital age,''
Stern said. ``It will be a tsunami of opportunities. Send us your resumes. My
address is 645 Fifth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue did not supply his address, but endorsed
Stern's stand and even employed the NBA boss' word.
</P>
<P>
	``David called it a tsunami of new opportunity,'' he said. ``It is an economy
driven by new technology.''
</P>
<P>
	And it has the NFL and NBA hanging out help wanted signs for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/Push Wall Street Project,
Tagliabue and Stern participated on a panel that discussed minority jobs in
sports. It is a continuing issue, one that ex-Georgetown coach John Thompson
spoke out about on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is about the universities in the country that educate our kids,''
he said. ``If these colleges are not sensitive enough that if you are going to
allow young people in intercollegiate activities, and after they finish you are
not willing to hire them on a consistent basis, it is ridiculous to wonder why
they don't have any interest in getting an education.''
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue sees only an upside to the developing sports environment.
</P>
<P>
	``Sports in the 21st century mirrors three trends in society -- population
growth, increased minority population and an America whose economic engine is
driven by technology,'' the NFL boss said.
</P>
<P>
	``The social, cultural, political implications are huge. Sports is no longer
the mom and pop business it was 50 years ago. We are at $3.5 billion revenue
league-wide and in five years it will be $5.5 billion through increases in
television revenue.
</P>
<P>
	``The challenges I see is the demand for new skills, high levels of
specialization in a nation that is becoming increasingly diverse. We seek
specialists, not generalists, coming from other sectors into sports. There is a
need for capologists. What's a capologist? It's a bright person who knows how to
deal with complex financial issues.''
</P>
<P>
	Included on the Operation/Push panel were athletes who succeeded first in
sports and then in the business world.
</P>
<P>
	Ex-stars like Drew Pearson and Isiah Thomas have flourished in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
	Pearson, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, runs a marketing company that
employs 100 people. Thomas, who starred for the Detroit Pistons, helped launch
the NBA's Toronto franchise and now operates the CBA, basketball's main minor
league.
</P>
<P>
	Pearson is a licensee for sports apparel.
</P>
<P>
	``It is tougher than ever to maintain a level of success,'' he said. ``It's
tough to gain access in the sports licensing industry. In the last year, I've
been in more fights than Mike Tyson and he's supposed to be fighting.
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough road to hoe. We have access to capital. What we need is access
to opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the reason he bought into the CBA was to bring franchises back into
local communities. He said a number of NBA players have invested in teams. Chris
Webber, Jalen Rose, Voshon Lenard, Derrick Coleman and Hall of Famer Dave Bing
have owner interest in the Detroit franchise. All of them are natives of that
city.
</P>
<P>
	``Sports inspires the world and it inspires America,'' Thomas said. ``It holds
a meaningful role in our lives. It's the only place you can truly see inclusion
and diversity at work.''
</P>
<P>
	Not always, though.
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that in his executive role, he attends many meetings. Usually,
though, he finds that he is the only minority in the room. ``In corporate
America, you notice that you don't encounter someone who looks like me,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Signs Appeals Reform Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JACKIE HALLIFAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The electric chair has ended its days as Florida's
sole means of execution after a decade that sometimes saw macabre spectacles in
the state's death chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill Friday giving inmates a choice between the
electric chair and lethal injection. The new law makes lethal injection the
method of choice if inmates decline a preference.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also approved new regulations designed to limit inmates' appeals and
cut the time they spend on death row by half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature approved the changes last week in a bid to stop the U.S.
Supreme Court from reviewing a death row inmate's lawsuit claiming the electric
chair is cruel and unusual punishment -- and therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is scheduled to be argued in February, but Attorney General Bob
Butterworth has asked the court to dismiss it in light of the change. The
inmate's attorney wants the case to continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Executions in the state have been on hold since October, when the U.S.
Supreme Court agreed to review the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida had been one of only four states, along with Georgia, Alabama and
Nebraska, that used the electric chair as its sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Its old electric chair, dubbed ``Old Sparky'' after flames shot from its
headgear during executions in 1990 and 1997, was replaced before the July
execution in which blood streamed down the face of Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   The other law changed Friday limits death row inmates appealing on legal
technicalities to two appeals in state courts in most cases and requires second
appeals be filed within six months of the first. Previously, attorneys for
convicted killers had a year to file a second appeal after the first was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents argued the change could lead to the execution of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said it will stop frivolous cases and bring legitimate claims to
the attention of judges more quickly. They hope the change will cut the time
between a death sentence and an execution to five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The 44 people who have been executed in Florida over the last two decades
have lived on death row an average of more than 10 years. One, Gary Alvord, has
lived with a death sentence for a quarter of a century.

<HEADLINE> Phills' Son: Dad's With the Angels  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The most moving eulogy for Charlotte Hornets guard Bobby
Phills was made by his wife, Kendall. The most courageous one came from his
teammate and close friend, David Wesley.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills' life was celebrated Friday at a memorial service, where his family
was joined by members of the NBA's Hornets and New York Knicks, friends and
former teammates. His funeral is scheduled for Sunday in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley, who police say was racing his teammate Wednesday before Phills lost
control of his sports car and collided with an oncoming car, needed a moment to
compose himself before he addressed the family.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't really know what I want to say, but he was my partner in crime," he
began. "We had some fun."
</P>
<P>
	   Making no references to the accident, Wesley remembered Phills as a fierce
competitor on the basketball court and on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
	   "He always had to win and even when he wasn't winning he talked enough trash
to make you think he was winning," he said, drawing laughter from the mourners.
</P>
<P>
	   Negating the despair that has gripped the community for days, Kendall Phills
set the tone for the service as she got up to speak near the open casket. She
carried their young son, Bobby Phills III, to the podium.
</P>
<P>
	   With a little gentle prodding from his mother, 3-year-old Bobby told several
hundred mourners: "Daddy is in heaven with the angels." He then ran off and
hugged his 1-year-old sister, Kerstie.
</P>
<P>
	   With few dry eyes left in the Central Church of God, Kendall Phills spoke
glowingly of her love for her husband. They met in high school when she was just
14.
</P>
<P>
	   She described Bobby Phills as "intelligent, competitive, funny and
compassionate."
</P>
<P>
	   "He adored our beautiful children and he loved his parents," Kendall Phills
said, finally breaking down into tears. "It's truly been a blessing for me to
have Bobby as my husband, friend and eternal soul mate. While we will meet
again, I will always love you, Bobby."
</P>
<P>
	   Phills, 30, was in a bronze casket surrounded by about a dozen flower
arrangements and two poster-size photographs of him while he played for the
Hornets. One of the arrangements was in the shape of a basketball hoop and ball.
</P>
<P>
	   An entourage of Knicks players came to the service led by veteran center
Patrick Ewing. Several of Phills' former teammates also attended the service.
</P>
<P>
	   Hornets coach Paul Silas also was unable to control his emotions when he was
asked to say a few words.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing I think I'll miss the most is his big smile, an infectious
smile," Silas said. "He would brighten up the room when he entered. And he was
smart and perceptive on and off the court."
</P>
<P>
	   Silas said Phills took it in stride when he was asked to give up his
starting job this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I asked him to go to the bench he said, 'Coach, I'll do whatever I
need to do to help this team."'
</P>
<P>
	   Hornets vice president Bob Bass nearly lost his composure when he started to
talk about his former player.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bad thing I feel," he said, his voice shaking, "was that I never told
Bobby that I love him. God, it's tough to lose a guy like that."
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional service was the start of what promises to be a difficult
period for Phills' former teammates. The Hornets were to fly to New York today
to play the Knicks. After the game, the team was to take a charter back to
Charlotte, then fly to Baton Rouge on Sunday for Phills' funeral and burial.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, on Monday, the Hornets will host the Toronto Raptors at the Charlotte
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   The funeral will be held on the campus of Southern University, where Phills
earned a bachelor's degree in animal science.
</P>
<P>
	   A moment of silence as well as a video tribute to Phills had been planned
for Friday night's game. That will be done at Monday's home game. His teammates
plan to wear a patch bearing Phills' No. 13 on their jerseys for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Hornets will retire his jersey number at their Feb. 9 home
game against Cleveland, the team with which Phills spent his first six NBA
seasons. Phills will be the first Charlotte player to have his jersey retired in
the club's 11-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   No makeup dates have been set for the Hornets' two postponements. Wednesday
night's game against Chicago also was postponed after the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley and Phills left a practice at the Charlotte Coliseum late Wednesday
morning, got into their Porsche coupes -- Phills a black one and Wesley a white
one -- and began racing on a winding, heavily traveled thoroughfare, according
to police.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than a mile from the coliseum, while the two were traveling at what
police said were speeds in excess of 75 mph, Phills lost control of his car in a
45-mph zone and slid into oncoming traffic. His car was struck in the driver's
side door by an oncoming sedan. Phills was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte-Mecklenburg County police spokesman Keith Bridges said if any
charges are filed in the case, they would come at the end of the crash
investigation, probably sometime next week.

<HEADLINE> Ticket Refund Set for Phills Delays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets on Friday announced a ticket
refund policy for the two home games postponed because of the death of
co-captain Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to offering refunds at the point of purchase, the Hornets said
tickets could be exchanged for future games at the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets could either be used for the identical seats at the two rescheduled
games, or they could be exchanged for tickets to another game this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The NBA postponed Wednesday night's game against Chicago after Phills was
killed earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Phills and teammate David Wesley were racing late Wednesday
morning after the team's morning shootaround. The two were traveling at speeds
in excess of 75 mph when Phills lost control of his car in a 45-mph zone and
slid into oncoming traffic. His car was struck in the driver's side door by an
oncoming sedan. Phills was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The league also postponed Friday night's game against New York, which had
been scheduled to start just a few hours after a memorial service for Phills.
</P>
<P>
	   League officials said Friday that both games would be rescheduled, but that
the makeup dates had yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The two teams will play tonight at New York. After the game, the team was to
take a charter back to Charlotte, then fly to Baton Rouge on Sunday for Phills'
funeral and burial.

<HEADLINE> Family of police shooting victim files complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The family of a man killed by police says Commissioner
Howard Safir twisted the truth to justify a shooting that should never have
happened.
<P>
	   "He specifically first demonized my brother," said Glen Busch, whose
brother, Gary, was wielding a hammer when officers shot him to death last
summer. "This starts from the top and works its way down."
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Busch's family filed a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review
Board Friday alleging that Busch was fleeing from cops, not attacking them, when
he was struck by 12 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't attack anybody ... and never had," said Busch's mother, Doris
Busch Boskey. "They knew that he wasn't a threat, they knew he posed no danger.
... He was trying to get away. Why would anyone go toward six or more police
officers?"
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy police chief Thomas Fahey said in a statement that the matter had
been fully investigated and that both the police department and the Brooklyn
district attorney found the officers involved in the shooting acted properly. He
declined through a spokesman to respond specifically to the allegations about
Safir's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, a Brooklyn grand jury decided the shooting was justified
because it was reasonable for the patrolmen to believe Busch was a threat to
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Busch's death on Aug. 30, 1999, prompted street protests in Borough Park,
Brooklyn, the predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhood where he lived, and
raised questions about how police deal with emotionally disturbed people.
</P>
<P>
	   Police came to Busch's home after receiving reports that he was threatening
people with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said that when officers ordered Busch, 31, out of his
basement apartment, he flew into a rage and charged up the stairs swinging an
11-inch hammer. One officer tried - but failed - to stop him with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
	   His family's CCRB complaint charged the officers involved in the shooting
with excessive force and abuse of authority.
</P>
<P>
	   It asked the board to investigate whether the officers followed department
guidelines on dealing with the emotionally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
	   If their actions were within NYPD rules, then the rules must be changed,
said New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Norman Siegel,
representing the family. Siegel said the use of pepper spray on the already
agitated Busch only provoked him further.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just ... creates a crisis situation when in most of these instances, if
you just wait it out, you can deal with the person," Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that even though the grand jury had found the officers did not act
criminally, the board could still determine that the shooting was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after the shooting, Safir said the four officers who fired the shots
that hit Busch had used deadly force only after he refused to drop his hammer
and stop attacking two other officers. The commissioner, who cited seven
non-police witnesses, said Busch was pummeling a fallen sergeant when he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The family disputes that account, and accused Safir and his subordinates of
distorting the truth in public statements after Busch's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an immediate cover-up, there were stories, they had to justify
this shooting which should never have happened," Mrs. Boskey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The family's complaint asks the CCRB to investigate Safir's actions and find
out what basis he had for saying there were seven independent witnesses
confirming that police acted appropriately. Investigators were reportedly unable
to find any of the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint also asks whether the officers involved truthfully answered
questions about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Boskey, who said she had spoken to many witnesses and seen photos of
the scene, said her son was trying to get away from police when he was shot. She
described his hammer as a religious item inscribed with Hebrew writing.
</P>
<P>
	   He was trying to get away from police and find an open space to recover from
the pepper spray when he was shot, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was afraid," Mrs. Boskey said. "They had guns drawn."

<HEADLINE> Winter arrives in New York City area with an icy jolt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - After a relatively toasty December and early January,
New Yorkers struggled to get through icy temperatures hovering in the teens and
winds that made it feel at times like 25 degrees below zero.
<P>
	   "It's been warm and now all of a sudden it is so cold," said Aida Rios, 31,
of the Bronx, as she waited for a subway Friday to get to work. "I was forced to
be outside in this weather. I felt like I was in a freezer."
</P>
<P>
	   "Even the money is cold," Charles Masur, 28, said at an ATM machine in White
Plains. "You can't wear enough to be warm when the wind's like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Some school districts in the northern suburbs opened up to two hours late.
And in Sullivan County, Monticello schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City was on a cold weather alert.
</P>
<P>
	   "Up to last night we were averaging 11 degrees above normal for the month,"
meteorologist Scott Reynolds of the National Weather Service said Friday. "Today
we'll take a little bite out of that, I suspect."
</P>
<P>
	   Shelters and soup kitchens braced for the worst overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coalition for the Homeless was giving hot meals and blankets to hundreds
of people on the streets and urging them to go to shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it gets this cold it's a matter of life and death," said Patrick
Markee, senior policy analyst for the coalition. "On nights like this we see
literally hundreds of men pouring into shelters," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that on Thursday night, some men waited hours to get into a shelter,
and he feared the same thing might happen Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Hossein Saadat, executive director of St. John's Bread and Life soup
kitchen in Brooklyn: "When it's cold like this people tend to stay longer than
usual. The challenge is finding space for so many people. We don't have the
heart to tell them to leave, so we just have to manage."
</P>
<P>
	   David Billig, a spokesman for the Emergency Medical Service, said the
service had received several calls Thursday and Friday about cases of
hypothermia, frostnip and frostbite.
</P>
<P>
	   He said people who live or have to work in the street, such as EMTs,
paramedics, firefighters, police officers and work crews, are most in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you don't need to be outside, stay inside," he said, and for those who
have to go out, he stressed the importance of layered clothing with a waterproof
outer layer. He said people should avoid smoking and alcohol, and should be sure
to wear gloves and a hat.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in White Plains, Jan Pferd of Goteborg, Sweden, said the weather
reminded him of home. But "that doesn't mean I like it. I think the wind will
bowl me over."

<HEADLINE> Doctors Optimistic on Letterman  </HEADLINE>
    By GEORGE WATSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman has a "very good" chance to return to full
health following his emergency quintuple bypass, but will likely need six to
eight weeks of recuperating at home, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, underwent surgery on Friday after a test found one of his
arteries was seriously blocked.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. O. Wayne Isom, who performed the procedure at New York Presbyterian
Hospital, said it went smoothly and predicted a rapid recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   He called Letterman's outlook "very good" and said the "Late Show" host "has
the heart muscle of a 20-year-old."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman had submitted to an angiogram because of what he said was high
cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family. The test, during which
a flexible tube is inserted into an artery and dye is injected, revealed the
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician, Dr. Louis J. Aronne, and his cardiologist,
Dr. Martin Post, said it was too early to determine how long recovery would
take.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Amarkanth Saxena, a cardiothoracic surgeon at St. Joseph's Medical
Center in Paterson, N.J., said if there are no complicating factors, Letterman
should be hospitalized for three or four days before a home recuperation of six
to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxena, who was not involved in Letterman's case but has performed several
bypass procedures, said such a patient should avoid high blood pressure and
cholesterol, in part by avoiding fried foods and red meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else, Letterman has made a long-running joke of his health,
starting years ago when he discovered he had high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   During Friday's "Late Show," which was taped in New York on Thursday,
Letterman joked about his cholesterol level with guest Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman quipped. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman spokesman Steven Rubenstein said CBS will telecast reruns of the
"Late Show with David Letterman" while the host recovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Mujibur Rahman, who runs a shop near The Ed Sullivan Theater near
Letterman's show and a frequent straight-man on the program, said he watched
television throughout Friday in hopes of catching an update about his friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm praying for him and his good health," Rahman said.

<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Ivan DeBlois Combe, the inventor of Clearasil, the
acne cream that helped millions of pimply-faced baby boomers get through the
awkward teen-age years, died Tuesday after a stroke. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   He named the product ``Clearasil'' to capitalize on every teen-ager's dream
of having clear skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe peddled the new product to drug stores across the country, but store
owners were reluctant to buy another acne product when so many others had
failed. Finally, Combe gave out free tubes of Clearasil to store owners in
exchange for a promise to order more if the product sold. It did.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales skyrocketed after Combe began advertising Clearasil on the popular
teen-age dance show ``American Bandstand'' in 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1960, Vick Chemical bought the Clearasil business from Combe's company,
Combe Inc. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought Clearasil in 1985.

Herb Graff
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Herb Graff, who devoted most of his life to collecting,
preserving and showing movies, died of heart failure Sunday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
	   Graff began collecting movies as a teen-ager, buying one-reelers and even
scraps of film discarded by film companies. His collection eventually grew to
several hundred features and more than 1,000 shorts, and his calling card read
simply, ``Film Resource.''
</P>
<P>
	   His principal interest was in early talkies, especially musicals, but his
collection included silent films and works from the 1940s. Born in Boston and
raised in Brooklyn, Graff was active for many years as a consultant and
lecturer, showing his movies on a 16-millimeter projector, often with a scratchy
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   He offered a series of public screenings, and also showed films on PBS and
at Town Hall in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he was never a critic or author, he was considered a significant
contributor to the art of movies, knowing more about them than most historians
or archivists.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his passion for film, it was a second job for Graff, who worked as a
salesman in the garment industry until 1983. He then went to work for the Castle
Hill film company and remained a movie professional for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1989 profile in The New Yorker, Graff recalled saying to himself,
``Were I to die my tombstone would read, ``Here lies Herb Graff, Sold Shirts in
White, Pink, Beige and Blue, and Every Five Years Lilac.''
Estrongo Nachama
</P>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Estrongo Nachama, who survived the Holocaust by singing for
Nazi guards at Auschwitz and later employed his sonorous baritone to help revive
Jewish life in Berlin, died Thursday of heart failure. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   After two years at Auschwitz, Nachama survived the forced ``death march'' to
Germany as the Nazis retreated westward ahead of the Soviet army. He was rescued
by Soviet troops at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Nachama was the community's chief cantor from 1947 until his death. While
his main role was singing at Jewish religious events and funerals, he also
regularly performed for other audiences and became one of postwar Germany's most
prominent Jews. He was honored by the German government for promoting
understanding among the faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   His only son, Andreas Nachama, now heads the thriving Jewish community in
the German capital.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Civil Rights Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Invoking the memory of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
President Clinton said today his budget request for 2001 will include a
substantial increase in money for civil rights enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said in his weekly radio address that ``there are still too
many barriers and examples of too many Americans facing discrimination in their
daily lives,'' even though the country is doing better in treating all citizens
equally.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, speaking on King's 71st birthday and two days before the nation's
official celebration, also said he will also ask Congress for swift passage of
legislation that would expand federal hate crime laws to include crimes
committed because of the victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
</P>
<P>
	   Seated near Clinton during the address was 100-year-old Charlotte Filmore, a
black woman who once worked at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said she is a living testament to civil rights progress in
America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whan she worked at the White House she had to use the side door,'' Clinton
said. ``Today she came through the front door all the way to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arriving today at the White House, Mrs. Filmore, who was born on October 2,
1899, said: ``I``m so glad I lived to see this day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he will seek $695 million for civil rights enforcement, a 13
percent increase from last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department would receive $98
million, an increase of 86 percent above its spending levels in 1993, the first
year of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proposed funding will permit the Justice Department to expand
significantly investigations and prosecutions of criminal civil rights cases --
including hate crimes and police misconduct -- as well as fair housing and
lending cases,'' the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he also will seek $322 million for the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, 14 percent more than last year's budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Other substantial increases are being sought for the civil rights
enforcement offices at the Labor Department, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the Agriculture Department, and the Education Department, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton described his proposals and requests as ``new steps to fulfill Dr.
King's dream'' as one of the 20th century's greatest champions of justice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dr. King challenged us to dig deep in our hearts ...and live to to our own
creed,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Says GOP Focus Is on Education  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing a year of past success, Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, said today that education was the No. 1 priority for Republicans in
2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who would dispute that education is the great equalizer in our society
that can give every citizen in our nation -- regardless of race, gender, income
or geographic background -- the same opportunity to succeed?'' Snowe said in the
GOP's weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
	   If the federal government would fully meet its obligation to fund special
education programs, it would free billions for states and local governments to
put toward other education needs, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, 5.6 million children were enrolled in special education programs,
most with learning disabilities, language impairments or emotional problems,
according to the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must continue to provide the resources and the flexibility necessary
for schools to be their best and students to do their best,'' Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
	   She added that student loans should be more accessible and affordable, and
said Congress plans to the review the nation's education programs this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning from young Americans to seniors, Snowe said Republicans are
dedicated to preserving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As part of last year's budget, we ensured that not one red cent of Social
Security surplus funds will be touched for the first time in 40 years,'' she
said. ``I'm pleased the president now agrees with our approach.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a final note, Snowe sounded the familiar Republican theme of fighting for
tax reform, particularly ending the ``marriage penalty'' that affects two-earner
couples.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've worked hard to make our economy what it is today,'' she said. ``You
deserve to keep more of that hard-earned money to spend as you see fit.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Brace for First Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The Republican campaign took a turn toward civility
in last week's runup to the first presidential voting, while Democrats Al Gore
and Bill Bradley decided that combat suited them better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The voters will have a clear choice on election day,'' pledged Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates looked ahead to a week of television ads, mass mailings,
phone banks and carpools designed to get supporters to the Iowa caucuses a week
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary served as an important distraction, with many
candidates splitting time between the two opening-bell states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No time to waste!'' Bradley said midway through a week in which the
dynamics shifted in the Democratic race in Iowa, taxes dominated the GOP debate
and a front-runner twice shifted his ad strategies under pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush seemed caught off guard during a GOP debate in Michigan, when
McCain seized on an unexpected pledge not to run negative ads. ``I'll shake
hands with you, George,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The moment seemed impromptu, but in fact McCain had reason to believe Bush
was about to go negative: A woman had contacted his campaign to complain that a
Bush camera team had interviewed her about McCain's tax plan. She said she was
coached to criticize the package.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign caught in the act, the Texas governor said he knew nothing
about the operation and pledged anew not to run negative ads. Bush advisers said
their ad team had stockpiled scores of interviews for potential ads, but there
were no plans to cut a negative spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet one member of the Bush camp confirmed that the woman who came forward
had been ``helped along'' by producers seeking an articulate criticism of
McCain's cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the national GOP front-runner, is in a dead heat with McCain in New
Hampshire. McCain has bypassed Iowa, where complicated caucuses demand
resource-draining organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also pulled his punch with Steve Forbes, the conservative millionaire
who is airing ads accusing Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of internal debate, Bush produced a response ad that said Forbes'
charge was ``wrong'' and set the record straight by talking about two Texas tax
cuts he supported. Left on the shelf was the script of an ad that would have had
Bush saying, ``My opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, appeared to outlast questions about his work on behalf of
contributors in the Senate. A week earlier, the matter had threatened to
overwhelm his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore and Bradley dredged up old Senate votes and
pounced with breathless accusations. The vice president said Bradley abandoned
flood victims in Iowa. The former New Jersey senator said Gore flip-flopped in
votes on smoking and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had promised not to sling ``darts'' in his not-politics-as-usual
campaign, but aides say he had no choice after the vice president lashed out at
Bradley in the final months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's team now is crying cry foul. ``It's a shame that Senator Bradley has
had to resort to negative campaigning,'' said the vice president's combative
spokesman, Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   The rhetoric intensified as Bradley struggled to close a stubborn 20-point
gap in Iowa polls and his advisers began to worry Gore actually was gaining
strength.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a different picture in New Hampshire, where the race remained close.
Gore's team sensed what one adviser called ``glacial movement'' in his favor
after weeks of advantage-Bradley in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Barely heard above the din, three Republicans hoped Iowa's social
conservatives would lift them into the top tier. Debates that served as bookends
to the week gave Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah a chance to
shine.
</P>
<P>
	   In their final week in Iowa, Bush plans to hammer home the fact that he has
the largest tax-cut proposal, and he is expected to continue to find fault with
McCain's package. He already accused McCain's bean counters of using
``Washington double-accounting.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's advisers discussed ways to portray their boss as the most
presidential of the presidential candidates, hoping to capitalize on lingering
questions about Bush's experience and intellectual heft.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic candidates braced for another week of jousting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a competition, after all,'' said Bradley, a sharp-elbowed former
basketball star.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Nixon Tape May Be Solved  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Archives is exploring whether new technology
could solve an enduring mystery of Watergate: What was said during the infamous
18 1/2-minute gap on one of President Nixon's tapes recorded three days after
the break-in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are interested in examining the possibility of retesting the 18
1/2-minute gap in the Watergate tapes to ascertain whether or not there is any
recoverable conversation,'' an internal archives memo obtained by The Associated
Press said. ``All of us believe it is doubtful there is anything recoverable,
but the last testing of the `gap' occurred in the late '70s.''
</P>
<P>
	   The memo was written Jan. 7 to schedule a meeting to review the idea and
report back to John Carlin, archivist of the United States, on ``whether or not
it would be feasible and prudent to test again, and if so, how we should
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
	   As heard on the tape, the gap is a series of clicks, hisses and buzzes. It
is part of a recording made June 20, 1972, in the old Executive Office Building
as Nixon chatted with his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman.
</P>
<P>
	   Public disclosure of the erasure, late the following year, eroded Nixon's
credibility at a time when his presidency was unraveling over the June 17, 1972,
break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate.
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary Woods, testified that when a phone rang, she
must have pushed the wrong button and left her foot on a pedal, accidentally
recording over part of the original conversation. A panel of experts set up in
the 1970s by federal judge John Sirica, who presided over the Watergate criminal
trials, concluded that the erasures were done in at least five -- and perhaps as
many as nine -- separate and contiguous segments.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel never figured out what was erased.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the National Archives, said the archives
would not make a quick decision on whether retesting should be done. ``It's
premature for the archives to be commenting on this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve St.Croix, an audio expert and president of Intelligent Devices in
Baltimore, has never heard the gap. But he said technology developed in the past
three years might make it possible to recover conversation, even from tapes
repeatedly erased on older machines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any tape that has ever had audio on it can never be completely free of
that audio, though sometimes only infinitesimal amounts remain,'' St.Croix said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that when a recording is made, magnetized particles of iron oxide --
basically, rust -- that are on the tape line up in patterns to represent the
sounds being recorded. According to St.Croix, most of the particles move into
these patterns, but not all.
</P>
<P>
	   The same thing happens when a tape is erased, he said. Most of the particles
are disrupted by erasure, but some are moved only partially. It is these few
that experts try to hear.
</P>
<P>
	   Another technique involves painting the tape with a chemical substance that
allows the patterns to be seen under a special light and then possibly digitized
into computer data and evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It might be that we do all this and you get a beautiful, digital image of
absolutely nothing,'' he said. ``If it's not there, we can't get it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Smolian, a sound restoration engineer in Frederick, Md., is not
convinced new technology would recover what was said on the tape. But he added
that government laboratories might be working privately with newer techniques
not yet commercially available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm deeply dubious,'' Smolian said. ``It was thoroughly erased.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smolian listened to the gap while preparing to testify in a lawsuit about
whether the government must compensate the Nixon estate for seizing the
presidential tapes, papers and other materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like a hiss, and then a click. And more hiss. And then less
hiss. And then more hiss -- as if somebody had started and stopped the machine a
number of times,'' Smolian said. ``It's very clear to me that it's been meddled
with.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Koenig, a former supervisory agent of the FBI laboratory's audio-video
division, said work done on the tape in the 1970s convinced him that talk cannot
be recovered from the tape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It isn't a matter that somehow, if we come up with technology, we can find
it,'' Koenig said. ``There isn't anything there to recover.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the experts who examined the tape in the 1970s tried to
hear signals along the extreme outer edge of the tape where they thought the
erasure might have been incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We detected only buzz noise,'' the experts said in their 200-page report
released in May 1974. ``Since we were not able to detect even a hint of
speech-like sounds in the buzz section of the tape, it is likely that recovery
of the original signal will never be possible.''

<P>
	   Recollections of what was discussed at meeting on June 20, 1972:
</P>
<P>
	   H.R. Haldeman, President Nixon's chief of staff:
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got back into the Democratic break-in again. I told the P (president)
about it on the plane last night. ... The more he thought about it, it obviously
bothered him more, because he raised it in considerable detail today.
</P>
<P>
	   ''... We've got to hope the FBI doesn't go beyond what's necessary in
developing evidence and that we can keep a lid on that, as well as keeping all
the characters involved from getting carried away with any unnecessary
testimony. The P was concerned about what our counterattack is, our PR (public
relations) offensive to top this.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Nixon:
</P>
<P>
	   ``What was said during the morning meeting will never be known completely.
... Some of what we talked about during those 18 1/2 minutes can be
reconstructed from the notes Haldeman took.
</P>
<P>
	   ``According to them, one of my first reactions to the Watergate break-in was
to instruct that my Executive Office Building office be checked regularly to
make sure that I was not being bugged by anyone. They also indicate a concern

divert its impact by mounting our own counterattack.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Were Aided Along With Farmers  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for wheat and corn are as low as ever in Garden
County, Neb., but things at the Nebraska State Bank are looking up. Only half as
many farmers need federal guarantees to qualify for credit this year, and almost
every borrower now is up to date on payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason? The $8.7 billion farm-economy bailout Congress passed in
October, said Mike Jorgensen, the bank's president. More than $2 million of the
emergency aid went to Garden County's 400 farms. "I think the government
payments have made a lot of difference," Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, analysts say, the unprecedented infusion of government farm aid over
the past two years has been a boon for banks as well as the growers who borrow
from them. With the bailout, direct government payments to farmers last year
reached a record $22.7 billion, triple the federal outlay just three years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one farming-dependent bank has failed in each of the past three years,
compared to close to 300 that went under during the last major slump in
commodity prices in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   The delinquency rate on federally guaranteed farm loans, which go to banks'
riskiest borrowers, is another sign of relative stability. It is virtually
unchanged from 1997 at about 4.5 percent, according to the Agriculture
Department. Overall, the delinquency rate for loans by farm banks was well under
3 percent for the year ended June 30, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
	   "The government is putting in a lot of money. That is the really big story,
I think," said Steve Koenig, a farm credit analyst for USDA's Economist Research
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Other factors are helping the banks, too: Land values are relatively stable;
the mid-1990s were boom years for U.S. agriculture, so farmers were in
relatively good financial shape when grain prices collapsed in 1998; and federal
loan guarantees are widely available.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA guaranteed almost $2.6 billion worth of farm loans last year and,
thanks to last fall's bailout package, has the money to do more than $4 billion
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Banks also are demanding more records from farmers than they used to -- back
in the 1980s, for example, they might not have required a farmer's income tax
returns to verify earnings. And banks more frequently are requiring farmers to
buy crop insurance or to get futures and options contracts on their crops, which
protect them from price declines.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers rely extensively on credit, both to pay for land and to cover yearly
operating expenses until crops are harvested.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, we're not looking at a financial or economic meltdown like we had
in that period in the '80s," said John Blanchfield, an agricultural credit
expert for the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "The 1990s for the most part were highly profitable years for farmers.
Through the '90s there was tremendous wealth built up, and that huge cushion of
wealth has helped tremendously these last couple of years."
</P>
<P>
	   The overall financial position of farmers is relatively sound, according to
USDA statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Average farm equity, adjusted for inflation, was up 1 percent last year from
1998 and has risen 50 percent since the mid-1980s. Farm debt is down 12 percent
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Virtually no other bank in the country is as dependent on farming as
Jorgensen's, located in Oshkosh, in the western Nebraska panhandle. Almost 94
percent of the $17 million in loans it had outstanding in 1998 were
agricultural.
</P>
<P>
	   But almost no one in the area has quit farming recently, although Congress
will have to come through with more aid in 2000 to ensure they are okay,
Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers are better managers than they used to be, he said. Almost every
producer bought federally subsidized crop insurance in 1999 -- only half did a
few years ago -- and many are using futures contracts even though the bank
doesn't require it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not trying to allude that the farm economy is good. It certainly
isn't," Jorgensen said. "But the borrowers we have seem like they are more
heads-up on it."

<HEADLINE> Councilman Apologizes for Insult  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUFFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A city councilman apologized after his muttered insult
of a citizen was picked up by a cable television microphone.
</P>
<P>
	   Councilman Curtis R. Milteer said he went to the home of T.C. Williams to
deliver the apology after he learned his unflattering characterization of
Williams had been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
	   It was during a Jan. 5 council meeting that Williams, a neighborhood
activist, criticized a plan to spend $2 million on a police precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you've got two million bucks and you don't know what to do with it,
call me,'' Williams told the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   On the cable broadcast, Milteer was then heard to mutter, ``Damn nut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Milteer said Friday he intends to apologize again -- this time publicly --
at a meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was an error of the head and not the heart,'' Milteer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams accepted Milteer's regrets, but said he thinks the public apology
is necessary.

<HEADLINE> The Golden Touch of John Wells  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For a man who bears the ultimate responsibility for
three hours of successful network TV drama each week, 66 hours per season, John
Wells seems remarkably cool.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Wells -- who is co-executive producer of two smash-hit television
series, "ER" and "West Wing," and one promising newcomer, "Third Watch" --
confesses to some wee-hour trepidation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do fine all day long, then I wake up out of a dead sleep, usually about
2:35, and realize ... I can't possibly get it done. I'm up for two hours, then I
go back to bed."
</P>
<P>
	   Wells' three NBC series total a staggering 24 to 30 script pages a
production day, compared to five for the average feature film. That's a heavy
load for the casts and crews and Wells says one of his key roles is to make the
working environment comfortable for them.
</P>
<P>
	   "The amount that you're working in TV is so great that it becomes your
family -- not a replacement, but an adjunct," he says. "A typical shooting day
is 12 hours, five days a week. It's not unusual to have 14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
	   "It needs to be a good place to work, where you're supported, and people
care about your concerns. We spend a lot of time trying to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   So what else does an executive producer do? Is TV the same as feature
movies, where the executive producers can number eight or more and include the
star's wife, agent and hairdresser?
</P>
<P>
	   Wells, 43, laughed loudly at the question.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a good object lesson," he remarked, "because all three shows are
very different jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "On 'Third Watch,' I'm very involved in the writing of the show and the
editing and producing. Because it's shot in New York, the production is handled
by Brooke Kennedy and my co-executive producer, Chris Chulack, a wonderful
director who supervises the visual end of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "On 'West Wing,' I get notes of the scripts, but (series creator and
co-executive producer) Aaron Sorkin really runs the writing staff. Tommy
Schlamme (also co-executive producer) runs the visual look of the show. I'm far
more involved in producing, along with my brother Lew.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because 'ER' has been on so long, we have a great staff. I'm much more
involved in the long-range planning and casting, giving notes on the script and
the cut."
</P>
<P>
	   "ER," of course, is a TV phenomenon: five and a half seasons as the top
rated series. Yet it was turned down by all the networks.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Wells said, the health care system was in decline. "There was
tremendous dissatisfaction with physicians; you were most likely to see a doctor
portrayed as a villain in a movie. There was a lot of belief that you couldn't
attract an audience with doctors as heroes."
</P>
<P>
	   NBC finally agreed to sponsor a pilot, largely, Wells believes, because
Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg were involved; they had just scored big
with "Jurassic Park." Network bosses hated the pilot, but agreed to schedule it
after it tested well with sample audiences.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House saga "West Wing," which has drawn rave reviews and solid
ratings in its first season, was also a hard sell, Wells said, "because there's
a general belief in films and television that there's not a mass audience for
politics." After 16 months and a change of network administrations, NBC agreed
to put "West Wing" on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC also lacked enthusiasm for "Third Watch," a drama about New York City
firefighters. It was considered "a rescue show" and was scheduled in the highly
competitive Sunday night at 8 time slot. Since Jan. 10, "Third Watch" has
appeared in a more favorable position, Monday at 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells confessed that he fell in love with the theater in the eighth grade of
his Alexandria, Va., school. He trained as a director and designer at
Carnegie-Mellon University, then graduated in film producing at the University
of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were required to take a writing course at USC, and I fell in love with
it," he said. "But I didn't make a dime from it for six years." He discovered he
was more adept at managing large groups of people. Now he finds himself
overseeing 700-750 employees each week -- "like a medium-size manufacturing
company."
</P>
<P>
	   The three shows have elements in common -- the most visible being
fast-paced, steady-cam action, whether it's emergency personnel racing along
with patients on gurneys, presidential aides hurrying down corridors, or
firefighters racing to a fire. All of the series also have large casts with
interlocking story lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells added another quality:
</P>
<P>
	   "What I'm interested in with drama is something that illuminates the human
condition in a way that we can better ourselves. We can watch someone else make
mistakes that we think we ourselves would be able to make.
</P>
<P>
	   "We try to find those small moments of heroism and moral dilemmas; they're
close to the same kinds of choices we all have to make day in and day out. Let's
experience those emotions and try them on a little bit, and hopefully we can use
a little bit of that in our own lives."

    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)- The investment group proposing the state's only
minority-owned bank has begun lining up branch offices in Hartford, Bloomfield
and Bridgeport.
<P>
	   The group Friday reached tentative agreement to buy three branches being
divested in the merger of Fleet Bank and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
	   Sale of the branches is dependent on The Community Bank being granted
charters and other approvals by state and federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank's holding company, Urban Financial Group Inc., would be based in
Bridgeport, and is headed by New York investor Peter F. Hurst.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see opportunities in urban markets that the bigger players may have
overlooked," Hurst said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial terms of the deal with FleetBoston Corp. were not disclosed, but
Hurst said his group has raised enough capital to get a charter and to buy the
three branches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Community Bank would be the first minority-owned bank in the state in a
decade. It would start out as a residential and commercial real estate lender,
as well as a lender to small businesses, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of our goals is to bridge the great digital divide" that separates city
and suburban households, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before The Community Bank opens for business, it must apply for and receive
a state charter and federal deposit insurance and the holding company must
receive a federal charter.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurst, an investment banker and lawyer, said he and his partners plan to
open the bank in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Community Bank would become the only minority-owned bank in Connecticut,
according to the state Department of Banking.
</P>
<P>
	   Caribbean First Bank of Hartford was once granted a temporary charter by
state regulators. But insufficient capital forced the bank to surrender its
charter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Savings &AMP; Loan Association in Hartford was the last
minority-owned bank to possess a full-fledged charter. It was one of 20
Connecticut banks that failed in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal feted on 80th birthday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor's birthday party Saturday has
turned into a major fund-raiser for the New York Archdiocese - as well as an
expected gathering for some of his possible successors.
<P>
	   The dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria in honor of the cardinal's 80th birthday
raised $4 million for Catholic charities, including support for parochial
schools in the archdiocese and funding for a seminary position named for the
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 1,500 people invited were several men whose names have
been mentioned as O'Connor's possible successors: Archbishop Justin Rigali of
St. Louis; Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the U.S.
Military; and Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner was scheduled to feature tributes to the cardinal, a speech by
O'Connor, and a video about his legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, who grew up in Philadelphia, was a military chaplain who served
briefly as the bishop of Scranton, Pa., before being named to head the New York
Archdiocese in 1984. He succeeded Cardinal Terence Cooke.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is the oldest active bishop in the United States and is regarded as
one of the most powerful Catholics in America. The pope is expected to replace
him now that he has turned 80, the age at which cardinals lose their power to
vote for a new pope.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor also had a brain tumor removed in September and has missed a number
of public appearances, including Masses, since then. He stumbled twice in
November when mounting the steps to the pulpit, and has taken to sitting in a
chair near the high altar to avoid the stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The guest list for his birthday dinner reads like a Who's Who of Catholics
in America. In addition to Rigali, O'Brien and Mansell, the attendees were
expected to include Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark; Cardinal Anthony
Bevilacqua of Philadelphia; Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston; Cardinal Adam Maida
of Detroit; Cardinal James Hickey of Washington; Cardinal Francis George of
Chicago; Archbishop Daniel Buechlein of Indianapolis; Archbishop Harry Flynn of
St. Paul-Minneapolis; and the Papal Nuncio in Washington D.C., Gabriel Montalvo.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Mayor Ed Koch, a close friend of the cardinal's, and Gov. George
Pataki, were also expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the clergy are also expected to attend Sunday morning Mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner is being chaired by three Wall Street investment bankers: Ted
Forstmann, senior partner of Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., and a well-known advocate
of school vouchers; David Komansky, CEO of Merrill Lynch; and Les Quick of Quick
&AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets were $1,000 a head but many guests made additional contributions.
The seminary position being funded by some of the proceeds is the John Cardinal
O'Connor Distinguished Chair in Hebrew Studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in
Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
	   It is designed to educate priests about the shared scriptural heritage of
Jews and Christians. Fostering better relations between Catholics and Jews has
been one of the cardinal's priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is also known for being a stalwart defender of the pope's hard line
on abortion and homosexuality. During his 16 years in New York, he has chastised
politicians who support abortion and ousted gay worshippers from parish
churches. But he's also sided with striking unions and gone into AIDS wards
anonymously to wash the hair of patients too sick to know who he was.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Archdiocese serves 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, the
Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Rockland and five upstate counties.

<HEADLINE> Dark past brings down South Beach's 'dangerous darling'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Until last month, Chris Paciello confidently reigned
over a South Beach nightclub regime catering to the see-and-be-seen set.
<P>
	   Madonna, Donald Trump, Jennifer Lopez - all hung out at Paciello's clubs,
lounging in black leather booths, sipping Dom Perignon and schmoozing with the
beefy, dark-haired owner.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities claim a truer picture of Paciello emerged years earlier in a
more mundane setting: the middle-class home of Staten Island housewife Judith
Shemtov. It was there, they say, that Shemtov took a bullet in the head - part
of an evil past that has finally caught up to Paciello.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 1, the Brooklyn native surrendered in Miami on murder and robbery
charges after he was named in a New York indictment accusing him of being a
former member of the violent "Beach Avenue Crew."
</P>
<P>
	   The goon squad, authorities say, provided muscle and money for the Bonanno
organized crime family by going on a crime spree that left a half dozen bodies
in its wake. They claim Paciello, whose legal name is Christian Ludwigsen, was
known as "the Binger" because he liked to binge on crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal case could force Paciello, 28, to forfeit his multimillion
dollar enterprise and put him behind bars for life.
</P>
<P>
	   The mercurial rise and fall of the man a Miami alternative weekly, New
Times, calls "the dangerous darling of the SoBe nightlife set" has both
enthralled and stunned his supporters and associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Kelly, owner of the new nightclub Level, learned from authorities last
week that Paciello once discussed responding to the competition by having him
"whacked."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely a 'Jekyll and Hyde' situation," said Kelly, Paciello's
onetime marketing director. He recalled Paciello as a kind boss who began each
day with a two-hour workout.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never, ever even heard him raise his voice," he said. "I thought he was
my friend. ... It's scary as hell."
</P>
<P>
	   Ingrid Casares - Paciello's partner in the trendy dance club Liquid and
close friend of Madonna - and other South Beach glitterati have rallied behind
Paciello. Insisting Paciello is a legitimate entrepreneur and community leader,
several wealthy backers have put up personal property to secure a $15 million
bail bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello's attorney, Roy Black, has sought to portray the graduate of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Bensonhurst as a "young man who's
turned his life around." He notes that Paciello - despite growing up with known
criminals and having several previous arrests - has never been convicted of a
felony.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, the way our society works is when someone becomes successful
or a high-profile person, they become a target," Black told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   South Florida friends say Paciello's success sprung from a shy charm and
knack for drawing black-clad beautiful people to his nightspots dotting South
Beach's Art Deco District.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his arrest, Paciello himself responded to mob rumors, saying, "It
doesn't make me a gangster because I hung out on the corner with people while I
was growing up." He has said he began using his mother's maiden name, Paciello,
because his parents broke up - not to escape his past.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors call the portrait a sham. They say Paciello led a double
life after he went south, switching his allegiance to the Colombo crime family
and settling scores with assaults and death threats.
</P>
<P>
	   In one incident noted in gossip columns, Paciello allegedly decked a former
football player at a South Beach club in a fight over a super model. A lawsuit
by a former Mr. Universe accuses him of breaking the plaintiff's face with a
beer bottle.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a character trait of Mr. Ludwigsen to resort to violent activity,"
said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Walden.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege Paciello first gravitated to the mob in the late 1980s
after moving to Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Accomplice witnesses have told investigators that as part of the Bonanno
holdup crew, Paciello was both mastermind and lookout for the 1992 robbery of a
branch bank in a Staten Island mall. Armed bandits smashed out windows with a
sledgehammer before making off with $300,000.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 18, 1993, the crew struck again, this time ringing the doorbell at
the home of Staten Island home of Shemtov, 46, on a tip that her businessman
husband had $200,000 stashed in a safe. Within minutes, a gunman had shot and
killed her; Paciello allegedly drove the getaway car as they fled, empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello made enough money to reinvent himself in South Beach by opening a
club called Risk in 1994, investigators say. The name was apt: Risk was
destroyed by fire in what authorities now suspect was an arson-insurance scam
which helped Paciello raise enough money to start Liquid.
</P>
<P>
	   Teaming with Casares - a member of a rich Cuban family which credits him
with helping her kick a drug habit - Paciello also opened the celebrity hangout
Bar Room and a restaurant, Joia, held fundraisers and bought a pricey
beach-front home. As his profile rose, so did stories linking him romantically
to the likes of Niki Taylor and Daisy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities say Paciello also had another acquaintance - an undercover
agent posing as a corrupt narcotics officer. The agent was making secret
recordings of their phone calls, evidence that prosecutors say exposes the
defendant as a career thug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got to get him beat up," Paciello allegedly said of Kelly. "I got to get
him whacked." Later, he warned that he would have to "come out of retirement.
I've become a big (sissy) down here. A big sucker."
</P>
<P>
	   About the same time, Paciello was observed introducing the undercover agent
to Alphonse Persico, then the acting boss of the Colombo crime family,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting has raised suspicions Paciello was laundering mob money through
his clubs. Prosecutors also allege that he allowed Liquid to become a haven for
dealers peddling the designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination of Paciello's violent background and newfound fame would
make him "a commodity to the Colombos," said Jerry Capeci, a crime expert
tracking the Mafia on his Ganglandnews.com. Web site. "He's willing to break
heads to make money and he's an entree to celebrities with lots of cash."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys have denied their client has any mob ties. And they
complain that the recorded conversations were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unfair to suggest that Chris Ludwigsen was plotting to kill anybody,
because that's nonsense," said attorney Howard Srebnick.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello is expected to be released from a Brooklyn jail by the end of the
month. But he will remain under house arrest until his trial in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the party goes on at Paciello's Bar Room. Madonna and Gwyneth
Paltrow were spotted dancing on tabletops there at 4 a.m. New Year's Day.

<HEADLINE> Man Jailed for Buying Hand Grenades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A white supremacist who admitted buying hand grenades,
which he allegedly wanted to use as mail bombs, has been sentenced to 10 years
in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Scott Gilliam pleaded guilty in August to federal firearms charges,
stemming from the purchase of the 10 grenades from an undercover federal agent.
</P>
<P>
	   When he bought the grenades, Gilliam had a cocked .45-caliber pistol on his
hip and his 20-month-old son in his arms, testified Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agent David Pasqualotto. Authorities said a search of his home
turned up an Uzi-type rifle with silencer, bomb-making instructions and white
supremacist literature, including white supremacist coloring books for children.
</P>
<P>
	   The sentence was double the term that attorneys had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't mean to hurt anybody,'' Gilliam told U.S. District Judge Richard
Vollmer at Friday's sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilliam, 28, of Foley, was arrested June 10 after telling an undercover ATF
agent he wanted to send the grenades as mail bombs, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
	   At earlier meetings with agents, Gilliam also said he wanted to purchase
C-4, a military explosive, to use in mail bombs to send to unspecified targets
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said he didn't want to be like the Unabomber, who wounded several
people and killed one,'' Pasqualotto testified. ``He wanted to kill everybody.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gilliam's attorney said he would appeal the sentence.

<HEADLINE> Coke Might Name Stahl President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Jack Stahl, a 46-year-old Coca-Cola executive who has been
with the company for 20 years, reportedly will be named the next president of
the soft drink giant.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke's board of directors is expected to select Stahl at its Tuesday
meeting, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said in its Sunday editions, citing
unidentified company officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jack is a huge asset to the company," said John Sicher, publisher of
Beverage Digest. "He has run the North American business, he's been chief
financial officer and his personal relations with the bottlers are excellent."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Warrants not always pursued in NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   AMSTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) - Police Chief Thomas Brownell sometimes wishes the
long arm of the law was a little bit longer.
<P>
	   He sees the problem regularly in this small Mohawk Valley city: An officer
makes a traffic stop or an arrest; a routine check uncovers an outstanding
warrant from the New York City area; police downstate decline to bring the
offender back.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically that means we've got the jerk living here," Brownell said. "We
don't want New York City's garbage, whether it comes by barge or ... bus."
</P>
<P>
	   Brownell is voicing frustration felt by a number of other upstate New York
police officers. While fugitives wanted on felony warrants are routinely
retrieved, the officers complain New York City authorities often will not pick
up people wanted on less serious misdemeanor warrants - charges like marijuana
possession or disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is considered a big enough public nuisance that the Schenectady
County sheriff has offered to have his own deputies drive offenders back to New
York City. And a state assemblyman from that area has just submitted a bill that
would set up a state funding stream to defray the cost of transporting those
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
	   "It kind of turns justice around on its head if you can go 150 miles up the
Thruway and not pay for breaking the law," Republican Assemblyman James Tedisco
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The warrant issue is tied up with the larger problem of criminals from New
York City migrating upstate. Even as crime rates have dropped in New York City,
some upstate areas have been grappling with relocated criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, police in Schenectady estimate that more than half the drug
suspects they arrest give New York City addresses. Albany Det. James Miller said
most of the 13 homicides there last year involved either a suspect or a victim
from New York City - many of them involved in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a safer climate for your low-level drug dealer to come up to Albany
and ply their trade," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least some of those offenders are leaving behind pending legal cases in
New York City. Law enforcement officials in Schenectady, Albany and Ulster
counties have reported stopping or arresting people with outstanding warrants
from downstate. If New York City refuses to retrieve them, they are released
back into those communities even if they end up serving local jail time.
</P>
<P>
	   "We kind of recontaminate the community," Schenectady County Sheriff Harry
Buffardi complained.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Police Lt. Dennis Cirillo said his department does travel
across the state to execute warrants but he said each case is judged on its own
merits.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look at the severity of the crime, the distance from the city coupled in
with the cost to the taxpayers," Cirillo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, the NYPD is one of the busiest police agencies anywhere. There
were 375,000 arrest cases in the New York City Criminal Court last year and the
city preliminarily reported 667 homicides for 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County District Attorney James Conboy noted that even far smaller
jurisdictions like his do not retrieve all fugitives. He noted that when a
person wanted locally for felony DWI was apprehended in the Midwest, local
officials decided not to saddle county taxpayers with the costs to bring the
offender back.
</P>
<P>
	   Tedisco, noting the costs to localities, has just proposed a bill that would
require the state to pay half the cost of ferrying absconders back to the town
or city where a warrant was issued. Municipalities could opt to pay the other
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, as a Republican in a chamber dominated by Democrats, Tedisco could
have an uphill fight. He has distributed copies of the bill to the Pataki
administration and hopes to hold hearings this year to build support.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffardi, meanwhile, has offered to have his department ferry offenders back
downstate. Problem is, he would need more money for the unbudgeted expense.
</P>
<P>
	   But as some police officers noted, even if more warrants were enforced, it
wouldn't totally stem the flow of criminals to upstate cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Schenectady Lt. Mike Hamilton noted: "In all likelihood they would come back
and commit the crimes anyway. It would just be a few days later."

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Hold Last Iowa Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates met Saturday in
one final Iowa debate before the first votes are cast in the 2000 campaign a
week from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   They put their rival styles and proposals on televised display aimed at the
Iowa Republicans who will gather in living rooms, school houses and village
halls to begin the process that will put one of them atop the GOP ticket next
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the frontrunner and commanding favorite in the
Iowa polls, has been arguing at a distance with his closest challengers, Sen.
John McCain and Steve Forbes, about their competing tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The lagging trio in the GOP field, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute debate was sponsored by The Des Moines Register and held at
the studios of Iowa Public Television. Questions came from the newspaper's
readers and were asked by its editor, Dennis Ryerson. The candidates also had a
chance to question one another.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days before
the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically eve with
the Texan in the latest surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Arizona senator isn't competing in Iowa, appearing in the debates
but without campaigning actively. So Forbes is No. 2, and far behind -- Bush
holds polling leads ranging up to nearly 30 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, Forbes and McCain have clashed on taxes in person and in a barrage of
television ads. Bush promised tax cuts ``so help me God'' in an earlier New
Hampshire debate, but McCain argues that the governor's $483, five-year cut
would spend more than the budget surplus and would not adequately protect the
future financing of Social Security. Forbes scoffs at both as proposals that
would preserve a system he wants erased in favor of a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
	   The self-financed candidate, heir to a magazine fortune, is broadcasting ads
attacking Bush for allegedly breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by
including increases in some sales and business taxes in a plan to cut property
taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, was featured in a
Des Moines Register ad saying he feared that the kind of negative ads that
wounded him in the last campaign ``may be happening again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ad didn't name Forbes, but the target was obvious. In 1996, Forbes waged
a blistering attack campaign on Dole, inflicting campaign damage that lasted
into the final campaign against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I emerged the Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke, and a much
easier target for the negative Clinton-Gore fall campaign,'' Dole said in his
open letter ad.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's wife, dropout candidate Elizabeth Dole, has endorsed Bush. Dole
himself has not publicly endorsed a candidate for the 2000 nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The key to the caucuses will be the ability of the rival campaigns to turn
out voters to register their preferences on a winter's Monday night, at 7 p.m.
There are no day-long voting hours as in a primary; to participate, Republicans
have to be at their caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a matter of building up strong support and then convincing people
to show up in a living room or a gymnasium on caucus time,'' Bush said, stopping
by a campaign headquarters on Saturday. ``It's a moment in time. It's a
different dynamic than a primary.''

<HEADLINE> Miami Club Boss Indicted for Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Until last month, Chris Paciello confidently reigned over a
South Beach nightclub regime catering to the see-and-be-seen set.
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna, Donald Trump, Jennifer Lopez -- all hung out at Paciello's Florida
clubs, lounging in black leather booths, sipping Dom Perignon and schmoozing
with the beefy, dark-haired owner.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities claim the true picture of Paciello can be found seven years
ago in the more mundane setting of Staten Island. It was there that housewife
Judith Shemtov was shot in the head -- part of what prosecutors say is a violent
past that has finally caught up to Paciello.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 1, the Brooklyn native surrendered in Miami on federal murder and
robbery charges after he was named in a New York indictment accusing him of
being a former member of the ``Beach Avenue Crew.''
</P>
<P>
	   The goon squad, authorities say, provided muscle for the Bonanno crime
family, killing a half-dozen people. They claim Paciello, 28, whose legal name
is Christian Ludwigsen, was known as ``the Binger'' for his violent crime
binges.
</P>
<P>
	   The case could put Paciello in jail for life and destroy his multimillion
dollar enterprises. Friends of the man whom the Miami weekly New Times called
South Beach's ``dangerous darling'' have been stunned by the sudden fall after
his mercurial rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Kelly, an ex-Paciello employee and now a competing Miami Beach
nightclub owner, was incredulous when told by authorities that his former boss
once discussed having him ``whacked.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is definitely a 'Jekyll and Hyde' situation,'' said Kelly, who
recalled Paciello as a kind man. ``I never, ever even heard him raise his voice.
I thought he was my friend. ... It's scary as hell.''
</P>
<P>
	   The South Beach glitterati have rallied behind Paciello, putting up personal
property to secure a $15 million bail bond earlier this month. They say their
friend is a legitimate entrepreneur who succeeded because of his shy charm.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello's attorney, Roy Black, says his client from Brooklyn's tough
Bensonhurst neighborhood is a ``young man who's turned his life around.'' He
notes that Paciello -- despite growing up among criminals and being arrested
several times -- was never convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, the way our society works is when someone becomes
successful ... they become a target,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello himself has said of the mob rumors: ``It doesn't make me a gangster
because I hung out on the corner with people while I was growing up.'' He says
he uses his mother's maiden name, Paciello, because his parents broke up -- not
to escape his past.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors call the portrait a sham, saying Paciello's move to Florida
meant only a switch in allegiance to the Colombo crime family. They accuse him
of settling scores with assaults and death threats and suspect he also laundered
mob money through his clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a character trait of Mr. Ludwigsen to resort to violent activity,''
said James Walden, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege Paciello first gravitated to the mob on Staten Island in
the late 1980s. They say former accomplices have named Paciello as the
mastermind of a $300,000 bank robbery by an armed gang in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 18, 1993, the crew struck again, this time ringing the doorbell at
the Staten Island home of Shemtov, 46, intending to rob $200,000 supposedly
stashed there. A gunman killed her, the robbers fled empty handed, and Paciello
allegedly drove the getaway car.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello then re-invented himself in South Beach, opening a club called Risk
in 1994. It was later destroyed by a fire that authorities suspect was set,
providing the insurance money to start his trendy dance spot Liquid.
</P>
<P>
	   Teaming with Ingrid Casares -- daughter of a rich Cuban family and a close
friend of Madonna -- Paciello also opened the celebrity hangout Bar Room and a
restaurant, Joia. As his profile rose, so did stories linking him romantically
to the likes of Niki Taylor and Daisy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities say Paciello had another acquaintance -- an undercover agent
posing as a corrupt narcotics officer whose secret recordings of phone calls
provide evidence that Paciello is a career thug.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got to get him beat up,'' Paciello allegedly said of Kelly. ``I got to
get him whacked.'' Later, he warned that he would have to ``come out of
retirement. I've become a big (sissy) down here. A big sucker.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys complain the recorded conversations were taken out of
context and deny their client has mob ties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unfair to suggest that Chris Ludwigsen was plotting to kill anybody,
because that's nonsense,'' said attorney Howard Srebnick.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello is expected to be released from a Brooklyn jail later this month
but will remain under house arrest at a relative's home in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the party goes on at his South Beach night spots. Madonna and
Gwyneth Paltrow were spotted dancing on the tabletops of his Bar Room at 4 a.m.
New Year's Day.

<HEADLINE> Money Revelations Stun Kohl's Party  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Revelations of campaign money irregularities by a state
branch of Germany's Christian Democrats deepened the party's finance scandal and
prompted calls Saturday for nullification of its victory in last year's state
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   A Christian Democratic leader in Hesse stunned the nation late Friday by
disclosing that party leaders had channeled millions to their organization from
foreign accounts and declared the money improperly. The amounts involved were
the biggest yet in the ever-expanding finance scandal touched off by former
chancellor Helmut Kohl that has dominated German politics for weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   National party leaders expressed dismay. ``Money laundering like the
Mafia,'' said Saturday's front-page headline in the daily Bild.
</P>
<P>
	   In Friday's revelation, a former Cabinet minister under Kohl who used to
chair the Hesse Christian Democrats said the state branch transferred $6.8
million to its coffers from abroad between 1989 and 1996. To hide the money's
origin, the party listed it as stemming from bequests, said the former minister,
Manfred Kanther.
</P>
<P>
	   National party leaders, including Kohl, were not informed about the
transfers, and neither was Hesse Gov. Roland Koch until now, said Casimir of
Sayn-Wittgenstein, the state party's then-treasurer. His remarks were reported
Saturday by the news magazine Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Monday, Koch, a Christian Democrat, had insisted the state
organization's books were in order.
</P>
<P>
	   The governing Social Democrats charged that the allegedly illegal campaign
funds tainted the Hesse state elections they narrowly lost last year. They urged
a fresh ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To prevent much greater damage to democracy, there is only one way out:
The voters must decide anew,'' said Hans Eichel, who was voted out as governor
and now is German finance minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats rejected the demand. Koch has refused to resign over
the affair.
</P>
<P>
	   The revelations on top of the finance scandal in the national party have the
Christian Democrats reeling as they try to focus on a state election next month
in Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All this is very hard to take,'' party general secretary Angela Merkel
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal erupted last month when Kohl admitted accepting up to $1 million
in cash donations and failing to declare them in apparent contempt of the law.
He has refused to name the donors despite repeated appeals from his party to
help clear up the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament is investigating whether payoffs influenced decisions by Kohl's
government, a suggestion Kohl vehemently denies.

<HEADLINE> Bada-bing! New Jerseyans love how mob hit portrays their state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - The cast of "The Sopranos" is here. Lorraine
Bracco, Steven Van Zandt, Michael Imperioli - and about 400 people from New
Jersey.
<P>
	   "How many times does a state become a star of a television series?" the
show's creator, David Chase, asked at a screening this week of HBO's wildly
successful mob hit.
</P>
<P>
	   It's true. "The Sopranos," which begins its second, 13-episode season on
Sunday, is set here. And unlike most television shows, it's filmed here. The
story of suburban mobster Tony Soprano and his two "families" has racked up 10
million viewers in its first season, plus four Emmy awards and raves by critics
who call it one of the best television series ever made.
</P>
<P>
	   And New Jerseyans say the series has shone a national spotlight on the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's practically the world's most expensive home movie," said Steve
Gorelick, assistant director of the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents have called Gorelick asking to have their homes used for the show.
The show has been shot in about 20 cities from Asbury Park to Paramus. Gritty,
industrial landscapes serve as a backdrop for mob activities, while suburban
tract homes and soccer fields in the same area show Tony Soprano's family side.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like, Uh! That was the diner in Fort Lee, and that was in Lodi and
that was in Newark," Newark Mayor Sharpe James said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meat market where Tony and his buddies talk business is in Kearny. The
nursing home where Livia Soprano, Tony's mother, lives is in West Orange. Bada
Bing!, the exotic dancing club that Tony runs, is in Lodi. And Pleasantdale
Chateau, the site of Thursday's screening, was set to serve as a the site of a
Soprano meeting in Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The scenes are certainly New Jersey. I don't know about the lifestyle they
project," said John Kosko, borough administrator of North Caldwell, where the
exteriors of the Soprano home are filmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Paramus resident Clara Nagy doesn't have a problem with the show's criminal
element.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do you know how much mob there is in New Jersey?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   And Paterson Police Chief Lawrence Spagnola, who worked on narcotics and
organized crime task forces in the 1970s, says, "I've seen a few families like
that. They're out there."
</P>
<P>
	   But New Jerseyans say they relate more to the characters' nuclear family
lives in the settings they call home.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows the problems they're having with their kids," Clifton Police Chief
Frank Logioco said. "I think the characters are absolutely perfect."
</P>
<P>
	   Those attending the screening applauded the most for Van Zandt, a longtime
Jersey celebrity for his membership in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and
then in Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd also clapped more on screen for Nancy Marchand's Livia, a
manipulative mother who, when she felt neglected and cast aside, fought back by
putting out a hit on her son.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dysfunctional as it is," Chief Spagnola said, "it's just an average
family."

<HEADLINE> Serb Paramilitary Leader Said Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Zeljko Raznatovic, the notorious Serb
paramilitary leader better known as Arkan, was shot and killed Saturday in a
Belgrade hotel, reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was shot in the head and rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery,
said police at the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A doctor at Belgrade's emergency hospital said he had seen Arkan and that
``all vital functions had stopped.'' One policeman also said that he had died,
either en route or after arrival at the hospital. The doctor and the police
officer both asked their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
	   Two independent news outlets, Studio B television and the Beta news agency,
also said he was dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, who was indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal, was shot in the
lobby of Belgrade's Hotel Intercontinental by a group of attackers, said
witnesses who asked for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his body guards, identified as Momcilo Mandic, was killed and another
person also seriously injured. The group was sitting in a sectioned-off part of
the lobby when the assailants attacked.
</P>
<P>
	   A source said Arkan was hit by at least one round from a Heckler and Koch
submachine gun that apparently hit him in the eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces
sided with Serb rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo
</P>
<P>
	   He has denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Reputedly one of Serbia's richest men, Arkan is wanted for bank robberies in
Western Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. He also is believed to have amassed
wealth from war profiteering.

<HEADLINE> Chile Vote Too Close To Call  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL CORMIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sunday's presidential election in Chile is so close
that not even pollsters will hazard a guess who will win: socialist Ricardo
Lagos or his rightist rival, Joaquin Lavin.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 8 million Chileans are eligible to cast ballots in a run-off vote for a
new leader in this country, where the economy is emerging from its deepest
recession in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic considerations will be uppermost in voters' minds as they choose
between Lavin, the strongest conservative candidate in years, and Lagos,
representing the Concertacion, a center-left coalition that has governed Chile
since a dictatorship ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men battled to a virtual draw in an initial ballot on Dec. 12. Lagos
received 47.9 percent of the vote and Lavin received 47.5 percent. A simple
majority was needed to win outright.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This election is going to be just as close as the first round,'' Lavin
said in an interview published Saturday in El Mercurio, Chile's leading
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The two most recent polls were divided, each giving the rival candidates a
lead of less than 1 percentage point -- less than the 3 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding
Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat who was constitutionally barred from
re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar-sounding
promises to fight rising street crime, aid strapped farmers, and create hundreds
of thousands of jobs. To some, that made it hard to distinguish between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes no difference to me, they're both the same,'' said fish seller
Eduardo Fuenzalida.
</P>
<P>
	   While Lagos, 61, was far head in polls early in the race, Lavin,
representing the opposition Alliance for Chile, gained momentum as the campaign
proceeded.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost boyish looking at 46, Lavin is a successful two-term mayor of Las
Condes, Santiago's swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on
that suburb's streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome could be swayed by how well either candidate has done in
alluring support from roughly 800,000 voters who did not vote the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lavin has attracted a huge mass of voters who are not ideologically
motivated,'' said Eugenio Guzman, a Chilean sociologist who observed that Lavin
focused more on the economy and unemployment early on.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lagos, who has a Ph.D. in economics from Duke University, has attracted
attention by promising unemployment insurance in a country seeking to improve
its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first measure in my government will be to create unemployment
insurance, take my word for it,'' said Lagos, a former opponent of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployment has improved to 9.6 percent after climbing as high as 11
percent, and the economy has begun to grow again after a two-year slump.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos remains a hero for Pinochet foes. After leftist guerrillas made an
attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos was one of several leftists arrested
by state security services in a crackdown. Although he had nothing to do with
that attempt, Lagos spent several days in jail, coming out to work full time for
the restoration of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his iron rule.
</P>
<P>
	   A move to extradite Pinochet to Spain won court approval. But after months
of legal wrangling, British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel
of doctors concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw said he was reconsidering the extradition, which could open the door
for Pinochet to return home to Chile within weeks. Both Lavin and Lagos have
said they would allow Pinochet to be tried at home if he returns.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts Concerning Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Key facts about Chile, which holds a presidential run-off election Sunday,
Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ELECTION SUNDAY: More than 8 million voters are registered to take part in
the presidential election. Winner to succeed President Eduardo Frei, 59, for a
six-year term.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   CANDIDATES:
</P>
<P>
	   --Ricardo Lagos, 61, a moderate socialist. Backed by the center-left
coalition that has governed Chile since civilian rule was restored in 1990,
ending Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   --Joaquin Lavin, 46, a conservative economist supported by a unified
right-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates battled to a virtual draw in a first round vote Dec. 12,
forcing the run-off, as no candidate received a majority of the vote. Lagos
received 47.9 percent, Lavin 47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   COUNTRY: Located on South America's western seaboard, Chile runs 2,700 miles
south from Peru, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Argentina. A long and
narrow country, Chile has average width of 110 miles. Population: 14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   POLITICS: A republic, Chile enjoyed one of the longest-lasting democracies
in Latin America until 1973, when a bloody military coup led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet toppled Marxist President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's authoritarian rule lasted until 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, he was arrested in Britain on a warrant by a Spanish judge
who wants to extradite and try him on torture charges stemming from human rights
abuses during his regime. In the final week of the campaign, Britain said he is
too ill to stand trial, which could lead to his return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ECONOMY: Chile pioneered liberal, free markets policies in Latin America
with remarkable success in the mid-80s. For over a decade, growth averaged 7
percent annually. But as the Asian financial turmoil spread throughout Latin
America, the economy suffered its worst recession in 16 years. Unemployment has
reached a record 11 percent, but signs of recovery have appeared.

   CLIVE, Iowa (AP) -- Flanked by pine trees, and with a parking lot full of
semitrailer trucks as a backdrop, Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer
chided the Clinton administration Saturday for not protecting its borders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing a lousy job in exporting more Iowa farm products out of this
country, and we're doing a terrible job in importing a lot of trouble, whether
it's illegal aliens or the drugs pouring across the border from Mexico,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative activist stepped out of a maroon Dodge Voyager and met with
reporters at the Flying J truck stop at the junction of Interstates 35 and 80.
Bauer said he wanted to use ``this great crossroads here in Iowa'' as a backdrop
to emphasize that he differs from his GOP counterparts on trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I particularly believe the front-runners in my party right now on major
issues are embracing policies that are identical to Bill Clinton,'' Bauer said.
``George Bush, John McCain and Orrin Hatch will all give China
most-favored-nation status again. I'm incredulous at that. I don't know an
adjective to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most-favored-nation'' status is normal trade relations, the country's
relationship with almost every country. Officials in Washington use the term to
``permanent normal trade status'' when referring to China.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Globe endorsed Vice President Al Gore and Sen.
John McCain in New Hampshire's Democratic and Republican presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In editorials published Saturday, New England's largest newspaper described
Gore as ``the most competent among the Democrats to lead the country in a
complicated world.'' Among the Republicans, McCain's ``forays into the
unconventional are sensible as well as bold.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two members of the Texas Board of Education said
Saturday that George W. Bush is distorting his record on education and endorsed
Steve Forbes for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Offut, who has served on the education board for seven years, and
Donna Ballard, a former board member and activist, said the education system in
Texas has deteriorated during Bush's four years as Texas' governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says in campaign ads that he supports local control of schools, Ballard
said, but as governor Bush broke his promise to restore local control. Ballard
said authority has been stripped from state and local elected boards while Bush
has been governor, with power given to an existing state agency or newly
appointed boards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Texas leads the nation in improving schools,'' said Bush spokesman Eric
Woolson. ``It's documented, and it's clear for all to see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Any signs of improvement in the system resulted from making tests easier,
Ballard charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush ``has not been forthcoming on the issues,'' Forbes said as he predicted
a ``good showing'' in the Jan. 24 Iowa Caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Ballard and Offut said they supported Bush when he ran for governor.
Their transportation to Iowa was paid by the Forbes campaign.

	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has picked up the
endorsements of 94 Republican National Committee members and state GOP chairmen
and -women.
</P>
<P>
	   They represent a majority of the 165 members of the committee, holding its
winter meeting in San Jose. The 94 amount to 85 percent of GOP officials
eligible under state by-laws to endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are the heart and soul of the Republican Party, chosen by GOP
volunteers, the good folks who do the hard work of putting up signs, handing out
fliers and getting people to the polls,'' Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh
said in thanking the group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Bush said: ``I am honored and humbled by the support of so
many grass-roots Republican leaders from every corner of our country.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Massacre Anniversary Marked  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Laying wreaths and reading poems, thousands of
Kosovo Albanians gathered on a snowy hillside Saturday for the first anniversary
of the mass killing that shocked the world and set in motion NATO's campaign
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians were killed by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's forces before the Racak massacre, and thousands of others lost their
lives later. But the killings of 45 men, women and children in Racak carry a
special significance in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Racak ``galvanized the pain we had been feeling at the time with an
understanding of the international community that the only way to stop Milosevic
was to show teeth,'' said Veton Surroi, an independent Albanian politician.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before the crowd began arriving for the graveside ceremony Saturday, a
bomb ripped through a Serbian Orthodox church in eastern Kosovo -- a grim
reminder that revenge-minded aggression still wracks the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In another case of ethnic violence, Serbs and ethnic Albanians tangled in a
northern town Friday. Two ethnic Albanians sustained head injuries in what began
as a fist fight in Kosovska Mitrovica, 20 miles north of Pristina, said U.N.
police spokesman Philippe Pacaud.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly afterward, an ethnic Albanian opened fire with a machine gun on
Serbs. No one was reported wounded, but NATO troops and U.N. police had to
separate the angry crowds that formed on the two sides of a bridge separating
the Serb and ethnic Albanian halves of the town.
</P>
<P>
	   In Racak, relatives of some of those killed in the massacre laid wreaths at
the graves marked with slabs of red-painted wood, as mourners looked on from the
hillside.
</P>
<P>
	   During the two-hour ceremony, local officials recited poems commemorating
the dead and former leaders of the officially disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army
gave speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Racak massacre marked a turning point in the new history of Kosovo,''
said Hashim Thaci, the former KLA political leader. ``We now should build a new,
free and democratic order that will be an example not only for Kosovars, but for
all the region.''
</P>
<P>
	   One year ago, the discovery of a bloody trail of bodies in the hills around
Racak in the wake of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels prompted William
Walker -- the American who was then the top international official in Kosovo --
to condemn the atrocity as a ``massacre'' of civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker's statement, and the pictures of the bodies -- their belongings
scattered on the ground, their faces bloodied and disfigured, many shot at close
range -- sparked international uproar that led to the first steps toward the
78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia launched in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Murat Metusai, 33, was in Switzerland last Jan. 15 when Serb-led forces
entered the village and went from house to house, herding together groups of
men, some of whom they later marched up the hill and shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, including Metusai's father, Haki, and mother, Sahide, tried to flee,
but Serbs opened fire killing them both. His mother's body was never found.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We searched everywhere,'' he said, standing solemnly over her open grave
filled with snow and still waiting for her body.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though it was a terrible massacre,'' he said. ``I think it did a lot
for Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Civil Rights Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton marked Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday Saturday by urging Congress to step up civil rights enforcement and
expand the federal hate crimes law to protect homosexuals, women and the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are still too many barriers and examples of too many Americans
facing discrimination in their daily lives,'' even though the country is doing
better in treating all citizens equally, the president said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking on King's 71st birthday and two days before the nation's official
celebration, Clinton renewed a commitment to add acts of hatred motivated by
sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of hate crimes already
covered -- acts sparked by prejudice based on race, religion, color or national
origin.
</P>
<P>
	   A move to expand the law died last year because of opposition from
Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such hate crimes leave deep scars not just on the victims but on our
larger community, for they take aim at others for who they are, and when they do
they take aim at America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that in his fiscal 2001 budget he wants ``the largest ever
investment to enforce our civil rights laws.'' He plans to seek $695 million, a
13 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals were criticized by the GOP's highest-ranking black lawmaker in
the House, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican
Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said Clinton's hate crimes proposal was as an effort to ``separate and
divide,'' to tell crime victims that ``some lives are more important than
others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Money for enforcing civil rights laws should go to encourage prosperity in
struggling minority communities ``instead of creating a larger Washington
bureaucracy,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seated near Clinton during the Oval Office address was 100-year-old
Charlotte Filmore, a black woman who worked at the White House as a housekeeper
during the Eisenhower administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The president called Mrs. Filmore a living testament to civil rights
progress in America, as well as to the open discrimination of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A good while ago she worked at the White House -- back then, even here,
she had to use a side door,'' Clinton said. ``Well, today, Charlotte Filmore
came to the White House through the front door and all the way to the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm so glad I lived to see this day,'' said Mrs. Filmore, born Oct. 2,
1899.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's proposal, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice
Department would receive $98 million, a 20 percent increase over last year and
86 percent above spending levels in the first year of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proposed funding will permit the Justice Department to expand
significantly investigations and prosecutions of criminal civil rights cases --
including hate crimes and police misconduct -- as well as fair housing and
lending cases,'' the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he also will seek $322 million for the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, 14 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other substantial boosts are being sought throughout the government, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No American in the 21st century should have to face discrimination when it
comes to finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican radio address, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe also invoked King's
memory as she urged bipartisan cooperation to improve education, Social
Security, health care and Medicare and to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On this weekend when we celebrate the life of Martin Luther King Jr., we
are reminded that our nation is at its strongest when we work past our
differences,'' Snowe said.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Daughter Hurt in Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The daughter of Vice President Gore was slightly injured
when another vehicle ran a red light and smashed into her car, police said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kristin Gore, 22, was treated at the scene for pain in her neck and left
elbow, Officer Guillermo Campos said. A passenger in her car, whose name was not
released, was treated for shoulder pain, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Gore, one of the vice president's four children, was driving north in
Hollywood late Friday when a car heading east ran a light and hit her car,
Campos said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both cars had moderate damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Secret Service agents took Ms. Gore away after the accident, said Sgt. Al
Ruvalcaba.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver of the other car was not drunk, Campos said. He did not know if
the driver was cited.
</P>
<P>
	   The traffic report did not say what Ms. Gore, a 1999 graduate of Harvard,
was doing in the area.

<HEADLINE> King Holiday Was Long, Tough Battle  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had been dead just four days
when Rep. John Conyers, moved by riots that shook several cities, introduced
legislation to make the slain civil rights leader's birthday a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   For the next 15 years, the Michigan Democrat filed his bill at the start of
each Congress, only to see it go nowhere amid apathy, widely held pessimism
about its future and outright hostility from lawmakers who considered King a
communist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many people said they thought this was a good idea, but they didn't see
how it was going to happen,'' Conyers said last week in a telephone interview
from his Detroit office.
</P>
<P>
	   It did finally happen, with the first federal observance of Martin Luther
King Jr. Day in 1986. On Monday, two days after what would have been King's 71st
birthday, every state will observe some form of civil rights celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, King's family focused on getting the holiday observed around
the country. Now the family and others hope it evolves into a day off in which
Americans do something more than sleep late or go shopping. They are encouraging
Americans to spend the day volunteering or helping the less fortunate. The theme
for 2000 is ``Remember! Celebrate! Act! A Day On, Not A Day Off!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The King holiday bill is really being honored in a way that makes me quite
proud. The celebrations are very appropriate,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   A key to getting the holiday passed was the public support of entertainers
such as Stevie Wonder, Dizzy Gillespie, Harry Bellafonte and Bob Dylan, Conyers
said. Wonder's 1980 tribute to King, ``Happy Birthday,'' became an anthem for
the campaign and planted the idea of a national King holiday in the American
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the popular culture, the idea was advanced,'' said Mary Frances Berry,
head of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and a University of Pennsylvania
history and law professor. ``Without the popular culture, it never would have
gone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some opponents claimed King, who was assassinated in 1968, was a social
menace who flirted with communists and did more than that with women. His
objection to the Vietnam War enraged millions.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents also argued that it would cost a fortune to give workers another
day off. And some people simply saw no good use for another winter holiday, said
Stanford University history professor Clayborne Carson, director of the MLK
Papers Project there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The notion of another three-day holiday in the middle of winter was not
good,'' Carson said. ``They said, 'What are people going to do?' In places where
you can ski, that might not have been a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from the rancorous political debate over whether King deserved such
recognition, many were taken by the audacity of proposing a new national holiday
for an individual.
</P>
<P>
	   Only George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Christopher Columbus received
such distinction, and national holidays themselves are rare and strange
creations, said David Garrow, an Emory University history and political science
professor who won the Pulitzer Prize for his 1987 King biography.
</P>
<P>
	   The last new federal holiday was Veterans Day, adopted in 1938. Many in
Congress were displeased in the 1970s when the Washington and Lincoln
observances were lumped into one as Presidents Day.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Conyers persisted, support was slowly growing in churches, state
legislatures, even in other countries. Finally, President Reagan conceded the
growing pressure in 1983 and said he would sign the bill if it reached him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll never forget that day in the debates in the Senate,'' Conyers said.
``They made us look like pikers. They bragged about King, they told us how
patriotic he was, what a super American he was, how much he had done for the
country. When they finally decided to come over, man, they ran to the front of
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is now entrenched. Last summer, New Hampshire
changed its Civil Rights Day to honor King specifically and a bill is pending in
the Utah Legislature, which convenes on the third Monday of January, to rename
the state's Human Rights Day in King's honor.
</P>
<P>
	   But observances still tend to be spotty. While every state gives its workers
either a paid or ``floating'' holiday they can use on King day, several Southern
states combine their observance with honors for Confederate generals Robert E.
Lee or Stonewall Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets, federal offices and most banks and schools are closed,
but only 23 percent of businesses offer the day as a paid holiday, according to
a survey of 413 companies by the Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., which sells
data and research to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, only 14 percent of companies surveyed observed the holiday, survey
director Mike Reidy said.

<HEADLINE> China Quakes Kill 4, Injure 400  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Two earthquakes struck southwest China 1 1/2 hours apart
Saturday, killing at least four people, injuring 400 others and collapsing
thousands of buildings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.9-magnitude quake hit Yao'an county in Yunnan province, about 900 miles
west of Hong Kong, at 6:09 a.m. local time, sending people running from their
homes. An even stronger aftershock with a magnitude of 6.5 struck 90 minutes
later, according to a county seismologist who gave just his surname, Su.
</P>
<P>
	   Four people were killed, 29 were seriously injured and 371 were slightly
hurt, government seismologists and state-run television said. The State
Seismology Bureau in Beijing said 4,000 buildings collapsed, but state-run
television said up to 10,000 buildings had fallen or were seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Television footage showed crumbled mud walls and a house with a caved-in
wooden beam roof. Medical staff in white coats treated some of the injured on
beds in the street. An old women and three children huddled under quilts on a
layer of straw.
</P>
<P>
	   The main compound of Yao'an's government headquarters was seriously damaged,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. Power in the area also was out, it added.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was no damage to a valuable historical site 30 miles from the
epicenter where remains of China's oldest fossil man were found in 1965, Xinhua
said. The site of Yuanmou Homo Erectus, who is believed to have lived 1.7
million years ago, is now a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
	   Quakes in China often produce high figures for building damage because of
fragile building materials and also because officials may count smaller
structures other than homes. Outside Chinese cities, one-story homes --
sometimes made of mud bricks -- are common.
</P>
<P>
	   In the town of Guantun, 18 miles from Yao'an, the early morning quakes woke
tens of thousands of people and sent residents flocking into the streets, Xinhua
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities moved in 10 tons of building material, 5,000 rolls of woolen
felt and food into affected areas, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong tremor also was felt in the provincial capital Kunming, some 125
miles to the east of Yao'an, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yao'an was also hit by a 6.5-magnitude quake in 1962 and a 5.6-magnitude
quake on August 14, 1993, Xinhua said.

   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen shot and killed a notorious Serb
paramilitary leader on Saturday in the lobby of the Belgrade Intercontinental
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, had been indicted for war crimes
in Bosnia, and his paramilitary forces have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during Serbia's war with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Reputedly one of Serbia's wealthiest individuals, Arkan was a longtime ally
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   After the shooting, Arkan, 47, was taken to a hospital for emergency
surgery, police at the scene said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A doctor at Belgrade's emergency hospital said he had seen Arkan and that
``all vital functions had stopped.'' A police officer also said that Arkan had
died, either en route or after arrival at the hospital. The doctor and the
police officer both asked their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
	   Two independent news outlets, Studio B television and the Beta news agency,
also said he was dead, but there was no confirmation from official sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Momcilo Mandic, one of Arkan's bodyguards, also was killed and another
person was seriously wounded, said a source in the hotel who also asked not be
identified. The source said the gunmen used a Heckler and Koch submachine gun
and escaped after at least one bullet hit Arkan in the eye while he was sitting
in a sectioned-off part of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces
sided with Serb rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo
</P>
<P>
	   He denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was wanted for bank robberies in Western Europe in the 1970s and
1980s. In the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia that began in 1991, the Belgrade ice
cream parlor owner made his fortune in black market currency trading, oil
smuggling and arms dealing.
</P>
<P>
	   His ``Tigers'' militia, meanwhile, became known for savagery.
</P>
<P>
	   During the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia, Arkan frequently warned the
Atlantic Alliance against a land invasion, warning of fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   He and his wife Ceca, a popular Serbian folk singer, were frequent nightly
visitors to Belgrade's Hyatt Hotel during the bombing, apparently fearing to
stay at home and risk becoming a NATO target.

<HEADLINE> Prize-Winning AP Photographer Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Henry Burroughs, an award-winning photographer who
chronicled three decades of news for The Associated Press, including the
presidencies of Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, died late
Friday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs died at his home in West River, Md., from complications of
pneumonia. His wife of 28 years, Margaret, was at his side.
</P>
<P>
	   Known as ``Hank,'' Burroughs joined the wire service on May 16, 1944, and
quickly gained a reputation as a journalist who could capture a great picture
without getting in the way of the story. Colleagues called him the ``dean of the
Washington photographers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was such a marvelous representative of the AP and the photography
profession itself,'' former AP Photo Editor Hal Buell said. ``He was really a
great example of what every fine news photographer should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retired UPI photographer Maurice Johnson said Burroughs took great care with
his subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a few of us who believe we are capable of getting a story,
photos, without being obtrusive and obnoxious. He always worked hard on stories,
but he was very aware of the people he was photographing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Daugherty, director of the AP's state photo center, said that from the
time he first arrived in Washington in 1967, he hoped to emulate Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he probably taught me and taught a lot of others to be a first
rate photojournalist while being a gentleman,'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter R. Mears, who has reported on Washington and national politics for
the AP for more than 35 years, said the bespectacled Burroughs brought intellect
to the job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was both a fine photographer and a scholarly, gentleman. Those traits
don't always go together,'' Mears said.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Henry Dashiell Burroughs Jr. on Aug. 1, 1918 in Washington, D.C., he
took to photography from his earliest years and spent six years as a fashion and
advertising photographer at The Washington Post before joining the AP.
</P>
<P>
	   At the wire service, he covered every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt
to Gerald Ford. His most memorable images include a photo of Richard Nixon
standing at the window of the Oval Office just as his presidency was about to
collapse and a photo of Kennedy just moments before his assassination.
</P>
<P>
	   The day Kennedy was shot in 1963, Burroughs was in the motorcade. He made
sure the world got pictures from the chaotic scene near the book depository and
of the mob outside the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs took a rare photograph of Roosevelt in his wheelchair, an image
that went unpublished because pictures of the president's handicap were
forbidden by the White House at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs won awards for a picture of President Johnson in deep thought
prior to a press conference on Vietnam and for a photo of Sen. Thomas Eagleton
and his wife leaving a cabin in the hills of South Dakota after informing
Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern, who had chosen Eagleton as
his running mate, that he had once undergone treatment for mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs served as president of the White House News Photographers
Association in 1957 and was chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for still
photographers. In 1964, he received the first AP Managing Editors Award for
photographic excellence.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1973, he was named ``Photographer of the Year'' by the White House News
Photographers Association. He was a member of the National Press Club for more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs once said that he felt lucky to have had ``a front-row ticket to
history.'' He was first assigned to the White House in 1949, and of all the
presidents he covered, Truman was his favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He loved photographers and we loved him,'' Burroughs once said. ``Any time
you walked in the Oval Office with Truman he would make some remark about us or
to us with his guest. And he'd put everybody at ease. We were part of his
party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Colleagues said Burroughs had a special talent for capturing lighter,
informal moments. Among his indelible images was a January 1961 photo of Jackie
Kennedy patting her husband's chin just moments after he was sworn in as
president and a 1957 photo of Richard and Pat Nixon throwing coins over their
shoulders at the Trevi fountain in Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   In his career, Burroughs drew many overseas assignments, beginning in
war-ravaged Paris and Berlin after World War II. He was arrested and detained by
a Soviet Army officer for taking photos of Red troops marching in East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs retired from the AP in 1975, after 31 years with the news service.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs was predeceased by first wife Elizabeth Anderson, second wife Anne
Simpson Moore, and his brother, David.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife, Margaret Wohlgemuth of Annapolis, Md.; one
stepson, Lyford Moore, of Mount Laurel, NJ.; stepdaughter Patricia Romero of
Boise, Idaho; two sisters, Jane Dollins of Alexandria, Va.; and Rosemary Schulte
of Towson, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Services were scheduled for Tuesday at noonat Our Lady of Sorrows Church in
West River, Md.

<HEADLINE> Technicality Frees Convicted Killers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Authorities were forced to free 11 convicted mob killers
from life prison terms Saturday after courts missed a crucial deadline in the
convicts' cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy's clogged court system mandates three trials before a conviction
becomes final. Courts first convicted the 11 defendants in 1998 in a mob
supertrial in Milan. But they let the 1 1-2-year maximum between trials go by at
midnight Friday without opening the second trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11 were among 80 people arrested in 1994 in a crackdown on mobs
trafficking guns and drugs in northern Italy. Some of the released prisoners,
including a man implicated in 59 killings, will go immediately to witness
protection programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are dangerous people and the danger is that they will return to
committing crimes,'' warned Marco Maria Alma, a deputy prosecutor in the
mobsters' trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 53 prisoners had convictions thrown out Saturday because the
trial deadline expired. In addition to the 11 killers, a second group will be
released from convictions for less serious crimes. Two dozen others will remain
behind bars on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Court officials blamed Italy's complicated legal system for the prisoners'
releases. They said they were overwhelmed by a case involving scores of
defendants and scores of charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy's labyrinthine legal system makes for years-long trials, averaging 600
days for the longest of the three mandated trial phases.

<HEADLINE> Report: USSR Had E.Germany Missiles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The Soviet Union secretly stationed nuclear missiles in
communist East Germany in 1959, several years before the confrontation with the
United States over missiles on Cuba, a magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Der Spiegel, citing new research by a German historian, said Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev gave the order to spirit 12 SS-3 missiles to Soviet bases in
East Germany, keeping its ally in the dark.
</P>
<P>
	   With a range of 750 miles, the missiles could have hit France and Britain as
well as U.S. military bases, the report said. They were withdrawn a few months
after their April 1959 arrival, apparently as the Soviets developed long-range
missiles that could hit those targets from Russian territory, Der Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Khrushchev's purpose may have been to find new ways to pressure the Allies
to leave West Berlin, a western outpost in East Germany during the Cold War, the
magazine said.
</P>
<P>
	   Historians had always viewed the 1962 Cuban missile crisis as the first time
Moscow stationed nuclear missiles abroad, the report said. Khrushchev withdrew
the missiles after a standoff with former President John F. Kennedy widely
believed to have brought the superpowers to the brink of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine cited research by an unnamed historian at Halle-Wittenberg
University in eastern Germany who interviewed witnesses and reviewed newly
available documents in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush said Saturday that John McCain's
campaign tax proposal would impose a $40 billion increase on working Americans
by taxing their employer benefits, but the Arizona senator said his tax cut
would more than offset it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain argued about taxes in televised campaign debate, the last
Republican confrontation before the Iowa caucuses begin the 2000 voting a week
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the front-runner, told McCain, who is debating but not campaigning for
the caucuses, that his tax plan would impose taxes on employer benefits for
workers, such as continuing education, transportation and child care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a $40 billion tax increase,'' Bush told McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked what the senator would tell a single mother who is working and
going to school and would have to pay taxes on the benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first thing I would say to that woman is, `I've got a tax cut for you,
and Gov. Bush doesn't,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, wouldn't deal with
the future financing of Social Security, either, which is vital to workers, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gov. Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for
Medicare and not one penny to pay down the national debt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said for Bush to run a campaign ad saying he will protect Social Security
is ``all hat and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's cute,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're always cute when they're true,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush's tax plan would give 36 percent of the benefits to the richest
1 percent of Americans. ``Let's not do the Texas two-step here,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, Bush's closest challenger in Iowa because of McCain's bypass
strategy, said he's spent more time in the state than any other candidate, and
his family has covered 12,000 miles seeking support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can depend on me,'' he said. ``I will change Washington with your
help.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain began with a mistake, thanking the moderator, but calling him Randy.
Editor Dennis Ryerson of The Des Moines Register moderated the 90-minute debate.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator, challenging Bush in the New Hampshire primary but not in the
Iowa caucuses, said, ``A lot of you don't know me.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope there will be a hardy band of Americans and Iowans who will go out
and say, `Hey, this guy McCain, he's qualified to be president of the United
States.' And I am.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that we ought to increase demand for Iowa products,'' Bush said.
``That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the demand for Iowa products.''

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Minister Defends Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- As international condemnation of Malaysia's
crackdown on government critics mounted, the country's foreign minister defended
the move Saturday as a rightful exercise of Malaysian law.
</P>
<P>
	   Three opposition leaders were charged this week with sedition and leaking
state secrets and two journalists were charged with sedition after criticizing
the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
insisted Saturday that the government was giving the suspects due process in
open courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the international community must respect that Malaysia is
exercising its rights, its own laws,'' he told the national news agency,
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
	   He pointed out that the accused were charged under the Sedition Act and the
Official Secrets Act -- which requires open court proceedings -- not the
Internal Security Act, under which a suspect can be held in detention for years
without appearing in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Amnesty International joined in the growing criticism of
Malaysia's crackdown. In a statement late Friday, it accused the government of
curbing freedom of expression and described the arrests as ``politically
motivated misuse of restrictive laws.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prominent among those being prosecuted is Karpal Singh, a longtime critic of
Mahathir, a leader of the Democratic Action Party and a defense attorney for
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar, a rallying figure for the opposition, has been jailed for corruption
and is on trial again. Karpal is charged with sedition after he alleged that
``people in high places'' had tried to poison his client.
</P>
<P>
	   Two top leaders of another opposition group, the National Justice Party, are
to face trial for sedition and leaking government secrets. The editor of the
opposition Harakah newspaper, Zulkifli Sulong, also has been charged -- as has
the paper's printer, Chea Lim Thye -- drawing condemnation from international
press freedom groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysia has been in political turmoil since Anwar was fired as deputy prime
minister in September 1998. His subsequent arrest and corruption conviction
provoked anti-government demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar is now serving a six-year prison term and standing trial for sodomy.
He has denied all the charges against him and says he is the victim of a
political conspiracy to destroy both him and the growing movement against
Mahathir's 18-year lock on power.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A career diplomat serving as Ukraine's envoy to NATO
was proposed Saturday as the country's new ambassador to the United States, a
news report said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Leonid Kuchma nominated Kostiantyn Hryshchenko for the post, the
Interfax news agency reported. The appointment must be approved by Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuchma praised Hryshchenko, 46, and said he had long been the top candidate
for the position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States is one of our main foreign priorities. That is why a
high-level diplomat should head Ukraine's embassy,'' Kuchma said, according to
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   Hryshchenko previously served as Ukraine's ambassador to Belgium. He has
been head of Ukraine's mission to NATO since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Soviet republic's previous ambassador to the United States, Anton
Buteiko, was dismissed by Kuchma late last year during a routine diplomatic
staff rotation, a presidential spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Hampers Libya Rescue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Bad weather on Saturday hampered the search for five
people missing in the crash of a Swiss-owned plane off the coast of Libya that
killed 17 others, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen people survived Thursday's crash, including the two Libyan pilots,
when the plane made an emergency landing in the Mediterranean sea.
</P>
<P>
	   All 38 passengers on board worked for the Libyan owned Sirte Oil Co. and
were traveling from the Libyan capital, Tripoli, to a refinery in Marsa el-Brega
on the Mediterranean coast. The plane had a three-person crew.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's chairman, Ahmed Aoun, said the search for the missing five --
three Libyans, a Briton and a Filipino -- would continue ``both at sea and along
the coast for as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, the bad weather conditions have meant we cannot search at
sea today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never say never, but the chances of finding anyone alive are getting
slimmer and slimmer and before too long it will be virtually nil. It is
extremely sad and we have sent our sincerest condolences to relatives,'' Aoun
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was confident that the cause of the crash would be pinpointed
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pilots survived and we know where the plane wreckage is, so we hope to
get all technical details as rapidly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is resting in 165 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot had reported that both engines cut out in quick succession as the
plane came in to land. The weather was good at the time of the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Libyan General Civil Aviation Authority has said it would lead the
investigation, helped by two British experts and Swiss investigator Hans-Peter
Graf.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the pilots, the survivors include eight other Libyans, seven Britons
and two Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 Britons work in Libya's oil industry, with many based in Marsa
el-Brega, 280 miles east of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17 bodies recovered were those of five Britons, three Libyans, two
Canadians, two Croats, two Filipinos, one Tunisian, one Pakistani and one
Indian.

<HEADLINE> Gun Maker Wants No Gun Shows Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The nation's largest gun manufacturer has begun instructing
distributors not to sell its firearms at gun shows, apparently the first policy
of its kind, The Denver Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In contracts with distributors this year, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. states that its
shotguns, rifles and handguns be supplied only ``to federally licensed firearms
dealers selling exclusively from their regular place of business,'' the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of guns are sold or traded every year at an estimated 4,400 gun
shows nationwide. Federally licensed gun dealers must conduct background checks
on gun-show customers, but unlicensed private dealers are not required to
conduct the checks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a new policy that no other manufacturer has made. I think what
they're doing is remarkable,'' said Tony DiChario, a Ruger distributor in
Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   In a notice to about 5,000 retailers, his company, AmChar Wholesale, has
asked them to adhere to the new policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please do not display or sell any Ruger firearms at any gun shows. Ruger
firearms must only be sold from licensed retail dealer establishments,'' the
notice says.
</P>
<P>
	   Unregulated sales at gun shows became a target of criticism after weapons
sold without background checks at the shows were used in the Columbine High
School massacre. Fifteen people, including the two gunmen, died in the attack
last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   But Colorado's largest firearms dealer questioned why customers who pass
background checks should be treated differently at gun shows than at stores.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Dave Anver, owner of Dave's Guns
in the Denver suburb of Aurora. ``We're talking about federally licensed
entities that do background checks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sturm, Ruger, based in Fairfield, Conn., has made and sold more than 13
million guns since it was founded 50 years ago. It ranked as the top gun
manufacturer in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials declined to comment on their reasons for the new policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sturm, Ruger remains a defendant in lawsuits filed by 28 cities and counties
seeking to recover the costs of gun-related violence, according to the Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Other gunmakers, including California-based Davis Industries, have taken
steps to limit their liability. Davis, a company that specialized in cheap
handguns, filed for bankruptcy protection in May. And Colt's Manufacturing Co.
announced last fall that it was curtailing its production of handguns.

<HEADLINE> Letterman cracking jokes day after bypass surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Television funnyman David Letterman was cracking jokes
in his hospital room Saturday as he began his recovery from emergency quintuple
bypass surgery.
<P>
	   "I feel fantastic," Letterman, 52, said the morning after his operation,
according to a statement. "In addition to re-routing the arteries, they also
installed an E-Z Pass."
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors performed the surgery on Friday, after an angiogram showed that one
of Letterman's arteries was severely constricted. He had the test because of
high cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family.
</P>
<P>
	   The wisecracking host came through the procedure well, his surgeon said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave's doing great," said Dr. O. Wayne Isom, chairman of cardiothoracic
surgery at the Weill Cornell Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. "He's
making jokes and feels terrific. He's on his way to a full recovery."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician, Dr. Louis J. Aronne, and his cardiologist,
Dr. Martin Post, have said it is too soon to say how long the comedian will need
to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, received flowers
from President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared on his show
Wednesday to discuss her likely Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and fans near the midtown Manhattan theater where he tapes "Late
Show with David Letterman" for CBS - and often brings his cameras into shops and
bars - were hoping for his good health.
</P>
<P>
	   "We love him," said Sirajul Islam, who manages a souvenir shop next door to
the theater and often appears with Letterman on the "Late Show." "It's a very
sad weekend for us, the whole neighborhood. ... I was not even sleeping last
night, watching television reporting about his condition, almost all night."
</P>
<P>
	   Most said they were shocked by the sudden surgery, although Letterman has
often joked on the air about his health, starting years ago when he discovered
he had high cholesterol. For a month he went on an oat-bran diet and complained
about it to his audience nightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was pretty surprised because I knew he had just gone in for ... a
checkup," said Christopher Fortier, 24, of Southington, Conn., who was browsing
and watching "Late Show" reruns in the CBS store near Letterman's studio. "He's
probably getting a kick out of it, the fact that everybody's paying so much
attention. I guess it'll show him how important he is to a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said the comedian's doctors and
family would not release any further details Saturday about his condition "and
ask that Dave's privacy be respected while he recuperates."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman joked about his arteries with guest Regis Philbin during the
program that was taped on Thursday and aired Friday, joking that after his
tests, doctors might have to "open daddy's rib cage."
</P>
<P>
	   In bypass surgery, doctors rerout the flow of blood to the heart to bypass
blockages.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS plans to telecast reruns of the "Late Show" while Letterman recovers.

<HEADLINE> Two of 3 Tenors Wow Rome Opera  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF ISRAELY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- In a special 100-year anniversary performance of Giacomo
Puccini's ``Tosca,'' two of the famed ``three tenors'' wowed a Rome opera house
crowd -- and one didn't even sing a word.
</P>
<P>
	   Placido Domingo took the baton Friday night to lead the Rome orchestra as
Luciano Pavarotti sang the lead tenor role in the Puccini classic. It was the
first time the 58-year-old Spaniard, who donned reading glasses, has directed
his Italian singing partner.
</P>
<P>
	   After the final act, shouts of ``bravi'' and 10 minutes of rousing applause
greeted the two bearded performers and the rest of the cast, including Ines
Salazar, the 28-year-old Venezuelan soprano who shined in the title role.
Florentine filmmaker and theater producer Franco Zeffirelli, who directed the
performance, joined the cast on stage afterward for a champagne toast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Placido Domingo led with flexibility and his usual charge of human
sympathy,'' Milan's daily Corriere della Sera wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-time-only performance gave a boost to the Rome opera, which has long
lived in the shadows of Milan's La Scala and has been plagued by labor strife
and public criticism from its in-house conductor, Giuseppe Sinopoli.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tosca,'' which highlights Puccini's precise orchestration and evocative
lyrical style, made its debut Jan. 4, 1900, in the same opera house where it was
performed Friday. The opera, set in Rome in 1800, ends with the broken Floria
Tosca hurling herself off the Castel Sant' Angelo as the sun rises over St.
Peter's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   '''Tosca' is Rome,'' Zeffirelli said before Friday's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The performance was Pavarotti's first in Rome since 1992. In that
performance as in this one, the 63-year-old superstar sang the part of Tosca's
lover, Mario Cavaradossi.
</P>
<P>
	   With Spain's Jose Carreras rounding out the trio, the ``three tenors'' have
packed opera houses and sports arenas over the past decade. An American tour is
set for this spring.

<HEADLINE> Report: 3 L.A. Cops May Be Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A special task force investigating corruption in the Los
Angeles Police Department has asked prosecutors to charge three officers with
crimes ranging from assault to perjury, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Detectives on the task force presented District Attorney Gil Garcetti's
office with evidence implicating Officers Nino Durden, Brian Hewitt and Michael
Buchanan, the Times said, citing an unidentified source.
</P>
<P>
	   The LAPD's probe into the city's worst police corruption scandal in decades
has uncovered alleged unjustified shootings, beatings, drug dealing, evidence
planting, false arrests, witness intimidation and perjury.
</P>
<P>
	   The criminal charges would be the first to grow out of the scandal since
former officer-turned-informant Rafael Perez began cooperating with authorities
and implicating officers in wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   To date, 20 officers have resigned or been relieved of duty, suspended
without pay or fired in connection with the scandal. In addition, 11 criminal
convictions have been overturned and four inmates have been released from
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   All three officers once worked in the same anti-gang detail as Perez, who
has pleaded guilty to stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker.
Perez has been cooperating with investigators in order to win a lighter penalty
at his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, Perez has implicated himself and Durden in a shooting,
telling detectives he and Durden planted a gun on Javier Francisco Ovando to
cover their tracks. Perez said the former partners then perjured themselves in
court, saying Ovando had attacked them.
</P>
<P>
	   Ovando, who was sentenced to 23 years in prison for assaulting a police
officer, has since had his conviction set aside and been freed. He was left
paralyzed by the shooting and has filed a lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors declined to comment on the task force's recommendation. Durden's
lawyer, Darryl Mounger, declined comment, and Hewitt's attorney could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
	   James Trott, who represents Buchanan, said he was surprised by the
development and has ``no clue'' as to what the police think they have against
his client.

<HEADLINE> New York GOP boss says McCain guilty of hypocrisy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The head of New York's Republican Party on Saturday
blasted Sen. John McCain's complaints about challenges to his qualifying
petitions for the state's presidential primary as "the height of hypocrisy."
<P>
	   Citing McCain's successful use of petition requirements in Arizona to knock
a potential challenger off the GOP Senate primary ballot in that state in 1998,
New York GOP boss William Powers said, "Senator McCain has demonstrated he is
just another politician who will say one thing and do another when it benefits
him."
</P>
<P>
	   Powers, a supporter of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential candidacy,
has mounted challenges to McCain's petitions to qualify for New York's March 7
primary ballot. That effort has been denounced by McCain as "Stalinist
politics."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment Saturday from the McCain campaign to Powers'
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is clear that Senator McCain believes one special set of rules applies
to him, and another set of rules applies to everyone else," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Republican Party is attempting to ensure that the people who signed
Senator McCain's petitions are registered Republicans who live in the right
congressional districts," the New York GOP leader said. "Sound familiar, Senator
McCain? That is almost exactly what you did in Arizona."
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, when reports circulated of McCain's own use of petition
challenges against potential opponents in Arizona, McCain spokesman Howard
Opinsky insisted the two situations are quite different. The challenges to
McCain in New York include alleged violations of "highly technical things
including the color of the paper on which the petitions were signed," Opinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We followed rules that are very open in Arizona," Opinsky said Friday. "The
rules in New York are written to keep people off the ballot, legitimate
candidates, so that the establishment can control the process."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Powers' lead attorney in the case, Jeffrey Buley, has said the New
York review of McCain's petitions only involves checking to see if those who
signed McCain petitions are enrolled Republicans and live in the congressional
districts where the petitions were circulated. Buley said hypertechnical
petition requirements will not be used against McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the McCain camp has objected because Bush supporters in New
York had originally said they planned no challenges to the McCain petitions. The
challenges were filed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and his New York campaign director, Staten Island Borough President
Guy Molinari, have called on Bush to use his influence with Powers and Gov.
George Pataki, also a Bush supporter, to get the challenges withdrawn. Bush has
refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also filed a federal lawsuit in an attempt to open up the ballot
in New York. That lawsuit will be heard at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must circulate petitions to qualify separate
convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in
which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP primaries in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari has conceded the McCain petitions have probably come up short on
the required number of signatures in at least five of the 31 districts, and
possibly in a sixth. Buley is examining all of McCain's petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes have both filed petitions they
claim qualify them for the primary ballot in all 31 congressional districts.
Only McCain, among the other GOP presidential contenders, also attempted to
qualify for the New York ballot through the petition process.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sees Colombia's Drug Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright got a
firsthand look Saturday at Colombian efforts to intercept cocaine shipments at
this steamy Caribbean port. She came away impressed with government sleuths'
high-tech tools -- and the methods drug lords use to circumvent them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's fantastic,'' Albright said when shown an Internet hookup that
allows Colombia to connect with 286 ports in 80 countries as part of an
integrated counterdrug campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was shown manifests purporting to document legal exports that were
an attempt by drug traders to conceal cocaine or heroin shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They certainly are ingenious,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Andres Pastrana, appearing with Albright at a news conference on
the grounds of the seaside guest house where she stayed Friday night, cited the
near-dismantling of cartels in Medellin and Cali as an indication of Colombia's
progress in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can and will do more,'' he said as three Coast Guard speed boats armed
with M-60 rifles deployed in waters just yards away. He said European donors
will meet in June or July to make pledges to assist Colombia in fighting the
drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said the two countries are sharing a ``very important moment'' and
are ``fully in harmony'' on high priority objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   While Albright was in northern Colombia, 14 people were killed Saturday in
clashes between leftist rebels and security forces hundreds of miles away, near
Bogota, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colombian government and the rebels also held peace talks Saturday in a
southern jungle. It was not clear if the attack was meant as a show of force to
coincide with the peace talks or Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit was further evidence of the growing alliance between
Washington and Colombia, the source of 80 percent of all the cocaine used in the
United States. Colombian drug lords also have emerged in the past decade as a
major force in heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite gains in interdiction, narcotics traders have been able to outpace
the government's eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, Albright planned to travel to Panama to meet President
Mireya Moscoso and visit the Panama Canal to view the results of the canal's
transfer to local control two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright had been scheduled to go to Panama on Dec. 14 for a lavish ceremony
marking the transfer but postponed because of the impending start of peace talks
in Washington between Israeli and Syrian leaders. The absence of both President
Clinton and Albright from the ceremony was criticized in Panama and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   She was to spend Saturday night in Oaxaca in southern Mexico before meetings
Sunday with government officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the White House announced a two-year, $1.6 billion program
largely devoted to the anti-narcotics struggle in Colombia. Albright said Friday
night that Peru and Bolivia have reduced coca leaf production and Colombia can
do the same with hard work.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright was escorted around the port by Colombian National Police Chief
Gen. Jose Serrano, a hero to many on Capitol Hill because of his reputation as
an incorruptible combatant in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright praised Serrano for the ``world class'' counterdrug system he has
built and expressed the ``greatest gratitude'' for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolstering the high-tech anti-drug weapons were German shepherds trained at
a special school in Bogota to sniff out illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright held the paw of one amiable canine. ``Good dog, really good show,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the biggest cocaine seizures in Cartagena involved the capture of
about 70 ``industrial spools'' -- cylinders normally used for housing material
for producing textiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on display was a container seized 13 months ago that held part of a
7.3-ton cocaine seizure -- one of the largest ever in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican lawmakers in the United States, citing evidence on the manifest
and other information, believe the shipment was bound for the United States by
way of Cuba. But the Clinton administration, along with Colombia and Cuba,
maintain the cargo was destined for Spain.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush said Saturday that John McCain's
campaign tax proposal would impose a $40 billion increase on working Americans
by taxing their employer benefits, but the Arizona senator said his tax cut
would more than offset it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain argued about taxes in televised campaign debate, the last
Republican confrontation before the Iowa caucuses begin the 2000 voting a week
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the front-runner, told McCain, who is debating but not campaigning for
the caucuses, that his tax plan would impose taxes on employer benefits for
workers, such as continuing education, transportation and child care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a $40 billion tax increase,'' Bush told McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked what the senator would tell a single mother who is working and
going to school and would have to pay taxes on the benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first thing I would say to that woman is, `I've got a tax cut for you,
and Gov. Bush doesn't,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, wouldn't deal with
the future financing of Social Security, either, which is vital to workers, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gov. Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for
Medicare and not one penny to pay down the national debt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said for Bush to run a campaign ad saying he will protect Social Security
is ``all hat and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's cute,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're always cute when they're true,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush's tax plan would give 36 percent of the benefits to the richest
1 percent of Americans. ``Let's not do the Texas two-step here,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, Bush's closest challenger in Iowa because of McCain's bypass
strategy, said he's spent more time in the state than any other candidate, and
his family has covered 12,000 miles seeking support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can depend on me,'' he said. ``I will change Washington with your
help.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain began with a mistake, thanking the moderator, but calling him Randy.
Editor Dennis Ryerson of The Des Moines Register moderated the 90-minute debate.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator, challenging Bush in the New Hampshire primary but not in the
Iowa caucuses, said, ``A lot of you don't know me.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope there will be a hardy band of Americans and Iowans who will go out
and say, `Hey, this guy McCain, he's qualified to be president of the United
States.' And I am.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that we ought to increase demand for Iowa products,'' Bush said.
``That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the demand for Iowa products.''
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, all six Republicans, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, Forbes, Bush and
McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his administration for its
policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans took turns questioning each other, and Keyes asked Bush
about a Texas town in which the city council voted to have all business
conducted in Spanish. He called that an assault on ``linguistic unity'' and said
Bush hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush began his answer in Spanish: ``That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had expressed concern about the episode, had told the Texas
attorney general to look into it. ``English is our nation's language,'' Bush
said. ``That's why I'm for programs to make sure our children learn English.''
The candidates 5th graf a0567
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days before
the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically eve with
the Texan in the latest surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Arizona senator isn't competing in Iowa, appearing in the debates
but without campaigning actively. So Forbes is No. 2, and far behind -- Bush
holds polling leads ranging up to nearly 30 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, Forbes and McCain have clashed on taxes in person and in a barrage of
television ads. Bush promised tax cuts ``so help me God'' in an earlier New
Hampshire debate, but McCain argues that the governor's $483, five-year cut
would spend more than the budget surplus and would not adequately protect the
future financing of Social Security. Forbes scoffs at both as proposals that
would preserve a system he wants erased in favor of a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
	   The self-financed candidate, heir to a magazine fortune, is broadcasting ads
attacking Bush for allegedly breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by
including increases in some sales and business taxes in a plan to cut property
taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, was featured in a
Des Moines Register ad saying he feared that the kind of negative ads that
wounded him in the last campaign ``may be happening again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ad didn't name Forbes, but the target was obvious. In 1996, Forbes waged
a blistering attack campaign on Dole, inflicting campaign damage that lasted
into the final campaign against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I emerged the Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke, and a much
easier target for the negative Clinton-Gore fall campaign,'' Dole said in his
open letter ad.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's wife, dropout candidate Elizabeth Dole, has endorsed Bush. Dole
himself has not publicly endorsed a candidate for the 2000 nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The key to the caucuses will be the ability of the rival campaigns to turn
out voters to register their preferences on a winter's Monday night, at 7 p.m.
There are no day-long voting hours as in a primary; to participate, Republicans
have to be at their caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a matter of building up strong support and then convincing people
to show up in a living room or a gymnasium on caucus time,'' Bush said, stopping
by a campaign headquarters on Saturday. ``It's a moment in time. It's a
different dynamic than a primary.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: Take Down Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore said Saturday the Confederate flag
should come down from public buildings because it divides Americans. The vice
president also accused the GOP presidential front-runner, George W. Bush, of
dodging the issue to satisfy supporters who have ``pretty obsolete and even
hateful attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, in a CNN interview with Jesse Jackson, said the flag represents ``for
many Americans a hurtful message that recalls the pain of slavery'' and it
should not be flown from the South Carolina Statehouse or other public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The citizens of goodwill everywhere must take a position on it and see
that in fact the American flag heals us and the Confederate flag divides us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier breakfast speech, Gore criticized the Republican presidential
field generally on the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's troublesome to me that so many of the Republican candidates have
spoken out against affirmative action and have been silent about the flying of
the Confederate flag over the South Carolina Statehouse, which is obviously
hurtful to so many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican candidates competing in the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary are
asked about the issue nearly every time they visit the state. Texas Gov. Bush
says the question is for people in South Carolina to decide, a point reinforced
by his campaign after Gore's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor has a position, and his position is that the people of South
Carolina can figure the issue out,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tucker also renewed criticisms that Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile has
stoked racial divisiveness and said if Gore wants to upbraid people on race, he
should start with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who normally speaks off-the-cuff, took the unusual
step last week of reading from a prepared statement to say many in South
Carolina view the flag as a ``symbol of heritage.'' That phrase is used by some
Republicans who want the flag to continue flying over the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said on ``Both Sides with Jesse Jackson,'' taped Saturday for broadcast
Sunday, that some Republicans have expressed hurtful language in the flag
debate, apparently referring to a South Carolina state senator who called the
NAACP the ``National Association for Retarded People.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there is too much tolerance of intolerance,'' Gore said. ``And I
think that that flag should be removed from the state capitol.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``I think that he, Governor Bush, has avoided taking a position,
or has ducked the issue because he is playing to some of his supporters that, I
think, have some pretty obsolete and even hateful attitudes.'' Some flag
supporters, as minorities see it, ``want to express views of racial superiority
and support for discrimination,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tucker said Bush has in fact repudiated the comments of the state senator.
``It was an offensive thing to say,'' she said. ``It shouldn't have been said.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the vice president is going to begin chastising people for their
comments, he needs to start with his own campaign manager, who made racist
comments recently,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She was referring to comments by Brazile, who said Republicans ``would
rather take pictures with black children than feed them'' and accused them of
using Gen. Colin Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, two of the most
prominent blacks in the GOP, to improve their image with minorities.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton demands unoccupied city-owned buildings be made into  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Rev. Al Sharpton and about 150 supporters marched up
125th St. to an abandoned Harlem building on Saturday, calling for the city to
convert city-owned abandoned buildings into shelters for the homeless.
<P>
	   Sharpton said the protest was in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday
and was inspired by King's message of nonviolent action and civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
	   "We came here today, on Martin Luther King's birthday, to show that the city
has property it could use to house the homeless, but it lacks the moral
imperative to do so," Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters braved below-freezing temperatures, walking briskly from
Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters on 124th St. and Madison Avenue
to the abandoned building at 370 St. Nicholas Ave.
</P>
<P>
	   After Sharpton briefly addressed the crowd, four protesters climbed up a
side fire escape into the building, chaining themselves inside and leading the
crowd in chants against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police. The protesters hung a
banner out of the burnt-out building's windows proclaiming the site the Martin
Luther King Jr. House.
</P>
<P>
	   One chained protester screamed out to the crowd, "Why is this building
locked up? There are people freezing outside," as police broke the lock off the
metal grille over the front door of the building. Once inside, police cut the
chains holding the protesters and arrested the four for trespassing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a beautiful example of Mr. King's message of nonviolent action and
civil disobedience," Sharpton said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest came amid controversy over Giuliani's policies regarding the
homeless. After a brick-wielding homeless man seriously injured a Queens woman
in November, police began arresting homeless people who refused orders to move
from city sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
	   The city also moved to put children in foster care if their parents sought
city shelter but refused to accept work assignments. Two judges blocked the city
from instituting the foster care rule.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the mayor declined to comment on the issue on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, who is to meet Hillary Rodham Clinton for the first time on
Monday, said he will ask the first lady serious questions about her stance on
homeless policies, healthcare, education and the justice system before deciding
whether to throw his support behind her likely run for the New York Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton will likely face Giuliani in the fight for the Senate seat
being vacated when Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan retires in November.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan To Set Up China Protections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A new bill approved by Taiwan's legislature Saturday
will let the government buy billions of dollars in stock to help protect
financial markets against hostile moves by China.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the bill, the government can create a fund of up to $16 billion to buy
blue chip shares when "major events" occur to weaken public confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the idea violates free market principles.
</P>
<P>
	   But President Lee Teng-hui, recalling how markets were roiled four years ago
when China test-fired missiles into Taiwanese waters, said the bill gives the
government an effective defense against financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can test-fire missiles, but I will have money to stabilize the stock
market," Lee told a business gathering. The plan will also allow the government
to head off speculation by foreign funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee proposed the fund last year, shortly before he enraged Beijing in July
by claiming that Taiwan and China have a special "state-to-state" relationship.
That prompted China to repeat threats to retake the island and triggered a
sell-off in the Taiwanese stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan and China split amid a civil war in 1949, but Beijing insists the
sides will reunify, by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   The money for the stabilization plan will come from government pension
funds, the labor insurance fund and bank loans using government-owned stocks as
collateral, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A committee of scholars and members from various political parties will be
set up to oversee operations.

<HEADLINE> ABC Backed Away From Anti-Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ABC says it stopped trying to collect government
financial credits for inserting anti-drug messages in its programs after
President Clinton's drug advisers asked to see scripts before they were aired.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't something that we were comfortable doing," ABC President Patricia
Fili-Krushel said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her comments indicated that the White House's efforts to advance anti-drug
messages were perhaps more aggressive than previously believed. Fili-Krushel
also acknowledged that ABC's participation in the effort was more extensive than
it had said before.
</P>
<P>
	   It was disclosed this past week that Clinton's Office of National Drug
Control Policy, which has bought millions of dollars worth of commercial time on
the networks, offered broadcasters financial credits if they could prove that
their programs advanced anti-drug themes.
</P>
<P>
	   White House advisers also said that in some cases they worked with networks
before shows were broadcast to make sure their messages were being conveyed
properly.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC said Saturday that it received credit for anti-drug stories on "The
Practice," "Home Improvement" and "General Hospital." The credits enabled ABC to
sell commercial time that it was otherwise obligated to give to the government.
</P>
<P>
	   When the little-known Clinton administration effort came to light on
Thursday, ABC said it had shown some scripts to the government but received no
financial benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Fili-Krushel said ABC decided not to participate this season because the
government asked to see scripts before they aired. The previous year, government
advisers were content to evaluate shows after they were broadcast, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, ABC is fulfilling its commitment to the government by airing free
public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone calls to two officials in Clinton's drug office were not immediately
returned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Donald Vereen, deputy director of the drug office, said efforts
to work with the networks had not been intrusive.
</P>
<P>
	   Fili-Krushel said ABC had not asked any of the producers and writers of its
shows to do anything to bend to the government's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the government's anti-drug work with the networks had been "blown
out of proportion." ABC conducted its own on-air drug-fighting campaign three
years ago, before the White House office effort, she said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Death Rate Jumped in Early 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's death rate jumped in the first week of January,
suggesting to experts that some terminally ill patients held onto life just long
enough to see the year 2000 arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The will to live can be pretty powerful,'' said Robert N. Butler, founder
and president of the International Longevity Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary numbers from New York's Department of Health show 1,791 people
died in the city in the first week of 2000 -- a 50.8 percent increase from the
1,187 deaths for the same period last year and 46 percent more than the 1,226
deaths in the first week of 1998, The New York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's pretty well established that people who are seriously ill will hang
on to reach significant events, whether they are birthdays, anniversaries or
religious holidays,'' said Richard Suzman, an associate director of the National
Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this case, making it into the next century or millennium certainly
counts as that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The increase was not caused by this year's influenza virus, because the flu
has been occurring at normal levels in the city, said Health Department
spokesman John Gadd.
</P>
<P>
	   National statistics are not yet available, and a spokesman for the city's
health department said such data would take considerable time to analyze.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Brace for First Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The Republican campaign took a turn toward civility
in last week's runup to the first presidential voting, while Democrats Al Gore
and Bill Bradley decided that combat suited them better.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The voters will have a clear choice on election day,'' pledged Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates looked ahead to a week of television ads, mass mailings,
phone banks and carpools designed to get supporters to the Iowa caucuses a week
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary served as an important distraction, with many
candidates splitting time between the two opening-bell states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No time to waste!'' Bradley said midway through a week in which the
dynamics shifted in the Democratic race in Iowa, taxes dominated the GOP debate
and a front-runner twice shifted his ad strategies under pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush seemed caught off guard during a GOP debate in Michigan, when
McCain seized on an unexpected pledge not to run negative ads. ``I'll shake
hands with you, George,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The moment seemed impromptu, but in fact McCain had reason to believe Bush
was about to go negative: A woman had contacted his campaign to complain that a
Bush camera team had interviewed her about McCain's tax plan. She said she was
coached to criticize the package.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign caught in the act, the Texas governor said he knew nothing
about the operation and pledged anew not to run negative ads. Bush advisers said
their ad team had stockpiled scores of interviews for potential ads, but there
were no plans to cut a negative spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet one member of the Bush camp confirmed that the woman who came forward
had been ``helped along'' by producers seeking an articulate criticism of
McCain's cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the national GOP front-runner, is in a dead heat with McCain in New
Hampshire. McCain has bypassed Iowa, where complicated caucuses demand
resource-draining organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also pulled his punch with Steve Forbes, the conservative millionaire
who is airing ads accusing Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of internal debate, Bush produced a response ad that said Forbes'
charge was ``wrong'' and set the record straight by talking about two Texas tax
cuts he supported. Left on the shelf was the script of an ad that would have had
Bush saying, ``My opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, appeared to outlast questions about his work on behalf of
contributors in the Senate. A week earlier, the matter had threatened to
overwhelm his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore and Bradley dredged up old Senate votes and
pounced with breathless accusations. The vice president said Bradley abandoned
flood victims in Iowa. The former New Jersey senator said Gore flip-flopped in
votes on smoking and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had promised not to sling ``darts'' in his not-politics-as-usual
campaign, but aides say he had no choice after the vice president lashed out at
Bradley in the final months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's team now is crying cry foul. ``It's a shame that Senator Bradley has
had to resort to negative campaigning,'' said the vice president's combative
spokesman, Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   The rhetoric intensified as Bradley struggled to close a stubborn 20-point
gap in Iowa polls and his advisers began to worry Gore actually was gaining
strength.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a different picture in New Hampshire, where the race remained close.
Gore's team sensed what one adviser called ``glacial movement'' in his favor
after weeks of advantage-Bradley in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Barely heard above the din, three Republicans hoped Iowa's social
conservatives would lift them into the top tier. Debates that served as bookends
to the week gave Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah a chance to
shine.
</P>
<P>
	   In their final week in Iowa, Bush plans to hammer home the fact that he has
the largest tax-cut proposal, and he is expected to continue to find fault with
McCain's middle-class tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
	   In a GOP debate Saturday, Bush asked McCain why his plan would be partially
paid for by exposing to taxes some fringe-benefits such as tuition payments by
employees. On the defensive, McCain chose not to answer the question directly,
and instead said Bush's tax-cutting plan endangers Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You run ads saying you're taking care of Social Security, my friend,''
McCain said. ``That's all hat and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's cute,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're always cute when they're true,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men were chuckling nervously, a reflection of how painfully polite the
GOP candidates are trying to be.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's advisers discussed ways to portray their boss as the most
presidential of the presidential candidates, hoping to capitalize next week on
lingering questions about Bush's experience and intellectual heft. ``I am fully
prepared,'' McCain said in Saturday's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic candidates braced for another week of jousting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a competition, after all,'' said Bradley, a sharp-elbowed former
basketball star.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Cracks Jokes After Bypass  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Television funnyman David Letterman was cracking jokes in
his hospital room Saturday as he recovered from emergency quintuple bypass
surgery the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel fantastic. In addition to rerouting the arteries, they also
installed an E-Z Pass," Letterman, 52, said, joking about the commuter toll
passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the cards from well-wishers were flowers from President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared on his show Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors ordered the surgery Friday after an angiogram showed one of
Letterman's arteries was severely constricted. He had the test because of high
cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave's doing great," said Dr. O. Wayne Isom, chairman of cardiothoracic
surgery at the Weill Cornell Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. "He's
making jokes and feels terrific. He's on his way to a full recovery."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's physician and cardiologist have said it is too soon to say how
long the comedian will need to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS plans to air reruns of the "Late Show" until he recovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman joked about his arteries with guest Regis Philbin during the
program that was taped on Thursday and aired Friday, joking that after his
tests, doctors might have to "open daddy's rib cage."

<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) - George W. Bush said Saturday that John McCain's
campaign tax proposal would impose a $40 billion increase on working Americans
by taxing their employer benefits, but the Arizona senator said his tax cut
would more than offset it.
<P>
	   Bush and McCain argued about taxes in televised campaign debate, the last
Republican confrontation before the Iowa caucuses begin the 2000 voting a week
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the front-runner, told McCain, who is debating but not campaigning for
the caucuses, that his tax plan would impose taxes on employer benefits for
workers, such as continuing education, transportation and child care.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a $40 billion tax increase," Bush told McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked what the senator would tell a single mother who is working and
going to school and would have to pay taxes on the benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first thing I would say to that woman is, 'I've got a tax cut for you,
and Gov. Bush doesn't,"' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, wouldn't deal with
the future financing of Social Security, either, which is vital to workers, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gov. Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for
Medicare and not one penny to pay down the national debt," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said for Bush to run a campaign ad saying he will protect Social Security
is "all hat and no cattle."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's cute," Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're always cute when they're true," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush's tax plan would give 36 percent of the benefits to the richest
1 percent of Americans. "Let's not do the Texas two-step here," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, Bush's closest challenger in Iowa because of McCain's bypass
strategy, said he's spent more time in the state than any other candidate, and
his family has covered 12,000 miles seeking support.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can depend on me," he said. "I will change Washington with your help."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain began with a mistake, thanking the moderator, but calling him Randy.
Editor Dennis Ryerson of The Des Moines Register moderated the 90-minute debate.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator, challenging Bush in the New Hampshire primary but not in the
Iowa caucuses, said, "A lot of you don't know me.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope there will be a hardy band of Americans and Iowans who will go out
and say, 'Hey, this guy McCain, he's qualified to be president of the United
States.' And I am."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that we ought to increase demand for Iowa products," Bush said.
"That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the demand for Iowa products."
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, all six Republicans, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, Forbes, Bush and
McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his administration for its
policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans took turns questioning each other, and Keyes asked Bush
about a Texas town in which the city council voted to have all business
conducted in Spanish. He called that an assault on "linguistic unity" and said
Bush hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush began his answer in Spanish: "That's not true."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had expressed concern about the episode, had told the Texas
attorney general to look into it. "English is our nation's language," Bush said.
"That's why I'm for programs to make sure our children learn English." The
candidates 5th graf a0567
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days before
the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically eve with
the Texan in the latest surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Arizona senator isn't competing in Iowa, appearing in the debates
but without campaigning actively. So Forbes is No. 2, and far behind - Bush
holds polling leads ranging up to nearly 30 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, Forbes and McCain have clashed on taxes in person and in a barrage of
television ads. Bush promised tax cuts "so help me God" in an earlier New
Hampshire debate, but McCain argues that the governor's $483, five-year cut
would spend more than the budget surplus and would not adequately protect the
future financing of Social Security. Forbes scoffs at both as proposals that
would preserve a system he wants erased in favor of a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
	   The self-financed candidate, heir to a magazine fortune, is broadcasting ads
attacking Bush for allegedly breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by
including increases in some sales and business taxes in a plan to cut property
taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, was featured in a
Des Moines Register ad saying he feared that the kind of negative ads that
wounded him in the last campaign "may be happening again."
</P>
<P>
	   The ad didn't name Forbes, but the target was obvious. In 1996, Forbes waged
a blistering attack campaign on Dole, inflicting campaign damage that lasted
into the final campaign against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   "I emerged the Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke, and a much
easier target for the negative Clinton-Gore fall campaign," Dole said in his
open letter ad.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole's wife, dropout candidate Elizabeth Dole, has endorsed Bush. Dole
himself has not publicly endorsed a candidate for the 2000 nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The key to the caucuses will be the ability of the rival campaigns to turn
out voters to register their preferences on a winter's Monday night, at 7 p.m.
There are no day-long voting hours as in a primary; to participate, Republicans
have to be at their caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a matter of building up strong support and then convincing people
to show up in a living room or a gymnasium on caucus time," Bush said, stopping
by a campaign headquarters on Saturday. "It's a moment in time. It's a different
dynamic than a primary."

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek Funding for Veterans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans a $1.5 billion increase in
spending for the nation's veterans, much of it aimed at improving health care
services, a senior congressional Democrat said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., said the administration's proposed veterans
spending in fiscal 2001 represents ``the largest VA (Veterans Affairs) increase
requested by any administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials declined comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans, the senior Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said the
administration will request $46 billion for veterans' benefits and services.
That includes a request for a $1.5 billion increase in spending authority, much
of it targeted at expanding health care services, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, he said, the Clinton budget request includes more than $1.3
billion in increases for veterans medical care, boosting total spending in that
area to $20.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans control both the House and Senate, and it was not immediately
clear what reception the proposed spending increases would receive from GOP
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans called the proposed increase ``significant and needed'' and said he
was especially pleased it includes the full cost of long-term and emergency care
benefits enacted by Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This budget recommends the funding needed by (the Department of Veterans
Affairs) to make veterans' emergency care and long-term care benefits more than
just words on paper,'' Evans said in a statement. ``The lack of emergency care
has been a serious problem confronted by too many veterans for too long.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our veterans should never be forced to choose between emergency care and
bankruptcy,'' he said. ``That has been the choice too many veterans have been
forced to make.''

<HEADLINE> Serb Paramilitary Leader Said Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen shot and killed a notorious Serb
paramilitary leader on Saturday in the lobby of the Belgrade Intercontinental
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was taken to a hospital for
emergency surgery, police said. A doctor at Belgrade's emergency hospital, who
asked not to be identified, said he had seen Arkan and that ``all vital
functions had stopped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official Tanjug news agency later confirmed that Arkan had died and that
two others with him had been shot, including a bodyguard who was also killed.
Other media reports said that his sister-in-law was wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   A source in the hotel, who asked not to be named, said the gunmen used a
Heckler and Koch submachine gun and escaped after at least one bullet hit Arkan
in the eye while he was sitting in a sectioned-off part of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, 47, and his paramilitary forces have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during Serbia's war with Croatia. Reputedly one of Serbia's
wealthiest individuals, Arkan was a longtime ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces
sided with Serb rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo
</P>
<P>
	   He denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, the British Foreign Office issued a statement saying it had
confirmed Arkan's death. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``Arkan
lived violently so it is therefore no surprise that he died violently.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret his death because it prevents us doing justice to the victims of
his atrocities by seeing him in the dock of at The Hague war crimes tribunal,''
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was wanted for bank robberies in Western Europe in the 1970s and
1980s. In the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia that began in 1991, the Belgrade ice
cream parlor owner made his fortune in black market currency trading, oil
smuggling and arms dealing.
</P>
<P>
	   His ``Tigers'' militia, meanwhile, became known for savagery.
</P>
<P>
	   During the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia, Arkan frequently warned the
Atlantic Alliance against a land invasion, warning of fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   He and his wife Ceca, a popular Serbian folk singer, were frequent visitors
to Belgrade's Hyatt Hotel during the bombing, apparently fearing to stay at home
and risk becoming a NATO target.

<HEADLINE> Man Wants Dead Wife's Heart Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- A man suing a hospital over the death of his wife
during childbirth learned that doctors removed her heart during an autopsy --
and never returned it, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   James Carey filed a motion Friday demanding that Nesbitt Memorial Hospital
return the heart because he might seek to exhume his wife's body ``to make it
whole.''
</P>
<P>
	   Theresa Lynn Carey, 34, died in 1997 during surgery to stop massive blood
loss following the birth of twins. The twins survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband claims doctors waited too long to react to his wife's massive
blood loss. The suit also names the hospital and its parent organization,
Wyoming Valley Health Care System.
</P>
<P>
	   Carey had approved an autopsy to determine the cause of death. But he claims
the real motive for the autopsy was to deflect blame from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor who performed the autopsy initially ruled that Mrs. Carey died of
cardiac arrest brought on by the hemorrhaging, the motion said. But after
examining the heart, the doctor changed the ruling to cardiac arrest brought on
by coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyoming Valley Health Care System officials issued a statement defending the
removal of the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Detailed testing can require multiple samples from the same piece of
tissue. This is part of the scientific, medical and legal process to determine
the facts in a case,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carey was not aware that the heart had been removed until November, when a
lawyer for the health care system said it was still being held at the hospital.

<HEADLINE> French Producer Alain Poire Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Alain Poire, the producer of some of France's best-loved films,
has died, his son said Saturday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Poire died from cancer at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine outside Paris on
Friday night, Jean-Marie Poire said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A pillar of French cinema has disappeared, as well as a loyal man with a
good heart,'' President Jacques Chirac said in a statement. ``Cinema is losing
... a passionate producer to whom we owe first-rate films which can be placed
among the greatest successes of French cinema.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1917 in Paris, the elder Poire studied law and worked in a news and
publicity agency before becoming a theater director in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   During his long career, he produced 250 films and worked with some of
France's best-known directors -- Gerard Oury, Georges Lautner, Francis Veber and
Yves Robert among them.
</P>
<P>
	   His films included some popular successes like ``Fantomas,'' ``The Tall
Blond Man With One Black Shoe'' and ``A Taxi For Tobrouk.'' He received a Cesar
film award in 1985 for his life's work and was named to France's Legion of
Honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Poire is survived by his wife and two sons. He will be buried in
Neuilly-sur-Seine on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Woman sentenced to at least 60 years in drunk-driving wreck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANTEO, N.C. (AP) - A waitress who killed four New Jersey teen-agers in
a wreck caused by her drunken driving was sentenced Saturday to at least 60
years in prison.
<P>
	   The presiding judge said he sentenced Melissa Marvin, 30, of Kill Devil
Hills, to consecutive sentences because each life she took was important.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know how I could have said to one parent your child's life didn't
matter," said Superior Court Judge Jerry Tillett, who heard testimony from
victims' relatives and the defendant for about two hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin was sentenced to 24 to 29 months for one count of assault with a
deadly weapon and 174 to 218 months each for four counts of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning session of court, Marvin tearfully pleaded with the
judge.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm so sorry for everything that happened," she said, speaking in court for
the first time and looking at the families of the victims. "I never intended to
hurt anyone. There's not a malicious bone in my body."
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin's attorney refused comment after the sentencing, but said in court he
would file an appeal. Meanwhile, his client remains locked up in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the April 6 wreck were Megan Blong, Amanda Geiger and Angie
McGrady, all of Burlington County, N.J., and Shana Lawler, who had moved from
New Jersey to the Outer Banks. All were 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony earlier this week showed Marvin had at least five drinks before
getting behind the wheel and that her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times
the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Blong, father of Megan Blong, told the judge the wreck was "totally
avoidable" and urged the judge to impose a long prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Erin Lawler, sister of Shana Lawler, told the judge: "How I wish more than
anything I could hug my sister one more time."
</P>
<P>
	   "My entire life, I did my utmost to be her big sister and protect her," she
said. "There wasn't anything I could do to protect her on April 6."
</P>
<P>
	   The defendant's mother said her daughter had "remorse and compassion for
those lives that were taken in this crash" and begged for mercy.
</P>
<P>
	   A Dare County jury deliberated about 4 1/2 hours Friday night before finding
Marvin guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury verdicts prompted crying from many in the courtroom but no reaction
from Marvin, who had sobbed frequently during witness testimony. Marvin also was
stoic when the sentence was read by the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Amber Davis said witnesses reported seeing
Marvin with a foot on her dashboard shortly before the wreck.
</P>
<P>
	   After the accident, Marvin refused to submit to an alcohol breath test, so
police obtained a search warrant to draw blood. The blood sample, taken more
than four hours after the wreck, showed a blood-alcohol level of .21, nearly
three times North Carolina's legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin had been arrested for driving while impaired twice before the April
accident. Both times, she was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser charge of
careless and reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Immigration Forces Deluge Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By BECKY BOHRER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Anti-immigration groups have latched onto Iowa's
first-in-the-nation caucuses as a national stage, pouring thousands of dollars
into campaign advertising that blames immigration for many of the country's
woes.
</P>
<P>
	   In one newspaper ad, words printed over a garbage dump read:
</P>
<P>
	   ``When those candidates tell you how unspoiled and beautiful Iowa is, ask
them what they're going to do to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most likely you'll have to give them the answer: reduce immigration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another ad describes the town of Storm Lake, where the IBP Inc. meatpacking
plant employs hundreds of Hispanics, as a place ``where quality of life is but a
memory.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Tom Vilsack railed against the ads last week, calling them a deplorable
propaganda campaign by ``hate-mongers'' who ``go after Hispanics and Asians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several television stations and newspapers, including The Des Moines
Register and Ottumwa Courier, have refused to run them, saying the ads are
misleading and inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was insinuating that immigrants were garbage,'' said Register Publisher
Barbara Henry.
</P>
<P>
	   While few Iowans have publicly agreed with the ads, Dan Stein, executive
director of the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration
Reform, said his group has had overwhelmingly positive feedback from the ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iowans have been brow beat to think of this level of immigration as
inevitable, that they should like it and everybody should get along,'' Stein
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know about the ad and what it did to Storm Lake. As far as we're
concerned, it's true,'' said Pam Schuver, co-owner of Danny's Sport Spot, a
restaurant in Cherokee, about 20 miles from Storm Lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Storm Lake is a great community, but it used to be better, Ms. Schuver said
Saturday. She said the town has deteriorated since large numbers of immigrants
came to work at the IBP plant.
</P>
<P>
	   People don't like to talk about it for fear of sounding politically
incorrect, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People try to dehumanize the opposition by using (the term) racism,'' said
John Vinson, president of the Virginia-based American Immigration Control
Foundation, which has been advertising across the country since 1997. ``There is
nothing in those ads to incite racial hostility.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, which began running three weeks before the state's Jan. 24
caucuses, say the U.S. population will grow from 275 million to 400 million
people in 50 years without immigration reforms. They say the country doesn't
have room for that many people and show images of unemployed workers and a
decaying neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   In Storm Lake, Mayor Jon Kruse has demanded a public apology from what he
called ``the inconsiderate, uninformed, out-of-state, political, special
interest group.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ad saying Storm Lake's quality of life has been diminished by
immigration says the northwest Iowa city's schools, jails and hospitals have
been overburdened by foreigners. It portrays a business forced to close its
doors, a neighborhood in disarray and people being arrested. But none of the
images were filmed in Storm Lake.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I call it very demeaning,'' said Dale Carver, who heads an area diversity
task force. ``They didn't portray Storm Lake at all in a true manner.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federation spokesman Rick Oltman of San Rafael, Calif., said the group is
sticking by the ad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think with have anything to apologize for. The mayor did not
correct any of the things that were said in the ad,'' Oltman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alicia Claypool, executive director of the Iowa Interfaith Alliance, said
the outside groups are simply ``taking advantage of Iowa's precinct caucus
process'' and the presence of the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, The Associated Press asked the candidates: Should legal
immigration be increased, decreased or maintained?
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan was the most outspoken, saying, ``Legal immigration should be
reduced to 250,000 newcomers a year, both to assimilate the 30 million who have
come here in recent decades, and to ease the downward pressure on the wages of
U.S. workers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the candidates said legal immigration levels should be maintained.
Gary Bauer said the numbers should be reviewed each year and lowered
temporarily, and Steve Forbes said he doesn't support increasing legal
immigration, except for high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``America must always remain a refuge for those fleeing oppression,''
Democrat Bill Bradley said, but he added, ``At the same time, we must be able to
control our borders to protect our security as well as to keep our work force
stable.''

<HEADLINE> Pigs Protest Pentagon Pork  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Two men in pink pig costumes and carrying a briefcase
of play money emerged from a stretch limousine outside the site of Saturday's
Republican presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a Pentagon contractor,'' one said, a plastic cigar clenched between
his teeth.
</P>
<P>
	   The pigs, representatives of the anti-defense spending group Iowans for
Sensible Priorities, said they were in town to protest Pentagon pork.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We get money from the Pentagon and we give money back to the candidates,''
said one pig, who declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Someone from the group, planted in the crowd, then began singing ``Hail to
the Pork,'' a parody set to the tune of the ``Hail to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   More than an hour before debate began, supporters of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and publisher Steve Forbes took their respective spots opposite each other
on the lawn of Iowa Public Television studios.
</P>
<P>
	   With campaign signs stacked on top of each other, Bush supporters
antagonized their Republican counterparts with screams of ``We want Bush. We
love Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes crowd, not to be outdone, grabbed megaphones and began screaming:
``Where's your tax plan?''
</P>
<P>
	   Decked out in a neon orange Forbes T-shirt and ski cap, 81-year-old Paul
Sandhorst said the 2000 campaign was his first foray into political activism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lee Iacocca was my choice a few years ago -- a businessman who knows how
to do things,'' Sandhorst said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Forbes, Sandhorst said, ``he doesn't have any debts. No one's done
him any favors.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Decked out in a straw hat and carrying a sign that read ``Grandmas for
Bush,'' Rosanne Freeburg was on a mission -- to obtain kiss No. 27 from George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The 72-year-old Cedar Rapids woman has kissed the Texas governor 26 times
during the past year as he campaigned in Iowa for the Republican president
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had 26 kisses for him,'' she said gleefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Freeburg said she supports Bush because of his stance on charter schools and
she plans to follow him to New Hampshire next week.
</P>
<P>
	   With scores of Bush supporters behind her, Freeburg stepped forward and sang
her theme song, ``Should all the Grandmas Vote for Bush,'' to the tune of ``Auld
Lang Syne.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Contenders Prepare for Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGELA CHARLTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- With little more than two months until Russia's presidential
election, Communists and other Russian groups sketched out strategies Saturday
for their race against heavily favored acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said he has a ``good
chance'' of winning the election. Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996
presidential elections, called his supporters together for a meeting to prepare
for the March 26 election.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communists have failed to expand their support in recent years beyond
their aging, nostalgic electorate, and have lost several allies in parliament.
Saturday's closed-door meeting was apparently aimed at finding ways to reverse
the trend, and Zyuganov called for cooperation among hard-line groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in Moscow, the reform-oriented Yabloko party formally nominated
lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky as its candidate. Yavlinsky, who had already said he
would run, promised to push for an open economy and an end to the war in
Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In Siberia, supporters of Aman Tuleyev, the pro-Communist governor of the
coal-rich but economically depressed Kemerovo region, began collecting
signatures to put his name on the presidential ballot, ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Other candidates include Konstantin Titov, the centrist governor of the
Samara region, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Once nominated,
candidates must collect 500,000 signatures by Feb. 13 to be registered for the
election.
</P>
<P>
	   All the candidates will be hard pressed to beat Putin, who assumed power
after Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31 and called early elections. Putin's
popularity is already sky-high, and the short campaign works in his favor by
giving him access to government coffers while leaving his opponents short on
time to raise money and make plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show that Putin has enough backing to win the election in the first
round, but failure to make progress in defeating rebels in Chechnya or economic
troubles could erode that support over the next two months. The Chechnya war has
been largely popular among Russians, and Yavlinsky is the only presidential
candidate to speak out against it.
</P>
<P>
	   A nationwide group of teachers and other educators endorsed Putin's
presidential bid at a meeting Saturday. In recent days, Putin has promised pay
raises for teachers, doctors and other state-funded workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want him to win, but we will help him only if we are sure that his
interest in education and his intention to support the teacher morally and
materially will not die down after he has taken the oath,'' the educators' group
said in a statement, according to ITAR-Tass.

<HEADLINE> Mechanical Woes Blamed in Bus Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators have found mechanical defects in
some of the four university-chartered buses involved in a deadly crash on a
foggy interstate two months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Details about the defects and the exact number of buses affected were not
released because the investigation is ongoing, said state police Cpl. Chriss
Grube.
</P>
<P>
	   Grube said Friday that crash investigators had not determined whether the
defects contributed to the Nov. 21 chain-reaction wreck, which left left two
people dead and more than 100 Penn State Univeristy students injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary cause was that the buses were traveling too fast for the foggy
conditions on Interstate 80 that day, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The four buses were among six bringing 280 Penn State students back from a
New York City shopping trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Penn State and Blue and White Lines Inc., the company which
owned the buses, declined to comment on the findings.

<HEADLINE> Two of 3 Tenors Wow Rome Opera  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF ISRAELY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- In a special 100-year anniversary performance of Giacomo
Puccini's ``Tosca,'' two of the famed ``three tenors'' wowed a Rome opera house
crowd -- and one didn't even sing a word.
</P>
<P>
	   Placido Domingo took the baton Friday night to lead the orchestra at the
Teatro dell'Opera di Roma as Luciano Pavarotti sang the lead tenor role in the
Puccini classic. It was the first time the 58-year-old Spaniard, who donned
reading glasses, has directed his Italian singing partner.
</P>
<P>
	   After the final act, shouts of ``bravi'' and 10 minutes of rousing applause
greeted the two bearded performers and the rest of the cast, including Ines
Salazar, the 28-year-old Venezuelan soprano who shined in the title role.
Florentine filmmaker and theater producer Franco Zeffirelli, who directed the
performance, joined the cast on stage afterward for a champagne toast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Placido Domingo led with flexibility and his usual charge of human
sympathy,'' Milan's daily Corriere della Sera wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-time-only performance gave a boost to the Rome opera, which has long
lived in the shadows of Milan's La Scala and has been plagued by labor strife
and public criticism from its in-house conductor, Giuseppe Sinopoli.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tosca,'' which highlights Puccini's precise orchestration and evocative
lyrical style, made its debut Jan. 14, 1900, in Rome. The opera, set in Rome in
1800, ends with the broken Floria Tosca hurling herself off the Castel Sant'
Angelo as the sun rises over St. Peter's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   '''Tosca' is Rome,'' Zeffirelli said before Friday's performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The performance was Pavarotti's first in Rome since 1992. In that
performance as in this one, the 63-year-old superstar sang the part of Tosca's
lover, Mario Cavaradossi.
</P>
<P>
	   With Spain's Jose Carreras rounding out the trio, the ``three tenors'' have
packed opera houses and sports arenas over the past decade. An American tour is
set for this spring.

	   The decision by EU deputy finance ministers in Brussels adjusts the
drachma's target rate in the EU's exchange rate mechanism to 340.75 to the euro
from 353.109. Currencies in the mechanism are allowed to fluctuate only within
narrow bands of each other.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision does not directly affect the drachma's market value.

<P>
	   Greece was not allowed to join the first wave of 11 nations to use the euro
because of its high inflation and budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   The news provided a boost for Premier Costas Simitis' government, which
imposed years of financial austerity on Greeks in an effort to become a member
of the euro club. Some analysts speculate that the EU could approve Greece's
euro bid in June.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a historic event," Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou told a news
conference. "It reflects the strength gained by the Greek economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Papantoniou said the new rate would "help Greece achieve a very low
inflation rate" and create a "positive climate" for the Athens Stock Exchange,
which attracted hundreds of thousands of small investors last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance officials in Brussels also welcomed the news. "This decision
contributes to the process of convergence that the Greek government has
initiated in the last year," said Pedro Solbes, EU Commissioner for economic and
monetary affairs.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Feted on 80th  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE WATSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor's birthday party Saturday turned
into a major fund-raiser for the New York Archdiocese -- as well as a gathering
for some of his possible successors.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria in honor of the cardinal's 80th birthday
raised $4 million for Catholic charities, including support for parochial
schools in the archdiocese and funding for a seminary position named for the
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 1,500 people invited were several men whose names have
been mentioned as O'Connor's possible successors: Archbishop Justin Rigali of
St. Louis; Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the U.S.
Military; and Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner was scheduled to feature tributes to the cardinal, a speech by
O'Connor, and a video about his legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is the oldest active bishop in the United States and is regarded as
one of the most powerful Catholics in America. The pope is expected to replace
him now that he has turned 80, the age at which cardinals lose their power to
vote for a new pope.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor also had a brain tumor removed in September and has since missed a
number of public appearances, including Masses. He stumbled twice in November
when mounting the steps to the pulpit, and has taken to sitting in a chair near
the high altar to avoid the stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets for the dinner were $1,000 each, but many of the guests made
additional contributions.

<HEADLINE> Car Crashes Into Blair's Gates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A car smashed into the gates protecting Prime Minister Tony
Blair's official Downing Street residence Saturday, injuring a U.S. tourist and
narrowly missing her three sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were questioning the driver to determine whether he deliberately
attempted to smash the barrier or whether he lost control of the car. He was
held on suspicion of causing criminal damage, but his name was not released.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyewitnesses said a tourist pushed her children to safety just before she
was hit and flung fifteen feet. The woman was hospitalized with a broken leg.
Her sons, ages three, six and eight, were not harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Scotland Yard described the woman as a U.S. tourist but would not release
her name or hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   The black wrought iron gates block access to Downing Street, a short street
at the end of which sits No. 10, the prime minister's office and home. The gates
were damaged, but the car did not break through, police said. They said the
prime minister and his family were not at home at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Bus driver Peter Saacs, 55, witnessed the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The driver pulled up as if to show someone Downing Street,'' he said.
``Then he was wheel-spinning in front of me and pulled out and went round the
back of our bus and into the gates.''

<HEADLINE> Algeria: Islamic Rebels Surrender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- More than 1,100 members of an Algerian rebel group
have surrendered in eastern Algeria since July, a state prosecutor said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many rebels from the Islamic Salvation Army have
surrendered overall and how many were still holding out Saturday, two days after
a government-imposed deadline for militants to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspaper reports before the deadline said 1,700 rebels throughout the
country had surrendered since July.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who is trying to end a bloody eight-year
Islamic insurgency, set Jan. 13 as the deadline for insurgents to surrender and
receive partial amnesty. The deal applied to all rebels except those guilty of
rapes, murders or bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouteflika has warned that any militants who failed to comply with the
deadline will be eradicated. Algerian soldiers have deployed in rebel
strongholds for a threatened offensive to annihilate rebel holdouts.
</P>
<P>
	   As the deadline approached, a rebel group called the Islamic Salvation Army,
or AIS, was granted full amnesty by the government. The group, which called a
cease-fire in 1997, dissolved itself soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last few days, 1,166 AIS members have surrendered in the Jijel
region, about 220 miles east of Algiers, said Bachir Chaib, the region's state
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaib told state radio that 137 members of the Armed Islamic Group have laid
down their arms in the same region. The radical group is blamed for some of
Algeria's most brutal massacres and had rejected Bouteflika's drive for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Algerian newspapers said a local AIS leader in western Algeria
also had complied with the deadline despite initial misgivings. Ahmed Benaicha
surrendered Thursday with about 450 of his men, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The surrender deadline was part of Bouteflika's plan for ``civil concord,''
which passed parliament in July and was ratified in a national referendum in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouteflika's peace plan is a bid to end the violence that has wracked this
North African nation since 1992, when the army canceled national elections that
the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. More than 100,000
people have been killed since then.

<HEADLINE> Two Immigrants Die in Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Police discovered two dead and 20 exhausted Eastern
European women trying to illegally enter Greece on Saturday across an icy
mountain pass.
</P>
<P>
	   The frozen bodies of Romanian Mirela Stan, 24, and Ukrainian Hatira
Antilsova, 29, were recovered Saturday and the 20 other young women were
detained, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The women were found on rugged Mount Belles, 415 miles north of Athens. They
had walked from neighboring Bulgaria through snow for three days, but were
stranded when smugglers failed to meet them on the Greek side, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run NET television said most of the women were not properly dressed
for subfreezing temperatures and that the group included three girls aged 15, 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They survived by eating snow,'' said Maria Nalbati, a hospital official in
the nearby city of Serres, where two of the survivors were being treated. ``They
were extremely tired. They hadn't had anything to eat or drink for three days,''
Nalbati said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from Asia and Eastern Europe cross
into Greece each year, sneaking over remote border passes or on to hundreds of
islands in the Aegean Sea. They remain in Greece to find work or make their way
to other European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Smuggling rings have been linked to illegal Greek labor networks, which
supply sweat shops, brothels and substandard construction projects.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 31 illegal immigrants have died trying to enter Greece in the last
three months, killed in truck crashes, by hypothermia or after wandering into
minefields along Greece's border with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said many of the women detained Saturday had previously been deported
from Greece. They said the group was from Romania, Ukraine and Moldova, while
the nationality of the two hospitalized women was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   The women will be deported back to Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush said Saturday that John McCain's
tax-cut plan would impose a $40 billion increase on working Americans, and his
GOP rival shot back during debate that Bush's proposal doesn't save ``one
penny'' for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the front-runner, told McCain, who is debating but not campaigning for
the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses, that his tax plan would impose taxes on employer
benefits for workers, such as continuing education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a $40 billion tax increase,'' Bush told McCain during the televised
debate, the last Republican confrontation before the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor asked McCain what would he tell a single mother who is
working and going to school and would have to pay taxes on the benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first thing I would say to that woman is, `I've got a tax cut for you,
and Governor Bush doesn't,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, wouldn't deal with
the future financing of Social Security, either, which is vital to workers, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gov. Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for
Medicare and not one penny to pay down the national debt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said for Bush to run a campaign ad saying he will protect Social Security
is ``all hat and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's cute,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're always cute when they're true,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush's tax plan would give 36 percent of the benefits to the richest
1 percent of Americans. ``Let's not do the Texas two-step here,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, Bush's closest challenger in Iowa because of McCain's bypass
strategy, also challenged Bush on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Texas, George, your tax cuts are more apparent than real,'' Forbes
said. ``Most Texans have never seen those tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded, ``Not only are my tax cuts real, they've reduced the base
line of the budget...'' he said. ``I've got a good record, I'm the only one on
this stage who's got a record endorsed by the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said Bush's property tax cut program didn't provide a break in six
out of 10 districts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Steve, look, that's good research, it's not true,'' Bush retorted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush cited an ad taken by Bob Dole in The Des Moines Register on Saturday,
in which the 1996 GOP nominee said he'd been damaged against the Democrats by
attack ads Forbes ran him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell the whole record,''
Bush told Forbes. ``We cut taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and Forbes all have ads promoting their tax plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who proposes a 17 percent flat tax, has ads attacking Bush for
breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by including increases in some sales
and business taxes in a plan to cut property taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like most government programs, it lived on forever,'' past its birth in
the 1970s when the country was in a crisis over imported oil, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lecturing tone, Bush took the opposite view. ``I believe that we ought
to increase demand for Iowa products. That is what ethanol does, John, it
increases the demand for Iowa products.''
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, all six Republicans, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, Forbes, Bush and
McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his administration for its
policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch repeatedly mentioned his 30-minute ad, running on two stations that
criticizes the scandal-plagued Clinton administration. At one point, he
lectured, ``Every one of you ought to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he supports a patients bill of rights, which is anathema to most
conservatives. ``There's nothing Republican or conservative about standing
with'' big HMOs in opposition to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans took turns questioning each other, and Keyes asked Bush
about a Texas town in which the city council voted to have all business
conducted in Spanish. He called that an assault on ``linguistic unity'' and said
Bush hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush began his answer in Spanish: ``That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had expressed concern about the episode, had told the Texas
attorney general to look into it. ``English is our nation's language,'' Bush
said. ``That's why I'm for programs to make sure our children learn English.''
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days before
the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically eve with
the Texan in the latest surveys.

<HEADLINE> Plan for underwater cables could affect clamming industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAPE MAY, N.J. (AP) - The state's ocean-clamming industry could be in
trouble if AT&AMP;T receives permission to install a $1.5 billion cable link to
Europe.
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T, one of several telecommunications companies involved in the battle,
asked the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection on Friday not to
grant a hearing to fishermen and to allow fiber optic cable to be installed
underwater.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable, which would carry Internet traffic and is expected to handle
about 8.2 million phone calls simultaneously, would run through some of the
world's richest clam beds.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fisherman don't own the sea bed," Paul Shorb, an attorney for AT&AMP;T,
told The Press of Atlantic City for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorb said fisherman "had their shot" to contest the permits in meetings,
and had won several concessions. But the necessary permits were later issued by
the DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   Although AT&AMP;T owns just 6 percent of the project, the company estimated that
a delay in laying the cable
</P>
<P>
	   would cost as much as $20 million per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorb noted that Internet consumers would absorb the cost of delays, adding
that fisherman should take the battle to court instead of seeking relief from
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisherman say they don't want to delay the project, but rather want to make
certain their safety and liability issues are addressed, such as burying cables
deeper, and removing old, unused cables to prevent fishermen from hitting them.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we're asking for is for them to be responsible for the cables," said
Daniel Cohen, a clam boat owner in the Port of Cape May. "If a fisherman hits a
cable, they (the companies) should be responsible."
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the companies have agreed to bury the cables 1 meter deep in some
areas, and 1.2 meters in other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our fishing should not be constrained by a permanent structure," said
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorb, however, noted that cables on the land, underground cables in that
they are protected and marked for the public's safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a land situation, we get a right-of-way, it's marked and people are not
supposed to dig there," said Shorb.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T and Sprint are in charge of installing the trans-Atlantic cable, which
would provide a link from Tuckerton to Widemouth, England, and an additional
link from Manasquan to Blaabjerg, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
	   The new cable, called a TAT-14, would have two lines to Europe and one line
connecting the two about 25 miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the project's enormous cost, 53 companies are involved in its
progress.
</P>
<P>
	   "After we jointly fund the project, we compete in reselling capacity," said
Shorb.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T's request to the DEP was sent on Friday, following a similar one made
by Sprint. Both companies argue that once a permit has been issued, a public
hearing regarding the permit is too late.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Trenton-based Garden State Seafood Association previously asked
for a hearing and requested that the installation of cables be halted until a
hearing took place.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEP has said the state Office of Administrative Law would have had to
grant such a hearing.

<HEADLINE> ABC's Game Show Craze Persists  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Don't wake ABC from its dream: the "Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire" craze is showing no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   The game show averaged nearly 29 million viewers in its first five airings
last week, with Wednesday's audience of 33.6 million the largest of the 36
editions of the quiz show on since August.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" averaged nearly five million
viewers more than it did in November, when it carried ABC to an unexpected
victory in the ratings "sweeps" period. ABC had better ratings Thursday than it
had in its time slot in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is really a juggernaut," host Regis Philbin said between taping two
programs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC executives are basking in the "Millionaire" glow, and trading barbs with
rival networks who say the bubble has to burst sometime.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC executive Garth Ancier last week said the show was like crack, because
it provides a quick ratings high but erodes ABC's ability to develop future
dramas and comedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Stu Bloomberg, ABC entertainment chairman, said he preferred to liken
"Millionaire" to Vitamin B-12. ABC said it was not reducing its spending on new
show development, and even announced Saturday a deal with Stephen King to
produce a miniseries, "Rose Red," sometime next season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't believe we are mortgaging our future at all," Bloomberg said. "We
are eternally grateful to have this show."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC noted that it was other networks, including NBC, that have reacted to
"Millionaire" by rushing other game shows on the air. ABC hasn't done so -- not
yet, at least.
</P>
<P>
	   The network is working with "Millionaire" executive producer Michael Davies
on another quiz, "Mastermind," that is expected on the air this summer, perhaps
earlier. Like "Millionaire," it's a remake of a popular British game show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the other networks have completely misread the success of
'Millionaire,"' Davies said. "I don't think this works on the level of a game
show. I think it works on the level of a drama."
</P>
<P>
	   Upcoming are a special football-themed 'Millionaire' shortly before the
Super Bowl and a movie-themed show around the Academy Awards broadcast. Davies
is also considering occasionally using celebrity players.
</P>
<P>
	   One oddity: the show that transformed prime-time television won't be
eligible this year for a prime-time Emmy Award. Instead, it will likely be
nominated for best game show, which is a Daytime Emmy award.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's entirely fair," Davies said.

in which the 1996 GOP nominee said he'd been damaged against the Democrats by
attack ads Forbes ran him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell the whole record," Bush
told Forbes. "We cut taxes."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and Forbes all have ads promoting their tax plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who proposes a 17 percent flat tax, has ads attacking Bush for
breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by including increases in some sales
and business taxes in a plan to cut property taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like most government programs, it lived on forever," past its birth in the
1970s when the country was in a crisis over imported oil, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lecturing tone, Bush took the opposite view. "I believe that we ought
to increase demand for Iowa products. That is what ethanol does, John, it
increases the demand for Iowa products."
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, all six Republicans, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, Forbes, Bush and
McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his administration for its
policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch repeatedly mentioned his 30-minute ad, running on two stations that
criticizes the scandal-plagued Clinton administration. At one point, he
lectured, "Every one of you ought to watch it."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he supports a patients bill of rights, which is anathema to most
conservatives. "There's nothing Republican or conservative about standing with"
big HMOs in opposition to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans took turns questioning each other, and Keyes asked Bush
about a Texas town in which the city council voted to have all business
conducted in Spanish. He called that an assault on "linguistic unity" and said
Bush hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush began his answer in Spanish: "That's not true."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had expressed concern about the episode, had told the Texas
attorney general to look into it. "English is our nation's language," Bush said.
"That's why I'm for programs to make sure our children learn English."
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days before
the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically eve with
the Texan in the latest surveys.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on 10 Commandments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidates, asked their positions on posting the
Ten Commandments in schools during Saturday's debate in Johnston, Iowa:
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES: ``There is nothing wrong with posting the Ten Commandments in our
schools today because they are the basis of Western civilization.''
</P>
<P>
	   HATCH: ``My gosh, I believe that almost anybody would say if you read the
Ten Commandments that that applies universally. You don't have to be a Christian
to have it apply.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN: ``You know it's interesting that we begin our proceedings every day
in the United States Senate with a prayer. Now, it doesn't have the beneficial
effect that some desire, but it seems to be ... acceptable for the United States
Senate to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEYES: ``The Ten Commandments are etched into the walls of the Supreme
Court. I find it rather hard to believe that it could be inappropriate to fit
them on the walls of our schools.''
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: ``It seems like to me 'Thou shalt not kill' is pretty universal. I
think districts ought to be allowed to post the Ten Commandments. No matter what
a person's religion is there's some inherent values in those great
commandments.''
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: ``When I'm president, there will be no more Nazi salutes in the
schools, and it will be OK to hang the Ten Commandments up again -- not only
there but in the Oval Office.''

<HEADLINE> Woman sentenced to at least 60 years in drunk-driving wreck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANTEO, N.C. (AP) - A waitress who killed four New Jersey teen-agers in
a wreck caused by her drunken driving was sentenced Saturday to at least 60
years in prison.
<P>
	   The presiding judge said he sentenced Melissa Marvin, 30, of Kill Devil
Hills, to consecutive sentences because each life she took was important. He
said under current sentencing rules, there will be no parole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know how I could have said to one parent your child's life didn't
matter," said Superior Court Judge Jerry Tillett, who heard testimony from
victims' relatives and the defendant for about two hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin was sentenced to 24 to 29 months for one count of assault with a
deadly weapon and 174 to 218 months each for four counts of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning session of court, Marvin tearfully pleaded with the
judge.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm so sorry for everything that happened," she said, speaking in court for
the first time and looking at the families of the victims. "I never intended to
hurt anyone. There's not a malicious bone in my body."
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin's attorney refused comment after the sentencing, but said in court he
would file an appeal. Meanwhile, his client remains locked up in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the April 6 wreck were Megan Blong, Amanda Geiger and Angie
McGrady, all of Burlington County, N.J., and Shana Lawler, who had moved from
New Jersey to the Outer Banks. All were 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony earlier this week showed Marvin had at least five drinks before
getting behind the wheel and that her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times
the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Blong, father of Megan Blong, told the judge the wreck was "totally
avoidable" and urged the judge to impose a long prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Erin Lawler, sister of Shana Lawler, told the judge: "How I wish more than
anything I could hug my sister one more time."
</P>
<P>
	   "My entire life, I did my utmost to be her big sister and protect her," she
said. "There wasn't anything I could do to protect her on April 6."
</P>
<P>
	   The defendant's mother said her daughter had "remorse and compassion for
those lives that were taken in this crash" and begged for mercy.
</P>
<P>
	   A Dare County jury deliberated about 4 1/2 hours Friday night before finding
Marvin guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury verdicts prompted crying from many in the courtroom but no reaction
from Marvin, who had sobbed frequently during witness testimony. Marvin also was
stoic when the sentence was read by the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Amber Davis said witnesses reported seeing
Marvin with a foot on her dashboard shortly before the wreck.
</P>
<P>
	   After the accident, Marvin refused to submit to an alcohol breath test, so
police obtained a search warrant to draw blood. The blood sample, taken more
than four hours after the wreck, showed a blood-alcohol level of .21, nearly
three times North Carolina's legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin had been arrested for driving while impaired twice before the April
accident. Both times, she was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser charge of
careless and reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Lawmakers Address Sprawl  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- For 50 years, Natomas Air Field and the pilots
who used it had few neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   The airport was built in a flood plain in the fields north of Sacramento.
Then came the levee improvements, and in 1997, city officials lifted the
building moratorium, letting loose a flood of shopping centers, movie theaters
and homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight, it seemed, Russ Kilmer saw Sacramento grow toward him and his
27-acre airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, in what anti-urban sprawl activists say is a perfect illustration of
their concerns, Kilmer and his 40 crop dusters and private planes are being
pushed off the land to make way for more houses and stores. City officials told
him the airport must close by the end of the month because the surrounding area
has drastically changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Development is coming even though the airport's land was contaminated by
decades of farm chemicals from crop dusters, Kilmer said. He doesn't believe
anyone would pay to clean it up for housing, but the rules are more lenient for
commercial use, and commercial businesses are taking advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's what's happening all over,'' Kilmer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cities are sprawling over farm land and into unsuitable areas at an alarming
rate, even with the environmental hazards that could pose, said Brett Hulsey,
director of the Sierra Club's anti-sprawl project.
</P>
<P>
	   ``California has been dealing with growth issues overall, but of the 11
states that have growth-management acts, California ranks ninth,'' Hulsey said.
``That basically means the laws aren't working.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are state laws that require land-use plans for forest, agricultural
and coastal land, but the laws don't tell counties and cities how to implement
those plans, said Peter Detwiler, a consultant for the Senate Committee on Local
Government.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, California's laws have been described as ``Jell-O without a
mold,'' Detwiler said. With the absence of policy comes urban sprawl, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprawl, as defined by the California Futures Network, is poorly planned
residential developments that devour farmland and open space and spawn traffic
congestion, pollution and a diminished quality of life.
</P>
<P>
	   It occurs mostly on the edges of cities where there are few neighbors to
cry: ``Not in my backyard,'' Detwiler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of urban sprawl surfaces for discussion every few years, then
disappears, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   This appears to be a year when legislators are willing to talk about it,
especially in light of projections that the state's population is expected to
grow by 12 million over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of being anti-growth, Groups such as the California Futures Network
are promoting smart growth -- urban building that doesn't mean long commutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Building Industry Association is advancing a ``job-centered''
housing policy that would remove obstacles to building higher-density urban
housing near jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Overly restrictive policies would push California into a housing crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, I think we're already at a crisis stage,'' said spokesman Tim
Coyle.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department of Finance estimates 250,000 new homes should be built
each year to keep up with population growth, but only about half that number are
built.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of legislators will meet informally next week for the first time to
address the issue in a caucus on responsible growth, said Assemblywoman Pat
Wiggins, a Democrat from Santa Rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus will look at recommendations from a panel that studied the issue
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of all the things the Legislature did last year, the one true failing
grade we give them is this area,'' said Gerald Meral, executive director of the
Planning and Conservation League. ``There's not a hint, not a ripple, not a
whisper that indicates they will do anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kilmer, meanwhile, has contacted every member of the Sacramento City Council
in an effort to keep his airport operating, at least for a few more years until
he retires.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't blame the developers. Housing, shopping, transportation -- they're
just responding to a need,'' he said. ``But you just can't relocate an
airport.''

<HEADLINE> Snow Falls in Great Lakes Region  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Rain spread into parts of the West on Saturday and light snow fell around
parts of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong jet stream carried moist air inland from a storm system approaching
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Steady rain fell over parts of northern and central California, with some
locally heavy rain in the state's northwest corner and along the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   About an inch of rain had fallen by midday at Redding and Blue Canyon.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter storm warnings and watches were issued for Saturday night in parts of
northern and central California.
</P>
<P>
	   The area of rain also expanded northward into southwestern Oregon and
eastward into northern Nevada, with a few light showers reaching southern Idaho
and western Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   A few snow showers were scattered at higher elevations of California's
Sierra, south-central Oregon, northern Nevada and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   Showers also were scattered around Washington's Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
	   Farther east, light snow fell from northeastern Minnesota into northern
Wisconsin and both Upper and Lower Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   A chance of snow showers or flurries was forecast during the night in
northern Pennsylvania, New York state and New England.
</P>
<P>
	   On the northern Plains, a few isolated, light snow showers moved eastward
across Montana and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow also was possible in western South Dakota and parts of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a morning low
of 17 below zero at Saranac Lake, N.Y., to a midday reading of 76 at Harlingen,
Texas. The lowest wind chill was 62 below zero at Frenchville, Maine, and the

<HEADLINE> Bradley Received Subsidy Payments  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- A partnership that includes Bill Bradley received
$2,150 in farm subsidy payments in 1997 and 1998, campaign aides said Saturday.
As a Democratic senator from New Jersey, Bradley had opposed such payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got $700 from the payments to the 250-acre farm in Missouri he owns
with a high school friend, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokeswoman Anita Dunn said the farm also received relief payments
after floods in 1993. Bradley donated his share to charity, added Dunn, who did
not immediately know the amount.
</P>
<P>
	   During last week's debate, Vice President Al Gore accused Bradley of voting
against flood relief that year. Bradley said Gore distorted his record and he
insisted he eventually voted for the relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Gore's record was tainted because he accepted federal subsidy
payments for growing tobacco on the Gore family's Tennessee tobacco farm.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Bradley aides said, the Democratic National Committee had
accepted soft money from the tobacco industry to put on the 1996 convention that
nominated Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley continues to stoop to new lows every day,'' said Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has come under fire in the campaign for Iowa's precinct caucuses on
Jan. 24 for not being sympathetic to farm assistance programs. While he insists
he was only representing his state, he has continued to maintain the Missouri
farm operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunn argued that subsidies Bradley received were minor and said his
opposition to those programs showed he was not influenced by personal gain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to see the difference between the two candidates, nothing
better illustrates it than the fact that Bill Bradley voted against a program
from which his partnership received a small subsidy,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehane said the latest exchange underscores the importance of Gore's
challenge to step up the number of campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reiterate our challenge that he debate us weekly,'' Lehane said.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Take Down Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore said Saturday the Confederate flag
should come down from public buildings because it divides Americans. The vice
president also accused the GOP presidential front-runner, George W. Bush, of
dodging the issue to satisfy supporters who have ``pretty obsolete and even
hateful attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, in a CNN interview with Jesse Jackson, said the flag represents ``for
many Americans a hurtful message that recalls the pain of slavery'' and it
should not be flown from the South Carolina Statehouse or other public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The citizens of goodwill everywhere must take a position on it and see
that in fact the American flag heals us and the Confederate flag divides us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier breakfast speech, Gore criticized the Republican presidential
field generally on the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's troublesome to me that so many of the Republican candidates have
spoken out against affirmative action and have been silent about the flying of
the Confederate flag over the South Carolina Statehouse, which is obviously
hurtful to so many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican candidates competing in the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary are
asked about the issue nearly every time they visit the state. Texas Gov. Bush
says the question is for people in South Carolina to decide, a point reinforced
by his campaign after Gore's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor has a position, and his position is that the people of South
Carolina can figure the issue out,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tucker also renewed criticisms that Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile has
stoked racial divisiveness and said if Gore wants to upbraid people on race, he
should start with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who normally speaks off-the-cuff, took the unusual
step last week of reading from a prepared statement to say many in South
Carolina view the flag as a ``symbol of heritage.'' That phrase is used by some
Republicans who want the flag to continue flying over the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said on ``Both Sides with Jesse Jackson,'' taped Saturday for broadcast
Sunday, that some Republicans have expressed hurtful language in the flag
debate, apparently referring to a South Carolina state senator who called the
NAACP the ``National Association for Retarded People.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there is too much tolerance of intolerance,'' Gore said. ``And I
think that that flag should be removed from the state capitol.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``I think that he, Governor Bush, has avoided taking a position,
or has ducked the issue because he is playing to some of his supporters that, I
think, have some pretty obsolete and even hateful attitudes.'' Some flag
supporters, as minorities see it, ``want to express views of racial superiority
and support for discrimination,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tucker said Bush has in fact repudiated the comments of the state senator.
``It was an offensive thing to say,'' she said. ``It shouldn't have been said.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the vice president is going to begin chastising people for their
comments, he needs to start with his own campaign manager, who made racist
comments recently,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She was referring to comments by Brazile, who said Republicans ``would
rather take pictures with black children than feed them'' and accused them of
using Gen. Colin Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, two of the most
prominent blacks in the GOP, to improve their image with minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   In his interview with Jackson, Gore said that as president he would sign an
executive order outlawing racial profiling in police work.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, while speaking at Merrimack Valley High School, Gore was
interrupted by a commotion in the back of the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   A man was arrested after apparently throwing punches and trying to hit a
police officer who approached him, campaign spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   Police refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore continued with his speech without missing a beat, even joking about the
need to cut down on crime, ``especially violence in schools.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Moves Into Solid Lead in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New polling suggests Vice President Al Gore has slipped
past former Sen. Bill Bradley to retake a solid lead in their campaign for New
Hampshire's Democratic primary election, Newsweek reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In polling Wednesday through Friday, the newsmagazine said 50 percent of
people who plan to vote in the Feb. 1 Democratic primary favored Gore to 36
percent Bradley. The other 14 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Newsweek said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., moved in the Republican campaign
from a statistical dead heat to a slight lead over the national front-runner,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The poll showed McCain with 42 percent to Bush's
34 percent backing among people who plan to vote in the primary. Steve Forbes
was the only other GOP candidate in double figures, with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic result showed a significant change from the last Newsweek
poll, in early December. It showed Bradley, who represented New Jersey in the
Senate, leading Gore 47 percent to 40 percent, with 13 percent undecided. With a
6 percentage point margin of error, that gave Bradley a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley by 10 percentage points, 46 percent to 36 percent, in the
early November Newsweek poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewers talked Jan. 12-14 with 848 registered voters who said they
planned to vote in New Hampshire. The margin of error was 7 percent for
Democrats and 6 percent for Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Young Monk May Emerge As Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR MAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- In a remote Buddhist monastery, a black crown has
lain disused for 18 years. Now, a teen-age Tibetan monk has arrived in India to
reclaim it -- and perhaps to step into a new leadership role for his people.
</P>
<P>
	   For 300 years, Tibetan Buddhist monks known by the title of Karmapa have
donned the Black Crown in a ceremony designed to liberate participants from the
endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16th Karmapa brought the crown with him when he fled Chinese-ruled Tibet
in 1959 and deposited it in his monastery at Rumtek, in what was then the
Buddhist kingdom of Sikkim. It has since been absorbed by India. He died in
1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the boy recognized as the old lama's reincarnation defected to
India in a grueling eight-day trek by car, horse and foot over 900 miles of
snow-draped Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrival of the 17th Karmapa, leader of the Karma Kagyu sect, has given
exiled Tibetans a new and tangible leader they can embrace alongside the
64-year-old Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of all Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
	   They wonder whether the tall 14-year-old with the engaging smile and mature
demeanor will go beyond his spiritual role and join the Dalai Lama in the
struggle against China's harsh rule of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Some hope the Karmapa might inherit the mantle of political resistance from
the Dalai Lama when he dies.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 40 years, the 14th Dalai Lama has enlightened the West with Tibet's
mystique, inspired the spread of Buddhism and kept a global spotlight on China's
dominance of his isolated nation. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama has no obvious successor. The second most powerful figure in
the Tibetan hierarchy, the Panchen Lama, hasn't been seen in public since 1995
and is believed to be under Chinese house arrest. A rival Panchen Lama enthroned
by the Chinese four years ago is rejected by most Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts, however, doubt the Karmapa can replace the Dalai Lama as the symbol
of Tibet and its primary link to the rest of the world. For reasons embedded in
Tibetan history and modern statescraft, the young monk is unlikely to attain the
same public prominence. Still, some scholars say he may be better placed than
the Dalai Lama to deal with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   For 500 years after the first Karmapa in the 12th century, the Karma Kagyu
leader assumed the regency of Tibet's feudal, monastic society. But the
so-called Black Hats were eclipsed in 1642 by the Dalai Lama's Gelugpas, or
Yellow Hats.
</P>
<P>
	   Tibet's historical trend now flows in another direction, says Lasang
Tsering, a Tibetan scholar and former director of the Tibetan Children's
Village, the biggest school for refugee children, which is run by the Dalai
Lama's administration in Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving toward a democratic form of government,'' Tsering says. ``In
the future, we will have a popularly elected chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1985 to a family of nomads, Ugyen Trinley Dorje was recognized in
1992 by both the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government as the Karmapa, the only
senior Tibetan monk with that dual stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Like all senior monks in Tibet, he was closely watched and groomed by the
Chinese. He fled in frustration when the Chinese broke a prior agreement to
allow exiled teachers of his sect to come to Tibet to instruct him. China
repeatedly denied a visa to his most important teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, a
disciple of the last Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbie Barnett, a researcher in Chinese studies at Colombia University, said
the Karmapa's tutelage under the Chinese may place him in a unique position to
work quietly for the Tibetan cause. He told The Associated Press he wouldn't be
surprised if the Karmapa eventually returned to Tibet.	   That role was filled
by the last Panchen Lama, who stayed in Tibet when the Dalai Lama and almost
100,000 of his followers fled to India after an abortive anti-China uprising in
1959. The previous Karmapa defected the same year.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Panchen Lama spent 14 years in prison for criticizing Mao
Tse-tung's policies in Tibet, he was adept at interceding with the authorities
to win concessions for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa, Barnett says, has ``the same guts and determination'' and
the background to deal with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Chinese need a leader in Tibet to sanction their regime, and the
Tibetans need a leader who can wrest concessions in return,'' Barnett says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those bought up in exile are extremely unlikely to be masters of the
mechanics, the peculiarities of Chinese political culture and diplomacy which
are essential for this task.''

<HEADLINE> Monk Wants To Revive Black Crown  </HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR MAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The young Tibetan monk who fled last week to India
wants to revive the Black Crown ceremony, a 300-year-old tradition lost since
the death of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
	   Devotees believe the black crown is the earthly embodiment of the aura that
surrounds the Karmapa, the leader of the Karma Kagyu sect of Buddhism founded
900 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The crown was brought to the Indian state of Sikkim, then an independent
Buddhist kingdom, by the 16th Karmapa when he fled Chinese rule in 1959. He died
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa, who defected to India last week, wants to go to Sikkim's
Rumtek monastery to reclaim the crown, the symbol of his enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
	   Legend says that only people with spiritual insight can see the true black
crown, said to be woven from the hair of female deities. Those who can see it at
the Black Crown Ceremony are released from the cycle of life, death and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
	   The black crown kept in Rumtek is believed to have been made by the
15th-century Chinese emperor Ming Chen, who saw the mystical crown hovering over
the Karmapa when the lama visited his court.
</P>
<P>
	   Realizing that not everyone had attained the same spiritual advancement, the
emperor created a crown that would be visible to all.
</P>
<P>
	   Tibetans believe the spirits of high lamas are reborn to continue teaching
compassion and helping mankind and that their incarnations can be identified
through meditation and a series of signs.
</P>
<P>
	   When the previous Karmapa was dying, he wrote a 13-line riddle to help his
disciples find his reincarnation, then hid it. Nine years later, his disciple
Tai Situ Rinpoche discovered it sewn into a brocade amulet the Karmapa had given
him and which he had worn around his neck or wrist all those years.
</P>
<P>
	   With three other regents, Tai Situ deciphered the note and sent two monks to
find their reborn leader in eastern Tibet. The riddle read in part:
</P>
<P>
	   ``From here to the north in the east of the land of snow
</P>
<P>
	   Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes
</P>
<P>
	   In a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow.
</P>
<P>
	   The method is Dondrup and the wisdom is Lolaga.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in the year of the one used for the earth.
</P>
<P>
	   With the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the white one:
</P>
<P>
	   This is the one known as Karmapa.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with these clues, the searchers went to Lhathok, which means ``God's
Thunder.'' Most of the inhabitants are known as ``Bakor,'' derived from the word
for ``cow.''
</P>
<P>
	   There they found their 17th Karmapa -- 7-year-old Ugyen Trinley Dorje, born
in 1985, the year of the Wood Ox by the Tibetan calendar, to parents named
Dondrup and Lolaga.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers told the monks that three days after Ugyen Trinley Dorje was born
they heard music and the sound of conch shells for more than an hour, but could
not find the source.

<HEADLINE> Russian Bombs Rain Down on Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSLAN MUSAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian bombs and artillery rained down on the
Chechen capital with renewed intensity Saturday, setting an oil depot ablaze and
sending black smoke into the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides claimed to be inflicting heavy losses in the protracted fight for
the capital, Grozny. Russian soldiers attacked the city with mortar fire, and
heavy fighting was reported at a meat canning factory and in other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, insisted the offensive was going
according to plan, despite rebel attacks last week that set back the Russian
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll take Grozny ... and then we'll finish the operation in the
mountains,'' he said on Russia's ORT television Saturday night. Putin's high
popularity is considered closely tied to his role in managing the war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   He also promised to respect Chechnya's people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Chechen civilians are our citizens and we will never sacrifice them
for the sake of a military goal. We will act toughly but not cruelly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, the president of the neighboring Russian republic of
Ingushetia said the military had lifted all restrictions on Chechens trying to
enter or exit Chechnya. The Russians' order last week to detain all males
between age 10 and 60 to check for rebel ties provoked strong foreign criticism.
No explanation was given for lifting the restriction.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil depot at Grozny's main refinery caught fire after it was bombed by
Russian warplanes Saturday. Chechen rebels claimed that one of their
anti-aircraft units shot down an Su-25 bomber in Grozny on Friday night. The
Russian Defense Ministry denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting a steady increase in bombing sorties in recent days, the Russian
military reported 180 raids over the past 24 hours, Russian news reports said.
The strikes appeared the heaviest in weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Konstantin Kukharenko, a military spokesman, said Saturday that
Russian troops had captured the towns of Sharoi and Simoi in the southern
mountains and that rebels were trying to escape the area disguised as civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Isa Munayev, the rebel commandant in Grozny, said 28 Russian scouts were
killed in the capital on Saturday. Russia claimed it killed 58 rebels from a
group trying to make its way from Grozny to southern Chechen bases, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But the casualty claims are impossible to
verify, and both sides usually exaggerate enemy losses and underreport their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's Defense Ministry has denied media reports of growing Russian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chechen commander Mumadi Saidayev insisted the rebels retain the upper
hand. Observers say the Russians, despite their much larger force and better
weaponry, could get bogged down in guerrilla fighting in the mountains against
rebels familiar with the unforgiving terrain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guerrilla war will go on until the last Russian soldier leaves
Chechnya, and it will intensify every day,'' Saidayev said in an interview. ``In
Grozny there are attempts by the federals to break through the defense which are
accompanied by great losses. Almost the whole city is controlled by the
Chechens.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel attacks in Grozny's streets devastated Russian troops in the 1994-96
Chechnya war. Seeking to avoid a repeat scenario, Russia's military this time
has hammered the city with bombs for months and sent in small groups of soldiers
to pick off remaining fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy hasn't yet brought the Russians a major victory in Grozny. It
has left much of the city in ruins and the remaining residents huddled in
basements.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia moved troops into Chechnya in late September after weeks of
airstrikes. The offensive is intended to wipe out Chechnya-based rebels who
twice invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan in August and who are blamed
for apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Rallies for Ill. Students  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson used the birthday of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as a rallying point Saturday in his crusade
for six black students expelled from the Decatur school system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We seek to honor his memory by fighting from Decatur to Wall Street,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to supporters at the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition's weekly meeting,
Jackson reaffirmed plans to appeal a judge's decision upholding the expulsions
and geared up for a rally Saturday night in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
	   He contended U.S. District Judge Michael McCuskey put ``politics over
principle'' in his ruling and said, ``This is not the first time we've had to
fight unjust judges.''
</P>
<P>
	   The teens originally were expelled for up to two years as the result of a
bleacher-clearing fight at a football game last September. After intervention by
Jackson and the governor, the city's school board cut the time to one year and
let the six teens attend alternative schools.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jackson said the punishment was still too harsh for a fight that
involved no weapons or drugs and that hurt no one seriously. He said he would
ask the school board on Tuesday to reinstate a seventh student who withdrew from
school rather than face expulsion. Jackson says the teen-ager was being hit and
was not fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   During protests in Decatur late last year, Jackson said the expulsions were
not a racial issue. But in the lawsuit, the students argued the school district
disproportionately expelled black students and disciplined them more harshly
than white students.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said there was no evidence race was an issue. He also said the
students' actions threatened community safety.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers, and
the senator retorted that the governor was trying a ``Texas two-step'' around
his own failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes called them both ``the timid tax cutters'' of the Republican
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Their tax arguments dominated a 90-minute debate among the six GOP
candidates for the 2000 nomination, their last Iowa confrontation before the
first votes of the year are cast in the Jan. 24 precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the faraway leader in the Iowa polls, with Forbes a lagging second,
and McCain, who is not actively campaigning, Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch, and
Alan Keyes trailing the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush challenged McCain on a loophole-closing proposal in his tax-cut plan
that would eliminate the tax-free treatment of workplace benefits including
continuing education, transportation and meals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have a plan that in essence raises taxes on working people by $40
billion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm giving them a huge tax cut,'' McCain countered. ``And the reality is
that your tax plan has 36 percent of it going to the richest one percent in
America.''
</P>
<P>
	   So McCain said he could tell a working mother ``I've got a tax cut for you
and Governor Bush doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not true,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, McCain said, the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, ``has
not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for Medicare and not one penny
for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And when you run ads saying you're going to take care of Social Security,
my friend, that's all hat and no cattle,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's cute, but ... '' Bush countered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, they're always cutest when they're true,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not true,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign issued a statement saying that his $240 billion,
five-year tax cut plan, would end ``a loophole that allowed corporations to get
a tax benefit for giving employes things like golf and health club memberships
and free parking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign manager Rick Davis said that would end ``corporate welfare'' to
finance a working class tax cut and put money into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is concentrating his campaign on the New Hampshire presidential
primary on Feb. 1, and Forbes is Bush's closest rival in Iowa, but far behind in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes challenged Bush on taxes, too.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the governor's Texas tax cuts ``are more apparent than real,'' that
most Texans never see them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not only are my tax cuts real, they've reduced the baseline of the
budget,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said in six out of 10 Texas districts, the property tax rate went up
in 1999. ``That's a Clinton tax cut,'' Forbes said. ``That's the kind he would
like. Raise the tax and call it a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Steve, look, that's good research, it's not true,'' Bush retorted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm the one person on this stage who has fought for and signed tax cuts,''
Bush said. ''... ``I've got a good record, I'm the only one on this stage who's
got a record endorsed by the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush cited an ad taken by Bob Dole in The Des Moines Register on Saturday,
in which the 1996 GOP nominee said he'd been damaged against the Democrats by
attack ads Forbes ran against him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell the whole record,''
Bush told Forbes. ``And I cut taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who proposes a 17 percent flat tax, has ads attacking Bush for
breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by including increases in some sales
and business taxes in a plan to cut property taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like most government programs, it lived on forever,'' past its birth in
the 1970s when the country was in a crisis over imported oil, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lecturing tone, Bush rebutted. ``I believe that we ought to increase
demand for Iowa products. That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the
demand for Iowa products.''
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, Hatch, Bauer, Keyes,
Forbes, Bush and McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his
administration for its policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he supports a patients bill of rights, which is anathema to most
conservatives. ``There's nothing Republican or conservative about standing
with'' big HMOs in opposition to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the only way to get needed action on health care is to reform
political financing, his keynote issue, so that insurers and HMOs can't get
special interest treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   In one segment of the debate, the Republicans questioned each other, and
Keyes asked Bush about a Texas town in which the city council voted to have all
business conducted in Spanish. He called that an assault on ``linguistic unity''
and said Bush hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush began his answer in Spanish: ``That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had expressed concern about the episode, had told the Texas
attorney general to look into it. ``English is our nation's language,'' Bush
said. ``That's why I'm for programs to make sure our children learn English.''
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days
before the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically even
with the national frontrunner in the latest surveys.

<HEADLINE> Serb Paramilitary Leader Said Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen shot and killed a notorious Serb
paramilitary leader on Saturday in the lobby of the Belgrade Intercontinental
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was taken to a hospital for
emergency surgery, police said. A doctor at Belgrade's emergency hospital, who
asked not to be identified, said he had seen Arkan and that ``all vital
functions had stopped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official Tanjug news agency later confirmed that Arkan had died and that
two others with him had been shot, including a bodyguard who was also killed.
Other media reports said that his sister-in-law was wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word of arrests, suspects or a motive.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses differed on the number of assailants. Some said that Arkan was
shot by a group of masked attackers. Others spoke of one gunman. The independent
Studio B television network reported two attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   A source in the Intercontinental Hotel, who asked not to be named, said the
gunmen escaped after at least one bullet hit Arkan in the eye while he was
sitting in a sectioned-off part of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, 47, and his paramilitary forces have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during Serbia's war with Croatia. Reputedly one of Serbia's
wealthiest individuals, Arkan was a longtime ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces
sided with Serb rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Full details of the charges have not been released, but former British
Defense Minister George Robertson said last year that Arkan was indicted for the
1991 massacre of 250 men taken from a hospital in Vukovar, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leaders, reacting to the killing, alluded to Arkan's link to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone who knew a lot and took part in many things was killed,'' said
Goran Svilanovic, a leader of the anti-Milosevic Civic Alliance, adding that
Arkan ``was very close to the authorities, or so it seemed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vladan Batic, also with the Civic Alliance said: ``Someone is pulling the
strings and decides who's going to be next.''
</P>
<P>
	   In London, the British Foreign Office issued a statement saying it had
confirmed Arkan's death. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``Arkan
lived violently so it is therefore no surprise that he died violently.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret his death because it prevents us doing justice to the victims of
his atrocities by seeing him in the dock of at The Hague war crimes tribunal,''
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's long criminal record goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when he became
a suspect in bank and jewelry store robberies in Sweden, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Germany. In 1981 he managed to escape from a heavily guarded
hospital room in Frankfurt. The international police, Interpol, issued three
arrest warrants for him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1980s, Arkan was reportedly recruited by Yugoslavia's secret
service to be an assassin in charge of killing dissidents living in the West,
mostly Croats and Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   Working for Serbian police, Arkan was later in charge of organizing Belgrade
soccer fans to cause trouble at stadiums in neighboring Croatia, which was
seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
	   On the eve of Yugoslavia's civil war in 1991, Arkan's job was reputedly to
deliver arms to Serbs living in Croatia and help their rebellion against the
independence-seeking Croatian leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   In the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia that began in 1991, the Belgrade ice
cream parlor owner made his fortune in black market currency trading, oil
smuggling and arms dealing.
</P>
<P>
	   He owned a first division soccer club, Obilic, which was banned last year
from all international competitions because of his links with war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   His ``Tigers'' militia, meanwhile, became known for savagery.
</P>
<P>
	   During the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia, Arkan frequently warned the
Atlantic Alliance against a land invasion, warning of fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan married a popular Serbian folk singer, Ceca, in 1995 and had two
children with her. In his previous two marriages, he had seven children. He and
Ceca were frequent visitors to Belgrade's Hyatt Hotel during the bombing,
apparently fearing to stay at home and risk becoming a NATO target.

<HEADLINE> Letterman cracking jokes day after bypass surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Television funnyman David Letterman was cracking jokes
in his hospital room Saturday as he began his recovery from emergency quintuple
bypass surgery.
<P>
	   "I feel fantastic," Letterman, 52, said the morning after his operation,
according to a statement. "In addition to rerouting the arteries, they also
installed an E-Z Pass."
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors performed the surgery on Friday, after an angiogram showed that one
of Letterman's arteries was severely constricted. He had the test because of
high cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family.
</P>
<P>
	   The wisecracking host came through the procedure well, his surgeon said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave's doing great," said Dr. O. Wayne Isom, chairman of cardiothoracic
surgery at the Weill Cornell Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. "He's
making jokes and feels terrific. He's on his way to a full recovery."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician, Dr. Louis J. Aronne, and his cardiologist,
Dr. Martin Post, have said it is too soon to say how long the comedian will need
to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, received flowers
from President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared on his show
Wednesday to discuss her likely Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and fans near the midtown Manhattan theater where he tapes "Late
Show with David Letterman" for CBS - and often brings his cameras into shops and
bars - were hoping for his good health.
</P>
<P>
	   "We love him," said Sirajul Islam, who manages a souvenir shop next door to
the theater and often appears with Letterman on the "Late Show." "It's a very
sad weekend for us, the whole neighborhood. ... I was not even sleeping last
night, watching television reporting about his condition, almost all night."
</P>
<P>
	   Most said they were shocked by the sudden surgery, although Letterman has
often joked on the air about his health, starting years ago when he discovered
he had high cholesterol. For a month he went on an oat-bran diet and complained
about it to his audience nightly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was pretty surprised because I knew he had just gone in for ... a
checkup," said Christopher Fortier, 24, of Southington, Conn., who was browsing
and watching "Late Show" reruns in the CBS store near Letterman's studio. "He's
probably getting a kick out of it, the fact that everybody's paying so much
attention. I guess it'll show him how important he is to a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said the comedian's doctors and
family would not release any further details Saturday about his condition "and
ask that Dave's privacy be respected while he recuperates."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman joked about his arteries with guest Regis Philbin during the
program that was taped on Thursday and aired Friday, joking that after his
tests, doctors might have to "open daddy's rib cage."
</P>
<P>
	   In bypass surgery, doctors reroute the flow of blood to the heart to bypass
blockages.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS plans to telecast reruns of the "Late Show" while Letterman recovers.

<HEADLINE> Serb Paramilitary Leader Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen shot and killed a notorious Serb
paramilitary leader on Saturday in the lobby of the Belgrade Intercontinental
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was taken to a hospital for
emergency surgery, police said. A doctor at Belgrade's emergency hospital, who
asked not to be identified, said he had seen Arkan and that ``all vital
functions had stopped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official Tanjug news agency later confirmed that Arkan had died and that
two others with him had been shot, including a bodyguard who was also killed.
Other media reports said that his sister-in-law was wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word of arrests, suspects or a motive.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses differed on the number of assailants. Some said that Arkan was
shot by a group of masked attackers. Others spoke of one gunman. The independent
Studio B television network reported two attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   A source in the Intercontinental Hotel, who asked not to be named, said the
gunmen escaped after at least one bullet hit Arkan in the eye while he was
sitting in a sectioned-off part of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, 47, and his paramilitary forces have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during Serbia's war with Croatia. Reputedly one of Serbia's
wealthiest individuals, Arkan was a longtime ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces
sided with Serb rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Full details of the charges have not been released, but former British
Defense Minister George Robertson said last year that Arkan was indicted for the
1991 massacre of 250 men taken from a hospital in Vukovar, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leaders, reacting to the killing, alluded to Arkan's link to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone who knew a lot and took part in many things was killed,'' said
Goran Svilanovic, a leader of the anti-Milosevic Civic Alliance, adding that
Arkan ``was very close to the authorities, or so it seemed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vladan Batic, also with the Civic Alliance said: ``Someone is pulling the
strings and decides who's going to be next.''
</P>
<P>
	   In London, the British Foreign Office issued a statement saying it had
confirmed Arkan's death. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``Arkan
lived violently so it is therefore no surprise that he died violently.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret his death because it prevents us doing justice to the victims of
his atrocities by seeing him in the dock of at The Hague war crimes tribunal,''
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's long criminal record goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when he became
a suspect in bank and jewelry store robberies in Sweden, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Germany. In 1981 he managed to escape from a heavily guarded
hospital room in Frankfurt. The international police, Interpol, issued three
arrest warrants for him.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1980s, Arkan was reportedly recruited by Yugoslavia's secret
service to be an assassin in charge of killing dissidents living in the West,
mostly Croats and Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   Working for Serbian police, Arkan was later in charge of organizing Belgrade
soccer fans to cause trouble at stadiums in neighboring Croatia, which was
seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
	   On the eve of Yugoslavia's civil war in 1991, Arkan's job was reputedly to
deliver arms to Serbs living in Croatia and help their rebellion against the
independence-seeking Croatian leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   In the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia that began in 1991, the Belgrade ice
cream parlor owner made his fortune in black market currency trading, oil
smuggling and arms dealing.
</P>
<P>
	   He owned a first division soccer club, Obilic, which was banned last year
from all international competitions because of his links with war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   His ``Tigers'' militia, meanwhile, became known for savagery.
</P>
<P>
	   During the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia, Arkan frequently warned the
Atlantic Alliance against a land invasion, warning of fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan married a popular Serbian folk singer, Ceca, in 1995 and had two
children with her. In his previous two marriages, he had seven children. He and
Ceca were frequent visitors to Belgrade's Hyatt Hotel during the bombing,
apparently fearing to stay at home and risk becoming a NATO target.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Lawmakers Address Sprawl  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- For 50 years, Natomas Air Field and the pilots
who used it had few neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   The airport was built in a flood plain in the fields north of Sacramento.
Then came the levee improvements, and in 1997, city officials lifted a building
moratorium in the plain, letting loose a flood of shopping centers, movie
theaters and homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight, it seemed, Russ Kilmer saw Sacramento grow toward him and his
27-acre airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, in what anti-urban sprawl activists say is a perfect illustration of
their concerns, Kilmer and his 40 crop dusters and private planes are being
pushed off the land to make way for more houses and stores. City officials
changed the area's zoning from agriculture to residential and retail and gave
Kilmer until the end of this month to shut the airport down.
</P>
<P>
	   Development is coming even though the airport's land was contaminated by
decades of farm chemicals from the crop dusters, Kilmer said. He doesn't believe
anyone would pay to clean it up for housing, but the rules are more lenient for
commercial use, and commercial businesses are taking advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's what's happening all over,'' Kilmer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cities are sprawling over farm land and into unsuitable areas at an alarming
rate, even with the environmental hazards that could pose, said Brett Hulsey,
director of the Sierra Club's anti-sprawl project.
</P>
<P>
	   ``California has been dealing with growth issues overall, but of the 11
states that have growth-management acts, California ranks ninth,'' Hulsey said.
``That basically means the laws aren't working.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are state laws that require land-use plans for forest, agricultural
and coastal land, but the laws don't tell counties and cities how to implement
those plans, said Peter Detwiler, a consultant for the Senate Committee on Local
Government.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, California's laws have been described as ``Jell-O without a
mold,'' Detwiler said. With the absence of policy comes urban sprawl, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprawl, as defined by the California Futures Network, is poorly planned
residential developments that devour farmland and open space and spawn traffic
congestion, pollution and a diminished quality of life.
</P>
<P>
	   It occurs mostly on the edges of cities where there are few neighbors to
cry: ``Not in my backyard,'' Detwiler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of urban sprawl surfaces for discussion every few years, then
disappears, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   This appears to be a year when legislators are willing to talk about it,
especially in light of projections that the state's population is expected to
grow by 12 million over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups such as the California Futures Network are promoting smart growth --
urban building that doesn't mean long commutes. The California Building Industry
Association is advancing a ``job-centered'' housing policy that would remove
obstacles to building higher-density urban housing near jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Overly restrictive policies would push California into a housing crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, I think we're already at a crisis stage,'' said spokesman Tim
Coyle.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department of Finance estimates 250,000 new homes should be built
each year to keep up with population growth, but only about half that number are
built.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of legislators will meet informally next week for the first time to
address the issue in a caucus on responsible growth, said Assemblywoman Pat
Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus will look at recommendations from a panel that studied the issue
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of all the things the Legislature did last year, the one true failing
grade we give them is this area,'' said Gerald Meral, executive director of the
Planning and Conservation League. ``There's not a hint, not a ripple, not a
whisper that indicates they will do anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kilmer, meanwhile, has contacted every member of the Sacramento City Council
in an effort to keep his airport operating, at least for a few more years until
he retires.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't blame the developers. Housing, shopping, transportation -- they're
just responding to a need,'' he said. ``But you just can't relocate an
airport.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Republican Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Highlights from Saturday's debate in Johnston, Iowa, among Republican
presidential candidates Gary Bauer, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Steve Forbes,
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as
transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House:
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   McCain elaborated on his tax plans after Bush said his plan would hurt
working people:
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN: In fact, not only does my proposal take care of the working mom, but
also the nonworking mom.
</P>
<P>
	   But again, the crux of this issue is, do we want to give middle-income and
lower-income Americans a much-needed tax break and also take care of the other
obligations that we have made over the years?
</P>
<P>
	   We are staggering under a $5.6 trillion national debt. My friends, we can't
lay that burden on future generations of Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Social Security trust fund is a ticking time bomb. We all know that at
2014 more money will be going out than coming in.
</P>
<P>
	   I want to take this surplus, put it into -- 62 percent of it into Social
Security, help Medicare, pay down the debt and give Americans a tax break. And
part of that will be paid for by eliminating a lot of this corporate welfare and
wasteful spending.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that if we bank on these surpluses -- George, three years ago people
were saying there are going to be surpluses as far as -- deficits as far as we
can see. Now they're saying they will have surpluses as far as the eye can see.
I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Bush and McCain had a brief exchange on their respective tax plans:
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: I'm the one person on this stage who has fought for and signed tax
cuts. I signed the two largest tax cuts in my state's history. I have laid out a
plan that is realistic, that is doable, that achieves a couple of the main
objectives. One, to make sure our economy continues to grow. And that's why I
cut the rates on all people who pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   I've got a plan that makes the code more fair. The marriage penalty's
unfair. The death tax is unfair. The earnings test on Social Security is unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   I've got a plan that hears the call of people who live on the outskirts of
poverty. I believe by cutting the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent, we
help people access the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   I believe it's important to have a tax cut. I will tell you what's going to
happen. If we leave money in Washington, D.C., the people are going to spend it
on bigger government and on more programs.
</P>
<P>
	   I agree with the idea of trying to trim down budgets, John. But the best way
to reduce the fat in Washington is to send money back to the people who pay the
taxes. And that's exactly what I intend to do.
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN: George, you say that the money, if it remains in Washington,
Congress will spend it. The president of the United States is not a hapless
bystander. Just last fall, just last fall in November, Congress passed one of
the most obscene pieces of work that I've seen -- a pork-laden bill that spent
the entire $14 billion surplus. I fought against that bill. I voted against it.
I railed against it. You said you supported it, and would have signed it. The
president of the United States can force the Congress of the United States to
spend less money. And if they won't, he can make them famous.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   All candidates were asked how they would act to maintain the dignity of the
presidency:
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: I think we know how to do that. I think the seven -- the last seven
years has been an aberration, not a reflection of the values of the American
people. I will be dedicated to returning good values to the Oval Office and to
my administration.
</P>
<P>
	   HATCH: It hasn't been right for our kids. When this president said on MTV,
``I didn't inhale,'' that sent the wrong message to every kid in this country,
because all those kids knew that he had to inhale, and he did inhale. And if he
did, then a lot of them think, well, why can't they. Now that's the kind of
example we've got to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
	   KEYES: I think we ought to stop kidding ourselves here. That wasn't Bill
Clinton's problem, it was our problem. And our problem is that we have turned
our back on the fundamental premise of this nation's life: that our rights come
from God and must be exercised with respect for the authority of God.
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN: The first and primary responsibility of the President of the United
States is to protect its security and conduct foreign policy. This
administration has conducted foreign policy in a feckless, photo-op way that
will cause us perhaps to have to expend our most precious assets: our American
blood and treasure.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: A president also brings an administration to Washington, D.C. The
administration I'll bring is a group of men and women who are focused on what's
best for America -- honest men and women, decent men and women. Women who will
see service to our country as a great privilege, and who will not stain the
house.
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES: The dignity of the office has been besmirched. The office will
recover because it is greater than any single individual. Harry Truman and
others showed that people with seemingly limited abilities could rise to the
occasion and just not treat it as some plaything. All candidates were asked
about their positions on education policy and school vouchers:
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES: The more the federal government is involved in education, the
greater an education crisis we will have. The key to education renaissance in
America -- renewal -- is to put parents, not politics, in charge of our schools.
One thing I will do as president is take that money from the Education
Department, earmark it, block-grant it back to states and municipalities, with
the provision that parents have true choice in picking their schools.
</P>
<P>
	   KEYES: I think it's absolutely critical that we put the control of our
educational system back in the hands of our parents. In order to do that,
though, we're going to have to overcome the arguments that those parents don't
have the responsibility, don't have the concern, don't have the love, don't have
the capacity to do the right thing. That's what Clinton and his liberal buddies
are always saying. They play on our lack of moral confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN: Choice and competition are the key to the future of education in
America. And if we don't keep that decision-making process at the state and
local level, then we'll just see a repetition of what we've seen in the past,
which is a very unfortunate situation.
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: I support vouchers, credits for all forms of education, including
home-schoolers. I think we can get the bureaucracy out of the way and begin to
have some real good things happen in the classroom again, which is what every
American, Republican or Democrat, wants. It's not a money problem; it's a will
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: I'm not running for federal superintendent of schools, and I don't
want to be the federal principal. I want to pass power back from Washington,
D.C., to states. I've had a lot of experience when it comes to improving public
education. It starts with trusting local people to make the right decisions for
their schools. I strongly believe in local control of schools, and so I will
work with the Congress to pass power back from Washington, D.C., in block-grant
form to states and local jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
	   HATCH: Our founding fathers believed that we have 13 state laboratories --
now 50 state laboratories -- where we could compare back and forth, and
determine which state is the best one, which one is the best laboratory. Can we
learn from this state? Can we learn from that? That's the way you do it, with
the families having the control.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes asked Bush what action he would take in a Texas town where the city
council passed an ordinance saying that all the town's business is to be
conducted in Spanish:
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: I did express concern about it. And I do express concern about it.
English is our nation's language. That's why I'm for programs that make sure our
children learn to speak English. ... English is the great language that provides
freedom and opportunity, plus we respect other people's heritage in this
country.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes asked Keyes if he would support oil exploration in Alaska:
</P>
<P>
	   KEYES: We want to do it in a way that's responsible. But we know that our
science now allows us to do this exploration in ways that will respect
ecological and environmental requirements, at the same time that we can exploit
God's precious resources for the good of our people.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bush asked McCain why his tax plan would force a single mom to pay taxes on
employer-provided benefits. Bush called it a $40 billion tax increase:
</P>
<P>
	   McCAIN: I'm giving them a huge tax cut. And that is a fact.
</P>
<P>
	   And the reality is, that your tax plan has 36 percent of it going to the
richest 1 percent in America. I don't do that. I think that we ought to give the
tax relief to the people that need it the most.
</P>
<P>
	   But I also think the best thing I can do for that woman you're talking about
is save her Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes was asked about benefits for family farmers and aiding the farm
economy:
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES: It's critical, in addition to doing -- opening more markets, getting
those barriers reduced -- that we do more to enforce these antitrust laws here
at home, and also do more on research and development. After all, we have a
whole high-tech industry based on grains of sand, literally writing whole worlds
on grains of sand.
</P>
<P>
	   If we can do that with sand, silicon, why in the world can't we do that with
corn and wheat and other agricultural products -- find new uses.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer asked Hatch if he would put trade before human rights in U.S. foreign
policy regarding China. Bauer responded by calling Hatch's answer ``naive'':
</P>
<P>
	   HATCH: Well, I happen to believe that I have put national security and human
rights in front of trade. But I was there in China in the late '70s, the early
'80s, the late '80s, the early '90s and the late '90s. The difference between
the late '70s and the late '90s is so stark, you can't hardly believe it,
because there is a creeping freedom that is growing there because we're bringing
China into the world of nations and expecting them to abide by the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, they don't treat liberty very well over there. They violate human
rights. They've enslaved the Tibetans. And they've threatened Taiwan, and
they've caused problems all over that area.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, I don't think the way to solve the problem is to isolate
China. I think the way to solve the problem is to bring China into the world of
nations -- WTO, IMF, et cetera -- where they've got to act like real human
beings.
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: And I can tell you, Senator, that President Ronald Reagan never gave
the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status. I would agree with you that China
-- there's some creeping going on. The creeping is the Chinese presence now in
the Panama Canal Zone. The creeping are the missiles coming, and now aimed at
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Sir, we cannot trade our way out of this problem. You are being naive in
your answer.

<HEADLINE> Germans March For Communist Heroes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- An estimated 100,000 people marched in commemoration of two
heroes of German communism in eastern Berlin on Saturday, guarded by police
after a threat against the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   No violence was reported during the march to a memorial for Rosa Luxemburg
and Karl Liebknecht, who were killed by soldiers in Berlin during a failed 1919
uprising.
</P>
<P>
	   The Party of Democratic Socialism, the former East German Communist Party,
organized the event. Leaders of the party laid wreaths at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the former East German regime, the deaths of Liebknecht and Luxemburg
were marked with annual commemorations. The party revived the marches in 1992,
two years after Germany was officially reunified.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,000 police, including rooftop snipers and bomb experts, protected
marchers after the party received a letter from a man wanted on arson charges
who threatened to use a machine gun and hand grenades on the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Police distributed leaflets to residents along the route, warning them to
look out for suspicious people or packages.
</P>
<P>
	   The party had called off the originally planned march the previous Sunday
because of the threat, citing police pressure.

	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) -- Drug trafficking, immigration laws, NAFTA,
corruption: Numerous issues remain outstanding between the United States and
Mexico as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright prepares for meetings here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, U.S. and Mexican officials have revealed few details on what
Albright will discuss when she meets Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green in
the southern Mexican city of Oaxaca on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican Foreign Relations ministry did not issue a statement, and a U.S.
Embassy spokesman referred inquiries to the State Department's Web site, which
cryptically summarized the visit as a meeting to continue ``ongoing discussions
and review of this crucial bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, on a three-day tour of Latin America, was expected to arrive late
Saturday night from Panama, where she was meeting President Mireya Moscoso and
reviewing results of the recent transfer of the Panama Canal from U.S. to local
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Before visiting Panama, Albright met Colombian officials to exchange views
on a multibillion-dollar U.S. aid package designed to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   In Oaxaca, Green and Albright were to meet Sunday morning before touring the
ancient Zapotec ruins at Monte Alban. She was to return to Washington on Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that both President Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo are
in the last year of their terms, ``I don't expect very dramatic news to come
out,'' said John Bailey, a Mexican specialist and government professor at
Georgetown University in Washington. ``It sounds kind of routine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright wasn't exactly making a big splash among residents or out-of-town
visitors to Oaxaca, a colorful city known for its ruins, colonial architecture
and black pottery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, you're kidding. She's coming here?'' said Canadian tourist Geri Rea,
lunching Saturday afternoon with her husband in an outdoor cafe next to the
city's crowded central plaza. ``She should be in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Cristobal Aquino, a 42-year-old Oaxacan primary school teacher getting
a shoeshine while reading the state's most prominent newspaper, Noticias, said
he wasn't sure who Albright was. He said the paper hadn't even mentioned the
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   As for what Albright might accomplish, Aquino said he would like to see the
two countries do something to stop the mistreatment of Mexican immigrants
working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   That was an issue also on the mind of 48-year-old Irene Ruiz, who was having
breakfast Saturday morning at the Hotel Victoria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They need to give more help to the Mexicans who cross the border to
work,'' she said. ``To give them more information on what's going to happen when
they arrive.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain and Forbes trade charges over competing tax-cut plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) - George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers, and
the senator retorted that the governor was trying a "Texas two-step" around his
own failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security.
<P>
	   Steve Forbes called them both "the timid tax cutters" of the Republican
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Their tax arguments dominated a 90-minute debate among the six GOP
candidates for the 2000 nomination, their last Iowa confrontation before the
first votes of the year are cast in the Jan. 24 precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the faraway leader in the Iowa polls, with Forbes a lagging second,
and McCain, who is not actively campaigning, Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch, and
Alan Keyes trailing the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush challenged McCain on a loophole-closing proposal in his tax-cut plan
that would eliminate the tax-free treatment of workplace benefits including
continuing education, transportation and meals.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have a plan that in essence raises taxes on working people by $40
billion," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm giving them a huge tax cut," McCain countered. "And the reality is that
your tax plan has 36 percent of it going to the richest one percent in America."
</P>
<P>
	   So McCain said he could tell a working mother "I've got a tax cut for you
and Governor Bush doesn't."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, McCain said, the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, "has
not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for Medicare and not one penny
for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "And when you run ads saying you're going to take care of Social Security,
my friend, that's all hat and no cattle," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's cute, but ... " Bush countered.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, they're always cutest when they're true," said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain campaign issued a statement saying that his $240 billion,
five-year tax cut plan, would end "a loophole that allowed corporations to get a
tax benefit for giving employes things like golf and health club memberships and
free parking."
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign manager Rick Davis said that would end "corporate welfare" to
finance a working class tax cut and put money into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is concentrating his campaign on the New Hampshire presidential
primary on Feb. 1, and Forbes is Bush's closest rival in Iowa, but far behind in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes challenged Bush on taxes, too.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the governor's Texas tax cuts "are more apparent than real," that
most Texans never see them.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only are my tax cuts real, they've reduced the baseline of the budget,"
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said in six out of 10 Texas districts, the property tax rate went up
in 1999. "That's a Clinton tax cut," Forbes said. "That's the kind he would
like. Raise the tax and call it a tax cut."
</P>
<P>
	   "Steve, look, that's good research, it's not true," Bush retorted.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the one person on this stage who has fought for and signed tax cuts,"
Bush said. "... "I've got a good record, I'm the only one on this stage who's
got a record endorsed by the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush cited an ad taken by Bob Dole in The Des Moines Register on Saturday,
in which the 1996 GOP nominee said he'd been damaged against the Democrats by
attack ads Forbes ran against him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell the whole record," Bush
told Forbes. "And I cut taxes."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who proposes a 17 percent flat tax, has ads attacking Bush for
breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by including increases in some sales
and business taxes in a plan to cut property taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like most government programs, it lived on forever," past its birth in the
1970s when the country was in a crisis over imported oil, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lecturing tone, Bush rebutted. "I believe that we ought to increase
demand for Iowa products. That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the
demand for Iowa products."
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, Hatch, Bauer, Keyes,
Forbes, Bush and McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his
administration for its policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he supports a patients bill of rights, which is anathema to most
conservatives. "There's nothing Republican or conservative about standing with"
big HMOs in opposition to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the only way to get needed action on health care is to reform
political financing, his keynote issue, so that insurers and HMOs can't get
special interest treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   In one segment of the debate, the Republicans questioned each other, and
Keyes asked Bush about a Texas town in which the city council voted to have all
business conducted in Spanish. He called that an assault on "linguistic unity"
and said Bush hadn't done anything about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush began his answer in Spanish: "That's not true."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had expressed concern about the episode, had told the Texas
attorney general to look into it. "English is our nation's language," Bush said.
"That's why I'm for programs to make sure our children learn English."
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days
before the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically even
with the national frontrunner in the latest surveys.

<HEADLINE> Pinelands Commission gives OK to reopen landfill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTHAMPTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Despite the objections of
environmentalists and many residents, the New Jersey Pinelands Commission voted
to reopen a landfill in Ocean Township and build half a dozen communications
towers in the forest preserve.
<P>
	   The 9-4 vote on Friday to reopen the landfill came after the commission's
newly appointed chairman, Jerrold L. Jacobs, took his seat for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   The landfill and tower issues had been under debate for months, with a
majority of public comment aimed at the landfill, which was closed 11 years ago
because its contaminants posed a threat to people living nearby. The landfill
has never been properly cleaned and capped.
</P>
<P>
	   The communications towers also drew concern from people who said the
structures are not in the best interests of the Pine Barrens.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs, who voted for the landfill plan, said the plan wasn't perfect but
would prevent legal delays and improve the landfill.
</P>
<P>
	   "I voted for it on the basis that it was the best solution to a not-perfect
situation," Jacobs told The Press of Atlantic City for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists said the vote sets a bad precedent, and worried that new
waste to the landfill could add lead, mercury and other pollutants to the dump.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Environmental Protection has wanted to hire owner
United Environmental Services Inc. to reopen the landfill. The company has a
plan to take in about 435,000 cubic yards of broken glass and demolition and
construction debris.
</P>
<P>
	   The waste would cover contaminates already there and level a part of the
site that is lined to prevent leachates from entering soil or groundwater. The
company would be paid about $7 million to accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would also be used to pay for a permanent cap to the lined section
of the landfill. Right now, rainwater percolates through the open portion of the
landfill and leaches about 30,000 gallons a day of contaminated water into the
Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer.
</P>
<P>
	   But to launch the plan, the DEP needed the commission to waive strict rules
concerning Pinelands waste.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert W. McIntosh Jr., who sits on the panel on behalf of the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior, voted against the plan. McIntosh said he wanted to
know if there were any financial assurances the company would be able to
complete the work. Residents said they had the same concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Jeff Tittle, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra
Club, said United Environmental Services should have to pay for the capping as
required by state law, rather than reopening the dump.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Friday, the commission unanimously approved a plan to allow Sprint
and Omnipoint to erect communications towers as high as 200 feet in the heart of
the Pinelands. The vote came a year after the commission allowed cellular phone
service providers to build as many as 23 towers in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   That plan calls for using 29 existing or previously approved towers, plus
six new ones, to be built to support Personal Communications Systems, or PCS.
The exact locations of the towers will depend on property negotiations and local
approvals.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs said an expert determined the PCS plan uses the fewest towers to
deliver service. He also said the commission would have been forced to accept
the plan anyway because Federal Communications Commission rules say certain
levels of service can't be denied to providers who carry a license for it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just think it's a sellout to the (Pinelands) Comprehensive Management
Plan to allow all those towers in some of the most environmentally sensitive
sections of the pines just so someone speeding to Atlantic City can talk on his
phone," Tittle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sally Dudley, Whitman's other appointment to the commission and considered a
strong environmentalist, was unable to vote because the state Senate last week
failed to approve her nomination before adjourning.

<HEADLINE> Young Monk May Emerge As Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR MAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- In a remote Buddhist monastery, a black crown has
lain disused for 18 years. Now, a teen-age Tibetan monk has arrived in India to
reclaim it -- and perhaps to step into a new leadership role for his people.
</P>
<P>
	   For 300 years, Tibetan Buddhist monks known by the title of Karmapa have
donned the Black Crown in a ceremony designed to liberate participants from the
endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16th Karmapa brought the crown with him when he fled Chinese-ruled Tibet
in 1959 and deposited it in his monastery at Rumtek, in what was then the
Buddhist kingdom of Sikkim. It has since been absorbed by India. He died in
1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the boy recognized as the old lama's reincarnation defected to
India in a grueling eight-day trek by car, horse and foot over 900 miles of
snow-draped Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrival of the 17th Karmapa, leader of the Karma Kagyu sect, has given
exiled Tibetans a new and tangible leader they can embrace alongside the
64-year-old Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of all Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
	   They wonder whether the tall 14-year-old with the engaging smile and mature
demeanor will go beyond his spiritual role and join the Dalai Lama in the
struggle against China's harsh rule of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Some hope the Karmapa might inherit the mantle of political resistance from
the Dalai Lama when he dies.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 40 years, the 14th Dalai Lama has enlightened the West with Tibet's
mystique, inspired the spread of Buddhism and kept a global spotlight on China's
dominance of his isolated nation. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama has no obvious successor. The second most powerful figure in
the Tibetan hierarchy, the Panchen Lama, hasn't been seen in public since 1995
and is believed to be under Chinese house arrest. A rival Panchen Lama enthroned
by the Chinese four years ago is rejected by most Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts, however, doubt the Karmapa can replace the Dalai Lama as the symbol
of Tibet and its primary link to the rest of the world. For reasons embedded in
Tibetan history and modern statescraft, the young monk is unlikely to attain the
same public prominence. Still, some scholars say he may be better placed than
the Dalai Lama to deal with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   For 500 years after the first Karmapa in the 12th century, the Karma Kagyu
leader assumed the regency of Tibet's feudal, monastic society. But the
so-called Black Hats were eclipsed in 1642 by the Dalai Lama's Gelugpas, or
Yellow Hats.
</P>
<P>
	   Tibet's historical trend now flows in another direction, says Lasang
Tsering, a Tibetan scholar and former director of the Tibetan Children's
Village, the biggest school for refugee children, which is run by the Dalai
Lama's administration in Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving toward a democratic form of government,'' Tsering says. ``In
the future, we will have a popularly elected chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1985 to a family of nomads, Ugyen Trinley Dorje was recognized in
1992 by both the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government as the Karmapa, the only
senior Tibetan monk with that dual stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Like all senior monks in Tibet, he was closely watched and groomed by the
Chinese. He fled in frustration when the Chinese broke a prior agreement to
allow exiled teachers of his sect to come to Tibet to instruct him. China
repeatedly denied a visa to his most important teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, a
disciple of the last Karmapa.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbie Barnett, a researcher in Chinese studies at Columbia University, said
the Karmapa's tutelage under the Chinese may place him in a unique position to
work quietly for the Tibetan cause. He told The Associated Press he wouldn't be
surprised if the Karmapa eventually returned to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   That role was filled by the last Panchen Lama, who stayed in Tibet when the
Dalai Lama and almost 100,000 of his followers fled to India after an abortive
anti-China uprising in 1959. The previous Karmapa defected the same year.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Panchen Lama spent 14 years in prison for criticizing Mao
Tse-tung's policies in Tibet, he was adept at interceding with the authorities
to win concessions for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa, Barnett says, has ``the same guts and determination'' and
the background to deal with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Chinese need a leader in Tibet to sanction their regime, and the
Tibetans need a leader who can wrest concessions in return,'' Barnett says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those bought up in exile are extremely unlikely to be masters of the
mechanics, the peculiarities of Chinese political culture and diplomacy which
are essential for this task.''

<HEADLINE> DEBATE NOTEBOOK: Pink pigs protest Pentagon pork  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) - Two men in pink pig costumes and carrying a
briefcase of play money emerged from a stretch limousine outside the site of
Saturday's Republican presidential debate.
<P>
	   "I'm a Pentagon contractor," one said, a plastic cigar clenched between his
teeth.
</P>
<P>
	   The pigs, representatives of the anti-defense spending group Iowans for
Sensible Priorities, said they were in town to protest Pentagon pork.
</P>
<P>
	   "We get money from the Pentagon and we give money back to the candidates,"
said one pig, who declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Someone from the group, planted in the crowd, then began singing "Hail to
the Pork," a parody set to the tune of the "Hail to the Chief."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   More than an hour before debate began, supporters of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and publisher Steve Forbes took their respective spots opposite each other
on the lawn of Iowa Public Television studios.
</P>
<P>
	   With campaign signs stacked on top of each other, Bush supporters
antagonized their Republican counterparts with screams of "We want Bush. We love
Bush."
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes crowd, not to be outdone, grabbed megaphones and began screaming:
"Where's your tax plan?"
</P>
<P>
	   Decked out in a neon orange Forbes T-shirt and ski cap, 81-year-old Paul
Sandhorst said the 2000 campaign was his first foray into political activism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lee Iacocca was my choice a few years ago - a businessman who knows how to
do things," Sandhorst said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Forbes, Sandhorst said, "he doesn't have any debts. No one's done him
any favors."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Decked out in a straw hat and carrying a sign that read "Grandmas for Bush,"
Rosanne Freeburg was on a mission - to obtain kiss No. 27 from George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The 72-year-old Cedar Rapids woman has kissed the Texas governor 26 times
during the past year as he campaigned in Iowa for the Republican president
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had 26 kisses for him," she said gleefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Freeburg said she supports Bush because of his stance on charter schools and
she plans to follow him to New Hampshire next week.
</P>
<P>
	   With scores of Bush supporters behind her, Freeburg stepped forward and sang
her theme song, "Should all the Grandmas Vote for Bush," to the tune of "Auld
Lang Syne."

<HEADLINE> Democratic candidate hoops it up on campaign trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) - There was no laser light show, only
glow-in-the-dark letters on black posterboard. But the pulsating music as Bill
Bradley loped toward the school auditorium was the same beat that sends the New
York Knicks charging into Madison Square Garden.
<P>
	   That beat had 71-year-old Bob Kusy dancing in his seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Long before he started following Bradley's Democratic presidential campaign,
Kusy followed his career in pro basketball. "I knew all the guys back then, but
Bill more than most because he was so good," Kusy said before Bradley's
appearance at Johnston High School, with his wife, Donna, a campaign volunteer,
beside him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly squeamish about being seen more as a jock than a president, Bradley
encourages fascination with his old athletic career. He regales every crowd with
at least one tale from his years with the Princeton Tigers, the United States'
1964 Olympic gold-medal team and the Knicks. His first political ads showed
footage from the Olympic game and he sometimes brings old teammates like Dave
DeBusschere along on the stump.
</P>
<P>
	   He joked to a high school boy in Exira that coach Phil Jackson moved from
the Chicago Bulls to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of the strategy to win
Southern California for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "How much did you pay him for that," the boy asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Not missing a beat, Bradley replied, "We were roommates on the Knicks. I
just agreed not to tell a few stories."
</P>
<P>
	   It's the fans who can be sheepish.
</P>
<P>
	   Jessica Paindiris, 16, and her father recently traveled from their home in
Connecticut to a Bradley campaign stop in New Hampshire, hoping for autographs
on the two basketballs they carried hidden in shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Jessica said she's drawn to Bradley not just by his sports celebrity but by
his integrity. "We need that now, after Bill Clinton," the girl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Professional athletes running for office is not a new phenomenon-
ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura is governor of Minnesota and former Buffalo Bills
quarterback Jack Kemp made bids for president and vice president - but it
remains something of a novelty.
</P>
<P>
	   Much like Bob Dole would visibly cringe each time Kemp, his 1996 running
mate, stripped off his coat to throw footballs, a touch of envy for Bradley's
sports appeal sometimes creeps into the remarks of Vice President Al Gore,
Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   At a New Hampshire house party late last year, Gore joked: "I played
basketball in college, too. The difference is I didn't make a big deal about
it."
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's campaign posters, featuring a vintage photo of him
dribbling in his No. 24 Knicks jersey, proclaimed him a scholar, a star athlete
and "basically the guy you hated in high school."
</P>
<P>
	   Friday night found him watching a basketball game at Theodore Roosevelt
High. At halftime, he remembered learning discipline and courage as a boy by
spending "most Friday nights in the winter in a gym just like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Roosevelt coach Michael Holmes told a reporter that, growing up, he would
pretend he was Bradley when he and the neighborhood boys played hoops in the
driveway. Today, Bradley, who attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar
after Princeton, "is the perfect role model" and helps make the point that ball
players need to study too, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley loves to tell the story about asking a Princeton professor to teach
him the Russian phrase for "Watch it, big fella" - one he repeats for campaign
crowds in a throaty shout - so he could fool the Soviet Olympic team into
thinking he understood when they called their plays aloud.
</P>
<P>
	   Athletics is good training ground for commander in chief, said Holmes.
"Anybody who can block (former Boston Celtic John) Havlicek and (Cincinnati
Royals Hall of Famer Oscar) Robertson, he's the guy I want by the button. He's
seen pressure."
</P>
<P>
	   For all the stories, Bradley mostly will not touch a basketball in front of
the news cameras except for autographs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Presidential campaigns look ahead to first votes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - The Republican campaign took a turn toward
civility in last week's runup to the first presidential voting, while Democrats
Al Gore and Bill Bradley decided that combat suited them better.
<P>
	   "The voters will have a clear choice on election day," pledged Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates looked ahead to a week of television ads, mass mailings,
phone banks and carpools designed to get supporters to the Iowa caucuses a week
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary served as an important distraction, with many
candidates splitting time between the two opening-bell states.
</P>
<P>
	   "No time to waste!" Bradley said midway through a week in which the dynamics
shifted in the Democratic race in Iowa, taxes dominated the GOP debate and a
front-runner twice shifted his ad strategies under pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush seemed caught off guard during a GOP debate in Michigan, when
McCain seized on an unexpected pledge not to run negative ads. "I'll shake hands
with you, George," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The moment seemed impromptu, but in fact McCain had reason to believe Bush
was about to go negative: A woman had contacted his campaign to complain that a
Bush camera team had interviewed her about McCain's tax plan. She said she was
coached to criticize the package.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign caught in the act, the Texas governor said he knew nothing
about the operation and pledged anew not to run negative ads. Bush advisers said
their ad team had stockpiled scores of interviews for potential ads, but there
were no plans to cut a negative spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet one member of the Bush camp confirmed that the woman who came forward
had been "helped along" by producers seeking an articulate criticism of McCain's
cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the national GOP front-runner, is in a dead heat with McCain in New
Hampshire. McCain has bypassed Iowa, where complicated caucuses demand
resource-draining organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also pulled his punch with Steve Forbes, the conservative millionaire
who is airing ads accusing Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of internal debate, Bush produced a response ad that said Forbes'
charge was "wrong" and set the record straight by talking about two Texas tax
cuts he supported. Left on the shelf was the script of an ad that would have had
Bush saying, "My opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, appeared to outlast questions about his work on behalf of
contributors in the Senate. A week earlier, the matter had threatened to
overwhelm his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore and Bradley dredged up old Senate votes and
pounced with breathless accusations. The vice president said Bradley abandoned
flood victims in Iowa. The former New Jersey senator said Gore flip-flopped in
votes on smoking and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had promised not to sling "darts" in his not-politics-as-usual
campaign, but aides say he had no choice after the vice president lashed out at
Bradley in the final months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's team now is crying cry foul. "It's a shame that Senator Bradley has
had to resort to negative campaigning," said the vice president's combative
spokesman, Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   The rhetoric intensified as Bradley struggled to close a stubborn 20-point
gap in Iowa polls and his advisers began to worry Gore actually was gaining
strength.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a different picture in New Hampshire, where the race remained close.
Gore's team sensed what one adviser called "glacial movement" in his favor after
weeks of advantage-Bradley in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Barely heard above the din, three Republicans hoped Iowa's social
conservatives would lift them into the top tier. Debates that served as bookends
to the week gave Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah a chance to
shine.
</P>
<P>
	   In their final week in Iowa, Bush plans to hammer home the fact that he has
the largest tax-cut proposal, and he is expected to continue to find fault with
McCain's middle-class tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
	   In a GOP debate Saturday, Bush asked McCain why his plan would be partially
paid for by exposing to taxes some fringe-benefits such as tuition payments by
employees. On the defensive, McCain chose not to answer the question directly,
and instead said Bush's tax-cutting plan endangers Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   "You run ads saying you're taking care of Social Security, my friend,"
McCain said. "That's all hat and no cattle."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's cute," Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're always cute when they're true," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men were chuckling nervously, a reflection of how painfully polite the
GOP candidates are trying to be.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's advisers discussed ways to portray their boss as the most
presidential of the presidential candidates, hoping to capitalize next week on
lingering questions about Bush's experience and intellectual heft. "I am fully
prepared," McCain said in Saturday's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic candidates braced for another week of jousting.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a competition, after all," said Bradley, a sharp-elbowed former
basketball star.

<HEADLINE> Dancer Meche Barba Dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Meche Barba, a circus performer's daughter whose
smoldering beauty brought her fame as a dancer in Mexican films, has died. She
was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Barba died in Mexico City on Friday of pulmonary emphysema. She had been
hospitalized since Dec. 30, Mexico City newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercedes Barba Feito was born on Sept. 24, 1922, in New York, where her
Spanish-born father, Antonio, had been performing with a circus.
</P>
<P>
	   Barba and her sister Carmen began performing as children to help support the
family when their father fell ill. Appearances on Mexico's premier theater
stages led to roles in film starting in 1937.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Barba once insisted she wasn't pretty enough to be a film star, she
won acclaim for her beauty and her acting presence. During Mexico's ``Golden
Age'' of cinema, she was cast beside stars such as singer Jorge Negrete and
German Valdes, the comic actor better known as Tin Tan.
</P>
<P>
	   She came to be known as ``the queen of the rumba,'' for her sensuous dancing
in more than 50 films.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, Barba began appearing in Mexican soap operas, often being cast
as a housekeeper. Her final performance came in 1999 in the series
``Rosalinda,'' starring singer-actress-dancer Thalia.
</P>
<P>
	   Barba's remains were cremated Friday and interred in Mexico City's Spanish
Pantheon. She is survived by her son, Fernando Fernandez, and four
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Israel Delays West Bank Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel decided Saturday to postpone a withdrawal from the
West Bank for at least two weeks over a dispute with the Palestinians on the
land to be included in the pullout.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said the Cabinet
would not view the withdrawal maps in a meeting Sunday, which is a requirement
for the withdrawal originally slated for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barak hasn't decided which lands should be included in the withdrawal,''
Gadi Baltiansky said. ``Barak wants to check a few more subjects and continue
the internal discussions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision meant the withdrawal would most likely be postponed for at
least two weeks since Barak will travel to the United States for the next round
of peace talks with the Syrians, which are slated to begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have accused Israel of neglecting the peace talks with them
in favor of the Syrian negotiations, which reopened in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet warned in a meeting Friday that
Israeli sluggishness in the negotiations will prevent the sides from working out
a framework on a final peace agreement by a Feb. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The continued lack of seriousness from the Israeli side over final status
issues will make it difficult'' to meet the deadline, read a release from the
Palestinian Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Palestinians officials were participating in a meeting of Arafat's
Fatah party and were not immediately available for comment on the postponement.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said Friday that Barak and Arafat would
meet on Thursday in Washington. Arafat is slated to meet with President Clinton
on the same day as part of a three-day trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel radio said the three leaders would meet together.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak postponed the withdrawal to wait to see what comes out of the
meetings, Army radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians had demanded that the next withdrawal include areas near
east Jerusalem -- the sector they hope to make the capital of a future state --
as part of the redeployment that is supposed to include 6.1 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel insists that any changes in control over the territory near the
disputed city would be decided in the final phase of peace talks between the
sides. Israel says that peace accords designate it as the sole deciding
authority on which land is included in withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem in 1967, declaring the sector part of its
capital. Barak insists the city will not be divided again as part of the
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh implied Friday that the
Palestinians may be given some authority in areas east of Jerusalem when he said
the boundaries of the city may be extended as part of a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the issue of Jerusalem has to be solved not by dividing
Jerusalem, but by its expansion,'' Sneh told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The expansion of Jerusalem would allow the Palestinians to say they control
parts of the city without actually granting them powers in the current city
limits.

<HEADLINE> New York GOP boss says McCain guilty of hypocrisy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The head of New York's Republican Party on Saturday
blasted Sen. John McCain's complaints about challenges to his qualifying
petitions for the state's presidential primary as "the height of hypocrisy."
<P>
	   Citing McCain's successful use of petition requirements in Arizona to knock
a potential challenger off the GOP Senate primary ballot in that state in 1998,
New York GOP boss William Powers said, "Senator McCain has demonstrated he is
just another politician who will say one thing and do another when it benefits
him."
</P>
<P>
	   Powers, a supporter of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential candidacy,
has mounted challenges to McCain's petitions to qualify for New York's March 7
primary ballot. That effort has been denounced by McCain as "Stalinist
politics."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign chairman in New York on Saturday said the challenge is
Bush's "last defense against a surging John McCain."
</P>
<P>
	   "What you are seeing is an advertisement of the state party's insecurity,"
said Guy Molinari, McCain state chairman and Staten Island borough president.
"John McCain is poised to upset George W. Bush's parade to the coronation. Bill
Powers and the Bush campaign are anxious to avoid a fair fight, and they are
using authoritarian tactics to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Powers said McCain should be subject to the same political rules as other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is clear that Senator McCain believes one special set of rules applies
to him, and another set of rules applies to everyone else," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Republican Party is attempting to ensure that the people who signed
Senator McCain's petitions are registered Republicans who live in the right
congressional districts," the New York GOP leader said. "Sound familiar, Senator
McCain? That is almost exactly what you did in Arizona."
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, when reports circulated of McCain's own use of petition
challenges against potential opponents in Arizona, McCain spokesman Howard
Opinsky insisted the two situations are quite different. The challenges to
McCain in New York include alleged violations of "highly technical things
including the color of the paper on which the petitions were signed," Opinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We followed rules that are very open in Arizona," Opinsky said Friday. "The
rules in New York are written to keep people off the ballot, legitimate
candidates, so that the establishment can control the process."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Powers' lead attorney in the case, Jeffrey Buley, has said the New
York review of McCain's petitions only involves checking to see if those who
signed McCain petitions are enrolled Republicans and live in the congressional
districts where the petitions were circulated. Buley said hypertechnical
petition requirements will not be used against McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the McCain camp has objected because Bush supporters in New
York had originally said they planned no challenges to the McCain petitions. The
challenges were filed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and his New York campaign director, Staten Island Borough President
Guy Molinari, have called on Bush to use his influence with Powers and Gov.
George Pataki, also a Bush supporter, to get the challenges withdrawn. Bush has
refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also filed a federal lawsuit in an attempt to open up the ballot
in New York. That lawsuit will be heard at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must circulate petitions to qualify separate
convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in
which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31 separate GOP primaries in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari has conceded the McCain petitions have probably come up short on
the required number of signatures in at least five of the 31 districts, and
possibly in a sixth. Buley is examining all of McCain's petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes have both filed petitions they
claim qualify them for the primary ballot in all 31 congressional districts.
Only McCain, among the other GOP presidential contenders, also attempted to
qualify for the New York ballot through the petition process.

<HEADLINE> Plan for underwater cables could affect clamming industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAPE MAY, N.J. (AP) - The state's ocean-clamming industry could be in
trouble if AT&AMP;T receives permission to install a $1.5 billion cable link to
Europe.
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T, one of several telecommunications companies involved in the battle,
asked the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection on Friday not to
grant a hearing to fishermen and to allow fiber optic cable to be installed
underwater.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable, which would carry Internet traffic and is expected to handle
about 8.2 million phone calls simultaneously, would run through some of the
world's richest clam beds.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fishermen don't own the sea bed," Paul Shorb, an attorney for AT&AMP;T,
told The Press of Atlantic City for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorb said fishermen "had their shot" to contest the permits in meetings,
and had won several concessions. But the necessary permits were later issued by
the DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   Although AT&AMP;T owns just 6 percent of the project, the company estimated that
a delay in laying the cable would cost as much as $20 million per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorb noted that Internet consumers would absorb the cost of delays, adding
that fishermen should take the battle to court instead of seeking relief from
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishermen say they don't want to delay the project, but rather want to make
certain their safety and liability issues are addressed, such as burying cables
deeper, and removing old, unused cables to prevent fishermen from hitting them.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we're asking for is for them to be responsible for the cables," said
Daniel Cohen, a clam boat owner in the Port of Cape May. "If a fisherman hits a
cable, they (the companies) should be responsible."
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the companies have agreed to bury the cables 1 meter deep in some
areas, and 1.2 meters in other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our fishing should not be constrained by a permanent structure," Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorb, however, noted that land cables are protected and marked for the
public's safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a land situation, we get a right-of-way, it's marked and people are not
supposed to dig there," said Shorb.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T and Sprint are in charge of installing the trans-Atlantic cable, which
would provide a link from Tuckerton to Widemouth, England, and an additional
link from Manasquan to Blaabjerg, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
	   The new cable, called a TAT-14, would have two lines to Europe and one line
connecting the two about 25 miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the project's enormous cost, 53 companies are involved in its
progress.
</P>
<P>
	   "After we jointly fund the project, we compete in reselling capacity," Shorb
said.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T's request to the DEP was sent on Friday, following a similar one made
by Sprint. Both companies argue that once a permit has been issued, a public
hearing regarding the permit is too late.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Trenton-based Garden State Seafood Association previously asked
for a hearing and requested that the installation of cables be halted until a
hearing took place.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEP has said the state Office of Administrative Law would have had to
grant such a hearing.

<HEADLINE> Newsweek poll shows Gore leading Bradley in New Hampshire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Al Gore leads Sen. Bill Bradley among
people who say they plan to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, says a
Newsweek poll released Saturday.
<P>
	   In polling Wednesday through Friday, the newsmagazine said 50 percent of
people who plan to vote in the Feb. 1 primary favored Gore to 36 percent
Bradley. The other 14 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Newsweek said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., moved in the Republican campaign
from a statistical dead heat to a slight lead over the national front-runner,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The poll showed McCain with 42 percent to Bush's
34 percent backing among people who plan to vote in the primary. Steve Forbes
was the only other GOP candidate in double figures, with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewers talked Jan. 12-14 with 848 registered voters who said they
planned to vote in New Hampshire. The margin of error was 7 percent for
Democrats and 6 percent for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic result showed a significant change from the last Newsweek
poll, in early December. It showed Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New
Jersey, leading Gore 47 percent to 40 percent, with 13 percent undecided. With a
6 percentage point margin of error, that gave Bradley a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls by other organizations also have shown Bradley leading Gore, or
in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley by 10 percentage points, 46 percent to 36 percent, in the
early November Newsweek poll.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Troops Stay in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOIDU, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Nigeria has halted the pullout of intervention
troops from Sierra Leone to help keep the fragile peace in the country until a
U.N. force is fully deployed, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, officials reported that a U.N. peacekeeper drowned in the West
African country, becoming the first casualty suffered by a member of the U.N.
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Gen. Gabriel Pamba, a commander of the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG, said the troops would remain in place to
prevent a dangerous power vacuum in Sierra Leone, where the rebel group
Revolutionary United Front and government forces signed a peace accord in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the accord, the rebels continue to terrorize civilians in the dense
jungle interior, according to the United Nations and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ECOMOG was the main fighting force backing Sierra Leone's government during
the war and now provides security alongside U.N. peacekeepers, who began
arriving in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Nigeria maintained that it could not afford its ECOMOG commitment and
late last year withdrew more than a third of the 10,000-member force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``ECOMOG was not meant to stay in Sierra Leone forever. But we will continue
until the U.N. peacekeepers are fully deployed,'' Pamba said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since November, the U.N. has begun deploying 6,000 peacekeepers -- mainly
Indians, Nigerians and Kenyans. On Wednesday, the Security Council began
considering a British proposal to nearly double the force's strength to 11,100
troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. J.S. Sandhu, a U.N. military officer, said Saturday that Yusuf
Birik, a Kenyan soldier, drowned while participating in a water obstacle course
during training exercises in Magburaka, 120 miles north of Freetown.

War Crimes Suspect Gunned Down

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A notorious Serb paramilitary leader accused of
war crimes was shot and killed by masked gunmen on Saturday in a Belgrade hotel.
The official Tanjug news agency confirmed that Zeljko Raznatovic, better known

Bush, McCain Clash on Taxes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers. The
senator retorted that the governor was trying a "Texas two-step" around his own
failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security. McCain is debating
but not campaigning for the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses. Steve Forbes, Bush's closest
challenger in Iowa because of McCain's bypass strategy, also challenged Bush on
taxes. "In Texas, George, your tax cuts are more apparent than real," Forbes
said. "Most Texans have never seen those tax cuts."

Gore Moves Into Solid Lead in N.H.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New polling suggests Vice President Al Gore has slipped
past former Sen. Bill Bradley to retake a solid lead in their campaign for New
Hampshire's Democratic primary election, Newsweek reported today. The

primary favored Gore, while 36 percent preferred Bradley. The other 14 percent
were undecided. Newsweek said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., moved in the Republican

front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.

Gun Maker Wants No Gun Shows Sales
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- The nation's largest gun manufacturer has begun instructing
distributors not to sell its firearms at gun shows, apparently the first policy
of its kind, The Denver Post reported today. In contracts with distributors this
year, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. states that its shotguns, rifles and handguns be
supplied only "to federally licensed firearms dealers selling exclusively from
their regular place of business," the newspaper said. Federally licensed gun
dealers must conduct background checks on gun-show customers, but unlicensed
private dealers are not required to conduct the checks.

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson used the birthday of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as a rallying point today in his crusade
for six black students expelled from the Decatur school system. Speaking to
supporters at the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition's weekly meeting, Jackson reaffirmed
plans to appeal a judge's decision upholding the expulsions and geared up for a
rally tonight in Decatur. He contended the judge put "politics over principle"
in his ruling and said, "This is not the first time we've had to fight unjust

Mystery of Nixon Tape May Be Solved
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Archives is exploring whether new technology
could solve an enduring mystery of Watergate: What was said during the infamous
18 1/2-minute gap on one of President Nixon's tapes recorded three days after
the break-in. It is part of a recording made June 20, 1972 as Nixon chatted with
his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. Public disclosure of the erasure eroded
Nixon's credibility at a time when his presidency was unraveling. Steve
St.Croix, an audio expert, said technology developed in the past three years
might make it possible to recover conversation, even from tapes repeatedly
erased on older machines.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian bombs and artillery rained down on the
Chechen capital with renewed intensity Saturday, setting an oil depot ablaze and
sending black smoke spewing into the sky. Both sides claimed to be inflicting
heavy losses in the fight for the capital, Grozny. Meanwhile, the president of
the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia said the military had lifted all
restrictions on Chechens trying to enter or exit Chechnya. The Russians' order
last week to detain all males between age 10 and 60 to check for rebel ties

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists: Earth Going Bad  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rise of the Internet and soaring stock markets
threaten to obscure ``real-world'' troubles such as crises in water supplies and
other resources, an environmental group said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Global economic trends during the 1990s were remarkably bullish, but
environmental trends were disastrous,'' Worldwatch Institute said in its State
of the World 2000 report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report noted that the 20th century brought spectacular technological
achievements, boosted employment and helped fuel America's longest peacetime
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   But, it said, the expanding global economy is outgrowing Earth's ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the Dow Jones goes up, the Earth's health goes down,'' said Lester R.
Brown, the study's lead author and president of Worldwatch.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Worldwatch started its annual assessments in 1984, its list of
troublesome trends -- shrinking forests, falling water tables, disappearing
plant and animal species -- has lengthened to include rising temperatures,
melting glaciers, more destructive storms, dying coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Caught up in the growth of the Internet, we seem to have lost sight of the
Earth's deteriorating health,'' Brown said. ``It would be a mistake to confuse
the vibrancy of the virtual world with the increasingly troubled state of the
real world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to reverse environmental trends will lead to reversals in economic
progress, the group warned in the 200-page report.
</P>
<P>
	   It said protests against the World Trade Organization last month in Seattle
made ``some progress'' in challenging the idea of ``economics at the expense of
the environment and other issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Decline already has started in Africa, where AIDS is sending millions to
early deaths, draining the already impoverished continent of scholars, workers
and farmers. The disease has caused a rapid drop in life expectancy in
sub-Saharan Africa, a primary indicator for measuring progress, Worldwatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Economic euphoria may lead us to ignore trends that have the potential to
reverse progress,'' Brown said. ``While the world economy is booming, the HIV
epidemic is devastating sub-Saharan Africa, a region of 800 million people.''
</P>
<P>
	   India is pumping underground water faster than it can be replenished,
threatening a drop in water tables, irrigation supplies and food production,
Worldwatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless New Delhi can quickly devise an effective strategy to deal with
spreading water scarcity, India -- like Africa -- may soon face a decline in
life expectancy,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two big challenges of the new century are to stabilize climate and
population, with each family, for instance, having only two children, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two dozen industrial countries have reached population stability, and
several developing countries are judged to be approaching it, including China,
South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Barbados.
</P>
<P>
	   Stabilizing climate will mean replacing fossil fuels with wind, solar cells
and other renewable sources of energy, the report said. It said the world gets
one-fifth of its electricity from hydropower, and harnessing the wind has even
greater potential as an energy source.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwatch said restructuring economic policy-making to incorporate
environmental issues will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The gap between economists and ecologists in their perception of the world
as the new century begins could not be wider,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists see a world economy that has grown by leaps and bounds in the
past 50 years. Ecologists see growth based on the burning of vast quantities of
fossil fuels, which destabilizes the climate, rather than using clean, renewable
sources.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Pinochet Outlook Grim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The independent medical team examining Gen. Augusto Pinochet
concluded he would die ``long before'' the expected 18 months needed to complete
his extradition to Spain on torture charges, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was inclined to stop
extradition proceedings against Pinochet after four specialists unanimously
found the 84-year-old general unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet requires a pacemaker and has reportedly suffered from two mild
strokes, diabetes, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
	   The key conclusion in the confidential medical report was that the former
dictator would not live to stand trial in Spain, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been under house arrest in Britain for 15 months during legal
battles over a Spanish attempt to extradite him for trial on human rights abuses
during his 1973-90 rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack Straw has made a very big mistake in this case'' in neglecting
Pinochet's deteriorating health,'' Fernando Barros, Pinochet's spokesman, told
the newspaper. ``The general deserves an apology.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office has said it would accept arguments on Pinochet's fate from
Spain, as well as France, Switzerland and Belgium -- which also have extradition
requests -- before making a final decision on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it was considering asking for a
judicial review of the way the medical examination was carried out.
</P>
<P>
	   At Pinochet's rented home in Wentworth, about 40 protesters gathered
Saturday to reiterate demands that Pinochet face trial for his alleged crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the campaigners were ``noisy but peaceful.'' There were no
arrests.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Nearly all homes in Kyrgyzstan's capital and surrounding areas
were without gas Saturday because of the Central Asian nation's debts to gas
suppliers, a news report said.

<HEADLINE> Finland To Choose New President  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTI HUUHTANEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- With the major presidential aspirants agreeing on
the big issues, Finnish voters are turning to the candidates' personalities to
make up their minds for Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters are choosing between, among others, a legislator who has publicly
described having sex in a waterbed, a government minister who refuses to marry
her longtime boyfriend and a suave politician who has been called the ``Kennedy
of Finland.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was considered unlikely that any of the seven candidates -- four of them
women -- would win the required 50 percent of the vote. A runoff between the two
top vote-getters is expected on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter who is elected, no major changes are expected in foreign and
security policy, the president's traditional domain, because of a consensus
among leading Finnish politicians. The main candidates approve of membership in
the European Union, which Finland joined in 1995, and say they will continue the
country's post-World War II policy of neutrality.
</P>
<P>
	   The election is only the second time Finns have voted directly for a
president since gaining independence from Russia in 1917. Before, voters cast
their ballot for an electoral college that chose the president -- a process
often marred by political deals.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of issues in the election has meant low-key campaigns, with
candidates refusing to criticize each other or even argue.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, people have been drawn to campaign rallies this year by the
personalities, and a high turnout was expected at the polls. Thirty-two percent
of the country's 4.2 million voters already cast ballots in a week of advance
voting at post offices.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the two leading candidates is former Prime Minister Esko Aho, 45.
Local media have dubbed Aho the ``Kennedy of Finland'' because of his dapper and
youthful appearance and the inclusion of his family in his campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   His main opponent, 56-year-old foreign minister Tarja Halonen, is a former
unionist who has said she will not marry her longtime boyfriend. She also has
declined to join the Evangelical Lutheran Church in a country where 85 percent
of the people are members. Finland has never had a female president.
</P>
<P>
	   Three recent major polls have shown Aho, of the opposition Center Party, and
Halonen, a Social Democrat, ahead of the other candidates and in a close race.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those trailing in the polls were 54-year-old Parliament speaker Riitta
Uosukainen and 64-year-old former U.N. peace envoy Elisabeth Rehn.
</P>
<P>
	   The flamboyant Uosukainen shocked the nation with candid descriptions of
lovemaking on a waterbed. She led earlier surveys, but her support has fallen,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehn was the first female defense minister of a Western country. She was
narrowly defeated by President Martti Ahtisaari in a runoff in 1994, but she was
far behind in the polls this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other candidates include Risto Kuisma, a former hard-drinking union boss who
is now a leading member of the temperance movement; Ilkka Hakalehto, a historian
who opposes Finland's EU membership; and Green Party member Heidi Hautala, who
sits in the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ahtisaari, 62, is not seeking a second term after six years in
office. He has said he will take a job in an international organization.

<HEADLINE> Israel Jets Strike Southern Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
hideouts in southern Lebanon on Saturday in the fifth such strike in a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The airstrikes came after two guerrilla groups claimed to have attacked
Israeli troops and their militia allies, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Israeli jets fired four missiles at targets in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a
stronghold of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas that faces an Israeli-occupied
border zone, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Black smoke billowed from the area, but there was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The district is a frequent target of Israeli warplanes. It is used by
Hezbollah guerrillas to attack Israeli troops and allied militiamen in the
occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese guerrillas are fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500
South Lebanon Army militiamen from the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The jets returned 2 1/2 hours later to strike near the village of Maidoun,
just outside the zone. In Jerusalem, the Israeli military confirmed the
airstrikes and said all planes returned safely.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the Hezbollah group and the Syrian-backed Amal movement said their
forces had fired rockets and mortars at Israeli and allied positions. No
casualties were reported in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting in south Lebanon has continued despite hopes of peace between
Lebanon and Israel now that the Jewish state has resumed negotiations with
Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel contends that the occupied zone, set up in 1985, is necessary to
protect its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has promised to withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon
by July.

<HEADLINE> Gore Gains Solid Lead in N.H. Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore leads Sen. Bill Bradley among
people who say they plan to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, says a
Newsweek poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In polling Wednesday through Friday, the newsmagazine said 50 percent of
people who plan to vote in the Feb. 1 primary favored Gore to 36 percent
Bradley. The other 14 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Newsweek said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., moved in the Republican campaign
from a statistical dead heat to a slight lead over the national front-runner,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The poll showed McCain with 42 percent to Bush's
34 percent backing among people who plan to vote in the primary. Steve Forbes
was the only other GOP candidate in double figures, with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewers talked Jan. 12-14 with 848 registered voters who said they
planned to vote in New Hampshire. The margin of error was 7 percent for
Democrats and 6 percent for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic result showed a significant change from the last Newsweek
poll, in early December. It showed Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New
Jersey, leading Gore 47 percent to 40 percent, with 13 percent undecided. With a
6 percentage point margin of error, that gave Bradley a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls by other organizations also have shown Bradley leading Gore, or
in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley by 10 percentage points, 46 percent to 36 percent, in the
early November Newsweek poll.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Frustrated With Elian's Delay  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, tens of thousands of protesters rallied to
demand the child's return in the angriest gathering so far in six weeks of
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How long? How long do we have to wait?'' shouted actor Julio Casanova, one
among a group of speakers who addressed the crowd. He referred to the Miami
relatives sheltering Elian as ``the torturers of his innocence.''
</P>
<P>
	   While a march of tens of thousands of mothers on Friday appealed to familial
sentiment, Saturday's gathering at the spot where Fidel Castro declared the
socialist character of his government almost four decades ago was a strident
political meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the historical significance of the site -- a street corner in the
heart of Havana's Vedado neighborhood -- and because of the political nature of
the gathering, many demonstrators had thought the Cuban leader would attend.
Ultimately Castro did not show.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering came one day after the deadline the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service had set for Elian to be returned to his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who lives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give
Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy
with them in the United States. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, says he
can give the child a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities are becoming increasingly impatient with the delays, which
they say only increases the psychological suffering of a small boy who lost his
mother at sea and is now separated from his father and grandparents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida
after his mother, stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S.
shores.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba insists Elian was ``kidnapped'' and is being ``held hostage'' by
enemies of Castro's communist government in Miami. Elian's Miami relatives and
the anti-Castro exile leaders who constantly visit the family there are
typically referred to here as ``criminals,'' ``mafia members,'' ``terrorists''
and ``wolves.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like most other such demonstrations, Saturday's rally was broadcast live on
government television.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcast included black and white film clips of the day Castro stood on
the same site in April 1961 and defined the Cuban revolution as socialist.
During that same speech, Castro announced that a U.S.-backed invasion force was
headed toward the island. The following day, CIA-sponsored troops launched the
disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
	   The angry political tone of Saturday's rally seemed aimed at letting
Washington know that Cuba was getting fed up.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man
on U.S.-Cuban relations, told The Associated Press on Friday that Cuban
authorities are frustrated by Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's
failure to enforce its decision.

<HEADLINE> Pinelands Commission gives OK to reopen landfill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTHAMPTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Despite the objections of
environmentalists and many residents, the New Jersey Pinelands Commission voted
to reopen a landfill in Ocean Township and build half a dozen communications
towers in the forest preserve.
<P>
	   The 9-4 vote on Friday to reopen the landfill came after the commission's
newly appointed chairman, Jerrold L. Jacobs, took his seat for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   The landfill and tower issues had been under debate for months, with a
majority of public comment aimed at the landfill, which was closed 11 years ago
because its contaminants posed a threat to people living nearby. The landfill
has never been properly cleaned and capped.
</P>
<P>
	   The communications towers also drew concern from people who said the
structures are not in the best interests of the Pine Barrens.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs, who voted for the landfill plan, said the plan wasn't perfect but
would prevent legal delays and improve the landfill.
</P>
<P>
	   "I voted for it on the basis that it was the best solution to a not-perfect
situation," Jacobs told The Press of Atlantic City for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists said the vote sets a bad precedent, and worried that new
waste to the landfill could add lead, mercury and other pollutants to the dump.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Environmental Protection has wanted to hire owner
United Environmental Services Inc. to reopen the landfill. The company has a
plan to take in about 435,000 cubic yards of broken glass and demolition and
construction debris.
</P>
<P>
	   The waste would cover contaminates already there and level a part of the
site that is lined to prevent leachates from entering soil or groundwater. The
company would be paid about $7 million to accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would also be used to pay for a permanent cap to the lined section
of the landfill. Right now, rainwater percolates through the open portion of the
landfill and leaches about 30,000 gallons a day of contaminated water into the
Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer.
</P>
<P>
	   But to launch the plan, the DEP needed the commission to waive strict rules
concerning Pinelands waste.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert W. McIntosh Jr., who sits on the panel on behalf of the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior, voted against the plan. McIntosh said he wanted to
know if there were any financial assurances the company would be able to
complete the work. Residents said they had the same concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Jeff Tittle, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra
Club, said United Environmental Services should have to pay for the capping as
required by state law, rather than reopening the dump.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Friday, the commission unanimously approved a plan to allow Sprint
and Omnipoint to erect communications towers as high as 200 feet in the heart of
the Pinelands. The vote came a year after the commission allowed cellular phone
service providers to build as many as 23 towers in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan approved Friday calls for using 29 existing or previously approved
towers, plus six new ones, to be built to support Personal Communications
Systems, or PCS. The exact locations of the towers will depend on property
negotiations and local approvals.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs said an expert determined the PCS plan uses the fewest towers to
deliver service. He also said the commission would have been forced to accept
the plan anyway because Federal Communications Commission rules say certain
levels of service can't be denied to providers who carry a license for it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just think it's a sellout to the (Pinelands) Comprehensive Management
Plan to allow all those towers in some of the most environmentally sensitive
sections of the pines just so someone speeding to Atlantic City can talk on his
phone," Tittle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sally Dudley, Whitman's other appointment to the commission and considered a
strong environmentalist, was unable to vote because the state Senate last week
failed to approve her nomination before adjourning.

cannibalism'' to resolve the Andean nation's economic and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ask Ecuadoreans not to resort to violent actions and instead to make
use of dialogue and rationality to resolve problems,'' he said during his
state-of-the-union address to Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians may have been persuaded not to demonstrate by a toughly worded
warning from the armed forces against violent protests.
</P>
<P>
	   There also were reports of disputes among groups that belong to the umbrella
Indian organization on when and how to carry out the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the planned protest, Indians had threatened to blockade highways
to paralyze traffic and keep farm produce from reaching the cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The army took control of Ecuador's highways on Saturday. Troop carriers
patrolled the major routes and threw up checkpoints, searching car and bus
passengers for weapons.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Received Subsidy Payments  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- A partnership that includes Bill Bradley received
$2,150 in farm subsidy payments in 1997 and 1998, campaign aides said Saturday.
As a Democratic senator from New Jersey, Bradley had opposed such payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got $700 from the payments to the 250-acre farm in Missouri he owns
with a high school friend, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokeswoman Anita Dunn said the farm also received relief payments
after floods in 1993. Bradley donated his share to charity, added Dunn, who did
not immediately know the amount.
</P>
<P>
	   During last week's debate, Vice President Al Gore accused Bradley of voting
against flood relief that year. Bradley said Gore distorted his record and he
insisted he eventually voted for the relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Gore's record was tainted because he accepted federal subsidy
payments for growing tobacco on the Gore family's Tennessee tobacco farm.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Bradley aides said, the Democratic National Committee had
accepted soft money from the tobacco industry to put on the 1996 convention that
nominated Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley continues to stoop to new lows every day,'' said Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has come under fire in the campaign for Iowa's precinct caucuses on
Jan. 24 for not being sympathetic to farm assistance programs. While he insists
he was only representing his state, he has continued to maintain the Missouri
farm operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunn, who was questioned about the subsidies by a reporter, argued that
subsidies Bradley received were minor and said his opposition to those programs
showed he was not influenced by personal gain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to see the difference between the two candidates, nothing
better illustrates it than the fact that Bill Bradley voted against a program
from which his partnership received a small subsidy,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehane said the latest exchange underscores the importance of Gore's
challenge to step up the number of campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We reiterate our challenge that he debate us weekly,'' Lehane said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Plans Parliament Referendum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine will hold a nationwide referendum on April 16
that could lead to dissolving the parliament and forming a new bicameral
legislature, President Leonid Kuchma said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuchma has long been at odds with the leftist-dominated parliament, or
Verkhovna Rada, which he accuses of blocking economic reforms in the
impoverished former Soviet republic. He has been threatening such a referendum
for months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Election Committee collected about 4 million signatures in
support of the referendum, the Interfax news agency reported. At least 3 million
signatures representing at least two-thirds of Ukraine's regions are required to
declare a referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   The referendum is to consist of six questions. One is a confidence vote in
the parliament. If a majority of voters choose no-confidence, the parliament
could be disbanded.
</P>
<P>
	   Another question asks whether to give Kuchma the right to dismiss the Rada
if it fails to adopt a budget in three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters would be asked to choose whether to abolish lawmakers' immunity from
prosecution. They also would choose whether to reduce the 450-seat parliament to
a 300-seat body and split it into two houses, one composed of nationally elected
candidates and the other made up of municipal officials and regional governors
appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Leftist factions in parliament oppose the proposed referendum.

<HEADLINE> Black Activists Protest Immigration  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Black activists at a rally honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
on Saturday called for an end to what they see as a double standard in U.S.
immigration policy that favors Cubans over Haitians.
</P>
<P>
	   The group of about 150 people denounced Miami officials for going to
Washington on behalf of 6-year-old Cuban Elian Gonzalez while ``not saying a
word'' about more than 400 would-be immigrants shipped back to Haiti after their
boat ran aground New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a simple cry that we're calling: Be fair,'' said Rev. Willie Simms, a
member of the Miami-Dade County Community Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1966 Cuban Readjustment Act, Cubans who reach U.S. soil can stay.
But there is no such law for Haitians and others who arrive here illegally. They
are sent back unless they can prove a ``credible fear'' of persecution in their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   While politicians were fighting to keep Elian in the country, Haitians Marc
Dieubon, 9, and his sister Germanie, 8, among the 411 whose boat ran aground,
were sent back to Haiti even though their pregnant mother had been taken ashore
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they weren't told Yvena Rhinvil's children were with
her, and the government last week said the children would be allowed to reunite
with her in Florida while her political asylum claim is processed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Rhinvil attended Saturday's rally and thanked the Haitian community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're standing with me and fighting for me,'' she said. ``I thank them
very much.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement, said the children probably
wouldn't have the opportunity to be reunited with their mother in Florida had it
not been for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban boy has been living with relatives in Miami since he was found
Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after the boat he was on sank and his
mother drowned. The Immigration and Naturalization Service determined the boy
should be returned to his father in Cuba, but his Miami relatives are fighting
for custody. The controversy has sparked weeks of protests in both countries.

Thousands Demand Cuban Boy's Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, tens of thousands of Cuban protesters
rallied today to demand the child's return in the angriest gathering so far in
six weeks of demonstrations. The gathering came one day after the deadline the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had set for Elian to be returned to
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who lives in Cuba. But last week, Attorney
General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a
chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy with them in the United States.
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, says he can give the child a better life
off the communist island.

reopened in December and will continue Wednesday in the United States.

retorted that the governor was trying a "Texas two-step" around his own failure
to plan for the future financing of Social Security. McCain is debating but not
campaigning for the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses. Steve Forbes, Bush's closest
challenger in Iowa because of McCain's bypass strategy, also challenged Bush on
taxes. "In Texas, George, your tax cuts are more apparent than real," Forbes
said. "Most Texans have never seen those tax cuts."

primary favored Gore, while 36 percent preferred Bradley. The other 14 percent

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers, and
the senator retorted that the governor was trying a ``Texas two-step'' around
his own failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush statement on benefit taxes led to a post-debate debate between the
two campaigns. McCain's spokesman said Bush was wrong, and that the taxes
envisioned in the senator's proposal would be about $4 billion. Bush's aides
insisted their candidate had the number right.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Iowa debate, Steve Forbes called both Bush and McCain ``the timid tax
cutters'' of the Republican presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Their tax arguments dominated a 90-minute debate among the six GOP
candidates for the 2000 nomination, their last Iowa confrontation before the
first votes of the year are cast in the Jan. 24 precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the faraway leader in the Iowa polls, with Forbes a lagging second,
and McCain, who is not actively campaigning, Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch, and
Alan Keyes trailing the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush challenged McCain on a loophole-closing proposal in his tax-cut plan
that would eliminate the tax-free treatment of workplace benefits including
continuing education, transportation and meals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have a plan that in essence raises taxes on working people by $40
billion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm giving them a huge tax cut,'' McCain countered. ``And the reality is
that your tax plan has 36 percent of it going to the richest one percent in
America.''
</P>
<P>
	   So McCain said he could tell a working mother ``I've got a tax cut for you
and Governor Bush doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not true,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, McCain said, the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, ``has
not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for Medicare and not one penny
for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And when you run ads saying you're going to take care of Social Security,
my friend, that's all hat and no cattle,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's cute, but ... '' Bush countered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, they're always cutest when they're true,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not true,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediately after the debate, the McCain campaign issued a statement saying
that his $240 billion, five-year tax cut plan, would end ``a loophole that
allowed corporations to get a tax benefit for giving employes things like golf
and health club memberships and free parking.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Congress already has imposed taxes on
perks like that, and that the McCain tax proposal would hit remaining worker
benefits with ``a whopper of a tax hike.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rick Davis, the senator's campaign manager, said, ``Not only has the
Bush campaign erroneously described the McCain plan, it grossly overstates the
revenue impact.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself did not raise those rebuttal points in the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is concentrating his campaign on the New Hampshire presidential
primary on Feb. 1, and Forbes is Bush's closest rival in Iowa, but far behind in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes challenged Bush on taxes, too.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the governor's Texas tax cuts ``are more apparent than real,'' that
most Texans never see them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not only are my tax cuts real, they've reduced the baseline of the
budget,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said in six out of 10 Texas districts, the property tax rate went up
in 1999. ``That's a Clinton tax cut,'' Forbes said. ``That's the kind he would
like. Raise the tax and call it a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Steve, look, that's good research, it's not true,'' Bush retorted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm the one person on this stage who has fought for and signed tax cuts,''
Bush said. ''... ``I've got a good record, I'm the only one on this stage who's
got a record endorsed by the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush cited an ad taken by Bob Dole in The Des Moines Register on Saturday,
in which the 1996 GOP nominee said he'd been damaged against the Democrats by
attack ads Forbes ran against him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell the whole record,''
Bush told Forbes. ``And I cut taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who proposes a 17 percent flat tax, has ads attacking Bush for
breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by including increases in some sales
and business taxes in a plan to cut property taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like most government programs, it lived on forever,'' past its birth in
the 1970s when the country was in a crisis over imported oil, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lecturing tone, Bush rebutted. ``I believe that we ought to increase
demand for Iowa products. That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the
demand for Iowa products.''
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, Hatch, Bauer, Keyes,
Forbes, Bush and McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his
administration for its policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he supports a patients bill of rights, which is anathema to most
conservatives. ``There's nothing Republican or conservative about standing
with'' big HMOs in opposition to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the only way to get needed action on health care is to reform
political financing, his keynote issue, so that insurers and HMOs can't get
special interest treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days
before the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain and Forbes trade charges over competing tax-cut plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) - George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers, and
the senator retorted that the governor was trying a "Texas two-step" around his
own failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security.
<P>
	   The Bush statement on benefit taxes led to a post-debate debate between the
two campaigns. McCain's spokesman said Bush was wrong, and that the taxes
envisioned in the senator's proposal would be about $4 billion. Bush's aides
insisted their candidate had the number right.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Iowa debate, Steve Forbes called both Bush and McCain "the timid tax
cutters" of the Republican presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Their tax arguments dominated a 90-minute debate among the six GOP
candidates for the 2000 nomination, their last Iowa confrontation before the
first votes of the year are cast in the Jan. 24 precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the faraway leader in the Iowa polls, with Forbes a lagging second,
and McCain, who is not actively campaigning, Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch, and
Alan Keyes trailing the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush challenged McCain on a loophole-closing proposal in his tax-cut plan
that would eliminate the tax-free treatment of workplace benefits including
continuing education, transportation and meals.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have a plan that in essence raises taxes on working people by $40
billion," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm giving them a huge tax cut," McCain countered. "And the reality is that
your tax plan has 36 percent of it going to the richest one percent in America."
</P>
<P>
	   So McCain said he could tell a working mother "I've got a tax cut for you
and Governor Bush doesn't."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, McCain said, the Bush tax cut, $483 billion over five years, "has
not one penny for Social Security, not one penny for Medicare and not one penny
for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "And when you run ads saying you're going to take care of Social Security,
my friend, that's all hat and no cattle," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's cute, but ... " Bush countered.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, they're always cutest when they're true," said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediately after the debate, the McCain campaign issued a statement saying
that his $240 billion, five-year tax cut plan, would end "a loophole that
allowed corporations to get a tax benefit for giving employes things like golf
and health club memberships and free parking."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Congress already has imposed taxes on
perks like that, and that the McCain tax proposal would hit remaining worker
benefits with "a whopper of a tax hike."
</P>
<P>
	   But Rick Davis, the senator's campaign manager, said, "Not only has the Bush
campaign erroneously described the McCain plan, it grossly overstates the
revenue impact."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself did not raise those rebuttal points in the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is concentrating his campaign on the New Hampshire presidential
primary on Feb. 1, and Forbes is Bush's closest rival in Iowa, but far behind in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes challenged Bush on taxes, too.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the governor's Texas tax cuts "are more apparent than real," that
most Texans never see them.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only are my tax cuts real, they've reduced the baseline of the budget,"
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said in six out of 10 Texas districts, the property tax rate went up
in 1999. "That's a Clinton tax cut," Forbes said. "That's the kind he would
like. Raise the tax and call it a tax cut."
</P>
<P>
	   "Steve, look, that's good research, it's not true," Bush retorted.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the one person on this stage who has fought for and signed tax cuts,"
Bush said. "... "I've got a good record, I'm the only one on this stage who's
got a record endorsed by the people."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush cited an ad taken by Bob Dole in The Des Moines Register on Saturday,
in which the 1996 GOP nominee said he'd been damaged against the Democrats by
attack ads Forbes ran against him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell the whole record," Bush
told Forbes. "And I cut taxes."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who proposes a 17 percent flat tax, has ads attacking Bush for
breaking a 1994 anti-tax pledge in Texas by including increases in some sales
and business taxes in a plan to cut property taxes, a net tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, running as a Republican reformer, later threw in a slap at a federal
subsidy popular with Iowa farmers, saying that he'd end the ethanol program
along with special tax breaks and loopholes because they do not serve the
interest of the American people. Ethanol is a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like most government programs, it lived on forever," past its birth in the
1970s when the country was in a crisis over imported oil, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lecturing tone, Bush rebutted. "I believe that we ought to increase
demand for Iowa products. That is what ethanol does, John, it increases the
demand for Iowa products."
</P>
<P>
	   When they weren't disputing their own rival ideas, Hatch, Bauer, Keyes,
Forbes, Bush and McCain took turns denouncing President Clinton and his
administration for its policies and for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slipped in a slap at Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the
Democratic candidates, saying they sound as though they want the federal
government to make all the decisions about American health care. The
Republicans, to a man, oppose that, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he supports a patients bill of rights, which is anathema to most
conservatives. "There's nothing Republican or conservative about standing with"
big HMOs in opposition to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the only way to get needed action on health care is to reform
political financing, his keynote issue, so that insurers and HMOs can't get
special interest treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP candidates debate next in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26, six days
before the first of the presidential primaries, in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has overtaken Bush in the polls there, running statistically even
with the national frontrunner in the latest surveys.

Thousands Demand Cuban Boy's Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, tens of thousands of Cuban protesters
rallied today to demand the child's return in the angriest gathering so far in
six weeks of demonstrations. The gathering came one day after the deadline the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had set for Elian to be returned to
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who lives in Cuba. But last week, Attorney
General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a
chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy with them in the United States.
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, says he can give the child a better life
off the communist island.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel decided Saturday to postpone a withdrawal from the

reopened in December and will continue Wednesday in the United States.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet warned in a meeting Friday that
Israeli sluggishness in the negotiations will prevent the sides from working out

primary favored Gore, while 36 percent preferred Bradley. The other 14 percent

well.
</P>
<P>
	   "Olivia and I are overwhelmed by the concern expressed by so many people. We
thank everyone for their prayers and kindness," the former Beatle said from
Ireland in his first public statement since the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison, 56, released a statement and photograph exclusively to The
Associated Press through a longtime friend in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The photograph taken Saturday showed Harrison and wife, Olivia, on vacation

<HEADLINE> Albright's Mexico Trip Undefined  </HEADLINE>
   By LISA J. ADAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) -- Drug trafficking, immigration laws, NAFTA,
corruption: Numerous issues remain outstanding between the United States and
Mexico as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright prepares for meetings here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, U.S. and Mexican officials have revealed few details on what
Albright will discuss when she meets Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green in
the southern Mexican city of Oaxaca on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican Foreign Relations ministry said a wide range of topics would be
discussed in the meeting -- economics, trade, cooperation on immigration,
protecting migrant workers in the United States and the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman referred inquiries to the State Department's Web
site, which cryptically summarized the visit as a meeting to continue ``ongoing
discussions and review of this crucial bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, on a three-day tour of Latin America, was expected to arrive late
Saturday night from Panama, where she was meeting President Mireya Moscoso and
reviewing results of the recent transfer of the Panama Canal from U.S. to local
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Before visiting Panama, Albright met Colombian officials to exchange views
on a multibillion-dollar U.S. aid package designed to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   In Oaxaca, Green and Albright were to meet Sunday morning before touring the
ancient Zapotec ruins at Monte Alban. She was to return to Washington on Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that both President Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo are
in the last year of their terms, ``I don't expect very dramatic news to come
out,'' said John Bailey, a Mexican specialist and government professor at
Georgetown University in Washington. ``It sounds kind of routine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright wasn't exactly making a big splash among residents or out-of-town
visitors to Oaxaca, a colorful city known for its ruins, colonial architecture
and black pottery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oh, you're kidding. She's coming here?'' said Canadian tourist Geri Rea,
lunching Saturday afternoon with her husband in an outdoor cafe next to the
city's crowded central plaza. ``She should be in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Cristobal Aquino, a 42-year-old Oaxacan primary school teacher getting
a shoeshine while reading the state's most prominent newspaper, Noticias, said
he wasn't sure who Albright was. He said the paper hadn't even mentioned the
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   As for what Albright might accomplish, Aquino said he would like to see the
two countries do something to stop the mistreatment of Mexican immigrants
working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   That was an issue also on the mind of 48-year-old Irene Ruiz, who was having
breakfast Saturday morning at the Hotel Victoria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They need to give more help to the Mexicans who cross the border to
work,'' she said. ``To give them more information on what's going to happen when
they arrive.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Costa Rican Plan Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A plane carrying 20 people crashed into a house
in Costa Rica's capital Saturday, killing four people aboard and injuring 14,
emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin-engine plane had just taken off from Tobia Bolanos Airport in San
Jose when it crashed at 1:10 p.m., Red Cross spokesman Guillermo Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, a Czech-built LED 410 leased by Taxi Aero Centro Americano, was
bound for the Tortuguero national park on the Atlantic Coast of northern Costa
Rica. The plane carried 17 passengers and three crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign tourists were believed among the passengers, Arroyo said. Their
nationalities were not immediately released, and it was unclear whether any were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed into a home in San Jose's upscale Rohrmoser neighborhood.
The three people in the home did not appear to be injured, emergency workers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar accidents have occurred in recent years in the area near the
airport. In September 1998, a small plane crashed into a house, killing two
people aboard the aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sees Colombia's Drug Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright got a
firsthand look Saturday at Colombian efforts to intercept cocaine shipments at
this steamy Caribbean port. She came away impressed with government sleuths'
high-tech tools -- and the methods drug lords use to circumvent them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's fantastic,'' Albright said when shown an Internet hookup that
allows Colombia to connect with 286 ports in 80 countries as part of an
integrated counterdrug campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was shown manifests purporting to document legal exports that were
an attempt by drug traders to conceal cocaine or heroin shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They certainly are ingenious,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Andres Pastrana, appearing with Albright at a news conference on
the grounds of the seaside guest house where she stayed Friday night, cited the
near-dismantling of cartels in Medellin and Cali as an indication of Colombia's
progress in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can and will do more,'' he said as three Coast Guard speed boats armed
with M-60 rifles deployed in waters just yards away. He said European donors
will meet in June or July to make pledges to assist Colombia in fighting the
drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said the two countries are sharing a ``very important moment'' and
are ``fully in harmony'' on high priority objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   While Albright was in northern Colombia, 14 people were killed Saturday in
clashes between leftist rebels and security forces hundreds of miles away, near
Bogota, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colombian government and the rebels also held peace talks Saturday in a
southern jungle. It was not clear if the attack was meant as a show of force to
coincide with the peace talks or Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit was further evidence of the growing alliance between
Washington and Colombia, the source of 80 percent of all the cocaine used in the
United States. Colombian drug lords also have emerged in the past decade as a
major force in heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite gains in interdiction, narcotics traders have been able to outpace
the government's eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, Albright flew to Panama where she inspected the operation of
the Panama Canal and also met with President Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
	   She expressed fascination with the maze of buttons, monitors and levers at
the Miraflores Lock near the Pacific side of the canal. She spoke as a Japanese
vessel that originated in Senegal was passing through with a cargo of phosphate

Thousands Demand Cuban Boy's Return
</SUBHEAD>

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, tens of thousands of Cuban protesters
rallied today to demand the child's return in the angriest gathering so far in
six weeks of demonstrations. The gathering came one day after the deadline the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had set for Elian to be returned to

General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Gunmen attacking a restaurant in the northern border city
of Tijuana killed three people, the government news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The four assailants jumped from a pick-up truck parked outside the seafood
restaurant La Palapa on Friday night and began shooting, Notimex reported,
citing witnesses. The gunmen then fled.

	   Two of the victims were identified as brothers Lorenzo and Juan Diego Favela

</P>
<P>
	   Investigators offered no motive for the slaying. Violence in Tijuana, just

<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rep. Ed Pease announced Saturday he will not seek
re-election to the congressional seat he has held since 1996, saying he wants to
devote more time to community service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Events of the last two years have helped me focus on the things I want to
do most -- spend more time in the fields and forests of Indiana, with family and
friends, and actively engage in the volunteer life of the communities I love so
much,'' the Republican said at a news conference in Terre Haute.
</P>
<P>
	   Being hospitalized last year with an arterial blockage in his heart, the
impeachment of President Clinton that year and having recently been robbed on a
Washington street caused him to rethink his priorities and decide not to seek a
third term, he said.

	   Pease is the second Indiana Republican planning to leave Congress after this
year's election. U.S. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Muncie, is seeking the Republican
gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The departure of two of the GOP's rising stars could make it even harder for
the party to keep its slim 222-212 majority in Congress, with one independent
who usually votes with the Democrats. More than 20 Republicans have announced
they are retiring at the end of this session, against a half-dozen Democrats.

<HEADLINE> ABC Backed Away From Anti-Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ABC says it stopped trying to collect government
financial credits for inserting anti-drug messages in its programs after
President Clinton's drug advisers asked to see scripts before they were aired.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't something that we were comfortable doing," ABC President Patricia
Fili-Krushel said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her comments indicated that the White House's efforts to advance anti-drug
messages were perhaps more aggressive than previously believed. Fili-Krushel
also acknowledged that ABC's participation in the effort was more extensive than
it had said before.
</P>
<P>
	   It was disclosed this past week that Clinton's Office of National Drug
Control Policy, which has bought millions of dollars worth of commercial time on
the networks, offered broadcasters financial credits if they could prove that
their programs advanced anti-drug themes.
</P>
<P>
	   White House advisers also said that in some cases they worked with networks
before shows were broadcast to make sure their messages were being conveyed
properly.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC said Saturday that it received credit for anti-drug stories on "The
Practice," "Home Improvement" and "General Hospital." The credits enabled ABC to
sell commercial time that it was otherwise obligated to give to the government.
</P>
<P>
	   When the little-known Clinton administration effort came to light on
Thursday, ABC said it had shown some scripts to the government but received no
financial benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Fili-Krushel said ABC decided not to participate this season because the
government asked to see scripts before they aired. The previous year, government
advisers were content to evaluate shows after they were broadcast, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, ABC is fulfilling its commitment to the government by airing free
public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of National Drug Policy issued a statement Saturday that said the
federal government never suggested changes in scripts
</P>
<P>
	   "Indeed, we have always assumed that any transcripts or programs submitted
for public service value qualification were final products and not subject to
further change," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Donald Vereen, deputy director of the drug office, said efforts
to work with the networks had not been intrusive.
</P>
<P>
	   Fili-Krushel said ABC had not asked any of the producers and writers of its
shows to do anything to bend to the government's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the government's anti-drug work with the networks had been "blown
out of proportion." ABC conducted its own on-air drug-fighting campaign three
years ago, before the White House office effort, she said.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Frustrated With Elian's Delay  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, an estimated 150,000 Cubans rallied to
demand the child's return, the angriest protest so far in six weeks of
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How long? How long do we have to wait?'' shouted actor Julio Casanova, one
of the speakers who addressed the crowd. He referred to the Miami relatives
sheltering Elian as ``the torturers of his innocence.''
</P>
<P>
	   A march of tens of thousands of mothers on Friday appealed to familial
sentiment. But Saturday's gathering was more of a strident political meeting,
held at the street corner where Fidel Castro declared that his government was
socialist almost four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, which organized the event and brought in the protesters,
estimated the crowd at 150,000. The people flooded down the two streets leading
to the historic intersection.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian, friend, Cuba is with you!'' demonstrators chanted after a band
played a ballad about Cuban socialism, singing lyrics that mentioned Castro as
the country's ``commander in chief.'' Internationally known folk singer Silvio
Rodriguez also performed for the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the historical significance of the site in the heart of the
Vedado neighborhood and because of the political nature of the gathering, many
demonstrators had thought Castro would attend. But the Cuban leader did not.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering came one day after a deadline the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service had set for Elian to be returned to his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who lives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give
Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court to keep the boy
with them in the United States. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, says he
can give the child a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities are becoming increasingly impatient with the delays, which
they say only increase the psychological suffering of a boy who lost his mother
at sea and is now separated from his father and grandparents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast
after his mother, stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S.
shores.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba insists Elian was ``kidnapped'' and is being ``held hostage'' by
enemies of Castro's communist government in Miami. Elian's Miami relatives and
anti-Castro exile leaders who visit the family there are typically referred to
in Cuba as ``criminals,'' ``terrorists'' and ``wolves.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like most other such demonstrations, Saturday's rally was broadcast live on
government television.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcast also included black-and-white film clips of the day a much
younger Castro stood on the same site on April 16, 1961, and defined the Cuban
revolution as socialist. The speech by the former rebel leader became a eulogy
for seven Cubans killed the day before in air attacks from B-26 bombers flown by
CIA-paid pilots -- one of many U.S. backed attacks on Cuba in the first years
after Castro took power.
</P>
<P>
	   During that same speech, Castro announced that a U.S.-backed invasion force
was headed toward the island. The following day, CIA-sponsored troops launched
the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
	   The angry political tone of Saturday's rally seemed aimed at letting
Washington know that Cuba was getting fed up.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man
on U.S.-Cuban relations, said Friday that Cuban authorities are frustrated by
Reno's failure to set a new deadline and by the INS's failure to enforce its
decision to reunite Elian with his father.

<HEADLINE> Ex Dominican Leader Enters Race  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RILEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Despite poor health, near
blindness and flagging popularity, former Dominican strongman Joaquin Balaguer
on Saturday entered the race for the presidency of the Caribbean country he led
with an iron grip for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Balaguer, 93, was helped by aides to the podium after the 1,700 delegates of
his Social Christian Reformist Party, packing a basketball arena, chose him to
run in the May 16 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reformers, luck is on our side -- let's go forward!'' he said in a strong
voice that was answered with thunderous applause befitting his status as one of
the region's last ``caudillos,'' or strongmen. ``We have to push this country
toward true social development ... to make this country more just for all, and
each day less poor.''
</P>
<P>
	   The nomination came hours after the bombing of a Santo Domingo law office
owned by party official Mario Read Vittine, who had challenged Balaguer's
pending nomination by saying Saturday's convention was improperly scheduled. No
one was injured during the attack Friday night, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Balaguer has remained the dominant figure in his conservative party since he
was forced to give up the presidency in 1996 amid allegations of voter fraud.
His endorsement helped Leonel Fernandez of the moderate Dominican Liberation
Party to the presidency -- a move that gave the elderly ruler a kingmaker role
but put the country on a more liberal course.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez has courted foreign investment, fought corruption and liberalized
the economy, helping fuel a sustained growth. But the economic boom also has
exacerbated class differences and largely passed by the majority of poor
Dominicans, and Fernandez has been repeatedly thwarted by an uncooperative
legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez is blocked from seeking a consecutive term under a 1994 law
originally aimed at curbing Balaguer's power -- leaving Balaguer facing two
first-time candidates: Hipolito Mejia of the leftist Dominican Revolutionary
Party, a younger politician with a strong grassroots following, and former
Fernandez adviser Danilo Medina.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have put Mejia in the lead, with a theoretical Balaguer candidacy
placing third -- but a wave of nostalgia for his firm hand at the helm makes the
race difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters have been laying the groundwork for Balaguer's campaign for
months, with posters across Santo Domingo declaring ``Balaguer is Returning!''
Within hours of his nomination, Dominican television stations were running
Balaguer campaign advertisements.
</P>
<P>
	   Dictator Rafael Trujillo, who was assassinated in 1961, named Balaguer
president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1961 coup forced Balaguer into exile until the United States invaded in
1965 to quash a leftist revolt. Balaguer won the 1966 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   As an autocratic president over much of the next three decades, he invested
billions of dollars in roads, housing and other public works but failed to lift
most of the island's 8 million people out of poverty. Unemployment still hovers
around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Balaguer was nearly blinded by glaucoma in the 1970s and has suffered from
various ailments. Last year he spent a month in the United States for treatment
of circulatory problems and a severe bout of the flu.

   By The Associated Press Meche Barba
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Meche Barba, a circus performer's daughter whose
smoldering beauty brought her fame as a dancer in Mexican films, died Friday of
pulmonary emphysema. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercedes Barba Feito was born in New York, where her Spanish-born father,
Antonio, had been performing with a circus.
</P>
<P>
	   Barba and her sister Carmen began performing as children to help support the
family when their father fell ill. Appearances on Mexico's premier theater
stages led to film roles starting in 1937.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Barba once insisted she wasn't pretty enough to be a film star, she
won acclaim for her beauty and her acting presence. During Mexico's ``Golden
Age'' of cinema, she was cast beside stars such as singer Jorge Negrete and
German Valdes, the comic actor better known as Tin Tan.
</P>
<P>
	   She came to be known as ``the queen of the rumba,'' for her sensuous dancing
in more than 50 films.
Denise Bennet
</P>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Race driver Denise Bennet, who won the national
quarter-midget championship in 1966, died Friday of cancer at age 43.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennet was the Arizona midget champion in 1983. In 1997, Bennet was inducted
into the Arizona Auto Racing Hall of Fame. In April of that year, she was
diagnosed with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Mannes, a three-time state midget champion, recalled that as a woman in
what had been a man's sport, ``Denise took a lot of guff in the beginning.''
Alphonse Boudard
</P>
<P>
	   NICE, France (AP) -- French writer Alphonse Boudard, who brought the world
of his rough youth to his novels, died Friday. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
	   Boudard was hospitalized a week ago, suffering from heart problems and
respiratory difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   An illegitimate child, Boudard spent much of his youth on the streets with
petty criminals. He used to say he was bilingual, speaking both French and
slang.
</P>
<P>
	   Boudard made his debut on the literary scene with the novel ``The
Metamorphosis of the Woodlice,'' which he wrote in 1962 after spending four
years in jail for burglary.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1963, Boudard's novel, ``The Cherry,'' won the Sainte-Beuve prize and
``The Fighters for Small Happiness'' won the Renaudot prize in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   The prestigious Academie Francaise awarded his ``To Die from Childhood'' a
great novel prize in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Boudard was also a scriptwriter, specializing in dialogue for movies like
``Trouble in Panama'' from 1965 and ``The Sun of the Vandals'' from 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   He married in 1958, and had two sons.
Henry Burroughs
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Henry Burroughs, an award-winning photographer who
chronicled three decades of news for The Associated Press, including the
presidencies of Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, died Friday
at his home in West River, Md., from complications of pneumonia. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Known as Hank, Burroughs joined the wire service on May 16, 1944, and
quickly gained a reputation as a journalist who could capture a great picture
without getting in the way of the story. Colleagues called him the ``dean of the
Washington photographers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born Henry Dashiell Burroughs Jr. on Aug. 1, 1918 in Washington, he took to
photography from his earliest years and spent six years as a fashion and
advertising photographer at The Washington Post before joining the AP.
</P>
<P>
	   At the wire service, he covered every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt
to Gerald Ford. His most memorable images include a photo of Richard Nixon
standing at the window of the Oval Office just as his presidency was about to
collapse and a photo of Kennedy just moments before his assassination.
</P>
<P>
	   The day Kennedy was shot in 1963, Burroughs was in the motorcade. He made
sure the world got pictures from the chaotic scene near the book depository and
of the mob outside the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
	   Burroughs retired from the AP in 1975, after 31 years with the news service.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife, Margaret Wohlgemuth of Annapolis, Md.; a
stepson, Lyford Moore, of Mount Laurel, NJ.; stepdaughter Patricia Romero of
Boise, Idaho; two sisters, Jane Dollins of Alexandria, Va.; and Rosemary Schulte
of Towson, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Services were scheduled for Tuesday at noon at Our Lady of Sorrows Church in
West River, Md.
Herb Graff
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Herb Graff, who devoted most of his life to collecting,
preserving and showing movies, died of heart failure Jan. 9. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
	   Graff began collecting movies as a teen-ager, buying one-reelers and even
scraps of film discarded by film companies. His collection eventually grew to
several hundred features and more than 1,000 shorts, and his calling card read
simply, ``Film Resource.''
</P>
<P>
	   His principal interest was in early talkies, especially musicals, but his
collection included silent films and works from the 1940s. Born in Boston and
raised in Brooklyn, Graff was active for many years as a consultant and
lecturer, showing his movies on a 16-millimeter projector, often with a scratchy
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   He offered a series of public screenings, and also showed films on PBS and
at Town Hall in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he was never a critic or author, he was considered a significant
contributor to the art of movies, knowing more about them than most historians
or archivists.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his passion for film, it was a second job for Graff, who worked as a
salesman in the garment industry until 1983. He then went to work for the Castle
Hill film company and remained a movie professional for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1989 profile in The New Yorker, Graff recalled saying to himself,
``Were I to die my tombstone would read, ``Here lies Herb Graff, Sold Shirts in
White, Pink, Beige and Blue, and Every Five Years Lilac.''
Devereux Milburn Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   NARARGANSETT, R.I. (AP) -- Devereux Milburn Jr., a trustee of the New York
Racing Association and a member of the Long Island team that won the 1950 U.S.
Open polo championship, died Monday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Milburn was a noted polo player as a back in the 1940s and '50s, following
his father onto the polo fields. He retired after a polo-related elbow injury in
1960 and took up fox hunting.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior partner for Carter, Ledyard &AMP; Milburn, where he was a litigator and
trust and estates expert, he was a longtime resident of Old Westbury, N.Y., and
for four decades was president of the Meadow Brook Club in Jericho, N.Y.
Roy E. Morgan
</P>
<P>
	   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Roy E. Morgan, operator of a Wilkes-Barre radio
station for more than four decades and a music, drama and art critic for The
Times-Leader in Wilkes-Barre, died Saturday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Morgan was the first to be awarded the Pennsylvania Associated
Press Broadcasters Association's Roy E. Morgan award, which honors outstanding
contributions to broadcast journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1947, Morgan and four others received a license to operate WILK, an AM
radio station in Wilkes-Barre that he operated until 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   During his broadcast career, Morgan served as president of the Pennsylvania
Association of Broadcasters in 1958, as a director of the National Association
of Broadcasters from 1967 to 1969, and as chairman of the ABC network affiliates
committee from 1977-80.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include two sons and four grandchildren.
Alain Poire
</P>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Alain Poire, the producer of some of France's best-loved
films, died of cancer Friday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Poire studied law and worked in a news and publicity agency before becoming
a theater director in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   During his long career, he produced 250 films and worked with some of
France's best-known directors -- Gerard Oury, Georges Lautner, Francis Veber and
Yves Robert among them.
</P>
<P>
	   His films included some popular successes like ``Fantomas,'' ``The Tall
Blond Man With One Black Shoe'' and ``A Taxi For Tobrouk.'' He received a Cesar
film award in 1985 for his life's work and was named to France's Legion of
Honor.
Zeljko Raznatovic
</P>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Zeljko Raznatovic, a Serbian warlord and
suspected war criminal better known by his alias, Arkan, was shot and killed
Saturday. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, who was indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal, was shot in the eye
while sitting in the lobby of Belgrade's Intercontinental Hotel by a group of
masked attackers who apparently escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan and his paramilitary forces have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during Serbia's war with Croatia. Reputedly one of Serbia's
wealthiest individuals, Arkan was a longtime ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   He was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces
sided with Serb rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Full details of the charges have not been released, but former British
Defense Minister George Robertson said last year that Arkan was indicted for the
1991 massacre of 250 men taken from a hospital in Vukovar, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's long criminal record goes back to the 1970s and 1980s in connection
with bank and jewelry store robberies in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Germany. In 1981 he managed to escape police custody from a heavily guarded
hospital room in Frankfurt. The international police, Interpol, issued three
arrest warrants against him.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Arkan was reportedly recruited by Yugoslavia's secret service
as a hitman in charge of killing dissidents living in the West, mostly Croats
and Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   On the eve of Yugoslavia's civil war in 1991, Arkan's job was reputedly to
deliver arms to Serbs living in Croatia and help their rebellion against
independence-seeking Croatia leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of clashes in Croatia, Arkan entered the war with his dreaded
``Tiger'' paramilitary units, which soon were accused of massive atrocities
against civilian population and of robberies.
</P>
<P>
	   The same units also reportedly fought in Bosnia when the war spread there in
1992. Serbian authorities have denied links with Arkan, but never did anything
to prevent his troops from crossing into neighboring republics.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan married a popular Serbian folk singer, Ceca, in 1995 and had two
children with her. In his previous two marriages, he had seven children.

Cubans Demand Return of Elian Gonzalez

<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, an estimated 150,000 Cubans rallied to
demand the child's return. Cuban authorities say the delays only increase the
psychological suffering of a boy who lost his mother at sea and is now separated
from his father and grandparents in Cuba. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast after his mother, stepfather and others died
in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores.

Environmentalists Issue Annual Report
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rise of the Internet and soaring stock markets
threaten to obscure "real-world" troubles such as crises in water supplies and
other resources, the Worldwatch Institute said in its State of the World 2000
report today. The report noted that the 20th century brought spectacular
technological achievements, boosted employment and helped fuel America's longest
peacetime economic expansion. But, it said, the expanding global economy is
outgrowing Earth's ecosystems. Since Worldwatch started its annual assessments
in 1984, its list of troublesome trends has lengthened to include rising
temperatures, melting glaciers, more destructive storms, and dying coral reefs.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans a $1.5 billion increase in

the senior Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said the
administration will request $46 billion for veterans' benefits and services.
That includes a request for a $1.5 billion increase in spending authority, much
of it targeted at expanding health care services, Evans said.

Chile Vote Too Close To Call

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sunday's presidential election in Chile is so close
that not even pollsters will hazard a guess who will win: socialist Ricardo
Lagos or his rightist rival, Joaquin Lavin. Some 8 million Chileans are eligible
to cast ballots in a run-off vote for a new leader in this country, where the
economy is emerging from its deepest recession in 16 years. Lavin and Lagos
battled to a virtual draw in an initial ballot on Dec. 12. Lagos received 47.9
percent of the vote and Lavin received 47.5 percent. A simple majority was
needed to win outright.

	   MOSCOW (AP) -- With little more than two months until Russia's presidential
election, Communists and other Russian groups sketched out strategies Saturday

Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said he has a "good chance" of winning
the election. The reform-oriented Yabloko party formally nominated lawmaker
Grigory Yavlinsky as its candidate. All the candidates will be hard pressed to
beat Putin, who assumed power after Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31 and called

Israel Delays West Bank Withdrawal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel decided Saturday to postpone a withdrawal from the
West Bank for at least two weeks over a dispute with the Palestinians on the
land to be included in the pullout. The Palestinians have accused Israel of
neglecting the peace talks with them in favor of the Syrian negotiations, which
reopened in December and will continue Wednesday in the United States.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet warned in a meeting Friday that
Israeli sluggishness in the negotiations will prevent the sides from working out
a framework on a final peace agreement by a Feb. 13 deadline.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Explosions destroyed a home and scattered debris
over a wide area of a south Kansas City neighborhood Saturday. At least one
person was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The blasts at a home set an adjacent house on fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of the victim was found in the house that exploded, said Fire
Department spokesman Pat Gilchrist. One person from that house was missing.
</P>
<P>
	   A large amount of explosive chemicals were found. Gilchrist said the type of
chemicals was unknown but they appeared to be powerful pyrotechnics that would
be used in making fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials said they did not know the cause of the explosions, but
speculated that it could have been a ruptured natural gas line or a
methamphetamine laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   Wood, glass and other debris littered the streets in the area. Some
businesses close to the house that exploded had their windows blown out.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses in the area reported hearing a series of explosions.	   ``We
thought at first someone was shooting at the house, but then there was just a
real loud boom,'' said Dave Ross, who lives in the house on the other side of
the exploded house.

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A plane carrying 20 people crashed into a house
in Costa Rica's capital Saturday, killing four people and injuring 15, including
one person in the house, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin-engine plane had just taken off from Tobia Bolanos Airport in San
Jose when it crashed at 1:10 p.m., Red Cross spokesman Guillermo Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, a Czech-built LED 410 leased by Taxi Aero Centro Americano, was
bound for the Tortuguero national park on the Atlantic Coast of northern Costa
Rica. The plane carried 17 passengers and three crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities did not release the nationalities or identities of the four
people who died.

injuring a housekeeper. Two other people in the house were not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Serb Paramilitary Leader Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen opened fire in a hotel lobby
Saturday, killing a feared Serb paramilitary leader indicted by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities in Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was shot in the Belgrade
Intercontinental Hotel and rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Tanjug news agency later confirmed that Arkan had died and that
two others with him had been shot, including a bodyguard who was also killed in
the attack. Other media reports said that his sister-in-law was wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word of arrests, suspects or a motive.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses differed on the number of assailants. Some said that Arkan was
shot by a group of masked attackers. Others spoke of one gunman. The independent
Studio B television network reported two attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   A source in the Intercontinental Hotel, who asked not to be named, said the
gunmen escaped after at least one bullet hit Arkan in the eye while he was
sitting in a sectioned-off part of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, 47, and his paramilitary forces have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during Serbia's war with Croatia. Reputedly one of Serbia's
wealthiest individuals, Arkan was a longtime ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the
indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began
in March. His paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in
atrocities during the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. Arkan's forces

	   The tribunal made public his indictment in an apparent attempt to dissuade
him from joining the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied involvement in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leaders, reacting to the killing, alluded to Arkan's link to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone who knew a lot and took part in many things was killed,'' said
Goran Svilanovic, a leader of the anti-Milosevic Civic Alliance, adding that
Arkan ``was very close to the authorities, or so it seemed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vladan Batic, also with the Civic Alliance said: ``Someone is pulling the
strings and decides who's going to be next.''
</P>
<P>
	   In London, the British Foreign Office issued a statement saying it had
confirmed Arkan's death. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``Arkan
lived violently so it is therefore no surprise that he died violently.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret his death because it prevents us doing justice to the victims of
his atrocities by seeing him in the dock of at The Hague war crimes tribunal,''
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's long criminal record goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when he became
a suspect in bank and jewelry store robberies in Sweden, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Germany. In 1981 he managed to escape from a heavily guarded

smuggling and arms dealing.

<P>
	   His ``Tigers'' militia, meanwhile, became known for savagery.
</P>
<P>
	   During the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia, Arkan frequently warned the
Atlantic Alliance against a land invasion, warning of fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan married a popular Serbian folk singer, Ceca, in 1995 and had two
children with her. In his previous two marriages, he had seven children. He and
Ceca were frequent visitors to Belgrade's Hyatt Hotel during the bombing,
apparently fearing to stay at home and risk becoming a NATO target.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Colombia Leaves 50 Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In some of the worst fighting in months, clashes
between leftist rebels and security forces near Bogota killed 50 people
Saturday, the same day Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited northern
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, staged an
early morning attack on Guayabetal, 30 miles southeast of Bogota, Colombia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting in the region continued throughout the day, and was still going on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colombian government and FARC also held peace talks Saturday in a
southern jungle. It was not clear if the rebel attack was meant as a show of
force to coincide with the peace talks or Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting was hundreds of miles away from Cartagena, where Albright was
on a one-day visit to discuss increasing cooperation between Colombia and the
United States in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the Colombian army said 44 rebels, five soldiers and a
police officers were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the worst fighting in Colombia in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, four small bombs exploded at police posts in southern Bogota,
causing damage but no casualties. No one claimed responsibility for the
explosives, but suspicion immediately fell on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia's civil war has been going on for nearly four decades and has
killed an estimated 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   On her visit, Albright promoted a proposed aid package to Colombia worth
$1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States insists the aid, if approved by the U.S. Congress, would
go to fighting drug trafficking. But some Colombians point out that FARC earns
much of its money from taxing drug crops -- and that the proposed aid would
almost certainly be used in the counterinsurgency fight under the guise of
fighting drugs.

Serb Paramilitary Leader Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen opened fire in a hotel lobby
Saturday, killing a feared Serb paramilitary leader indicted by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities in Bosnia and Croatia. There was no word
of arrests, suspects or a motive. Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was
reputedly one of Serbia's wealthiest individuals, and a longtime ally of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Arkan was indicted for war crimes in
Bosnia in September 1997.

George W. Bush accused John McCain of seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the

extended stay in the United States, an estimated 150,000 Cubans rallied to

psychological suffering of a boy who lost his mother at sea and is now separated

Black Activists Protest Immigration

today called for an end to what they see as a double standard in U.S.
immigration policy that favors Cubans over Haitians. The group of about 150
people denounced Miami officials for going to Washington on behalf of 6-year-old
Cuban Elian Gonzalez while "not saying a word" about more than 400 would-be
immigrants shipped back to Haiti after their boat ran aground New Year's Day.
Under the 1966 Cuban Readjustment Act, Cubans who reach U.S. soil can stay. But
there is no such law for Haitians and others who arrive here illegally.

where the economy is emerging from its deepest recession in 16 years. Lavin and

<HEADLINE> Cardinal feted on 80th birthday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor's birthday party Saturday turned
into a major fund-raiser for donors eager to express their gratitude for his
contribution not only to the city but to the nation.
<P>
	   Praising his strength and wisdom, speakers honored O'Connor on his 80th
birthday, which raised $5.2 million for Catholic charities, including support
for parochial schools in the New York Archdiocese and funding for a seminary
position named for the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
	   But with speculation that O'Connor is in the twilight of his career as one
of the most powerful Catholics in the nation, the party at the Waldorf-Astoria
also served as a gathering for some of his possible successors.
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 1,500 people attending were several men whose names have
been mentioned as O'Connor's possible successors: Archbishop Justin Rigali of
St. Louis; Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the U.S.
Military; and Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor said he anticipates being relieved of his post in the near future,
and while saying he would like to stay until he dies, he still found humor in
the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will soon be evicted. I don't know when it will be," said O'Connor,
speaking eloquently for about 15 minutes while drawing several standing ovations
and even more laughs. "I will have the distinction of bring the first living
cardinal to be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
	   He promised not to disappear from the public's view and will assist his
successor in any way that he can.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor turned the party's focus away from him and instead celebrated the
city he loves. He spoke fondly of New York and its many giving people,
especially those he said who do so quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner featured tributes to the cardinal, a speech by O'Connor, and a
video about his legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, who grew up in Philadelphia, was a military chaplain who served
briefly as the bishop of Scranton, Pa., before being named to head the New York
Archdiocese in 1984. He succeeded Cardinal Terence Cooke.
</P>
<P>
	   He is the oldest active bishop in the United States. The pope is expected to
replace him now that he has turned 80, the age at which cardinals lose their
power to vote for a new pope.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor also had a brain tumor removed in September and has missed a number
of public appearances, including Masses, since then. He stumbled twice in
November when mounting the steps to the pulpit, and has taken to sitting in a
chair near the high altar to avoid the stairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The guest list for his birthday dinner read like a Who's Who of Catholics in
America. In addition to Rigali, O'Brien and Mansell, the attendees were expected
to include Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark; Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua
of Philadelphia; Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston; Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit;
Cardinal James Hickey of Washington; Cardinal Francis George of Chicago;
Archbishop Harry Flynn of St. Paul-Minneapolis; and the Papal Nuncio in
Washington D.C., Gabriel Montalvo.
</P>
<P>
	   Auxiliary Bishop James F. McCarthy, who once served as O'Connor's secretary
for 12 years, referred to the six cardinals attending the celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a measure of the respect of which he has had by the leaders of the
United States," McCarthy said. "This may be the last chance that everyone can
singularly point the spotlight on him and say, 'Way to go, John."'
</P>
<P>
	   Former Mayor Ed Koch, a close friend of the cardinal's, and Gov. George
Pataki, also attended.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the clergy are also expected to attend Sunday morning Mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner was chaired by three Wall Street investment bankers: Ted
Forstmann, senior partner of Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., and a well-known advocate
of school vouchers; David Komansky, CEO of Merrill Lynch; and Les Quick of Quick
&AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
	   Tickets were $1,000 a head but many guests made additional contributions.
The seminary position being funded by some of the proceeds is the John Cardinal
O'Connor Distinguished Chair in Hebrew Studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in
Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
	   It is designed to educate priests about the shared scriptural heritage of
Jews and Christians. Fostering better relations between Catholics and Jews has
been one of the cardinal's priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is also known for being a stalwart defender of the pope's hard line
on abortion and homosexuality. During his 16 years in New York, he has chastised
politicians who support abortion and ousted gay worshippers from parish
churches. But he's also sided with striking unions and gone into AIDS wards
anonymously to wash the hair of patients too sick to know who he was.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Archdiocese serves 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, the
Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Rockland and five upstate counties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marine Accused of Rape in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A U.S. Marine has been arrested and accused of trying to rape a
Japanese woman at a disco on the Japanese island of Okinawa, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lance Cpl. Oswald McDonald, 29, dragged the woman into a corner of the disco
Friday and attempted to sexually assault her, a spokesman for the Okinawa
Prefectural police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman resisted and the soldier backed off without physically injuring
her, said the spokesman, who only identified himself by his last name, Shimada.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Marines confirmed the arrest on Friday, but gave no further
details. Officials could not immediately provide McDonald's hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrest in Okinawa city came just months after the U.S. military lifted a
four-year curfew barring service members from the city center. The ban, lifted
in October, was meant to curtail fights and drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
	   The curfew was imposed in October 1995, a month after three U.S. servicemen
raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl on another part of the island. The crime
triggered protests against the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Okinawans have long complained about crime and congestion linked to the U.S.
bases. About two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are in Okinawa, 1,000
miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald is based at Futenma Air Station. The Japanese government recently
endorsed a plan to move the station's heliport to a less crowded part of Okinawa
as part of a U.S.-Japanese agreement to reduce tensions on the island.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has extended for six more months a ban
on U.S. companies suing companies that deal in properties seized after Fidel
Castro took power in Cuba, the White House said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the press office said Clinton notified Congress on Friday
that he was taking the action ``in the natural interest and because it is the
best way to secure the ... objective of promoting a transition to democracy in
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has regularly used his authority to suspend the right of U.S.
companies to sue under the 1996 Helms-Burton Act in an effort to avoid angering
European countries and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of companies headquartered in Canada and Europe do business with
Cuba and have been critical of the Helms-Burton law.

<P>
    OLEAN, N.Y. (AP) -- J.R. Bremer's 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds left gave St.
Bonaventure a 57-56 victory over No. 23 Temple on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Bonaventure (12-2, 4-0 Atlantic 10 Conference) didn't lead in the second
half until Bremer made the game-winning basket. Bremer, who missed the first
eight games of the season with a broken right foot, was 4-of-5 from 3-point
range in scoring 14 points. He had five points in the last 30 seconds to cap the
Bonnies' comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Bonaventure has its best record at this stage since the 1970 team was
13-1 on the way to advancing to the NCAA tournament Final Four.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Bonaventure trailed 49-44 with 4:15 to play, but then limited Temple
(9-4, 3-1) to seven free throws the rest of the way. David Caper, who finished
with 14 points, hit two 3-pointers and Bremer added five points as the Bonnies
closed the gap.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Winn added 11 points and Patricio Prato had 10 for St. Bonaventure.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Karcher had 16 points and Quincy Wadley 13 for the Owls.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple led 33-22 at halftime, riding 50 percent field-goal shooting
(14-of-28). But the Owls were limited to only five baskets in 27 second-half
shots, an anemic 18.5 shooting percentage. St. Bonaventure, for its part, was
11-of-25 (44 percent) in the second half, including 7-of-14 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight year St. Bonaventure got a victory over Temple,
but the Bonnies still trail 35-5 in the series.

<P>
	   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Luke Axtell scored 15 points and No. 8 Kansas
remained unbeaten at home with a 97-82 victory over Nebraska on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Axtell, a 6-foot-10 transfer from Texas, made three 3-pointers and hit a
pair of free throws that kept the Jayhawks (14-2 overall, 3-0 Big 12) in charge
with a 66-46 lead with 12:43 remaining. It was the first time Axtell had led his
new team in scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers (7-9, 0-3), trying to avert their first 0-3 start in the
conference in seven years, trailed by only two until Kansas went on a 17-2 run
at the end of the first half. The Jayhawks then scored the first four points of
the second half to open a 53-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Until then, the biggest lead Kansas could manage was eight when Axtell made
a 3-pointer for a 32-24 lead. The Huskers then scored the next six points and
trimmed the lead to 32-30 before Kenny Gregory's bucket and Kirk Hinrich's
3-pointer ignited the 17-2 run in the last three minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska, 1-16 in its last 17 trips to Allen Fieldhouse, was led by Kimani
Ffriend's 23 points and 14 rebounds. Gary Cochran had 17 points, including five
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Truscott's free throw sliced Kansas' lead to 60-45 before Drew Gooden
hit a pair of free throws and Axtell followed with two more. Gooden, a 6-foot-9
freshman, brought the sellout crowd of more than 16,000 to its feet with a
follow shot at the 11:47 mark that gave the Jayhawks a 69-48 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A few minutes later, reserve Ashante Johnson scored six of Kansas' next
eight points as the Jayhawks improved to 8-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Gooden and Gregory had 14 points for Kansas, while Nick Collison had 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskers outrebounded Kansas 55-48.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Explosions destroyed a home and scattered debris
over a wide area of a south Kansas City neighborhood Saturday, killing one
person and setting an adjacent house on fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of the victim was found in the house that exploded, said Fire
Department Deputy Chief Pat Gilchrist.
</P>
<P>
	   A large amount of explosive chemicals was also found in the remains of the
house that exploded. Gilchrist said the type of chemicals was unknown but they
appeared to be powerful pyrotechnics that would be used in making fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials said they did not know the cause of the explosions, but ruled
out a natural gas leak. Gilchrist said the fire would be investigated as a crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Wood, glass and other debris littered the streets in the area. Some
businesses close to the house that exploded had their windows blown out.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses reported a series of explosions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We thought at first someone was shooting at the house, but then there was
just a real loud boom,'' said Dave Ross, who lives in the house on the other
side of the exploded house.

    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- See what you've missed, Chicago. That's what Steve Francis
seemed to be saying with his play Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Upset last summer when the Bulls made Elton Brand and not him the first pick
in last summer's draft, Francis matched a career high with 27 points -- 23 in
the first half-- and had 11 assists as the Rockets held on to beat the Bulls
93-90.
</P>
<P>
	   Toni Kukoc scored 29 points for the Bulls, who have lost three straight
following a three-game winning streak. Brand did OK, too, adding 15 points to go
with 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls trailed by 10 with 4:13 left and were down six with just less than
three minutes to go when Francis drove the baseline and then dished to Anthony
Miller for a layup. Francis then sprinted to midcourt raising his arms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls then ran off seven straight points, including a followup by former
Rockets guard Matt Maloney, but could never get the lead. Maloney missed two
shots in the final 16 seconds, the second on a driving lauyp against Francis
with six seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenny Thomas and Miller then hit free throws in the closing seconds to wrap
up the victory. Walt Williams added 17 points for Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis didn't score as much in the second half because the Bulls had to
double team him after he erupted for 19 first-quarter points, including a
spectacular 10-point spurt in the final 69 seconds as the Rockets built a
17-point lead they never lost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls trailed by 15 in the third quarter, but cooled Francis off with a
double team and caught up with a 17-4 run that featured Kukoc's seven free
throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis started the 10-point personal spurt with a highlight-film
double-crossover dribble and then dunked on the baseline. Seconds later, he
stole the ball and went flying to the basket, stopping in time to flip the ball
to himself for another crowd-oohing slam.
</P>
<P>
	   He wasn't finished, adding back-to-back 3-pointers to close the first
quarter and give the Rockets a 37-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first period, Francis had 19 points on 8-for-11 shooting, three
rebounds, four assists, two steals and three dunks. He finished 12-of-17 from
the field.

<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- One night after their longest winning streak of the
season ended, the Los Angeles Lakers snapped their longest losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal had 26 points, 19 rebounds and seven assists as Los Angeles
beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 104-91 on Saturday night for its 17th victory in
18 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "We came out and did what we had to do," said O'Neal, who also had five
blocks. "We make it a point not to lose two in a row."
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant had 22 points and Glen Rice added 17 for Los Angeles, which had
its 16-game winning streak snapped in Indiana on Friday night. The Lakers have
not lost consecutive games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't get emotional," coach Phil Jackson said after watching his team
squander a 17-point first half lead. "It was a take-care-of-business type of
game."
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who lost
for just the third time in 14 games. Terrell Brandon had 21 points and eight
assists and Anthony Peeler had 17 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied at 80 entering the fourth quarter, but the Lakers used a
17-2 run at the start of the quarter to put it away.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were just running their offense and we were just missing," Garnett
said after his team shot 4-for-18 in the fourth. "We got more frustrated as the
quarter went on."
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Fisher's third 3-pointer of the run gave Los Angeles a 97-82 lead with
4:53 left. Minnesota did not get closer than nine the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher had 12 points in the third and outscored Minnesota, which tied a
franchise-low with 11 points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he (Fisher) took it personal that his guy wouldn't even check him,"
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just tried to be aggressive on both ends of the court and make things
happen, and it did," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles led 57-49 at halftime and still led by eight, 74-66, with 4:55
left in the third. But, the Wolves followed with an 11-2 run to take their first
lead of the game on Garnett's dunk with 1:22 left.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fought so hard to get back in," said Wolves forward Joe Smith, who said
it was no fun guarding O'Neal for most of the game. "I was surprised the
momentum didn't carry us over."
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers shot 12-for-20 in the first quarter and raced out to a 30-20
lead. Rice scored 11 and Bryant added nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles kept the pressure on in the second led by Rick Fox, whose third
3-pointer of the quarter gave the Lakers their biggest lead at 51-34 with 3:37
left.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Minnesota went on a 15-6 run to close within 57-49 by halftime. Peeler
scored 14 in the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Rallies for Ill. Students  </HEADLINE>
   By SARA BAKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson used the birthday of slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Saturday as a rallying point in his
crusade for six black students expelled from the Decatur school system.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson has said the expulsions were not a racial issue. But while speaking
to hundreds of people packed in the Church of the Living God on Saturday night,
he called the expulsions a black and white issue.
</P>
<P>
	   He pointed to recent studies that show ``zero tolerance'' discipline
policies imposed in schools amid fears of mass shootings and riots are having a
disproportionate impact on black students.
</P>
<P>
	   He also pointed to figures showing that 82 percent of students the Decatur
school district has expelled are black, even though black students comprise only
about 46 percent of Decatur's public school population.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Decatur is symbolic of a national crisis,'' Jackson said. ``Youth are
being expelled disproportionately and jailed disproportionately without a plan
to educate them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson added that what is happening in Decatur is the biggest civil rights
movement in America today.
</P>
<P>
	   The six Decatur teens were expelled for up to two years as the result of a
bleacher-clearing fight at a football game in September. After intervention by
Jackson and the governor, the city's school board cut the time to one year and
let the six teens attend alternative schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to supporters at a Rainbow-PUSH Coalition weekly meeting in Chicago
earlier in the day, Jackson reaffirmed plans to appeal a judge's decision
upholding the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jackson said the punishment was still too harsh for a fight that
involved no weapons or drugs and that hurt no one seriously. He said he would
ask the school board on Tuesday to reinstate a seventh student who withdrew from
school rather than face expulsion. Jackson says the teen-ager was being hit and
was not fighting.

	   TOKYO (AP) -- A U.S. Marine has been arrested and accused of trying to rape
a Japanese woman at a disco on the Japanese island of Okinawa, police said.

Friday and attempted to sexually assault her, a spokesman for the Okinawa
Prefectural police said. The arrest in Okinawa city came just months after the
U.S. military lifted a four-year curfew barring service members from the city
center. The ban, lifted in October, was meant to curtail fights and drunkenness.
The curfew was imposed in October 1995, a month after three U.S. servicemen
raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl on another part of the island. The crime
triggered protests against the U.S. military presence.
