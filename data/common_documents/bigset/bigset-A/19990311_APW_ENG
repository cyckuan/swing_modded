<HEADLINE> Murray St. Aims for Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When Murray State takes the floor against  
Ohio State tonight in the South Regional, the Racers will take with 
them a tradition of bedeviling better-known teams in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13th-seeded Racers also have a tradition of coming up short.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of these days we're going to win a game in the  
tournament,'' said Tevester Anderson, Murray State's 62-year-old 
rookie coach. ``I don't know when it's going to happen again. I 
hope I'm still coaching here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, No. 2-seeded Duke was tied at halftime with  
Murray State and had to hit 83 percent of its free throws to hold 
on, 80-70. In 1990, top-seeded Michigan State was pushed to the 
brink by Murray before surviving, 75-71. And two years before that, 
the Racers picked up their only NCAA victory in 10 tries, knocking 
off third-seeded North Carolina State 78-75. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8,900-student school in Murray, Ky., is making its seventh  
tournament appearance this decade. As usual, the 13th-seeded Racers 
(27-5) are a heavy underdog against fourth-seeded Ohio State 
(23-8). 
</P>
<P>
	Other first-round games at the RCA Dome pit top-seeded Auburn  
(27-3) against Winthrop (21-7), Syracuse (21-11) against Oklahoma 
State (22-10) and UCLA (22-8) against Detroit (24-5). 
</P>
<P>
	About the only advantage Murray State may have on the Buckeyes  
is their tournament experience. Five Racers -- including starters 
Isaac Spencer, Aubrey Reese and Rod Murray -- played a year ago when 
Rhode Island eliminated them 97-74 in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming into the tournament this year with a lot of  
confidence,'' Reese said. ``We feel we can play with anybody in the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Reese who hit a looping 15-foot shot at the buzzer to  
beat Southeast Missouri 62-61 in the Ohio Valley Conference 
tournament to put the Racers into the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, meanwhile, has only one player who has ever played  
in the tournament. Point guard Scoonie Penn started on the 1996 and 
1997 Boston College teams that made it to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a big deal that we haven't played in an  
NCAA tournament before,'' Penn said. ``I hope we can come out 
loose. I tell the guys to just go out and have fun, to play hard 
and be hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no other Buckeyes player has ever even been on a team that's  
won more than 10 games in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you don't go to the tournament, you don't know what  
you're missing,'' said Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, who coached 
Boston College to the tournament three times -- including Penn 
twice. ``Once you go, you don't ever want to not go again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn has encountered the same questions. While Ohio State  
hasn't been to the NCAA tournament since 1992, it's been 11 years 
for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want our players to come out and play with the same  
energy level and not get too emotional about being here or get too 
high and panic if things don't go their way the first few minutes 
of the game,'' coach Cliff Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winthrop may be the longest of longshots, going from 7-20 a year  
ago to 21-7 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that no No. 16 seed has ever gotten a No. 1 ... I'm  
not worried about that,'' first-year Eagles coach Gregg Marshall 
said. ``We were picked dead last (in the conference). Now we're 
first. We're here. This is a reality. We're going to go out and 
play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game between ninth-seeded Oklahoma State and eighth-seeded  
Syracuse figures to be as close as their seedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams might be a little better than they played this  
year,'' Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. ``We'll find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though UCLA is seeded fifth, the Bruins believe they are  
the underdog against 12th-seeded Detroit. Point guard Baron Davis 
has a simple explanation for why everyone seems to think UCLA is 
headed for an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just hate us, basically,'' he said. ``That's all.  
Because we're UCLA, because we're young, because we're all good 
looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Detroit coach Perry Watson said he doesn't want the  
attention that goes with being Cinderella. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't understand why they want to put those slippers on  
us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900; Pulls Back To 9,841 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the threshold of an historic milestone, the  
Dow was retreating from its record highs this afternoon after 
surpassing 9,800 and 9,900. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 68.27 at 9,841.11, after pulling back from a high of 9,935.46, 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock measures also were rising, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index also hitting a new high and flirting with its 
first close ever above 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up 1  
11/16 at 84 15/16, and Exxon, which rose 1 1/2 at 74 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Dow gainer was soft-drink maker Coca-Cola, which  
rose 3 9/16 to 66 1/4 after an analyst from Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette Securities raised his investment opinion of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor interest in the magical 10,000 mark for the Dow also  
seemed to be feeding on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short term, at the margins, traders feel its inevitable  
that we will go to 10,000 and they are playing that dynamic to push 
the Dow higher,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for 
Legg Mason of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in years, the broad stock indicators were  
driven higher even without a surge in technology stocks. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.70 to 2,397.30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more sectors that participate in a market advance is a  
sign the market looks very good,'' Cripps said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cripps cautioned that many small cap stocks are still  
struggling, as evidence by the Russell 2000 measure falling 0.56 to 
400.56 
</P>
<P>
	Helping today's rally was new retail sales data showing the U.S.  
economy is growing without any inflationary threats. Since there 
are no signs that the economy is overheating, investors believe 
that the Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to boost 
interest rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department said today that  
first-time claims for unemployment checks remained under 300,000 
for the sixth consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 751.69 million 
shares, up from 642.30 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.30 to 1,290.14.  
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.24 at 608.72, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.75 at 717.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize GOP Over Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest dustup over the 2000 census,  
House Democrats criticized reports Thursday that Republican leaders 
are planning a major campaign against White House plans to use a 
mix of traditional and scientific methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans oppose use of ``statistical sampling.'' Democrats  
argue it will produce a more accurate accounting of the nation's 
population than the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hastily scheduled news conference, Democrats denounced a  
published report that said Republicans were preparing for a budget 
fight over the census issue that could result in another shutdown 
of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., a sampling advocate, said it was  
``outrageous'' that Republicans were ``willing to undermine the 
entire census to keep political power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report in the Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, said House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has enlisted former Rep. Bill 
Paxon, R-N.Y., to prepare House Republicans for a budget fight over 
the census. The newspaper also said Paxon and a team of political 
consultants were mapping plans to win over the public, including a 
paid media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do think the American people need to know that any effort  
to have a two-count census is going to diminish'' the count, said 
Hastert spokesman John Feehery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 census, which was the first to be less accurate than  
the one before, missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4 million 
people twice. Subsequently, the National Academy of Sciences 
endorsed sampling for the 2000 count. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans took their objections to court, and the Supreme  
Court ruled in January that sampling is unconstitutional for the 
process of redistributing the 435 seats in the House. But the court 
said the law requires its use for other purposes, such as the 
annual distribution of billions of dollars in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director, has announced that  
the agency will produce two separate population counts for the 
census. One will be based on a traditional door-to-door count and 
be used to reshuffle House seats; the other will use sampling to 
find people missed during the first count and produce what 
administration officials say will be a more accurate census. 
</P>
<P>
	The census, which begins on April 1, 2000, involves mailing  
questionnaires to some 100 million households and sending workers 
to find those who don't respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Government Reform census subcommittee  
cleared four measures by its chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., 
that are among a package of proposals Miller says will produce a 
more accurate census without sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills, which advanced to the full House Government Reform  
Committee, would mandate a follow-up mailing of census forms; 
require that they be available in 33 languages, including Braille; 
authorize an additional $300 million for Census Bureau advertising 
and outreach; and require the commerce secretary to administer $26 
million in matching grants for outreach by local governments and 
community groups.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Probes Eligibility Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The University of Minnesota is conducting a  
whirlwind investigation to determine whether four players, 
including starters Miles Tarver and Kevin Clark, are eligible for 
the Gophers' first-round NCAA tournament game against Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	The university promised a decision before today's 2:42 p.m. EST  
tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe by the university's general counsel and its NCAA  
compliance officer followed a report in Wednesday's Saint Paul 
Pioneer Press quoting a former university employee as saying she 
did take-home exams and other course work for the four current 
players and at least 16 former players. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also quoted four former players as confirming that  
work was prepared for them in possible violation of the student 
code of conduct and NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't declare people ineligible just based on an  
allegation,'' said Jeff Schemmel, senior associate athletic 
director. ``We've got to find out on our own what's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation focused on whether Tarver, Clark, Antoine  
Broxsie and Jason Stanford -- the four current players named by the 
newspaper -- violated NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That decision will only be made after we have fully evaluated  
all the information that we can compile in this short period of 
time,'' Chris Schoemann, the university's director of athletic 
compliance, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the university suspended the players, the NCAA could  
reinstate them because there hadn't been time for a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota players declined to comment on the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything that's going on besides our basketball  
game tomorrow with Gonzaga,'' Tarver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins, who told the Saint Paul paper that he knew  
nothing of the specifics of the charges, praised the ``character 
and class'' of his players, but otherwise tried to avoid the issue 
when he appeared for a news conference that is mandatory for all 
tournament teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our guys plan on playing,'' Haskins said. ``The  
investigation going on is being conducted by the university and 
they are doing a great job with that. We are here to focus on 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The larger questions of whether there was widespread cheating,  
and the possible ramifications on Haskins' 13-year tenure at 
Minnesota, were taking a back seat to the immediate eligibility 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very fast process,'' Schemmel said. ``I'm sure in  
the long run a lot of investigating will be done. We're just trying 
to deal with four athletes right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To add to the distractions, Clark suffered a seizure similar to  
those associated with epilepsy Tuesday on the flight to Seattle. If 
eligible, he was expected to play but not be at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, a starting guard, is the team's No. 2 scorer at 14.7  
points per game. Tarver, who starts at forward, led the team in 
rebounding at 7.1 per game. Both are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark was a junior-college transfer two seasons ago. Tarver was  
a reserve on the 1997 Final Four team. 
</P>
<P>
	Broxie, a sophomore center, played in all 27 games this year.  
Stanford, a senior forward, played in 21 games, also as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota star Quincy Lewis, the Big Ten's leading scorer at  
23.7 points per game, was not among those implicated. He said the 
Gophers will have no problem staying focused on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go back to the hotel, watch some film, go to  
bed, get up tomorrow at 7 o'clock, have a pregame meal, come to the 
arena and get ready to play,'' Lewis said. ``I don't care if the 
whole city of Seattle falls down, we have to be ready to play. As 
long as the gym doesn't fall down, then we're going to be there 
ready to play.''

<HEADLINE> Reports: FBI Probes UCLA Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI is investigating members of the UCLA  
football team for an alleged point-shaving scheme last season, 
according to the Los Angeles Times and a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players have been questioned by FBI agents since an  
investigation was launched three weeks ago, and star quarterback 
Cade McNown underwent a polygraph test and passed, the Times 
reported in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	KFWB-AM radio reported the investigation Wednesday night, citing  
unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times cited unnamed sources who indicated that a reputed New  
York mobster might have connections to some team members. 
</P>
<P>
	All players have been exonerated so far, both news organizations  
said. However, no other names or specific allegations were 
released. It was not immediately clear if the allegations involved 
one or more games. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, agents wanted to speak to four players, and at least  
one interview has yet to be scheduled, the Times quoted sources as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for McNown issued a statement Wednesday that  
confirmed he was among those the FBI questioned, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown voluntarily took the lie detector test, passed it and was  
told ``there would be no further inquiry necessary,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Dellins, UCLA's sports information director, did not  
immediately return phone calls placed to his office and home 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also did not return phone calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	UCLA spokeswoman Diana DeCardenas said she had not heard about  
an investigation and referred calls to Dellins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard about this,'' DeCardenas said. ``This is the  
first we have heard of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA Athletic Director Pete Dalis told the Times the university  
had notified Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of gambling and agents, 
of the FBI inquiry. Dalis stressed that agents ``assured'' UCLA the 
FBI had ``no concerns regarding the conduct of UCLA or any of its 
student-athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA finished the season with a 10-2 record, winning its first  
10 games before losing at Miami 49-45 on Dec. 5. The Bruins then 
lost to Wisconsin 38-31 in the Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA won the Pacific-10 Conference championship and was ranked  
second in the country before losing to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, expected to be a first-round selection in next month's  
NFL draft, left the university after the Rose Bowl to focus on 
preparing for his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two games, the defense gave up a lot of points,''  
senior linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo told the Times. He said has 
not been approached by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayanbadejo said point shaving wouldn't make sense for UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
	``But when something like point shaving comes up, how does the  
defense have any control over point shaving?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Brad Melsby also told the paper: ``From what I  
understand, they're looking for some sort of point deal. They're 
not going to find anything. We all know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melsby also said he has not been interviewed by the FBI.  
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the investigation told the Times that the  
Bruin players had been observed and possibly photographed in recent 
months with Dominic Montemarano, 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Montemarano, also known as ``Donny Shacks,'' was convicted in  
1987 in federal court of racketeering charges. He was sentenced to 
18 years in federal prison, but later released from federal 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	A source recalled seeing 20 to 25 current or former UCLA players  
at a Long Beach restaurant. Sitting with them, the source said, was 
Montemarano, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that Montemarano could not be reached for  
comment at his home in suburban Century City.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Suggests Clinton Perjury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- After failing to charge President  
Clinton and his wife in the five-year Whitewater investigation, 
prosecutor Kenneth Starr is airing some of the evidence he gathered 
against them by putting their former business partner on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with criminal contempt and obstructing Starr's  
investigation, defendant Susan McDougal is using the case to do 
some airing of her own, trying to put the prosecutor's tactics on 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney says Starr was trying to pressure Mrs. McDougal,  
44, into falsely alleging wrongdoing by the Clintons. ``She was not 
going to cooperate with an investigation that was totally flawed 
and corrupt,'' attorney Mark Geragos said, adding that his client 
would testify in her own defense and make clear she was concealing 
no crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Starr's prosecutors introduced a series of Whitewater  
loan documents, in an effort to show the close relationship between 
Mrs. McDougal and the Clintons. Each one of the eight documents 
introduced at the trial bears the signature of the Clintons, Mrs. 
McDougal and her late ex-husband James. The documents show that the 
bank loan for approximately $200,000 used to purchase the 
Whitewater property in northern Arkansas was repeatedly extended by 
the bank for over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Wednesday at Mrs. McDougal's trial,  
Geragos said that in a 1996 conversation with his client, Starr's 
prosecutors told her ``you know who we want and you know what we 
want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr prosecutor Mark Barrett said ``we vigorously and  
categorically deny that'' Starr's office had sought perjured 
testimony from Mrs. McDougal to implicate the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos told the jurors he would show his client was being  
``used as a pawn ... to get the president or the first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett opened the trial by charging that Mrs. McDougal's  
refusal to testify before a grand jury has kept investigators from 
determining whether Clinton lied under oath about his business 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has documents, but no central witness to testify against  
the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom he has been 
investigating since 1994 as was his predecessor, Robert Fiske, in 
connection with the 1980s real estate venture known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons were partners with Mrs. McDougal and her late  
husband, James, in the venture. Both the McDougals were convicted 
and imprisoned as a result of the Starr investigation. James 
McDougal died in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Starr's evidence touching on the Clintons: a $27,600  
cashier's check from 1982 found in the trunk of an abandoned car 
and made payable to ``William Jefferson Clinton.'' A $5,081 check 
from Mrs. McDougal's account bearing the notation ``payoff 
Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett suggested the records raise questions of possible  
perjury by the president, who testified in 1996 that he never took 
out a loan from the savings and loan owned by Mrs. McDougal and her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton said `I never received a loan from''' the  
McDougals' failing savings and loan, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Barrett said, the $5,081 check had been partial payment  
of the $27,600 cashier's check, which was used to pay off a 
Whitewater debt. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third trial for Mrs. McDougal in three years. She  
was convicted of fraud charges brought by Starr in 1996 and 
sentenced to prison and more recently was acquitted in a California 
state trial of embezzlement. Her current trial is for refusing 
repeatedly to answer grand jury questions from Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was granted limited immunity by Starr in exchange  
for her testimony and still refused to give it, resulting in her 
being jailed for 18 months of civil contempt. Starr then decided 
that her refusal to testify was so egregious and entailed such 
important information that he proceeded with the current case of 
alleged criminal contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentioning the president and Mrs. Clinton 10 times during his  
35-minute opening statement, Barrett said that in the absence of 
Mrs. McDougal's testimony, ``the other two people who might know 
about these events ... reside in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett played an audio tape of Mrs. McDougal refusing to answer  
grand jury questions about billing records from Mrs. Clinton's 
former law firm in Little Rock and about Castle Grande, another 
McDougal land development. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Grande was riddled with fraud, according to federal  
regulators. It ended up costing the McDougals' federally insured 
savings and loan nearly $4 million. Mrs. Clinton is listed in the 
billing records as having performed work on Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett and grand jury court reporter Tammie Foreman read grand  
jury testimony from 1996 in which Mrs. McDougal refused to answer 
whether she discussed with Clinton a $300,000 federally backed loan 
or a land development called Lorance Heights and whether she 
believed Clinton testified truthfully at her Whitewater trial in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury testimony being introduced by Starr's office is a  
two-edged sword that could end up hurting prosecutors. It 
highlights Mrs. McDougal's protests that Starr was relying on 
testimony of convicted felon David Hale and Mrs. McDougal's 
ex-husband, who flip-flopped on his own testimony, implicating the 
Clintons in alleged wrongdoing while facing decades in prison for 
his crimes.

<HEADLINE> Bell Expects N.Y. Decision Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell Atlantic expects New York  
telecommunications regulators to decide soon whether the company 
has met a key test in its efforts to provide long-distance service 
to local phone customers in the state, Chairman Ivan Seidenberg 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Seidenberg said he expects New York regulators to  
decide whether Bell Atlantic's computer systems, which rival local 
phone companies depend on to sign up and bill new customers, have 
passed the ``stress test'' -- meaning its computers can process a 
heavy load of orders. 
</P>
<P>
	If the company passes that test, it's likely to win state  
regulatory approval for its long-distance application. Then Bell 
Atlantic will ask the Federal Communications Commission for 
permission to provide long-distance service in New York -- the last 
major regulatory hurdle to selling long-distance in New York, part 
of its local phone territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``After almost two years of effort, we're about to crack the  
code,'' Seidenberg told telecommunications and Internet analysts 
meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal policy-makers and analysts believe Bell Atlantic will be  
the first regional Bell telephone company to win Federal 
Communications Commission approval to provide long-distance service 
to some of its local phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has turned down previous long-distance applications by  
other Bell companies, saying they haven't sufficiently opened their 
local phone markets to rivals -- a condition for entering the 
long-distance field. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Seidenberg expressed interest in letting callers pay  
for calls to mobile phones just as they do regular phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the receiver of a mobile-phone call -- not  
the caller -- typically foots the bill. As a result, many Americans 
switch off their phones to avoid unwanted calls. In Europe and 
Asia, however, it's the caller who usually pays. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this one simple change, we could extend wireless to a  
whole new segment of the consumer marketplace,'' Seidenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard expressed support for the  
caller-pays approach, saying it would encourage people to make more 
calls from mobile phones. Some companies now provide some form of 
this.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900 for First Time / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average surged above  
9,900 for the first time today, buoyed by a rally in oil stocks and 
more evidence that the U.S. economy is growth at a non-inflationary 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
99.35 to 9,872.19, adding to its 79-point record-setting gain on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By 12:30 p.m. EST, the Dow was up 126.55 to 9,899.39. Moments  
later, the Dow topped 9,900 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose at midday, with the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index also hitting a new high. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up 2 1/2 at  
85 3/4, and Exxon, which rose 2 3/8 at 75 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also fueling today's rally was new data showing the U.S. economy  
is growing without any inflationary threats. Since there are no 
signs that the economy is overheating, investors believe that the 
Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to boost interest 
rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department said today that  
first-time claims for unemployment checks remained under 300,000 
for the sixth consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 410.23 million 
shares, up from 352.44 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.46 to 1,297.30 and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 20.39 to 2,426.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.69 at 611.17, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.88 at 721.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Valdez Spill Blame Explored Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Exxon Valdez skipper Joe Hazelwood is  
reiterating his belief that the 1989 accident that spilled 11 
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound was not his fault. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CBS' ``60 Minutes'' to air Sunday,  
Hazelwood blamed third mate Greg Cousins, who was on the bridge and 
failed to turn the tanker away from Bligh Reef despite orders to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood told CBS that he realizes the world views him ``as  
some drunken fool,'' but he denied being intoxicated on March 24, 
1989, when the tanker struck the reef several hours after leaving 
Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The skipper admitted that he had at least three vodkas earlier  
in the evening, but said his real mistake was to leave Cousins in 
charge as the tanker moved south out of the Valdez Arm and into the 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect and hindsight being 20/20, of course, I never  
would have left the bridge if I had any idea about what was going 
to happen,'' Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone number could not be found for Cousins. But during  
the 1994 civil trial against Exxon, which resulted in a $5 billion 
verdict against the company, Cousins testified that he wasn't sure 
why he failed to order the right turn that would have taken the 
900-foot tanker away from the reef. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been poor seamanship on my part, (or) lack of  
experience -- I don't know,'' Cousins said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood was in his cabin doing paperwork when Cousins called  
down to him warning of trouble. The ship hit the rocks a moment 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that moment I felt a shudder, and I got sick to my stomach,  
physically sick,'' Hazelwood recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cleared in 1990 of a charge of piloting the tanker while  
drunk, but was convicted of negligently discharging oil. He is to 
begin serving 1,000 hours of community service this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood, now working as a law clerk in New York City, is  
expected to travel to Anchorage to pick up trash along highways and 
clean up litter in parks as part of a 10-person work crew.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets C. American Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- President Clinton is offering promises of  
loan forgiveness, fairer immigration and freer trade at his meeting 
with seven Central American presidents. The United States, he says, 
is ready to draw ``a good road map for where we're going into the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That map -- a joint communique broadly pledging cooperation to  
improve human rights, tackle crime and drugs, and clean up the 
environment -- went through some 37 drafts shuffled among the eight 
nations on their way to this presidents' summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the U.S. delegation braced for some expressions of  
disappointment from its hosts, all convening in the shadow of three 
forested volcanoes ringing the colonial capital of Antigua. The 
summit marked the finale of Clinton's four-day tour of the region 
and its reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promised Central Americans that his visit would yield  
``specific commitments on the part of the United States so we know 
we have a good road map for where we're going into the future, and 
you know what you can expect of our partnership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salvadoran President-elect Francisco Flores echoed the gratitude  
of his regional counterparts when he told Clinton his travels 
through Central America had served to ``validate the process of 
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on trade, leaders here wanted better than Clinton offered in  
the Caribbean Basin Initiative he sent to Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the one-on-one meetings Clinton had with presidents as he  
stopped first in Nicaragua, then Honduras, El Salvador and now 
Guatemala, what most concerned his counterparts was attracting jobs 
and investment, said Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy 
Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they face now is a gigantic economic problem caused by  
the hurricane, with thousands of jobs decimated and the need for 
new capital and investment,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that the limited trade benefits Clinton has  
asked of Congress -- which fall far short of the latitude Mexico won 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement-- were the best 
Clinton could offer given the tricky politics of his own Democratic 
Party's resistance to knocking down trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had proposed what he thought was the best possible bill  
that had a reasonable chance of passage,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Clinton's mission on this trip has been to repair the  
image of an American colossus to the north that spent billions of 
dollars during the 1980s to finance Cold War-era battles against 
leftist insurgents in Central America. Clinton recalled it as a 
time that provoked ``bitter divisions about our role in your 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemalans harbor a deep resentment toward the United States  
over a 36-year civil war in which 200,000 Guatemalans died or 
disappeared. At a roundtable discussion with Guatemalan citizens on 
Wednesday, Clinton said any U.S. support given military forces or 
intelligence units that engaged in ``violent and widespread 
repression'' was wrong. ``And the United States must not repeat 
that mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another subject of great concern here, immigration, the  
president had only promises that his administration was working to 
rewrite regulations that would ease the standard by which illegal 
immigrants are granted legal status. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris  
Meissner said they were aiming for a ``more compassionate 
standard'' by which some 600,000 illegal Central Americans could 
become eligible for legal status. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new regulations are trying to get around an old law. And  
the administration has not committed to specific legislative 
changes -- a more direct route to the equitable immigration policy 
Clinton says he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvadoran lawmakers, particularly, pressed Clinton in his  
appearance Wednesday before their Legislative Assembly for a new, 
more lenient statute that takes into account the Mitch-related 
joblessness and despair that has driven Central Americans across 
the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the regulatory review was as far as the  
administration was willing to go for now. ``Once we see how far 
that goes and how close we've been able to come,'' then legislation 
would be considered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt relief is one area where Clinton has, perhaps, the greatest  
hope to deliver on his promises. The $956 million emergency aid 
package he sent to Congress includes substantial loan forgiveness -- 
about 90 percent for Nicaragua's debt, 67 percent for Honduras -- 
and a two-year moratorium on debt payments by all Central American 
nations.

<HEADLINE> Bid for Penguins Called 'Dubious' </HEADLINE>

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- An attorney for Penguins co-owner Roger Marino  
decribes himself as ``dubious'' about Mario Lemieux's bid for the 
bankrupt team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fear is that Mario does not have a realistic and  
confirmable plan at this time,'' Marino's attorney, Harry L. 
Manion, said Wednesday.

<P>
	Manion said Tuesday that Marino would step aside and let Lemieux  
buy the team unchallenged if Marino were repaid $5 million he lent 
the team and if Lemieux promised not to gut the roster to save 
money.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Favored for Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A familiar cast of characters will be  
back for Saturday's Florida Derby, and that's OK with trainer Carl 
Nafzger -- as long as the results are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's talking about a surprise, and I hope to heck there  
aren't any,'' said Nafzger, who trains Fountain of Youth winner 
Vicar, the 3-1 morning line favorite for the $750,000 Florida Derby 
at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 11 3-year-olds, including the impressive filly Three  
Ring, were entered Wednesday for the 1 1/8-mile race. Vicar, a winner 
in three of five career starts, will also be facing five others who 
challenged him in the Fountain of Youth, including the second, 
third and fourth-place finishers in Cat Thief, Certain and Grits'N 
Hard Toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taking another shot at Vicar will be Casanova Star (eighth)  
and Aly's Alley, who was ninth in his first start this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Marquard, breeder and owner of Aly's Alley, expects his  
colt to run much better in the Florida Derby, one of several major 
Kentucky Derby prep races around the country this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was too anxious after being off 3 1/2 months,'' said Marquard,  
who was delighted his colt drew the No. 11 post. ``He seems to do 
better from the outside, so we hope to give you all a pleasant 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aly's Alley left from the No. 13 post when he finished second in  
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Plesa, the trainer of Three Ring, was far from thrilled  
when his filly drew the No. 10 post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outside post certain doesn't enhance her chances,'' Plesa  
said. `I'll talk it over with owner Barry Schwartz and we'll decide 
whether we want her in the Florida Derby or scratch her from the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Three Ring is pulled out, she would run in the Bonnie Miss on  
March 16, the closing day at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	No filly has ever won the Florida Derby, first run in 1952.  
Three Ring, with four wins in seven career starts, is coming off a 
14 3/4-length romp in the Davona Dale on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, who will be ridden by Shane Sellers, won the Fountain of  
Youth by a neck over the D. Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief. The 
victory came after a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Holy 
Bull on Jan. 16, and it gave Nafzger a touch of Derby fever again. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger won the 1990 Kentucky Derby with Unbridled, who also won  
the Florida Derby. The winner of the Florida Derby has gone on to 
win the Kentucky Derby nine times, with Thunder Gulch the last to 
do it in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be happier with him'' Nafzger said of his Wild  
Again colt, who is owned by James Tafel. ``He just keeps getting 
better. I saw what I wanted to see in his last work. We wanted him 
to relax and listen to his rider. He's a pretty happy horse right 
now. I think we have something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby field, from the rail out, with jockeys and  
odds is: Valid Trefaire (Jose Santos, 15-1); Cat Thief (Pat Day, 
4-1); Certain (Kent Desormeaux, 6-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 10-1); 
Vicar (Sellers, 3-1); Casanova Star (Mike Smith, 20-1); Wondertross 
(8-1, Jerry Bailey); Grits'N Hard Toast (Robbie Davis, 8-1); First 
American (Jose Velez, 20-1); Three Ring (John Velazquez, 5-1); and 
Aly's Alley (Edgar Prado, 15-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby (ABC-TV, 5:43 p.m. EST post time) is one of  
several Derby preps at three tracks this weekend, with trainer Bob 
Baffert's brigade set to run in California and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Baffert sends out current Derby favorite Exploit  
and Prime Timber in the San Felipe at Santa Anita and the filly 
Silverbulletday in the Fair Grounds Oaks; on Sunday, he's got 
Answer Lively -- the 2-year-old champion -- and General Challenge in 
the Louisiana Derby and the filly Excellent Meeting in the Santa 
Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert nearly captured the Triple Crown the last two years,  
winning the Derby and Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997 and with 
Real Quiet in 1998.

<HEADLINE> DuPont To Expand Into Drug Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking to jump-start its drug business, DuPont  
Co. plans to form alliances with pharmaceutical firms later this 
year and offer a new class of its stock that will track the 
company's growing biotech and drug business. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont expects to make the new investment vehicle available in  
2000, pending shareholder approval, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each Dupont shareholder will receive one share the ``tracking  
stock'' for each DuPont share. Other key details of the move, which 
must get shareholder approval, have yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont officials said creating a separate stock is vital because  
its life sciences division -- which comprises pharmaceutical, 
biotechnology and agricultural businesses-- is so different from the 
rest of the chemical company, and offers investors the potential 
for considerably higher long-term value. The company can also use 
the new stock to help in acquiring new technologies and to recruit 
new talent. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment option is not a spinoff. Wilmington, Del.-based  
DuPont, formed in 1802, will remain one company, with one board of 
directors and one balance sheet. But DuPont will develop separate 
financial statements for the life sciences division. 
</P>
<P>
	``DuPont is one of the premier technology companies in the  
world,'' said Sano Shimoda, an analyst with BioScience Securities 
in Orinda, Calif. ``By raising the profile of life sciences, people 
will see the remaining company is undervalued and the entire 
company will benefit. They can have their cake and eat it too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont last year said it was shifting into the life sciences,  
which carries higher risk, but also better chance for faster growth 
and higher profits than the company's chemicals business. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, speculation has centered on Dupont buying  
Monsanto Co., a large life sciences company which failed in an 
effort to merge last year with drug maker American Home Products. 
Neither company would confirm the talks, but analysts Wednesday 
said an alliance between DuPont and Monsanto would make sense. 
Monsanto makes Celebrex, the new arthritis pain medication that is 
likely to be the hottest selling drug of 1999 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont life sciences business totaled $4.3 billion in sales last  
year, or less than 20 percent of the company's of total sales. 
</P>
<P>
	While investors cheered Wednesday's announcement, some cautioned  
that it may not be easy for Dupont to find a large drug company to 
partner with. 
</P>
<P>
	Dupont only has a small number of drugs on the market, including  
the HIV drug Sustiva and blood thinner Coumadin. And the company 
lacks a large drug sales force or other attributes to attract 
interest of a big drug company, said Alex Zisson, an analyst with 
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	Zisson notes that DuPont can offer cash and technological  
expertise. ``There is no reason why they cannot become a bigger 
player in the life sciences field,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By forming an alliance, Zisson said, the company will more  
quickly be able to participate more quickly in the growing 
worldwide demand for drugs than by working on its own. An outright 
purchase of a drug company could have threatened to dilute DuPont's 
earnings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its hard to be a niche player in the pharmaceutical industry  
today,'' said John Himes, a DuPont vice president. ``Its critical 
that a partner must have complimentary strengths and give us strong 
competitive advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said DuPont will look to expand in Europe and Asia and add  
products outside the company's focus on heart care, neurology and 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	While a growing number of drug companies have cooperated on  
specific products, such as Warner-Lambert Co. and Pfizer Inc. 
selling the cholesterol drug Lipitor, analysts say it is much 
tricker to pull off a broader alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dupont has firsthand knowledge with a big joint venture. Last  
year the company spent $2.6 billion to buy out its seven-year 
partnership with Merck Co., the world's largest drug company. The 
two firms had developed Sustiva and hypertension drug Cozaar. 
DuPont said buying out Merck's share would quicken its move into 
the life sciences.

<HEADLINE> Bill May Help Nursing Home Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nursing homes would be barred from evicting  
residents solely because they rely on Medicaid under legislation 
approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 398-12 on Wednesday, was prompted by an attempt  
by a major nursing home operator last year to remove residents who 
paid through Medicaid, the government health insurance program for 
the poor. Medicaid payment rates are generally lower than those of 
private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would prohibit nursing homes from expelling or  
transferring residents because of their payment status or the 
home's decision to withdraw from the Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and major senior citizen groups support the  
legislation, which has been approved by the Senate Finance 
Committee and is awaiting Senate floor action. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, nursing homes could still choose to leave the  
Medicaid program. However, they would be required to make clear to 
incoming residents that Medicaid payments were no longer acceptable 
and the facility could transfer new residents who initially pay 
with private funds but later become dependent on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients rely on Medicaid to  
help pay for their care, and with nursing home costs averaging 
$40,000 a year, about half of residents who begin by paying with 
their own money and health insurance must turn to Medicaid within 
three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  
Medicaid, estimates that 58 nursing homes a year are withdrawing 
from the program.

<HEADLINE> Little Hope for Missing Sightseers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- An FBI agent said Thursday that a missing  
woman and two teen-age girls likely met violent deaths soon after 
they disappeared on a trip to Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio, missing for more than three weeks, probably died the  
night they disappeared from the El Portal lodge where they were 
staying or very early the next morning, said agent James M. 
Maddock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel almost certain the women were the victims of a violent  
crime,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, of Eureka in northern California, her  
15-year-old daughter Julie, and Silvina Pelosso, a 16-year-old 
family friend from Cordoba, Argentina, were last seen on Feb. 15 at 
the Cedar Lodge, a restaurant and motel on Yosemite's rugged 
western border. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock refused to say what investigators said Wednesday that  
prompted Mrs. Sund's husband to say that evening that he was 
``devastated'' by the FBI's news. FBI officials had earlier said it 
was likely the three were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jens Sund apologized Thursday for the remark, saying reporters  
caught him at a low moment and that he has ``been on an emotional 
rollercoaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Carrington, Mrs. Sund's father, said that despite the  
FBI statement, the family continues to hold out hope the three 
women will be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe it. We think there's still a pretty good  
chance,'' he said, his voice choked with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents used all-terrain vehicles Thursday in a search  
around the rugged western border of the park. Volunteers assisting 
in the effort said they had been told to search for shallow graves.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. deficit in the broadest measure of  
trade surged to a record high of $233.4 billion last year as the 
global economic crisis resulted in the first drop in sales of 
American farm products and manufactured goods in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the deficit in the current  
account jumped by 50.4 percent from the 1997 imbalance of $155.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While the fourth quarter deficit narrowed a slight 2.9 percent  
to $63.8 billion, private economists viewed that as a temporary 
improvement and not a sign of a permanent turn for the better in 
America's trade fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Latta, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, said she  
expected the 1999 current account deficit to hit $286 billion, 
reflecting continued global economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a global economic slowdown with recessions in  
one-third of the globe and slowing growth in Europe. That means 
weak demand,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's deficit surpassed the old record of $168 billion in  
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1987 deficit was equal to 3.7 percent of the total  
economy, the 1998 imbalance was only 2.7 percent of a bigger U.S. 
economy. But if this year's deficit does climb to around $290 
billion, that would make it equal to 3.3 percent of the gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, bulging trade deficits would be a major political  
problem for the occupant of the White House. But the imbalances 
this time are occurring as domestic growth remained strong, pushing 
unemployment to the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republican Pat Buchanan, announcing his presidential  
candidacy earlier this month, pledged to fight against cheap 
imports and make sure that American workers ``are not here to serve 
the financiers of some new world order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current account is considered the best gauge of the  
country's international standing because it measures not only trade 
in goods and services, but also investment flows between countries 
and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures released Thursday showed a deterioration in most  
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of American goods fell by 1.2 percent to $671.1 billion  
last year, the first drop in this category since 1985. Two-thirds 
of the decline came from falling farm sales and the other one-third 
from a decline in sales of manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade surplus in services, such as airline fares, sales  
of insurance and consulting fees, fell to $78.9 billion last year, 
down from a surplus of $87.7 billion in 1997, reflecting primarily 
a drop in foreign tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit in investment income, the difference between what  
foreigners earn on their U.S. investments and what Americans earn 
abroad, rose to $22.5 billion, after a $5.3 billion deficit in 
investment earnings in 1997, the first red ink in this category on 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the mid-1980s, the United States was the world's largest  
creditor country, but as Americans have given billions of dollars 
to foreigners to pay for deficits in merchandise trade, the country 
is now the world's largest debtor nation. That means foreigners now 
have larger U.S. holdings and thus bigger investment earnings than 
Americans make on their overseas holdings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The deficit in America's broadest measure of  
trade shot up to an all-time high of $233.4 billion in 1998 as 
farmers and manufacturers were battered by the global economic 
crisis, resulting in the first drop in U.S. goods exports in 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the imbalance in the  
nation's current account swelled by 50.4 percent from last year's 
$155.2 billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring deficit occurred despite the fact that the current  
account deficit narrowed slightly in the final three months of the 
year, edging down to $63.8 billion from $65.7 billion in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts believe this slight improvement will be only  
temporary. They are forecasting another big increase in the current 
account deficit this year as recessions in Asia, Russia and now 
Latin America cut demand for farm and manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account is considered the best gauge of the  
country's international standing because it measures not only trade 
in goods and services, but also investment flows between countries 
and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>

the global financial crisis is having on certain sectors of the 
economy. Exports of American goods fell by 1.2 percent to $671.1

their U.S. travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit in investment income, the difference between what  
foreigners earn on their U.S. investments and what Americans earn 
abroad, rose to $22.5 billion, up sharply from a 1997 deficit of 
$5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth category of the current account, unilateral  
transfers, which covers foreign aid and pension payments to 
Americans living abroad, rose to $41.9 billion, up slightly from 
$39.7 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall current account deficit of $233.4 billion surpassed  
the old record of $168.0 billion set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is worried that record trade deficits  
will cause a backlash against its free trade policies. Already, the 
administration has bowed to pressures from the U.S. steel industry, 
expediting cases that charge foreign countries are selling steel in 
the United States at unfairly low prices.

<HEADLINE> Nets Get Marbury; Brandon to Wolves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Stephon Marbury was traded to the New Jersey  
Nets on Thursday in a nine-player deal involving the Minnesota 
Timberwolves and Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolves owner Glen Taylor said Marbury, who helped turn the  
Timberwolves into one of the most exciting teams in the West, moves 
to the Nets along with guards Chris Carr and Elliot Perry and 
forward Bill Curley. The Wolves get point guard Terrell Brandon 
from Milwaukee and forward Brian Evans and two draft choices from 
the Nets, including a first-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also send Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling to the Bucks,  
who also get Paul Grant from the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury told WFAN Radio in New York earlier Thursday he had been  
traded. Speaking from the West Coast, where the Wolves had a game 
against Golden State, Marbury said he planned to fly cross country 
and join the Nets for their game Friday at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, a Brooklyn native, said he was elated to be returning  
home, and would immediately sign a long-term extension with the 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sign tomorrow. It'll be signed tomorrow,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon also confirmed the trade in an interview with KFAN Radio  
in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. I think any player, anyone who's in any type of  
business enjoys being wanted,'' Brandon said. ``I'm excited about 
being a Timberwolf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are off to the worst start in the Eastern Conference at  
3-15, including five straight losses that have raised questions 
about coach John Calipari's job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West. At 12-6, they are two games behind Utah 
in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury's agent, David Falk, met with Taylor about 10 days ago  
to discuss Marbury's future, and Marbury turned down a six-year 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor then asked about the likelihood Marbury would sign after  
the season and was told he probably would not. So the Wolves, who 
lost Tom Gugliotta to Phoenix before the season began without 
compensation, decided to move Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were kind of forced into it,'' Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Wolves offered Marbury the maximum deal under  
the NBA's new labor contract, six years for $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't money,'' Taylor said. ``He grew up in the East and  
wants to play back by his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury has long expressed a desire to play for the New York  
Knicks, and it's clear he saw the Nets as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's New York, but it's not New York. It's New Jersey,'' he  
told WFAN. ``When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first 
thing they think is that's the other New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he was disappointed, but had no hard feelings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a great future. We liked him here, we  
invested a lot of time in him as a young player. (But) he's gone 
and we're very, very fortunate to land another outstanding guard in 
Terrell Brandon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell has played in only two games since spraining his ankle  
in the season opener. Gatling had asked to be traded, and Evans was 
showcased in heavy minutes Wednesday night in a loss to the Pacers.

	Clinton Kosovo Policy Passes House  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a contentious debate, the House voted  
bipartisan support for President Clinton's Kosovo policy on 
Thursday. The move turned back a GOP-led effort to oppose sending 
U.S. troops there as peacekeepers. Clinton had warned that such a 
restriction, even though nonbinding, could have jeopardized 
already-endangered peace talks due to resume in Paris on Monday. On 
a 237 to 178 vote, the House first turned aside a proposal by Rep. 
Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., to protest any American troop engagement in 
the war-torn Serbian province.

inflated stock prices than any possible Dow-10,000 computer snafus 
as the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with the five-digit 
milestone. A year ago some consultants warned that old software 
could read 10000 as 0000 and cause some computers to go haywire, or 
interpret it as a major crash and trigger automatic selling. But 
computer and industry experts say any glitches have been patched, 
and would have been largely irrelevant, anyway.

by drug traffickers, the State Department said Thursday. The

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both the House and Senate passed a bill  
Thursday that would give the nation's schools greater freedom in 
how they spend federal education money. The ``ed-flex'' bills would 
let states and school districts apply money for certain federal 
programs to other programs that serve their students best. For 
example, schools could use federal money meant for science and math 
teachers to boost reading instruction, if that's what they need.

economy. Hong Kong's blue-chip index led the way with an initial 
2.2 percent jump that left it flirting with its own benchmark: 
11,000 points. In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial

<HEADLINE> Md. Man Kills Wife at Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Minutes after a woman was granted a  
divorce, her former husband shot her to death and critically 
wounded her daughter in the courthouse parking lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuse Shing Liu, 49, went to his car Thursday, pulled out a  
shotgun and began firing wildly, witnesses and police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When his estranged wife, So Shan Chan, grabbed the shotgun, the  
suspect pulled out a handgun and shot both women, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, he just (fired) a good seven or eight shots, point blank,  
right into them,'' said Randy Hawes, who watched from his office 
window. The gunman continued firing at the women as they lay on the 
pavement, Hawes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies arrested the suspect without resistance and  
were preparing murder charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chan's daughter, Wing Sau Wu, 26, was in critical condition  
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard County police said Ms. Chan, 52, a seamstress who lived  
in Baltimore and spoke no English, had been separated from her 
husband, who owns a restaurant, since 1995. She had filed for 
divorce in July, saying her husband had assaulted her numerous 
times and threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	A clerk described Thursday's court hearing as calm. Circuit  
Judge Lenore Gelfman granted Ms. Chan a divorce and ordered her 
lawyer to draw up the proper papers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Adresses Scientist Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, addressing for the first  
time criticism of his administration's handing of an espionage 
investigation at a federal weapons lab, said Thursday U.S. 
officials ``moved quickly and decisively'' when the scope of the 
concerns became known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not ignore evidence. Quite the contrary, we acted on  
it. ... The record is clear we did respond in an appropriate way,'' 
Clinton said when asked about the national security controversy 
involving China during a stop in Guatemala during his Latin America 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Intelligence Committee was briefed Thursday on a still  
classified report by a special congressional panel concerning 
technology transfers to China. The report, according to committee 
lawmakers, is highly critical of security at federal weapons 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers and GOP presidential aspirants have  
accused the administration of not moving aggressively to 
investigate suspicions in 1996 that top-secret nuclear warhead 
information may have been given to China in the 1980s by an 
employee of the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week the Energy Department fired a Los Alamos  
computer scientist who has been under investigation by the FBI for 
nearly three years in connection with the concerns first raised in 
1995. The Taiwan-born scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged 
with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that when it was learned in 1997 that ``the scope  
of the potential espionage might be very broad and might be 
directly related to lax security at the energy labs ... we moved 
quickly and decisively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president added that congressional committees were informed  
along the way and ``have received at least 16 briefings on this 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some lawmakers have complained that they received detailed  
information about the Los Alamos investigation only relatively 
recently and not before a special committee of the House began 
closely looking into weapons lab security related to the China 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a better job could have been done,'' said Rep. Porter  
Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Commitee, when 
asked Thursday about the investigation. He declined for security 
reasons to say when he learned of the case or to provide any 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, said the case was taking  
on too much of partisan tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a knee jerk tendency to have a political response by  
some people,'' complained Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman 
of the special House committee that wrote the still-classified 
China technology report. Cox alluded to recent comments by Vice 
President Al Gore that the Los Alamos espionage occurred in a 
Republican administration. 
</P>
<P>
	As for security at federal labs, Cox said his panel's report  
will show ``there's a real problem, an ongoing problem. It's 
today's problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the  
special panel, said, ``I don't think anybody knew the magnitude of 
the problem until it got to the committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-page report remains top secret. Negotiations are  
underway between committee members and the White House on how much 
of it should be made public. Cox said he favors declassifying all 
of it except for parts that refer to sources or methods of 
intelligence gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	A part of the report deals with the Los Alamos investigation, he  
said. He said progress was being made with the administration on 
declassification, but that considerable disagreements remain.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton May Form Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, in another sign of her  
interest in the New York Senate seat, is considering forming an 
exploratory committee that would cover any costs of her 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of such a preliminary step has been discussed as a way  
to avoid any questions of impropriety in the raising and spending 
of money, a senior adviser said Thursday, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. The discussions are still preliminary and it is possible 
that she won't form a committee, even if she does seek the seat 
held by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the 
adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the talks reflect how seriously Mrs. Clinton is  
considering a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews this week, several friends and associates said the  
first lady appears more likely than ever to run for the Senate. One 
confidant said Mrs. Clinton was ``very inclined'' to make the race. 
The associates caution, however, that she does not plan to decide 
until late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Other advisers, including one who talked to her recently, say  
they're not convinced she will run. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Marsha Barry has advice for all Mrs. Clinton  
watchers: ``Everybody should just relax. She's not there yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Two supporters hope to get her there. Mrs. Clinton will meet  
separately at the White House on Friday with the state's top 
Democrat and the top Democrat in the New York Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver encouraged Mrs. Clinton to run  
when she called him last month to talk about the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope has been one of the main  
boosters of the Hillary-for-Senate craze. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan intends to announce  
her political plans sometime next week, and several Democrats said 
Thursday they expect her to challenge first-term GOP Sen. Spencer 
Abraham. Stabenow defeated a Republican incumbent to win her 
Lansing-area seat in 1996. She has run statewide before, losing 
both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Stabenow got encouraging polling data in recent weeks. Her way was 
further eased when former Gov. James Blanchard announced he would 
not enter the race for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	If Stabenow runs for the Senate, it would give Republicans a  
shot at taking back her House seat. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Al Gore hasn't earned the valued endorsement of New Hampshire  
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, but he's got the next best thing: her husband. 
Bill Shaheen, a lawyer and longtime political activist, has agreed 
to chair the vice president's New Hampshire presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will announce the appointment during a trip Monday to the  
first-in-the-nation primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has yet to endorse Gore or his rival, former New  
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, though the vice president's allies are 
confident she will side with their man. Her spokesman said Shaheen 
won't focus on the endorsement question until after the state's 
legislative session concludes in June. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, who ran for the Republican nomination in 1996 and  
has been working toward a 2000 campaign ever since, will soon make 
it official. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to Forbes say he will form a campaign committee  
with the Federal Election Commission next week. Within weeks, his 
first television ads will begin running in key states, the 
officials say 
</P>
<P>
	The businessman also is rounding out his campaign staff.  
Longtime aide Bill Dal Col will be his campaign manager, John 
McLaughlin will be his pollster and Paul Sanderson and Norm Cohen 
will be media consultants. Dal Cole, McLaughlin and Sanderson 
worked on Forbes' 1996 effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who will be in New Hampshire next week, is planning a  
campaign kickoff event for late spring. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle has a message for the rest of  
the GOP presidential field: Catch me if you can. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is lagging in polls that show Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush as the early favorite, Quayle says voters New Hampshire and 
Iowa will determine the true front-runner next year. He is steering 
his energy toward those two early-vote states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, the rest of them can try to catch me if they can,''  
Quayle said at a school in Indianapolis on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is touring Indiana for a series of fund-raisers and  
private campaign events, but he met with reporters to talk about 
his education reform agenda.

<HEADLINE> 5 Teens Escape Psychiatric Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Five teen-age boys facing charges  
ranging from robbery to attempted murder used a key to unlock a 
door and escape from a psychiatric hospital Thursday. Two were 
captured immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The five escaped from the Middle Tennessee Mental Health  
Institute at about 1:45 p.m., Superintendent Joseph Carobene said. 
Staffers ran after them and captured two. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three -- ages 15, 16 and 17 -- remained at large. Police  
searched the area around the hospital on foot and by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very dangerous,'' Nashville police spokesman Don  
Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe the escape was planned in advance because  
the boys were wearing warm clothing. It was unclear how they 
obtained the key. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital is located just off Interstate 40 and near Percy  
Priest Lake, on the east side of Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Trade Mack to Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies  
traded Sam Mack to his former team Thursday, sending the shooting 
guard to the Houston Rockets for second-year swingman Rodrick 
Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	In giving up Mack's offensive ability, which cooled off after a  
hot start to the season, the Grizzlies wanted Rhodes for his 
defensive play and athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we gave up some outside shooting with Sam, but he  
wasn't making very many shots lately. We think that at least what 
we've gotten is better defensively,'' said Grizzlies 
president-general manager Stu Jackson, noting Rhodes has played 
both guard spots, as well as small forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with Rodrick, it's one more step to adding some  
versatility to our lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Grizzlies' nine-game losing streak was not a  
factor in making the deal. He did admit he made the trade despite a 
desire to add more experience to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought about that, but at the same time we want to get  
more athletic and try to help our defensive presence,'' said 
Jackson. ``We'd like to get older and we will. I think the bottom 
line is that Rodrick Rhodes will help our basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was announced just prior to Thursday's NBA deadline  
and hours before the teams were to face each other in a game at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	After a solid start this season, in which he averaged 17.8  
points a game through eight games, Mack's production cooled off to 
where he was relegated to coming off the bench in Vancouver's last 
four outings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies acquired Mack, now in his fifth NBA season, from  
the Rockets just prior to the 1997-98 season in exchange for a 
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, selected 24th overall by the Rockets in the 1997 draft,  
played 58 games in his rookie season, averaging 5.8 points and 1.9 
assists. He missed the first 14 games of this season after 
undergoing arthroscipic surgery to repair a torn right pectoral 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Activated from the injured list on March 2, he has seen limited  
action in three of the Rockets' last five games, averaging just 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he failed in an attempt to swing another deal,  
trading away the Grizzlies first-round draft pick -- anticipated to 
be a lottery selection -- to bring in a starting center. He's been 
unhappy with Bryant ``Big Country' Reeves'' this season. Reeves 
showed up to camp about 40 pounds overweight and has put up 
substandard numbers, mostly coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact still remains that for us to be a good  
basketball team, Country needs to re-emerge. There's no other way 
to look at it, he's got to get better,'' said Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies also announced a roster move, placing center Tony  
Massenburg (sprained left wrist) on the injured list and activing 
rookie forward J.R. Henderson, who was out with knee tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> House To Debate US Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is moving ahead with debate on the  
possible deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo, despite appeals for a 
delay from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 1996 
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, a former Senate majority leader, and Albright cautioned  
that divisive congressional debate could undermine already-fragile 
chances of reaching agreement when peace talks resume Monday in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to throw cold water on a possible agreement you  
vote no,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was scheduled to vote today on whether to send 4,000  
U.S. troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping force, as 
President Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a solemn duty to have this vote,'' said House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate vote is expected as early as next week.  
</P>
<P>
	The House was considering a nonbinding resolution by House  
International Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., that asks 
members whether they believe U.S. troops should go to Kosovo to 
enforce a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many members of Congress have serious reservations about  
deploying our armed forces to Kosovo as peacekeepers. Others 
strongly support the president's policy,'' Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the resolution is nonbinding, ``It does mean something  
when Congress has passed a resolution,'' Dole told a House hearing 
Wednesday. At the president's request, Dole has served as a special 
U.S. envoy to the Albanian side in the Kosovo dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the upcoming peace talks between Kosovo's ethnic  
Albanians and Serbs, prospects seemed further dashed Wednesday when 
special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed to persuade Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to sign onto the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, speaking to the House International Relations Committee  
after reports that Holbrooke's mission had failed, said, ``Why 
should Milosevic sign it? The Albanians haven't signed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole went to the Balkans last weekend to persuade rival Albanian  
factions to sign onto the accord. He left without getting the 
consent of Kosovo's hard-line guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, earlier Wednesday, told a separate House hearing, ``A  
vote at any time to oppose an authorization would be taken by both 
sides as a green light to resume fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Milosevic's latest defiance seemed to build support in  
the GOP-led chamber for the administration position rather than 
diminishing it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who  
prosecuted the House impeachment case against Clinton, indicated he 
probably would support the administration this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers may be ``something  
we have to do,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I don't think we should deceive ourselves --  
that this is something we can get out of easily. People are going 
to get shot and some of those people are going to be our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman conceded that ``any political agreement to prevent  
further suffering in Kosovo will very likely require an 
international military force to ensure the implementation of the 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gilman also questioned the willingness of the rival factions  
to support such a pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Albright and Dole told Congress there was no way any peace  
accord could be reached at the bargaining table without the 
certainty that U.S. troops would be part of any peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he is ready to commit 4,000 U.S. troops to be  
part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo -- but 
only if a peace accord can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Serb positions if the  
Albanian side agrees and the Serbian side, led by Milosevic, 
declines.

<HEADLINE> Brooks Heading Back To MLB Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Garth Brooks is on his way back to spring  
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The country singer was to return to the San Diego Padres camp  
today after taking a few days off to be with his mother, Colleen 
Brooks, who underwent surgery Tuesday in Los Angeles to remove a 
cancerous spot from her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing fine. They feel like everything's great,'' Capitol  
Records spokesman Scott Stem said. ``She's going to accompany Garth 
to spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Brooks underwent surgery for throat cancer last year.  
Brooks, 37, left camp Saturday after tests during his mother's 
regular monthly checkup raised suspicions that cancer may have 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was invited to camp as a way for him to kick-start his  
Touch 'Em All Foundation. He has no chance of making the big-league 
roster, and would be sent to a minor-league team only if he showed 
he was competitive.

<HEADLINE> Young Racers Making Impact in Busch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- Some of the guys are barely old enough to  
vote. Still, they've already shown the future of NASCAR racing is 
in very good hands. 
</P>
<P>
	An abundance of young drivers -- from second-generation stars  
such as Dale Earnhardt Jr. to teen-agers like Casey Atwood -- are 
emerging in the Busch Grand National series, one step below the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very smart. And they are talented,'' said Randy  
LaJoie, a two-time Busch champion who gave ``two thumbs up'' to the 
latest batch of would-be stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Busch drivers are at Atlanta Motor Speedway for Saturday's  
Yellow Freight 300, a preliminary event for the Cracker Barrel 500 
Winston Cup race. The first round of qualifying was held Thursday 
at the 1.54-mile trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing I've seen about these guys compared to some of  
the ones in the past is they will ask questions,'' LaJoie, 37, said 
prior to qualifying. ``The last couple of years, we've had guys 
coming through here who thought they were smarter than the rest of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr., son of the seven-time Winston Cup champion, is  
the most prominent of the young guns, having won his first Busch 
title and more than $1.3 million a year ago at 24. He'll race in 
five Winston Cup races this year along with a regular Busch 
schedule in preparation for his move up in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But young Earnhardt is not the only famous name on the Busch  
circuit. There's a third-generation driver (Jason Jarrett, 23, son 
of Dale and grandson of Ned) and even a fourth (Adam Petty, 18, son 
of Kyle, grandson of Richard and great-grandon of Lee). 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go out and do the best you can,'' the teen-aged Petty  
said. ``It doesn't matter if your name is Smith or Jones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are several teen-agers Petty can hang out with in the  
garage, sharing stories about who got carded this week trying to 
get into the track. One of his best friends is 18-year-old Atwood, 
who became the youngest Busch driver in history last season when he 
took part in 13 races, winning two poles and more than $123,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We joke around the garage that the ages for me, Casey and  
(19-year-old) Kevin Grubb don't add up to Randy LaJoie,'' Adam 
Petty said grinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood won about a dozen Late Model Sportsman races at a track  
near his hometown of Nashville, Tenn., before even getting his 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who was only 22 when he debuted as a full-time  
driver on the Winston Cup circuit and has won three championships 
in his first six seasons, paved the way for the influx of young 
drivers, Atwood says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in young and did good,'' Atwood said. ``Now, you've  
got all the car owners going down to the local tracks looking for 
the young guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Busch series is one of the most unique proving grounds in  
sports. While technically a minor league, a number of Winston Cup 
regulars take part when the series stops at major tracks like 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't like it, but I do,'' Atwood said. ``I  
want to learn all I can. The more I get behind those guys and race 
with those guys, the better off I'll be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Winston Cup regulars tend to take away  
spots from the younger guys. At the last race in Las Vegas, 17 of 
the big-time drivers earned a spot in the Busch field, which 
knocked out drivers like 22-year-old Wayne Grubb, Kevin's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings about it,'' Wayne Grubb said. ``I like  
it in a way, but in Las Vegas we got swarned by 'em. Half the field 
was Winston Cup, and the rest of us had to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaJoie has even stronger feelings about the commingling of the  
two series. He feels the wealthier, more-experienced teams have an 
unfair advantage over most of their Busch counterparts, plus they 
take away positions from young drivers who need the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaquille O'Neal can't go back to college for the NCAA  
tournament,'' LaJoie said. ``Let us have our series back.''

<HEADLINE> World Cup Qualifying Draw Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The qualifying draw for the 2002  
World Cup will take place in Tokyo on Dec. 7, FIFA decided 
Thursday, with qualifying beginning the following March and running 
through Nov. 11, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament, with half the games in Japan and half in South  
Korea, is tentatively set for June 1-30, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to complaints by European federations who couldn't  
get enough tickets for their fans at last summer's tournament in 
France, FIFA president Sepp Blatter said the world governing body 
will take a greater role in ticketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter said Japanese and South Korean organizers could keep all  
proceeds from tickets for games in their nation. In addition, FIFA 
will give the Japanese and South Korean organizers $100 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter called for the local organizers to cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
	FIFA postponed a decision on the number of berths for Asian  
teams until the FIFA congress, scheduled for July 9 in Los Angeles. 
With Japan and South Korea getting automatic berths, Asia is upset 
just two spots in the 32-nation field will be available to other 
nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Football Confederation has said it will consider  
pulling its 40 nations out of the event entirely if it does not get 
what it wants. All four Asian teams failed to advance out of the 
first round last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA also said its first world club championship will take place  
next Jan. 5-14, probably in Brazil. FIFA executive committee member 
Lennart Johnansson, the president of the Union of European Football 
Associations, said it might be a one-time experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make a trial, but I doubt that there will be further  
tournaments,'' Johansson said, adding Europe probably would send 
the winner of this year's European Champions Cup or the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter would like to see the event take place at least every  
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, FIFA increased the roster limit for this summer's  
Confederations Cup from 18 to 20 and said clubs must release 
players to their national teams at least five days before the 
tournament, scheduled for July 24-Aug. 8 in Mexico City and 
Guadelajara. The United States plays Brazil, Germany and New 
Zealand in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, FIFA said it was establishing emergency medical plans,  
including a special communications network, for the World Youth 
Championship in Nigeria, which starts April 3. The Americans are 
grouped with England, Cameroon and Japan in the first round of that 
tournament, limited to players under 20.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved a  
resolution today warning Yasser Arafat against declaring a 
Palestinian state. The resolution calls on the Clinton 
administration to be stronger in its opposition to such a move and 
to make it clear to the Palestinian leader that such a state, with 
Jerusalem as its capital, would not be recognized by the United 
States.

<P>
	ANTIGUA, Guatemala (AP) -- President Clinton today declared a  
``springtime of renewal and rebuilding'' in Central America, a 
rebirth spawned by the tragedy of Hurricane Mitch but buoyed by a 
new solidarity between nations. At the opening of a summit with 
Central American presidents, Clinton repeated U.S. commitments to 
fighting drug trafficking, lowering trade barriers and implementing 
fairer immigration laws.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives of four multinational companies are  
urging Congress to overhaul U.S. international tax rules that they 
say put them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors. Robert 
Perlman, vice president of Intel Corp., told the Senate Finance 
Committee that if the California-based computer chip giant were 
founded today, he'd recommend locating the headquarters in the 
Cayman Islands for tax reasons.

	Lawyers To Reopen Au Pair Case  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Louise Woodward's lawyers say they want to review  
medical evidence in light of a new theory aired on ``60 Minutes'' 
that young Matthew Eappen may have been strangled by someone, not 
shaken to death by the former au pair. The attorneys said they 
don't know if the new theory is reliable, but they were glad that 
two doctors interviewed on the CBS program agreed 8-month-old 
Matthew did not die from shaken baby syndrome, as prosecutors 
contended.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge today threw out the murder convictions of  
a man who spent 17 years in prison and came within two days of 
execution before journalism students cast doubt on his conviction. 
``Thank God, I'm innocent of all charges. Thank God, I'm free,'' 
Anthony Porter said after today's court hearing. Judge Thomas 
Fitzgerald praised the work done by prosecutors, defense attorneys

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George Bush declared an emergency

	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Finance minister Oskar Lafontaine has  
resigned in an apparent power struggle with Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder over economic policy. Lafontaine also stepped down as

<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- In the biggest upheaval yet in Germany's  
fledgling government, the finance minister resigned Thursday over 
sharp differences with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on economic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of uneasy cooperation, left-leaning Finance  
Minister Oskar Lafontaine lost a power struggle to the 
business-friendly Schroeder, signaling a consolidation of the 
chancellor's power. Lafontaine also resigned as head of the ruling 
Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine was blamed for destabilizing the euro and the German  
economy with his left-leaning policies, and his resignation 
triggered a share surge in the euro's value to about $1.10, from 
$1.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said he would name successors for both posts on  
Friday, amid talk that he was eyeing the party post for himself. A 
leading candidate for the finance post is Hans Eichel, the outgoing 
governor of Hesse state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chancellor expressed regret at the resignation, which came  
as a surprise, and thanked Oskar Lafontaine for his work,'' 
Schroeder's spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said in a terse statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden resignation comes a day after Schroeder warned  
several ministers that their sometimes zealous policies and tax 
changes were alienating voters and industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's resignation followed media reports that Schroeder  
had blasted him at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday for alienating 
German industry with tax changes, and made a veiled threat to 
resign himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder singled Lafontaine out for making a ``strategic  
error'' in raising taxes on the energy industry just when Schroeder 
is trying to nudge it toward phasing out nuclear power, the 
Berliner Morgenpost and Die Welt reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In what Cabinet sources viewed as a resignation threat,  
Schroeder reportedly told the ministers there could come a point 
``when I can no longer bear the responsibility for such policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially in Britain, Lafontaine's campaign for common European  
measures to create jobs and harmonize taxes triggered resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the conservative tabloid The Sun ran a headline  
that asked, ``Is this the most dangerous man in Europe?'' with a 
front-page picture of Lafontaine, who was persistently criticized 
for calling on central bankers to lower their interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	His domestic tax reform triggered outrage in industry with its  
effort to make big companies pay for cuts in average earners' taxes 
-- an idea Lafontaine touted as a way to pump up consumer spending 
in a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	German opposition politicians welcomed the resignation as  
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lafontaine's one-dimensional demand policy failed because it  
blew public finances, created no jobs and damaged Germany as a 
place to do business,'' said party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt of the 
pro-business Free Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lafontaine's resignation is an admission that Schroeder's  
government has failed,'' said Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the main 
opposition Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine, 55, led the Social Democrats to a stunning revival  
after taking over in 1995 at a low point in its political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	After ending party infighting, he reluctantly set aside his own  
ambitions for the chancellery in favor of the more popular 
Schroeder -- setting the stage for a simmering rivalry that 
continued after the Social Democrats' election victory last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences, Lafontaine was critical in uniting  
the party behind Schroeder, viewed suspiciously by the party's left 
wing. The combination of Schroeder's popularity and Lafontaine's 
loyal party following helped the Social Democrats push the 
Christian Democrats out of office after 16 years in power. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lafontaine's resignation, there was speculation that  
Schroeder could take over the party and increase his often shaky 
authority in the coalition government with the environmentalist 
Greens. 
</P>
<P>
	It the second big defeat of Lafontaine's political career. In  
1990, he was trounced in Germany's first post-unity elections by 
incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl after voicing skepticism about 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990 campaign, Lafontaine survived an assassination  
attempt by a deranged woman who stabbed him. He recovered to resume 
campaigning.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Early on, Ian Barbour was in the thick of it.  
After World War II, in his mid-20s, he became a teaching assistant 
to nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi. The debate in the lab and 
beyond: ``Should we build a hydrogen bomb?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced that science was raising more questions than it could  
answer, Barbour completed his Ph.D. in physics at the University of 
Chicago and enrolled in Yale Divinity School. What he found was 
that, just as few scientists knew much about religion, few 
theologians delved deeply into science. ``I had to put together the 
pieces myself,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, he accepted an unusual appointment to teach in  
both the physics and religion departments at Carleton College in 
Northfield, Minn., where he is now a professor emeritus. His 1965 
book, ``Issues in Science and Religion,'' helped launch the current 
debate on how scientists and religious thinkers should explore 
questions of mutual concern -- from the theological implications of 
evolution to the ethics of technology. 
</P>
<P>
	This week Barbour, 75, won the $1.24 million Templeton Prize for  
Progress in Religion for a lifetime of work. 
</P>
<P>
	He said when he started in the field there were two main ways of  
looking at science and religion. First, they could be seen as 
fields in conflict, as epitomized by the evolution versus 
creationism debate. Secondly, they can be seen as separate realms, 
in which scientists focus on natural phenomena and theologians 
address questions of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	But a more promising approach, Barbour believes, is dialogue  
that allows theologians to rethink their concepts of God in the 
light of science without abandoning the teachings central to their 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take the Bible seriously without taking it literally,''  
says Barbour, a member of the United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks at an award ceremony Wednesday, and in an  
interview at his hotel the day before, Barbour talked about 
concepts addressed in his work. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On the Big Bang Theory:  
</P>
<P>
	``The Big Bang fits with traditional (Christian) ideas quite  
well. This is the universe we might expect if we have a personal 
God interested in conscious personal beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- On evolution:  
</P>
<P>
	``Evolution is a more far-reaching concept. It tells us more  
about human nature in terms of relatedness to other creatures (and) 
the importance of genetics in terms of what is similar and 
different about human culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through most of Western history, it was assumed that God  
created living things all at once in their present forms. It was 
viewed as a completed world in which a transcendent God could still 
intervene occasionally from the outside. Now we know that ... 
evolution is God's way of creating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- On death:  
</P>
<P>
	``You simply can't any longer say as traditional Christians that  
death was God's punishment for sin. Death was around long before 
human beings. Death is a necessary aspect of an evolutionary world 
... One generation has to die for new generations to come into 
being. In a way, it is a more satisfying ... than to see it as a 
sort of arbitrary punishment that God imposed on our primeval 
paradise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- On revelation:

<P>
	``In the Bible it is the Holy Spirit which represents God's  
presence within the world ... It may be possible to use concepts 
derived from science to provide new models of God's relation to the 
world. The communication of information is an important concept in 
many fields of science, from DNA to computer networks ... God's 
action in the world can be thought of as the communication of 
information. ...We can even see a parallel in the opening verse of 
John's Gospel: `In the beginning was the word.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	-- On the environment:  
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of human dominion (in Genesis) has sometimes been  
used to justify unlimited exploitation of the natural world. But 
there are other neglected Biblical themes that provide support for 
environmental concern. Stewardship is called for since `the earth 
is the Lord's,' and we are accountable for our treatment of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all scientists like Barbour's mix of the scientific and the  
sacred. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Jay Gould, in his new book, ``Rocks of Ages: Science and  
Religion in the Fullness of Life,'' dismisses as fallacy any 
assertion that ``the facts of science reinforce and validate the 
precepts of religion, and ... God shows his hand (and mind) in the 
workings of nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has not read Gould's book, Barbour criticized earlier  
writings by the Harvard zoologist that he says keep science and 
religion ``in watertight compartments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty years after contemplating the hydrogen bomb, Barbour is  
writing about such ethical issues as cloning, which he believes 
need to be examined by a range of thinkers, including those who 
look to the Bible for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bible doesn't say, `Thou shalt,' or `shalt not clone,' ''  
Barbour says. But it offers valuable lessons about human dignity 
that are crucial to the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't,'' says the physicist, ``leave it to the  
scientists.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Set for `Painful' Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Describing next week's IOC meeting as the most  
important of his presidency, Juan Antonio Samaranch has told 
members they must take ``painful'' decisions to clean up after the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to all International Olympic Committee members,  
Samaranch also said the organization needs to make ``structural 
changes'' to restore its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called an extraordinary IOC general assembly next  
Wednesday and Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to deal with the 
worst crisis in the organization's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The session will vote on the expulsions of at least five members  
in connection with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members have already resigned.  
</P>
<P>
	The assembly will also vote on a series of reform measures,  
including an overhaul of the bidding and site-selection process for 
the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Samaranch's letter, dated March 9, was obtained by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must confess that I consider the coming extraordinary  
session one of the most important in our history, and the most 
important of my presidency,'' said Samaranch, who has been in power 
since 1980. ``Our duty requires that we take concrete decisions, in 
some cases painful ones, for the whole world will be observing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and Samaranch have come under severe attack from outside  
critics following revelations of cash payments and other improper 
inducements received by IOC members from Salt Lake and other bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must defend our organization, and the Olympic Games,  
through our future actions,'' Samaranch said. ``We must also defend 
the honor and integrity of our members ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the support of international federations and national  
Olympic committees, Samaranch said, ``I am convinced that ... we 
will succeed in bringing about the structural changes that are 
necessary for us to be able to move toward the third millennium 
with confidence and determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am counting on you all to contribute ... to defining a new  
policy for the IOC, in a spirit of renewed unity,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also told members the conclusion of the IOC's  
investigation into the Salt Lake scandal has been delayed and won't 
go before the executive board until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the best efforts and sacrifices of the commission  
members, the report has not yet been finalized,'' he said. ``It 
appears that it will take longer to conclude than was originally 
planned. As soon as it is complete, it will be submitted to the 
executive board for its meeting on 15th March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members resigned or were ousted in the first phase of the  
inquiry that concluded in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the IOC inquiry panel has been looking into 19 other  
cases -- three holdovers from the first phase, plus 16 additional 
names cited in a Salt Lake ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one more member is expected to be expelled in the  
latest phase, while the bulk of the others are expected to be 
exonerated or receive warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, an IOC member since 1987,  
will be ousted under the recommendation of the six-man panel, 
Olympic sources familiar with the case have told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork was named in a Utah ethics report last month that said  
his wife, Julia, borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief Tom 
Welch ``to help a friend in a serious situation.'' The report said 
the money, withdrawn by Welch from his children's' trust fund, was 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those still under investigation from the first phase is  
South Korean executive board member Kim Un-yong, the highest 
ranking IOC delegate implicated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim faces allegations that he used Olympic connections to help  
secure lucrative jobs for his children in broadcasting and 
entertainment. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--A former organizer at the heart of the Salt Lake Olympic  
bribery scandal says the senior U.S. official of the games knew 
about the vote-buying scheme. Dave Johnson, who was senior vice 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and long involved 
in the city's Olympic campaign, told The New York Times that he 
discussed ``everything'' about the program with IOC member Anita 
DeFrantz. DeFrantz, now an IOC vice president, denied Johnson's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC leader Mitt Romney announced a hiring freeze, reductions  
in staff travel and other cuts to save $14 million. He also 
highlighted $84 million worth of expenses -- including extra 
furniture, decorations, and a planned memorial plaza -- that are not 
crucial to the games and should be contingent on revenue.

<HEADLINE> Body of Marine Pilot Found Near Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A search team on Thursday found the  
body of a Marine Corps pilot near the wreckage of his jet, which 
crashed a day earlier in the Alaska Range, Air Force officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was identified as Maj. Timothy M. Curry, 35, of  
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	His F/A-18C Hornet fighter jet crashed Wednesday night north of  
12,300-foot Mount Deborah, about 80 miles south of Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was assigned to the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron at the  
Marine Corps Air Station at Iwakuni, Japan. He was in Alaska to 
participate in a training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter lifted the search team to examine the wreckage at  
an elevation of 6,800 feet. The search had been hampered by heavy 
snow, wind and low-lying clouds, Air Force Sgt. Angel Newman said 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was participating in Northern Edge, a joint military  
training exercise, when his plane was reported missing at Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet was one of two flying from Eielson Air Force Base near  
Fairbanks. The other jet returned safely to Eielson.

<HEADLINE> GOP Prepares for Budget Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Outdealt before at budget poker, House and  
Senate Republicans are trying to settle on spending, surplus and 
tax terms to set their hand for showdowns with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Their leaders gained agreement on a first-step budget plan, as  
an outline, details to come later in appropriations bills. Plus a 
tax cut short of what they had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	To get this far, they are settling for a tax cut of at least $15  
billion and perhaps $25 billion going into the 2000 presidential 
campaign year, with a promise of far more generous ones to come 
later. All that is subject, of course, to terms Clinton will sign 
into law. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, they are yielding points now, compromising with  
themselves -- to the dismay of some conservatives -- rather than risk 
the disarray that worked to Clinton's advantage last time. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 2000 budget, effective next Oct. 1, this is all going to  
have to be done within spending ceilings that will force cuts from 
current levels, unless Congress and Clinton agree to lift the 
limits to avoid the squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
	They managed it in 1998 on the legislative pretext that an extra  
$21 billion in spending, some Clinton's, some for congressional 
wants, was for emergencies and therefore not subject to the limits, 
or caps, in budget talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Those caps were set in the 1997 budget agreement, and to comply  
with them this year, spending subject to annual appropriations -- a 
bit less than one-third of the overall budget -- cannot exceed $536 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans said their budget plan will stay within that  
limit. But they want $16 billion in defense spending increases, 
which would force sharp reductions in domestic programs Clinton 
will defend, up to and including appropriations vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Republicans, the spending Clinton wants would  
exceed the caps by about $33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	His budget proposed an array of tax measures to pay for new  
spending, almost all of them repeat requests for tax changes the 
Republican Congress has rejected before and almost certainly will 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP comeback is that Clinton proposed financing he cannot  
get for spending that would cut into the budget surplus and the 
Social Security trust fund behind it. In the government's way of 
keeping the books, surplus Social Security taxes account for the 
black budget ink until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Republican plan, surpluses generated by Social  
Security taxes could not be used for anything else. That is an 
attempt to outdo Clinton on an issue he preempted in 1998 by 
declaring that none of the surplus should be spent until the 
financing of Social Security is overhauled and guaranteed through 
the mid-21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave him leverage against Republican tax cut plans because  
they hardly could say no. Clinton now has repeated that with more 
detail: He wants 62 percent of surpluses through 2014 used for 
Social Security, 15 percent for Medicare, and the rest for other 
programs, including increased defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Republicans are trying to outdo him with a budget plan  
they say would lock up the Social Security trust fund instead of 
continuing to use it as a sort of bank for borrowing to cover other 
government spending, as both GOP and Democratic administrations 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate budget committees are to act on the plan  
next week, and GOP leaders hope to get the budget resolution 
enacted within the month. That is supposed to be done by April 1; 
last year it was not done at all, the first time in 24 years 
Congress had failed to adopt its own budget. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not go to Clinton and it is not binding; it is a  
blueprint to be filled in with appropriations and tax legislation. 
That did not get done last year, either. Only one of 13 
appropriations bills passed before the Sept. 30 deadline, only 
eight ever were enacted. Instead, the budget was bargained into a 
single gigantic money bill. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans divided, Democrats resisting program cuts and  
Clinton vetoing spending bills short of what he demanded, the 
impasse worked in his favor. He blamed it on the Republicans, 
accused them of failing the most basic responsibility that goes 
with control of Congress, and held out the threat of government 
shutdowns unless they settled. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been there before, in 1995, when there were shutdowns  
for lack of appropriations and the whole mess backfired on 
Republicans. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Funeral To Be Quiet Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Across the street, in Washington Square,  
scaffolding was built for TV cameras, and barriers were set up to 
block access to Sts. Peter and Paul Church for Joe DiMaggio's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	In the church, where DiMaggio received his first communion and  
married his first wife, there was a feeling of serenity. And that's 
exactly the atmosphere the Yankee Clipper requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, whose twin steeples tower over the North Beach  
neighborhood in which DiMaggio spent most of his childhood, was to 
be closed to the public today as Father Armand Oliveri led the 
service for DiMaggio, who died Monday at his Florida home at the 
age of 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri, 79, who had known DiMaggio since the two grew up  
together in North Beach, said the service was a regular funeral 
Mass, including Psalm 23 as well as readings from both the Old and 
New Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominick DiMaggio, Joe's younger brother and a fellow major  
leaguer, was to give the eulogy. Oliveri said there would only be 
about 40 people attending the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they wanted it to be family, and that was about  
it,'' Oliveri said. ``Perhaps some close friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ornate church, dark and solemn despite the light filtering  
through its stained-glass windows, has been visited by President 
Lyndon Johnson and Vice President Walter Mondale. It also was the 
site of funeral services for former San Francisco Mayor Joseph 
Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications at the church entrance Wednesday that  
a dignitary was about to be eulogized there. There was no mention 
of DiMaggio on a bulletin board announcing the times for Masses in 
English, Italian and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside Sts. Peter and Paul, secretary Aurora Piazza leafed  
through a church book to a two-page spread of DiMaggio and actress 
Dorothy Arnold from their wedding on Nov. 19, 1939. Piazza, who 
grew up in North Beach, waited outside the church on that autumn 
day 60 years ago to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi, who will be joined by two singers for  
the funeral service, was preparing ``Amazing Grace'' and Schubert's 
``Ave Maria'' among five musical works requested by the DiMaggio 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's estranged son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., was to be  
one of the pallbearers carrying the casket from the church after 
the service. The funeral procession was set to pass DiMaggio's 
former home on Beach Street on its way to Holy Cross Cemetery in 
nearly Colma. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jr., who had not talked with his dad in two years, was  
DiMaggio's only child. His mother was Dorothy Arnold, whom DiMaggio 
divorced in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in 1954 and they 
divorced later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone disputed that Steinbrenner wasn't  
invited, saying the Yankees owner was asked to accompany the family 
to the West Coast. Cerrone said Steinbrenner declined the 
invitation because he didn't want an exception to the guest list 
made in his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was one more person outside the family to be there,  
Joe would have wanted George Steinbrenner,'' Engelberg said 
Wednesday. ``He really loved George, and said he was one of the 
most humane people he knew. I agree. But the family had to say, and 
reluctantly so, no one else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years, 
and Engelberg.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble Earnings Up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
rose almost 82 percent from a year ago, boosted by a big gain from 
German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG's purchase of a 50 percent 
stake in barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company said Thursday that it earned $106  
million, or $1.47 a share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 
compared with $58.3 million, or 81 cents a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $1.03 billion, up from $968.53 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results included a gain of 52 cents a share from the  
Bertelsmann deal. The 1997 results included a charge of 17 cents a 
share for early extinguishment of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the gain from the Bertelsmann deal, but including a  
loss of 12 cents a share from barnesandnoble.com, Barnes &AMP; Noble 
earned 95 cents a share in the fourth quarter, meeting Wall Street 
analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer had warned Wall Street last month that its profits  
wouldn't meet expectations. The good news pushed Barnes &AMP; Noble 
stock up $3.37 1/2, or 12 percent, to $30.50 Thursday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Barnes &AMP; Noble earned $92.4 million, or $1.29 a  
share, compared with $53.2 million, or 76 cents a share, in 1997. 
Sales were $3 billion, up from $2.80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble said its superstore sales rose 12 percent to $2.5  
billion last year and contributed 84 percent to total retail sales 
in 1998. Sales at stores open at least a year -- also known as 
same-store sales -- rose 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-store sales at its B. Dalton stores, which are smaller and  
usually found in malls, declined 1.4 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at barnesandnoble.com climbed 381 percent last year to  
$70.2 million. While its sales were better than expected, it still 
lagged behind the $609 million in sales at No. 1 online bookseller 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble is awaiting approval from the Federal Trade  
Commission on its $600 million bid for Ingram Book Group, the 
largest U.S. book distributor to retailers. That deal would allow 
Barnes &AMP; Noble to deliver books faster and more cost-effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Jan. 30, the company operated 521 Barnes &AMP; Noble stores  
and 484 B. Dalton bookstores. During 1998, 50 Barnes &AMP; Noble stores 
were opened and 13 were closed, of which 11 were relocated. B. 
Dalton opened four stores and closed 43 stores.

<HEADLINE> Md. Man Kills Wife at Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Minutes after a woman was granted a  
divorce, her estranged husband shot her to death and critically 
wounded her daughter in the courthouse parking lot Thursday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old suspect, Tuse Shing Liu, went to his car, pulled  
out a shotgun and began firing wildly, witnesses and police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When his estranged wife, So Shan Chan, grabbed the shotgun, the  
suspect pulled out a handgun and shot both women, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, he just (fired) a good seven or eight shots, point blank,  
right into them,'' said Randy Hawes, who watched from his office 
window. The gunman continued firing at the women as they lay on the 
pavement, Hawes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies arrested the suspect without resistance and  
were preparing murder charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard County police said Ms. Chan, 52, a seamstress who lived  
in Baltimore and spoke no English, had been separated from her 
husband, who owns a restaurant, since 1995. She had filed for 
divorce in July, saying her husband had assaulted her numerous 
times and threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	A clerk described Thursday's court hearing as calm. Circuit  
Judge Lenore Gelfman granted Ms. Chan a divorce and ordered her 
lawyer to draw up the proper papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chan's daughter, Wing Sau Wu, 26, was in critical condition  
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Child Freed in Wyoming Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAWLINS, Wyo. (AP) -- A father who says he is heavily armed  
released one of his four children in a standoff that dragged into 
its fourth day today. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric DeMillard freed his 2-year-old daughter Wednesday night  
after police assured him she would not be placed in a foster home. 
But he refused to release any of his three sons, one of whom he has 
been convicted of beating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really perked up morale,'' Police Chief Tony Rose said.  
``Everybody is ecstatic about getting the little girl out. 
Typically, when they give up one thing, usually the rest will come 
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeMillard, 42, grabbed hold of his children Sunday at the home  
of his estranged wife, Novetta, who called police and fled. The two 
are separated and battling for custody of the sons, ages 9, 8 and 
6, and the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not threatened the children or fired any shots but he  
claims to have a rifle and several handguns, said police in this 
community 120 miles west of Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a judge revoked DeMillard's visitation and telephone  
rights, saying supervision was ``not sufficient'' to protect the 
children during their father's visits. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have cut off the house's cable television, water and  
electricity. Bottled water was being left on the front porch. 
DeMillard has been using the fireplace to heat the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said two of the children tried to run to their mother when  
they saw her Wednesday, but DeMillard pulled them back and stripped 
them down to their underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, DeMillard pleaded guilty to third-degree assault  
against his 8-year-old son and was sentenced to community service. 
He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation, complete a 
parenting class and have no contact with his son.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Has Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- The last five months prepared the New  
York Yankees for the jolting news that Joe Torre has prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre delivered that report Wednesday before leaving the  
Yankees, a team that has been shadowed by death and disease since 
he took over as manager three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're Yankees. We can deal with this better than anyone  
else,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said. ``We have with Joe 
DiMaggio's passing, Darryl Strawberry's cancer and we will now. Joe 
Torre will come out of this as a champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team believes doctors caught the disease in its early  
stages, and Steinbrenner said Wednesday's test results are 
encouraging. He said Torre could be back in three weeks -- in time 
for the season opener April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Torre's condition came two days after DiMaggio died of  
complications from lung-cancer surgery and on the same day 
Strawberry returned to the lineup for the first time since 
undergoing colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what Darryl went through last year, we just have to be  
ready for something like this,'' Tino Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, former Yankees star Catfish Hunter appeared at  
the team's camp too weak to shake hands because of Lou Gehrig's 
Disease. In 1996, when Torre became the Yankees' manager, his 
brother Rocco died, and his brother Frank had a heart transplant 
during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what Torre's course of treatment  
will be or where he will be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, and I am looking forward to taking care of this  
problem and getting back to work,'' said the 58-year-old manager, 
who spent the day at his spring home in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will rotate managers while Torre is out. Hitting  
coach Chris Chambliss managed the split squad game Wednesday in 
Fort Myers against the Red Sox, and Stump Merrill, who managed the 
Yankees in 1990-91 and is now a special assistant to general 
manager Brian Cashman, handled the team's game in Bradenton against 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-base coach Willie Randolph and pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre also will share the managing duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is upbeat,'' Stottlemyre said after visiting Torre.  
``Naturally I'm very concerned. He's our leader. He's a manager as 
well as a very good friend. Any time a friend has a problem, you're 
really concerned. I've got my fingers crossed and everything else 
crossed that everything will be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who convinced Torre to let him return Wednesday -- a  
week earlier than expected -- said the team was ``devastated'' by 
the news, which dampened his return to the Yankees lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really couldn't get as motivated as I would have been,''  
Strawberry said after going 1-for-4 against the Red Sox. ``No one 
wants to see someone else face this particular battle. It is a 
difficult battle for anybody. We all have to realize that until 
there is a cure for cancer there are no guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre met with his coaches and then individually with veterans  
Joe Girardi, Paul O'Neill and David Cone on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi informed the Yankees who went to Fort Myers in a brief  
closed-door meeting two hours before the game. O'Neill told the 
group of players in Bradenton, while Cone told those who stayed in 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing to understand is why,'' Girardi said. ``The  
first thing that went through my mind is what's next. You see 
Darryl coming back and then you hear Joe has cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about one in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited, because many men in the same 
family have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre is the third prominent person in baseball to be diagnosed  
with cancer this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga was diagnosed with a  
cancerous tumor in his lower back and is undergoing chemotherapy. 
He will miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, a former Yankees  
prospect, was diagnosed last month with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``As players, we're not immune to what everyone else has to  
face,'' said Scott Brosius, whose father was diagnosed with colon 
cancer last year. ``A lot of people go through this. It definitely 
gets you when it hits this close to home. Our thoughts and prayers 
are with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marv Levy, the former coach of the Buffalo Bills, underwent  
surgery for prostate cancer during the 1995 NFL season and, at 70, 
was back coaching within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is taking the correct steps,'' Levy said. ``It is a  
disease that, when diagnosed early and treated aggressively, is 
highly curable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has a 302-184 record and has won two World Series  
championships in his first three years as Yankees manager. Last 
year, Torre led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 wins and swept San 
Diego in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who signed a two-year contract extension last month,  
joined Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk as the only managers to lead 
the Yankees to the postseason in their first three years.

<HEADLINE> Group To Finance Marcos Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private U.S. foundation promised Thursday to  
contribute $15,000 to publish a children's book written by Mexican 
guerrilla leader Subcomandante Marcos, making up for a $7,500 grant 
withdrawn this week by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like any kind of political censorship,'' said J.  
Patrick Lennan, head of a foundation in Santa Fe, N.M., named for 
his late father, a Chicago executive. ``And this smacks of 
political censorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's chairman, William J. Ivey, canceled the federal award  
for Cincos Puntos Press of El Paso, Texas, after a reporter noted 
the Mexican revolutionary was the book's author. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivey said he acted because some of the money might have reached  
Marcos, who has battled the Mexican government since he led an 
uprising five years ago in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennan said the foundation had helped the family publisher  
before in putting out a book. 
</P>
<P>
	He also mentioned the group's $35,000 support a decade ago of  
homoerotic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe, after a Mapplethorpe show 
was canceled by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. The 
Corcoran had received some of the money for the show from the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennan's foundation may buy and distribute some of the books.  
The publisher says its already has sent to a distributor some of 
the 5,000 copies printed and expect that publicity will create more 
orders from booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``The Story of Colors,'' is a tale about the Mayan  
gods still revered by many in Chiapas, an area known for its Mayan 
ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was first published in Spanish by a Mexican press  
without any help from the U.S. federal agency. The U.S. grant would 
have helped print and distribute an English vesion. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. edition includes a photo inside the front flap of  
Marcos in his signature black ski mask, with an ammunition belt 
across his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman at the Mexican embassy in Washington, Jose Antonio  
Zabalgoitia, said the embassy agreed with Ivey's decision to cancel 
the grant.

<HEADLINE> Marijuana Packed in Hot Peppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRAFFORD, Mo. (AP) -- A truck that pulled into a highway  
weighing station tipped the scales with more than 7,000 pounds of 
marijuana packed in with hot peppers in the biggest drug haul ever 
in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, whose name was not released, was arrested for  
investigation of interstate transportation of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 81 cases of marijuana valued at about $7.5 million, along  
with several hundred cases of hot peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver was believed to have picked up the load in Texas and  
was thought to be heading for Chicago. Workers at the station on 
Interstate 44 called authorities on Wednesday because of 
discrepancies in his paperwork.

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Hosts Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The past three years, Utah's last game has  
been a loss to Kentucky in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	It could happen again.  
</P>
<P>
	The two teams that played for the 1998 national title are in the  
NCAA Midwest Regional at New Orleans and only two wins away from a 
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you know the next two teams are going to forfeit, that  
is almost a moot point,'' Utah coach Rick Majerus said Thursday. 
``We expect all of the problems in the world with Arkansas State. 
It's hypothetical ... my attention is not beyond tomorrow's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there is the potential for another Utah-Kentucky  
postseason matchup in the round of 16, first is the possible 
matchup between the two winningest teams of the 1990s -- Kentucky 
and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to be a strong region with a lot of big-name teams,''  
Kentucky coach Tubby Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	But before any of those are possibilities, Kansas, defending  
national champion Kentucky and Utah have to get through their 
first-round games. All are favored. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-seeded Utah (27-4), which has won 22 straight games while  
becoming the first Big West Conference team to sweep through the 
regular season and league tournament undefeated, plays the opener 
Friday against Arkansas State (18-11). 
</P>
<P>
	In the other first-round games at the Superdome, Kansas (22-9)  
plays Evansville (23-9); Kentucky (25-8) meets New Mexico State 
(17-11) and Washington (17-11) faces Miami, Ohio (22-7). 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas State, the Sun Belt Conference tournament champion,  
enters its first NCAA tournament seemingly recovered for a rash of 
injuries to its post players. The Indians have won seven of their 
last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	With four 6-foot-7 or taller players fighting injuries, the  
Indians were forced, during one stretch, to use several lineups 
with 6-4 players and shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more focused now, we got Eric (Beatty, a 6-8 senior)  
back and that gets our team chemistry back,'' guard Antonio Harvey 
said. ``The key is rebounding. If we rebound well, we can beat 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty missed about four weeks after breaking a bone in his foot  
in January, but had 19 rebounds in three SBC tournament games last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after winning the Big 12 tournament title for the third  
straight year, Kansas has its lowest NCAA seed since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 6 seed for Kansas was the highest among the five Big 12  
teams to get into the NCAA tournament, and also is the same seeding 
the Jayhawks had when they won the 1988 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Roy Williams has said the Jayhawks got the seeding they  
deserved. But the only real letdown for Kansas were a pair of 
two-game losing streaks in a seven-game span. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, the winningest team of the decade, has won 285 games in  
the 1990s. That's six more than Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Evansville became an at-large team after losing the Missouri  
Valley Conference championship game to Creighton, which beat 
Louisville 62-58 in a first-round game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	MVC player of the year Marcus Wilson, only the second Evansville  
player to score more than 2,000 career points, is one of only two 
seniors for the Purple Aces. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Kentucky, which has played in the past three NCAA  
title games (winning in 1996), is in its record 40th NCAA 
tournament and appears set on making another march through March. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky lost four straight road games to finish with its most  
regular season losses since 1990. But the Wildcats won the 
Southeastern Conference tournament with double-digit victories over 
three NCAA teams -- Mississippi, Arkansas and Auburn, the South's 
No. 1 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a goal to be 9-0 in the postseason; we're 3-0 right  
now,'' Wildcats senior Scott Padgett said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico State is back in the NCAA tournament under Lou  
Henson, who in February became the sixth active coach with 700 
career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	While 423 of Henson's victories came in 21 years at Illinois, he  
has the Aggies back in the NCAA tournament only two years after 
returning to his alma mater and 25 years after their last 
tournament together. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson is in his 19th NCAA (seventh at New Mexico State), but  
none of his players has ever played in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington went to the NCAA round of 16 last year before losing  
75-74 to Connecticut. The Huskies are led by 7-foot center Todd 
MacCullough, who averaged 19 points per game while leading the 
Pac-10 in rebounding (12 ppg) and field goal percentage (.662). 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stick together, play hard as a unit and neutralize  
him by committee,'' said Wally Szczerbiak, a second-team 
All-American who leads Miami with 23.6 points and 8.7 rebounds per 
game.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900 for First Time / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average surged above  
9,900 for the first time today, buoyed by a rally in oil stocks and 
more evidence that the U.S. economy is growth at a non-inflationary 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
99.35 to 9,872.19, adding to its 79-point record-setting gain on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By 12:30 p.m. EST, the Dow was up 126.55 to 9,899.39. Moments  
later, the Dow topped 9,900 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose at midday, with the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index also hitting a new high. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up 2 1/2 at  
85 3/4, and Exxon, which rose 2 3/8 at 75 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also fueling today's rally was new data showing the U.S. economy  
is growing without any inflationary threats. Since there are no 
signs that the economy is overheating, investors believe that the 
Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to boost interest 
rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department said today that  
first-time claims for unemployment checks remained under 300,000 
for the sixth consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 410.23 million 
shares, up from 352.44 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.46 to 1,297.30 and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 20.39 to 2,426.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.69 at 611.17, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.88 at 721.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Police: Bottle Found in Jones' Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A pint of vodka was found under the  
front passenger seat of country singer George Jones' sport-utility 
vehicle after a crash that critically injured him last weekend, a 
Tennessee Highway Patrol spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigating trooper has said he does not think the crash  
was alcohol-related, but the highway patrol on Thursday asked for a 
test on a vial of blood taken from Jones shortly after the 
accident, spokeswoman Dana Keeton said. She did not know when the 
results would be available. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway patrol did not ask for the test earlier because  
there was little urgency to the case, since Jones was the only 
person involved, Keeton said. The bottle was sealed and in a sack 
but had previously been opened, Keeton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, has long battled alcoholism and drug abuse. Early in  
his career, he was given the nickname ``No Show'' for failing to 
appear at so many concerts after partying. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones suffered a collapsed lung and severely lacerated liver  
when he crashed his sport-utility vehicle into a bridge near his 
home about 1:30 p.m. Saturday. He was talking to his stepdaughter 
on a cellular phone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was still in critical condition Thursday but doctors said  
he could go home by the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Air Travelers Gripe to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First there were mechanical problems at  
Denver, then the missed connection at Houston, an employee strike 
passengers weren't told about, a detour to Miami during Super Bowl 
weekend without help in getting a hotel, a switched airline to the 
Grand Caymans, and adding injury to insult, lost luggage for which 
the original airline agreed to pay only $640. 
</P>
<P>
	The story by Darlene Mccord of Glenbrook, Nev., of her vacation  
``turned nightmare'' marked the second straight day of 
congressional hearings in which travelers, travel agents and 
consumer groups have skewered the airlines for poor service and 
ill-treatment of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified to the Senate Commerce Committee, whose chairman,  
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is sponsoring one of several bills 
strengthening the rights of air travelers. House Transportation 
Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., who has his own bill, held 
similar hearings on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This winter the pot boiled over when Northwest Airlines held  
passengers inside an aircraft unable to take off due to weather at 
Detroit for seven and more hours,'' said Paul Ruden of the American 
Society of Travel Agents. ``More recently, the 'sick out' by 
American Airlines' pilots further enraged the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater on Wednesday unveiled administration proposals to require 
greater disclosures about delays and ticket prices and to double 
maximum payments to $2,500 for lost luggage or $800 for being 
bumped from a flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more planes are taking off, so are passenger complaints.  
That's why I'm proposing a new law requiring all airlines to spell 
out how they will address problems such as delays, overbooking and 
missing baggage,'' President Clinton said in a statement recorded 
for radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, in testimony prepared for the Senate Commerce  
Committee today, says it has heard the complaints and is trying to 
respond. ``Satisfied customers are the heart of our industry,'' 
said Air Transport Association President Carol Hallett in written 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	She outlined several steps being taken, including providing  
timely information on flight delays and cancellations, quoting 
passengers the lowest fares available for which they qualify and 
assuring that unaccompanied minors have appropriate supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	At the House hearing, the voice of Tami Rourke of Newberry,  
Mich., broke as she testified about how her son, who was 6 years 
old and traveling alone on a Northwest Airlines flight from Arizona 
to Michigan in 1996, was delayed in Minneapolis overnight. He was 
put in a hotel room with a 15-year-old boy who sexually molested 
him, Rourke said, even though the industry's unaccompanied minors 
program requires children to be monitored at all times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time we make the airlines be held accountable for their  
obvious lack of true care and concern for more than mishandled 
baggage,'' said Rourke, who said she reached an out-of-court 
settlement with Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest outside counsel Donald Mark, Jr., stated in a letter  
Wednesday that Northwest transports 125,000 minors annually and has 
never received another complaint of child molestation. He said 
local police had closed the investigation without filing charges 
after extensively interviewing the 15-year-old, who denied the 
incident.

	Barbara Plecas of Walled Lake, Mich., told the packed hearing of  
her experience in the famed Detroit blizzard, when she arrived on a 
Northwest flight from Tampa and an announced half-hour delay in 
getting to the gate turned into seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The bathrooms were overflowing and unusable, there was no food  
or water, and a passenger who demanded action was read his rights 
and told he could be arrested when they reached the gate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said he had met with airline executives last week and  
they took a ``dismissive attitude'' about what they regarded as 
isolated cases. But he said that since introducing legislation he 
had become aware of ``an enormous antagonism on the part of the 
traveling public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's bill would require airlines to pay compensation when  
passengers are kept waiting on the runway more than two hours. It 
would bar airlines from using a single flight number to denote a 
flight that involves a change of aircraft. Airlines would be 
required to explain delays and provide refunds for flights canceled 
for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposal would ask airlines to provide for  
food and restroom facilities during ground delays and evacuation 
procedures for extended delays and bumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also announced new regulations under which airlines must  
disclose at the time of a ticket purchase any code-sharing 
arrangements where one airline sells a ticket for another and any 
need for passengers to change planes.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Illinois Guard Official Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Illinois Army National Guard's  
former chief of staff has been charged with bribery and lying under 
oath in a bid to thwart an investigation into his alleged sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. James Burgess, recently put on retirement status from his  
$102,907-a-year post, could spend up to 85 years in prison and be 
fined $2.5 million if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-count indictment returned Wednesday charged him with  
obstruction of a proceeding, two counts of perjury, two counts of 
bribery, three counts of witness tampering and two counts of false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleges he engaged in the illegal acts during an  
investigation into sexual harassment and adultery by the 
Washington-based National Guard Bureau and later the Department of 
the Army, the FBI and a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the perjury charges alleges Burgess lied when he said,  
``I'm not interested in any other woman than my wife. And 
especially if they happen to work for me and they happen to work 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burgess, 52, was arrested Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely surprised and upset the grand jury returned an  
indictment,'' said his attorney, Jon Noll. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe initially looked into allegations that Burgess  
committed adultery, harassed female employees and was engaged in an 
``improper relationship,'' according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury concluded that not only did Burgess try to thwart  
the investigation but that he had attempted to cover up actual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment cites repeated statements Burgess made under oath  
to a military investigator in 1997 in which he denied any sexual 
harassment. But, according to the indictment, Burgess ``repeatedly 
had sexually harassed, touched in a sexual manner and made improper 
sexual advances toward females.''

<HEADLINE> Iran's President Meets With Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Amid some of the tightest security in memory  
here, Pope John Paul II held private talks with Iran's president 
today, in a meeting that could lay ground for better relations 
between Christianity and Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	After their 25-minute meeting in the pope's private library,  
John Paul called it ``an important, promising day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As President Mohammad Khatami left the library, the Iranian  
leader said: ``The hope is for the final victory of monotheism, 
morality, peace and reconciliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked John Paul to pray for him.  
</P>
<P>
	In a public exchange of gifts following their meeting with  
interpreters, the two men appeared relaxed and pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope gave the president a painting of Sts. Peter and Paul;  
Khatami presented John Paul with a Persian rug with a design of St. 
Mark's Basilica in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami described the encounter as a ``great and pleasant  
meeting.'' As the two men emerged from the library, the chanting of 
Iranian dissidents outside in St. Peter's Square could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Security appeared even heavier than when U.S. presidents have  
called on the pope. Helicopters buzzed overhead and hundreds of 
police blocked off the boulevard leading to St. Peter's Square, 
searching garbage bins in the area for any explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	The square was off-limits to tourists, but somehow about 50  
chanting anti-Khatami protesters got in and were surrounded by 
about as many police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami, a moderate cleric, spoke Wednesday in a conciliatory  
way toward Western religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the divine religions are not quintessentially different,''  
Khatami declared in an address at the European University Institute 
at Fiesole, outside Florence. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has long made his own efforts to stress the common  
bonds and beliefs in Christianity, Islam and other faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that today's scheduled audience could  
be a prelude to a brief papal stopover in Iran during an expected 
trip to Asia later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope Paul VI stopped in Tehran in 1970, when the country was  
ruled by the shah. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami, 56, is pushing for more social and political freedom in  
Iran, but faces stiff opposition from the conservative clerics who 
control parliament, the security forces and the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	He visited the United Nations last year, but the Italy trip is  
the first official visit by an Iranian leader to a Western nation 
since his country's Islamic Revolution in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's chairmanship of the 54-nation Islamic Conference gave  
extra weight to the pope's meeting with Khatami, a mid-level Shiite 
cleric. Islam and the Roman Catholic Church claim 1 billion 
adherents each. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope had been expected to press Khatami to allow Iran's  
small Christian minority more rights. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Vatican has welcomed what Khatami calls  
his beginning of a ``dialogue between civilizations and countries 
and different people and cultures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has rejected criticism of the papal audience from  
the Iranian opposition in exile. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pope opens his arms to all those who seek an audience,''  
the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Christians in Iran number only 120,000. About 13,000 of them  
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Fides, the news agency of the Vatican's missionary  
arm, Christians in Iran are free to worship inside their churches 
but their activities are strictly watched and they are denied some 
civil rights -- barred from serving in the armed forces and 
government posts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his visit, as in his presidency, Khatami has repeatedly  
pushed for more open relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Islam and Europe must, by force of historical and geographic  
circumstance, get to know one another better, and then move on to 
improve their political, culture and economic relations,'' he said 
in his speech Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice during the roughly 30-minute address, Iranian dissidents  
in exile got into the inner courtyard of the building, shouting 
``Death to Khatami!'' Police dragged them away. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, in Rome, Khatami's car was splattered with  
eggs and several protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday also brought an awkward overlap with an Italian visit  
by Salman Rushdie, who appeared at the University of Turin to 
accept an honorary degree. 
</P>
<P>
	In hiding from Iranian religious hard-liners' death edict,  
Rushdie said Khatami gave him some hope for change in Iran -- but 
pointedly noted Khatami didn't represent the views of all Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami was to travel back to Iran later today, ending the  
three-day trip.

<HEADLINE>  More Indonesian Religious Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Religious violence on riot-torn Ambon  
Island claimed more victims after outnumbered troops opened fire on 
Muslim and Christian mobs fighting each other with spears, knives 
and gasoline bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence flared late Wednesday and residents said security  
forces continued to fire shots early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard shots before dawn. Two neighbors were wounded by  
gunfire. Another was stabbed,'' said resident Una Noya in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest killings triggered a new series of protests by  
Muslims in other parts of Indonesia. There are fears that religious 
strife might spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials were not immediately available for comment  
today amid conflicting reports on casualty numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper Kompas said 10 people were killed in Ambon. The  
Jakarta Post newspaper said seven died and quoted a nurse at a 
local hospital as saying at least 30 people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police declined to say how many were killed. Earlier they said  
one man had died and Christian church officials said three had been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of houses were set on fire in the city, 1,400 miles east  
of Jakarta, when clashes among rival gangs erupted in six places 
around the city, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fierce fighting among Muslims and Christians erupted in Ambon on  
Jan. 19. Since then violence has spread to five neighboring islands 
and has left more than 200 people dead in Maluku province. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,  
making it the most populous Islamic nation. However, parts of 
Maluku, known in Dutch colonial times as the Spice Islands, have 
large Christian populations. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious clashes continue as Indonesia grapples with rising  
political and social tensions fueled by its worst economic crisis 
in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts fear religious strife could threaten a push for  
greater democracy for Indonesia, which is preparing to hold its 
most open parliamentary election since 1955 on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, President B.J. Habibie downplayed the threat of rising  
instability and said the large number of political parties that are 
contesting the election was a sign of greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	On neighboring Sulawesi Island today, thousands of Islamic  
students marched through the streets of Ujung Pandang city and 
warned of the possibility of retaliation against the Christian 
minority there.

<HEADLINE> UConn Aims To Make Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Under head coach Jim Calhoun, Connecticut is 13-1  
in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament. After that, the 
round of 16 tends to turn sour and the final eight becomes a dead 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	With their third No. 1 seed this decade, the Huskies again are  
favored to escape the West Regional and earn their first Final Four 
berth in school history. The road begins tonight against 
16th-seeded Texas-San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we haven't won a national championship or been  
the Final Four in the past decade hasn't frustrated me,'' 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said Wednesday. ``It's only kept me 
excited about trying to do something that we haven't done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies (28-2), who won their first 19 games this season,  
have advanced past the second round six times in nine seasons and 
played in three regional finals (1990, 1995 and 1998). 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's Christian Laettner set the tone for Connecticut's decade  
when he hit a jumper with one second left in overtime of the 1990 
East Regional final. UCLA, the eventual national champion, was the 
culprit in 1995, and North Carolina bounced the Huskies in the 
round of eight last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it does is make you a little thirsty,'' Calhoun said. ``I  
will never apologize for what Connecticut's done over the past 
decade. I'll never apologize for what we've been able to do in our 
own neighborhood, the Big East. I'll never apologize for the 
players that I've coached and the things they've accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all underdogs, Texas-San Antonio (18-10) has dreams of  
knocking off Connecticut, but history says the Roadrunners will 
have as much success as Wile E. Coyote. Sixteenth seeds are 0-56 
since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to go out and play a miraculous game,''  
guard Steve Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I expect from our guys is to do their very  
best,'' Roadrunners coach Tim Carter said. ``If you start talking 
about a lot of foolishness, then you set yourself up. ... We're 
dreaming right now, but that's the first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas-San Antonio-Connecticut game is the last of four at  
McNichols Arena. Fifth-seeded Iowa (18-9) plays No. 12 
Alabama-Birmingham (22-10) in the opener, followed by fourth-seeded 
Arkansas (22-10) and No. 13 Siena (25-5). Eighth-seeded Missouri 
(20-8) faces ninth-seeded New Mexico (24-8) to start the evening 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri, which has just two seniors and five freshman, is  
making its 17th NCAA appearance under coach Norm Stewart, but its 
first since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last time this ball club will play in the NCAA  
with no pressure,'' Stewart said. ``I want them to enjoy it because 
from now on there's a pressure because you want to succeed either 
more or the same to achieve the greatest goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico's Kenny Thomas and Missouri's Monte Hardge will  
provide one of the most appetizing matchups of the day. At 
6-foot-8, 260 pounds, Thomas will be outsized for one of the few 
times in his career by the 6-11, 335-pound Hardge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never played against anybody that weighs as much as he  
does,'' said Thomas, who is recovering from a groin pull suffered 
last Thursday. ``It's going to be physical, and I'm looking forward 
to it. I'm just going to play Kenny Thomas basketball, and I'm not 
going to change anything for anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siena, a small Franciscan school from Loudonville, N.Y., is  
taking a similar stance against NCAA-tested Arkansas, which won the 
national title in 1994 and finished second in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite only one previous tournament appearance, the Saints plan  
to attack Arkansas' vaunted pressure defense known as 40 minutes of 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is there to be scared of?'' Siena guard Marcus Faison  
said. ``They're not going to send us to jail if we lose, are 
they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa, meanwhile, is drawing inspiration from coach Tom Davis,  
who learned last spring that the school would not renew his 
contract despite nine NCAA appearances and a 267-139 record in 13 
seasons with the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing for coach has been the greatest basketball experience  
of my life,'' senior guard Kent McCausland said. ``I wanted to soak 
in everything he had to give me. It's been perfect. It's been 
great.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Sends Steel Bill to House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel-state lawmakers are pressing ahead with  
legislation to impose quotas on steel imports, winning the right to 
a House vote over the objections of key Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee sent the bill to the full  
House with an unfavorable recommendation out of fear that 
parliamentary maneuvers would otherwise be invoked to force a vote. 
The full House is expected to vote as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before the committee acted Wednesday, White House chief  
of staff John Podesta threatened a presidential veto, saying the 
bill would violate international trade agreements and ``is not in 
our nation's economic interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the domestic steel industry, reeling from an import surge  
that has forced production cutbacks and layoffs, was elated that a 
steel bill even moved out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was the first to reach the full House since the Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to U.S. markets to get rid of their surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crisis has gone on for far too long,'' said Rep. Pete  
Visclosky, D-Ind., the chief sponsor of the quota bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is likely to draw considerable support from House  
Republicans from districts with steel mills. It faces a tougher 
time in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee debate highlighted rifts within Congress  
about how best to tackle the increase in steel imports and brought 
out concerns that other struggling industries will want special 
remedies as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil industry has been more hard hit by imports,'' said  
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee chairman. ``Likewise, our 
farmers and ranchers just got through a very difficult stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also argue that quotas could lead to market distortions,  
shortages of certain types of steel and increased prices, hurting 
steel consumers in the automobile, appliance and construction 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., a supporter of the bill, said  
strong sanctions are needed to ``send a strong message to the 
international community that Congress is not willing to roll over 
and be a patsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the insistence of House leaders, the committee reported the  
bill ``adversely'' on a voice vote, meaning a majority of its 
members opposed the measure but agreed to let the House consider 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, said they shared Archer's misgivings about the bill 
but did not want parliamentary tactics from supporters to disrupt 
normal procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who opposes quotas in favor of more  
moderate steel legislation, accused Republicans of trying to divide 
House Democrats from the Clinton administration and give 
Republicans in swing districts ``a boost by appearing to be 
concerned about steel workers and the steel industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would limit foreign-made steel imports to their  
pre-July 1997 levels, before worldwide conditions began changing to 
boost imports dramatically. The measure also would set up an import 
notification system to improve tracking of shipments into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is considering steel tariffs of as much as 71  
percent against Japan and Brazil after issuing a preliminary ruling 
in favor of the domestic industry's complaints that those countries 
have dumped steel in U.S. markets at prices below production costs.

<HEADLINE> Crude Down on Lack Of Oil Talk News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
Thursday as market participants awaited news from a meeting of key 
world oil producers in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cotton and grain futures jumped higher.  
Natural gasoline futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	No news was bad news for crude oil, which fell Thursday after  
posting solid gains all week amid optimism world oil producers are 
getting more serious about slashing supplies in an effort to 
sustain higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting in Amsterdam of Saudi Arabia -- the world's top  
producer -- Venezuela, Iran, Algeria, Mexico and Norway produced no 
news of solid plans to go ahead with the supply cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, rumors that Venezuela had no plans to go along with the  
cuts helped push prices lower, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent rally, prices continue to hover at their  
lowest in a decade. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries in the past year has moved to cut 2.6 million barrels 
daily from output, while other producers have chipped in to bring 
that figure to slightly more than 3 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	But those moves have had little effect on prices amid cheating  
and slack world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi predicted Wednesday that OPEC and  
independent producers will agree on cuts ahead of the cartel's 
meeting next Tuesday in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for April delivery fell 38 cents to $14.31 a barrel; April  
heating oil fell .77 cents to 37.89 cents a gallon; April unleaded 
gasoline rose .50 cents to 44.30 cents a gallon; April natural gas 
fell 1.21 cents to $1.820 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures rose on a government report that showed U.S.  
exports of the fiber tripled last week. The sales, which were 
bigger than expected, went mostly to Mexico, South Korea, Japan and 
Taiwan. May futures rose to a three-month high but gave up some of 
the gains by the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton for May delivery jumped 1.98 cents to 63.35 cents per  
pound in trading on the Board of Trade of the City of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas suffered its biggest drop in seven weeks after a  
report that U.S. inventories fell less than expected last week 
during a late-season cold spell. 
</P>

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian markets ended mixed Thursday amid

</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
22.14 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 15,502.14. On Wednesday, 
the Nikkei had jumped 2.54 percent to its highest level in nearly 
seven months.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Security Flap Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's top adviser on national  
security, rejecting suggestions by some Republicans that he resign, 
says the administration reacted properly and swiftly to security 
concerns at federal nuclear weapons labs in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions that we took as a government, I believe were  
appropriate,'' Sandy Berger said Wednesday. ``They were in the 
national interest, and I believe we acted swiftly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day there were calls from GOP presidential  
aspirants for Berger to resign because, they said, he had not moved 
quickly enough to recognize serious security breaches at the 
national labs when he learned of an investigation in 1996 that 
China may have obtained top-secret nuclear warhead information from 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intention of resigning,'' Berger told reporters in  
Guatemala City, where he was accompanying Clinton on a tour of 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout continued Wednesday from the firing earlier in the  
week of a scientist at Los Alamos, one of more than a dozen labs 
scattered around the country, after the scientist had been the 
target of three-year FBI espionage investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he was to be  
briefed soon by the FBI on the Los Alamos investigation. Several 
congressional hearings on the subject were scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	And the controversy also became entwined in early presidential  
campaign politics. 
</P>
<P>
	While the suspected espionage at Los Alamos occurred during the  
Republican administration of Ronald Reagan, GOP presidential 
aspirants lashed out at the Clinton White House for not moving fast 
enough to investigate it and address security problems at the labs 
when the suspected espionage became known in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime target was Berger, who then was deputy national  
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the information is accurate then Sandy Berger should not  
have time to resign. He should be fired,'' declared Sen. Bob Smith, 
R-N.H., who is a presidential aspirant. Smith, chairman of a Senate 
Armed Services subcommittee, also said he would raise the Los 
Alamos issue at a hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Pat Buchanan, who also is running for president,  
said Berger ``ought to explain his actions to the country or 
resign,'' and fellow GOP presidential hopefuls Lamar Alexander and 
Steve Forbes also called for Berger's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart dismissed it all as  
``Republican attack politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I reject the notion there was any dragging of feet'' in  
administration response to the Los Alamos investigation, Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said he had first learned of the FBI investigation in a  
routine intelligence briefing in 1996. ``This was very preliminary. 
The FBI had just begun investigating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nearly another year, in July 1997, before a more  
detailed Energy Department briefing on the investigation would 
prompt him to conclude there was a serious security problem at the 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The July 1997 briefing was troubling and raised serious  
questions and warranted a significant response,'' Berger said. He 
said it was ``absolutely not'' true that U.S policy of engaging 
China in trade and other matters in any way influenced the response 
to the Los Alamos investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said he asked that the CIA evaluate what security damage  
might have occurred and that an interagency task force reviewed how 
security could be improved at the labs. Six months later, in 
February 1998, Clinton issued a formal presidential directive 
imposing new safeguards on the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	It directed tighter security checks on foreign visitors to labs  
and called for additional counterintelligence personnel at the 
Energy Department. The department brought in a former FBI agent, 
Edward J. Curran, to head a new counterintelligence office and 
doubled the office's spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement and security officials said Wednesday they were  
frustrated for some time about weapons lab security and what they 
viewed as a lack of emphasis on counterintelligence. With the 
arrival of Bill Richardson, the former U.N. ambassador, as energy 
secretary last year, they said new emphasis was put on security 
concerns.

<HEADLINE> Brit Prudential Wants M&AMP;G Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's Prudential Corp. PLC is offering 1.9  
billion British pounds, or $3.1 billion, for fund manager M&AMP;G Group 
PLC in a deal that would create a leader in investment products as 
well as insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Thursday, has the backing of the M&AMP;G Group  
board and a charitable trust that owns of about 33 percent of its 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	M&AMP;G has about $30 billion in funds under management and is  
second in the unit trust market in the United Kingdom behind 
Schroders PLC, according to Prudential. Unit trusts are pieces of 
fixed portfolios of securities assembled by asset managers and sold 
to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	With Prudential's existing fund management arms PPM and Scottish  
Amicable, Prudential said the deal may make it the leader in the 
U.K. unit trust market. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential Corp. PLC is a leader in retail insurance in Britain,  
but is unrelated to The Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which 
is based in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer represents a 40 percent premium to M&AMP;G's closing price  
Wednesday in London. M&AMP;G was up 37 percent in midday trading while 
Prudential was down 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	PPM, Prudential's fund management business, owns about 1.7  
percent of M&AMP;G's stock. Prudential has entered into agreements to 
buy shares from M&AMP;G board, which represent 0.44 percent of the 
shares, and The Esmee Fairbairn Charitable Trust's 33.3 percent 
stake in M&AMP;G. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential expects the combination would create cost savings of  
10 million British pounds, or $16.2 million, a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential finance director Johnathan Bloomer told reporters he  
couldn't say how soon the cost-savings would be achieved. He said 
he didn't anticipate a ``significant number'' of jobs cuts at M&AMP;G, 
which has some 1,100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	M&AMP;G, which distributes investment products through independent  
financial advisors and directly, will operate as a separate unit 
within Prudential and retain its own brand. Its products would also 
be sold through Prudential's sales force and Egg, its direct 
banking arm launched in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will be funded from Prudential's own cash resources,  
Bloomer said.

<HEADLINE> Nets Get Marbury; Brandon to Wolves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Stephon Marbury was traded to the New Jersey  
Nets in an nine-player deal involving the Minnesota Timberwolves 
and Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West, moves to the Nets along with guards 
Elliot Perry and Chris Carr and forward Bill Curley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves get guard Terrell Brandon from Milwaukee and forward  
Brian Evans and two draft choices from the Nets, including a 
first-rounder. One of the picks will be this year; the other will 
come farther down the road, perhaps in 2000 or 2003, said Kevin 
McHale, the Wolves' vice president for basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also send Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling to the Bucks,  
who also get Paul Grant from the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from the West Coast, where the Wolves had a game  
against Golden State, Marbury told WFAN Radio in New York he 
planned to fly to Philadelphia for Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, a Brooklyn native, said he was elated to be returning  
home, and would immediately sign a long-term extension with the 
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sign tomorrow. It'll be signed tomorrow,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, a former All-Star, told KFAN in Minneapolis he was  
happy with the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. I think any player, anyone who's in any type of  
business enjoys being wanted,'' Brandon said. ``I'm excited about 
being a Timberwolf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are off to the worst start in the Eastern Conference at  
3-15, including five straight losses that have raised questions 
about coach John Calipari's job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury had helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West. At 12-6, they are only two games behind 
Utah in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury's agent, David Falk, met with owner Glen Taylor about 10  
days ago to discuss Marbury's future, and Marbury turned down a 
six-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	A tired-looking McHale made it clear Thursday night he was  
frustrated and bitter with the way Marbury and Falk handled the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess loyalty and some other words are long forgotten in our  
league,'' McHale said. ``I can't stand that attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale said Falk's visit was meant ``to lay the groundwork for  
the Brinks job they were trying to pull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Wolves asked what the likelihood was that  
Marbury would sign after the season and were told probably not. So 
the Wolves, who lost Tom Gugliotta to Phoenix before the season 
began without compensation, decided to move Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were kind of forced into it,'' Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Wolves offered Marbury the maximum deal under  
the NBA's new labor contract, six years for $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't money,'' Taylor said. ``He grew up in the East and  
wants to play back by his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury has long expressed a desire to play for the New York  
Knicks, and it's clear he saw the Nets as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's New York, but it's not New York. It's New Jersey,'' he  
told WFAN. ``When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first 
thing they think is that's the other New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he was disappointed but had no hard feelings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a great future. We liked him here, we  
invested a lot of time in him as a young player. (But) he's gone 
and we're very, very fortunate to land another outstanding guard in 
Terrell Brandon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon also will be a free agent at the end of the season, but  
Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said he was confident Minnesota 
will re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The positive thing is we lost Stephon but we got an All-Star  
point guard in return,'' said Saunders, who expected Brandon to 
arrive in time for Friday night's game at Sacramento. ``... I think 
he will flourish and play very well here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders also acknowledged it will take time for the Wolves to  
adjust. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll take us some time to fight through the team changes,''  
Saunders said. ``When you change personnel, the identity of your 
team changes and so does the chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Bucks coach George Karl had been reluctant to see  
Brandon go because the team jelled under his leadership and the 
Bucks jumped out to a 12-5 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon had refused to negotiate a contract extension in  
Milwaukee, but Karl said he didn't want to see a player of 
Brandon's stature get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, a change is a step backward unless you're going to get  
Magic Johnson or John Stockton or Gary Payton, someone you know is 
a better player,'' Karl said last week. ``To get a better player 
than Terrell Brandon is a difficult task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell has played in only two games since spraining his ankle  
in the season opener. Gatling had asked to be traded, and Evans was 
showcased in heavy minutes Wednesday night in a loss to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, Curley and Grant have seen little action this season.

fresh evidence about the hardy U.S. economy. The Dow broke through 
the 9,800 and 9,900 marks by noon, peaking at 9.935.46 before 
pulling back. A late rally failed to breach the five-digit 
milestone. The Dow closed up 124.60 at 9,897.44. NYSE advancers led

a slow start but has heated up, with 43 states reporting outbreaks, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. For the week 
ending Feb. 27, pneumonia- and influenza-related deaths accounted

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Mobil Execs Say Merger Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairmen of Exxon and Mobil told lawmakers  
today the merger of the two oil giants is essential for them to 
compete with the large government-owned oil producers that dominate 
the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger will mean that Exxon-Mobil ... will be able to  
compete in the same scale as the largest foreign firms,'' Exxon 
chairman Lee Raymond told a House Commerce energy and power 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel members, although expressing concerns about the  
potential impact of the merger on competition, generally endorsed 
the move as understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the national interest of the United States of America  
to support this merger,'' said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the 
subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced in December that Exxon Corp. would  
purchase Mobil Corp. for $73.7 billion in stock, combining the 
biggest U.S. oil companies, and creating the sixth-largest oil 
producer in the world. The only larger ones are governmnet-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal awaits Federal Trade Commission approval. Raymond said  
Exxon and Mobil shareholders will vote on the merger on May 27 
before expected government clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	While the FTC is likely to require the companies to sell off  
some assets, especially gasoline stations, where they are currently 
concentrated, Raymond said he was not ready to forecast any 
extensive divestitures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue to be discussed with the FTC,'' said Raymond,  
promising to fully cooperate with the regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate testimony, representatives of service station  
dealers and gasoline marketers expressed concern about how the 
merger might affect them, fearing it might force some out of 
business, especially in the Northeast, where the two companies have 
significant market shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Reidy, an Exxon dealer in suburban Maryland outside  
Washington, said dealers were concerned the new oil giant would 
``squeeze out'' independents and that wholesale gasoline prices 
might increase. 
</P>
<P>
	If company-owned stations are ordered sold, ``the lessee dealers  
should be given a fair opportunity to acquire their business before 
(the stations) are sold off,'' said Riedy, who testified on behalf 
of the Service Station Dealers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Shotmeyer, whose family owns a chain of Mobil stations  
in New Jersey, said Exxon and Mobil have by some accounts 35 
percent of the retail gasoline market in the state. He said many of 
the Mobil station owners are worried the FTC may force them to 
abandon the brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond and Mobil chairman Lucio Noto said they're confident  
arrangements can be worked out suitable to the FTC, which is the 
government agency with antitrust jurisdiction over the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Noto said he had become convinced that to be competitive, ``we  
had to do something,'' even though the merger will ``mean a lot of 
changes'' for his 130-year-old company as well as for him 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was not to become the biggest, but the most efficient,  
said Noto, whose personality and management style have been 
described as contrasting sharply to that of Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big isn't necessarily bad if you want to do the kind of things  
you need to do on a world scale basis,'' said Raymond. ``Ultimately 
everyone benefits from that.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Jump in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers continued their spending  
spree unabated in February, their confidence supported by the best 
job market in a quarter-century, a stream of tax refunds and 
booming stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Their buying is helping the U.S. economy shrug off the ill  
effects of a rapidly rising trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales -- which represent about a third of the nation's economic  
output -- jumped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 
$236 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the seventh consecutive gain and came on top of robust  
increases of 1 percent in January, revised up from an earlier 
estimate of 0.2 percent, and 1.1 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are aggressively buying everything from apparel to  
vehicles and anything in between,'' said economist Mark Zandi of 
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	That's helped keep the economy strong as the global financial  
crisis continued to batter U.S. farmers and manufacturers through a 
soaring trade deficit. The Commerce Department said the deficit in 
America's broadest measure of foreign trade, the current account, 
jumped 50.4 percent last year to a record $233.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Commerce Secretary William Daley said the retail sales  
figures ``show that the robust growth that marked the end of 1998 
has continued into 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence -- with its implication of sustained profits --  
drove stock prices to a record close. The Dow Jones average burst 
both the 9,800 and 9,900 barriers for the first time, settling to 
9,897 at the end of trading, a gain of 125 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and job markets are behind Americans' willingness to  
buy, especially expensive durable goods such as cars and furniture. 
The Labor Department said Thursday that first-time claims for 
unemployment benefits remained under 300,000 for the sixth 
consecutive week for the first time since 1974. Claims edged up 
1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strong spending is driving employment and strong employment is  
driving spending,'' said economist Robert Dederick of Northern 
Trust Co. in Chicago. ``You have a virtuous circle that is not 
being broken by inflation, as is usually the case. So the wheels 
keep turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest ABC News-Money magazine poll put consumer confidence  
this week tied with a record high, set in mid-January. The weekly 
polls began in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors supporting spending include good weather across  
much of the country in February, low interest rates and federal tax 
refund checks, padded by a new $400 per child credit and two 
education credits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service said the average refund through  
last week, $1,677, was $227 higher than the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, who continue to predict consumer spending will fade as  
the year progresses, note that tax refunds will remain a factor for 
only another month or two. 
</P>
<P>
	They also point to rising mortgage rates, which hit a 10-month  
high of 7.11 percent this week, according to Freddie Mac, the 
mortgage company. That should dampen refinancing, which has put 
money in many consumers' pockets, and home sales, which encourage 
associated sales of furniture and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, auto sales were particularly strong, up 1.8 percent.  
And sales of everything else rose a healthy 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Receipts at furniture stores rose 1 percent; building supplies  
and hardware stores, 1.2 percent; apparel and accessory shops, 1 
percent; food stores, 0.9 percent, the most in nearly two years; 
drug stores, 1.3 percent; restaurants and bars, 0.8 percent; and 
gasoline stations, 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at department and other general merchandise stores rose  
0.5 percent, a decent increase on top of an extremely strong 2.6 
percent advance in January.

<HEADLINE> GOP Floats Independent Counsel Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An assistant attorney general subject to  
Senate confirmation would oversee investigations of high-level 
government officials under a GOP lawmaker's draft proposal to 
replace the expiring independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Gekas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's  
commercial and administrative law subcommittee, suggested the plan 
in a letter Wednesday to Attorney General Janet Reno. He asked Reno 
to respond by April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Democrats suggested that Gekas' idea was premature,  
saying the panel first should hear testimony from President 
Clinton's former paramour, Monica Lewinsky, about how she was 
treated by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Gekas, R-Pa., said he would oppose calling Ms. Lewinsky as a  
witness. He also cautioned that the proposal is a draft still 
``just ephemeral in our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It indicates our thinking at this point,'' he added later.  
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal, also signed by Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,  
and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would place investigations now under 
the independent counsel law in the Justice Department's Public 
Integrity Section. Both men were among the House prosecutors in 
Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief of the section would carry the title of assistant  
attorney general, be subject to Senate confirmation and appointed 
for a fixed term that would extend beyond the electoral cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican proposal would leave open the possibility of  
appointing a special counsel in cases where Congress requested it 
and the attorney general concurred. The bill would create an 
advisory panel to certify a pool of lawyers from which a special 
counsel would be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Democrats refused to sign the letter, saying the  
proposals had not been reviewed by the panel. As the statute's June 
30 expiration loomed, Democrats said they want to hear from Ms. 
Lewinsky, who criticized Starr sharply in her book and recent 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some discussion about how valuable her  
contribution would be,'' Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., said in an 
interview. He said Ms. Lewinsky's possible testimony ``goes to the 
larger issue of what's happened behind the scenes -- is it fair? Is 
it just?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the Governmental Affairs Committee is set to hear  
from Reno next week on the independent counsel law.

<HEADLINE> Famed Boat May Lie in RI Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- A marine archaeologist has uncovered clues  
that suggest a wreck at the bottom of the harbor is that of the HMS 
Endeavour, the ship that carried the English explorer Capt. James 
Cook on his legendary South Pacific expedition more than 200 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cook's voyage, the ship was sold and renamed, and its fate  
became lost to time. But D.K. Abbass says her reading of old 
British naval records indicates that Endeavour may be lying in 20 
feet of water in Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	If she is right, it ``would easily be one of the most important  
vessels to be discovered in the history of international maritime 
exploration,'' says Rod Mather, an underwater archeologist at the 
University of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook's round-the-world voyage in 1768-71 filled gaping holes in  
what was known about the geography of the South Pacific. He mapped 
the eastern coast of Australia, discovered that New Zealand 
consisted of two islands instead of one, and was the first European 
to set foot on Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cook sailed Endeavour back to England in 1771, the vessel  
was refitted as a store ship. It was sold in 1775 as a coal 
transport, its original use. (As for Cook, Hawaiian natives killed 
him in 1779.) 
</P>
<P>
	The ship's ultimate fate has been a mystery for more than two  
centuries, but Australian researchers recently concluded that 
Endeavour had been renamed Lord Sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Ms. Abbass a clue.  
</P>
<P>
	British troops had occupied Newport during the early years of  
the American Revolution. With French naval forces approaching in 
1778, British troops ordered ships taken out into the harbor and 
sunk. Ms. Abbass knew that a prison ship called Lord Sandwich was 
among the scuttled vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	She traveled to Britain and found that the Lord Sandwich off  
Newport and Endeavour were both three-mast barks with the same 
exact carrying capacity -- 368 71/94 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as three vessels named Lord Sandwich were sailing under  
the British flag back then. But Ms. Abbass says the Lord Sandwich 
in Newport Harbor is the only one with Endeavour's dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abbass, who led a team that excavated a vessel of the French  
and Indian War era from Lake George and has investigated several 
old shipwrecks in Rhode Island, believes the carcass of the 
Endeavour might be off a Navy pier. 
</P>
<P>
	There is an 80-foot timber visible in the silt that is  
consistent with the dimensions of the 97-foot Endeavour, she says. 
There is also evidence of ship ballast and a cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians know that Cook had the Endeavour repaired in several  
parts of the world, so marine archaeologists plan to see whether 
the wreck in question has pieces of wood indigenous to places the 
explorer visited. Seeds and pollen samples could also provide 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also known that the Lord Sandwich that was scuttled in  
Newport transported German mercenaries from Europe to America 
during the Revolution. Archaeologists plan to look for signs of 
their presence -- such as uniform buttons -- to confirm the find. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of shipwrecks in Rhode Island and people look  
at them like old junk. But there's important history out there,'' 
Ms. Abbass said. ``I think what we've done will stand up to 
scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> Man Apologizes for Stabbing Teacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- A man accused of stabbing his daughter's  
fourth-grade teacher apologized and said he had not been taking his 
prescribed medicine for a psychiatric disorder at the time of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan was to stab her, get out of there and go home and get  
arrested,'' Paul Joe Gonzalez Jr. said in a rambling jailhouse 
interview with the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very nice teacher and a great person. I apologize to  
the school and the family who are feeling hurt. I deserve what I 
got coming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 30, said he had not been taking his medicine for a  
diagnosed bipolar disorder ``because I know I'm not crazy.'' Such 
disorders are characterized by wild mood changes and can include 
manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez was to be arraigned today, perhaps on an attempted  
murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who has done volunteer work at the school, said he had  
planned the attack on Nancy Peer, apparently believing she was part 
of a government plot against him and his three children. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into his daughter's classroom at J.O. Ford Elementary  
School Tuesday afternoon, upset because his daughter had been kept 
after late because of academic problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege that as he was having a conversation with Peer, he  
stabbed her without warning in her lower right abdomen with a 
kitchen knife when she turned around. The knife was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's 9-year-old daughter was among the many pupils who  
witnessed the attack. Peer was hospitalized in fair condition 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> US Proposes $3B Arms Sale to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The United States proposed today a $3  
billion military equipment sale to Egypt involving some of the most 
sophisticated weapons in the U.S. arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale offered by Defense Secretary William Cohen would  
involve 24 advanced-model F-16 fighters, 200 M1-A1 tanks and one 
eight-unit Patriot missile battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen announced the sale at a news conference following his  
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who requested the 
purchase. It requires U.S. congressional approval, which is 
considered likely by U.S. defense officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-16s, which will add to Egypt's existing force of 196 F-16s  
are built by Lockheed Martin Corp. in Fort Worth, Texas. The new 
fighters, the advanced Block 40 version, will cost $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would substantially expand Egypt's armored capability.  
Egypt has 555 M1-A1 tanks. The new tanks will cost about $680 
million and be assembled in Egypt from parts manufacturing in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt would be buying the most advance model of the Patriot  
anti-missile battery. The $1.3 billion Patriot deal involves the 
Patriot 3 model of a system that drew attention during the Persian 
Gulf War when it was used against Iraqi Scud missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt plans to buy a single missile defense battery composed of  
eight, boxcar like missile firing units -- a total of 32 missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriot 3, made by Raytheon Corp., is still being developed  
and tested in the United States. Defense officials said it will be 
several years before the missiles can be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said after the announcement that the exact  
purchase prices and the timing of delivery are still being worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States provides Egypt with $1.2 billion annually in  
military aid, which includes training programs, weapons and spare 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. defense officials said it was unclear whether the new  
weapons would be purchased out of that aid money or whether the 
transaction would be structured in some other way. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials characterized the proposed sale as part of Egypt's  
effort to modernize its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen arrived in Cairo Wednesday night after visits to six  
Persian Gulf nations, as well as Jordan. He was to fly later today 
to Israel for talks on regional security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Cohen's trip, he has proposed selling air-to-air  
missiles to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and discussed fighter aircraft 
and air-to-air missile sales to the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions from reporters, Cohen said the United  
States is not bringing an arms bazaar to the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that Egypt feels it needs to modernize its  
military in order to protect its own self-defense, that's a 
judgment that is made by a sovereign country,'' said Cohen. ``Each 
country ought to be free and secure to request technology and 
equipment that they believe necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also noted that the United States is competing for foreign  
military sales with arms makers in Britain, France and elsewhere. 
``We have competition,'' Cohen said. ``We want to be in a position 
to respond.''

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Collectibles Nearly Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Marty Bookston guides his visitor to a  
display case where a black-and-white picture shows Joe DiMaggio 
kneeling in his New York Yankees uniform, leaning on a bat as if in 
the on-deck circle. Inset next to the photo is a baseball with 
DiMaggio's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sold a bunch of these to a couple of lawyers a few weeks  
ago for $300,'' Bookston, owner of Florida Rare Coins &AMP; 
Collectibles, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the price is $550.  
</P>
<P>
	``What a deal those guys got,'' Bookston said.  
</P>
<P>
	From DiMaggio's adopted hometown to the World Wide Web, the  
price for DiMaggio memorabilia has just about doubled in the days 
following the Hall of Famer's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value's just skyrocketed,'' said Bookston, whose small  
shop operates on the ground floor of the same office building where 
the Yankee Clipper used to do his banking. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are interested in his stuff, but it's hard to  
get hold of it,'' he continued. ``We don't want to price ourselves 
out of the market, but there's definitely a lot of interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio died Monday at his Hollywood home following a  
four-month battle with lung cancer. He was buried Thursday in a San 
Francisco suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Several dealers said the price of his memorabilia steadily had  
been rising during the course of his illness. Even so, the market 
did brisk business Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe's prices always have been high to start with,'' said Bill  
Rodman, owner of B&AMP;J Collectibles in Lakewood, N.J. ``It's really 
getting to the level where it was at its peak, about three or four 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Glaskin, whose Sports Collectors Warehouse sits a couple of  
punts from the Miami Dolphins' complex in Davie, said he had about 
a dozen DiMaggio items in stock when the Yankees great was 
hospitalized in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had four baseballs and five or six 8-by-10s on plaques,'' he  
said. ``I sold them all right in that time. Usually I only sold one 
or two a year. But no matter what I had at that time, I could have 
sold it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glaskin said he won't buy any DiMaggio collectibles now out of  
concern for fakes. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was one of the first to discover the power of the  
memorabilia market, but he was a finicky signer. He spurned many 
requests to sign bats and jerseys, often limiting his autographs to 
balls and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal to sell limited edition bats six years ago,  
DiMaggio agreed not to sign any more bats for five years. That 
agreement expired shortly before he took ill. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the B&AMP;J website listed one of those limited edition  
bats for $3,495. It also had a DiMaggio autographed ball for $399 
and an autographed 16x20 photo for $349. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Ryan, whose Chicago auction house North Shore Sports  
specializes in game-used memorabilia, said he had been considering 
a special auction of DiMaggio items until he made a key 
realization. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just not enough material,'' said Ryan, who is  
preparing a special auction of Michael Jordan items in the wake of 
the NBA great's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Michael Jordan, we've got jerseys for 75 percent of the  
years he played in the NBA. Shoes, a large assortment of stuff. I 
thought this would be a great opportunity to jump on for DiMaggio. 
But I can't do it.''

<HEADLINE> NYC's Murder Rate Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a steady decline in New York City's murder  
rate, early indicators for 1999 show a slight rise in homicides 
when compared with the first months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Through March 7, 115 murders have been reported in the city this  
year, 6 more than last year, or a 5.5 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest statistics were discussed by Police Commissioner  
Howard Safir at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homicides, like all crimes, have peaks and valleys,'' Safir  
said. Overall, reported crime was down 14 percent for the period, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary analysis shows that of the slayings with known  
motives, 21 stemmed from domestic violence or family disputes, 
compared with 11 by March 7 of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 629 murders in New York last year, the lowest total  
since the 1960s. Safir said that even if this year's total reached 
700, it would still be the second-lowest since 1967.

<HEADLINE> UConn Coach Calhoun To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Jim Calhoun, who has guided Connecticut to three  
trips to NCAA tournament's round of eight, was expected to miss the 
Huskies' first-round game Thursday night against Texas-San Antonio 
because of an intestinal virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun developed ``virus-like'' symptoms Thursday morning, but  
was able to conduct Connecticut's game-day shootaround. He decided 
to skip the Texas-San Antonio game after being examined by 
Connecticut trainer Joe Sharpe and the school's director of sports 
medicine, Dr. Jeffrey Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar symptoms caused Calhoun to miss the Huskies' 95-58  
victory over Hartford on Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut assistant Dave Leitao will take over for Calhoun as  
the top-seeded Huskies play 16th-seeded Texas-San Antonio in the 
West Regional. A No. 16 seed has never beaten a No. 1 seed since 
the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun is in his 13th season at Connecticut. Since he took over  
in 1986, the Huskies have gone 298-120, earning eight NCAA 
tournament bids and advancing to the round of sixteen six times.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Spokesman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Monica Lewinsky drama, abruptly 
resigned Thursday after Starr asked the Justice Department to 
investigate him in connection with a recent press leak. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a Jan. 31 article in The New York Times that  
reported Starr had concluded President Clinton could legally be 
indicted while still in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly went on national television the day after the article  
appeared and said the ``information did not come from our office. 
... We did not leak this information. ... We do not leak grand jury 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's referral to the Justice Department came after his office  
conducted its own inquiry, according to a source familiar with the 
situation. The inquiry indicated Bakaly may have had some 
involvement in the leak, but he denied wrongdoing, said the source, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bakaly's attorney nor Starr's office would disclose the  
findings of the inquiry into the leak, but both made clear in 
prepared statements that it played a role in Bakaly's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having been provided with the preliminary results of the  
internal investigation, this office has referred the matter to the 
Department of Justice,'' Starr said in a statement. Starr said he 
accepted the resignation with ``regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly's lawyer, Howard Shapiro, said in a statement that his  
client would cooperate ``in every way'' with the Justice inquiry 
and said he was ``confident that he will be found not to have 
violated any statute, regulation or court order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that it was Mr. Bakaly's job as OIC spokesman to respond  
to media inquiries concerning the OIC's work, it is no surprise 
that he has been interviewed in connection with the inquiry being 
conducted by the Department of Justice,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly's resignation is to take effect June 1, but Starr placed  
him on paid administrative leave in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed that Starr  
referred the Bakaly matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not yet received the investigative materials in  
connection with the matter from the FBI agents assigned to the 
Office of Independent Counsel,'' Marlin said. ``When we receive it, 
we will determine how best to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times story came at a sensitive time for Starr because a  
federal judge already was investigating his office regarding 
allegations of leaks of grand jury material in the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the January news story, Starr had said he was  
``deeply troubled'' by the latest leak and ordered a review. 
Clinton's lawyer, meanwhile, complained to the judge overseeing the 
case that the report amounted to another illegal leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly did not immediately return a call to his home seeking  
comment Thursday. His lawyer was out of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shapiro said in the statement that his client joined Starr's  
staff ``during a high-profile phase and unavoidably controversial 
phase of the OIC's investigation to communicate the OIC's work to 
the media and public. With that high-profile phase of the OIC's 
work now largely completed, this is a logical time for Mr. Bakaly 
to make the transition back to the private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly, a bespectacled lawyer who also acted as spokesman for  
Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz's investigation of former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, was the official who announced 
from the steps of the Capitol that Starr had sent a referral to 
Congress alleging possible impeachable offenses late last summer.

<HEADLINE> 'Lion In Winter' Draws Roars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``What family doesn't have its ups and downs,''  
sighs Eleanor of Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, most don't reach the depths -- or heights -- achieved by  
Eleanor and her estranged husband, Henry II, king of England, in 
``The Lion in Winter.'' James Goldman's comedy is being splendidly 
revived on Broadway by the Roundabout Theater Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Family Feud 1183 A.D. where not only are the  
barbarians at the gate, they are in the castle, as father, mother 
and three sons battle, bribe and backstab their way to power. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite a fight, particularly since the joustings, verbal and  
otherwise, are led by Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing, two 
terrific performers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishburne plays Henry II, king of England and a lot of France,  
too. Channing is Eleanor, his catty, clawing wife who has been 
imprisoned for leading several rebellions against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it's Christmas time -- ``What shall we hang, the holly or  
each other?'' the king remarks -- so Eleanor has been given 
temporary freedom to prowl the castle. 
</P>
<P>
	She stirs up quite a bit of trouble. The question is, who will  
succeed Henry on the throne? The king favors his youngest son, 
John, a pimply, unpleasant youth. The queen wants her oldest child, 
Richard Lionheart, to succeed his father. Then there's the 
calculating middle child, Geoffrey, determined to support whichever 
brother will make him chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
	Causing additional grief is Philip, the ambitious young king of  
France and brother to Henry's young mistress, Alais. Philip 
connives with the best of them, using his sister and his affection 
for Richard for his own gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliances switch, collapse and then reconfigure as the  
combatants on stage look out only for themselves. Conspiracy is the 
order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's vaguely historical play is deliberately anachronistic.  
He uses real people in made-up circumstances. The language and some 
of the situations are oddly modern. So are the relationships, which 
are simultaneously funny and scary.These folks could use a good 
dose of family therapy. But then Christmas always brings out the 
worst in people. 
</P>
<P>
	Channing is delicious. Dressed in fur and bright red, she first  
enters with guns blazing, wittily dismissing her sons and eager to 
settle scores with her errant husband. She is one of those 
performers whose comic timing not only gets laughs but builds 
character. Yet the actress manages to get a little heartache into 
her portrayal, too, particularly in one poignant moment as she 
watches Henry kiss his young mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishburne roars with the power of an aging lion, a beast who  
realizes that he soon will be toothless and forced to pass his 
power to a younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the three sons, Chuma Hunter-Gault, Neal Huff and Keith Nobbs  
are distinctive types: Hunter-Gault all-bluster as Richard, Huff 
all-conniving as Geoffrey and Nobbs all-whining as John. Roger 
Howarth effectively insinuates himself into their lives as the 
sexually ambiguous Philip. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mayer directs the play in full battle mode. He doesn't  
allow the pace to slacken or the actors to let down their guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Better known as a movie than a play (the film starred Peter  
O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn), ``The Lion in Winter'' is 
relentless in its pursuit of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, who died last year, once said ``The Lion in Winter'' is  
``concerned with things that ordinarily are somber: hatred, 
vengeance, lost love, greed, the threat of death, to name a few.'' 
It is, indeed, but it laughs all the way -- and in high style -- to 
its final curtain.

<HEADLINE> Scarlet Letter Stands on Lawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYSIDE, Wash. (AP) -- The 7-foot-tall scarlet ``A'' in Dixie  
Lyczewski's front yard will stay, but at least the flashing strobe 
light has been turned off. 
</P>
<P>
	The yard display is a result of a dispute between Mrs. Lyczewski  
and her husband, Tim. They separated last August after 26 years of 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 20-year-old daughter, Tarah, built the display using  
plastic irrigation pipe wrapped in red garlands three months ago. 
It's shaped like the letter ``A,'' as in ``adultery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she got the idea from Nathaniel Hawthorne's ``The  
Scarlet Letter'' after her father began dating and moved in with 
another woman before her parents' divorce was final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were raised with high morals,'' she said. ``I told my dad  
that we'll take it down if he stops living with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Lyczewski said he is frustrated about the display, but a  
restraining order prevents him from getting a close look at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to do it to embarrass me, but they're doing a  
better job of embarrassing themselves,'' he said. ``They see it as 
an affair. I'm 48 years old, and I see it as a relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyczewski agreed to turn off a flashing strobe light on the  
display on Tuesday after 208 residents filed a petition to have the 
display removed and the city brought a public-nuisance complaint.

<HEADLINE> New Test Can Detect Growth Hormones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Scientists say they have developed a 100-percent  
accurate blood test for human growth hormones injected by athletes 
to enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Christian Strasburger of Innenstadt University Hospital in  
Munich, Germany, says his test could be used to catch cheaters in 
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney if the International Olympic 
Committee's medical commission accepts it. 
</P>
<P>
	Strasburger collaborated with a scientific team commissioned by  
the IOC that is developing several tests to detect substances such 
as human growth hormones, or HGH. None of the tests have yet been 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Strasburger's study explaining the technique,  
published in Friday's issue of the British medical journal The 
Lancet, ``the dogma of 'undetectability' of HGH misuse no longer 
holds true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Peter Sonksen, an endocrinologist based at London's St.  
Thomas' Hospital who is coordinating the IOC's team, said that 
while the German test is a valuable contribution, ``it's not the 
kind of test the IOC could take to court and hang an athlete 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strasburger's method would need to be further evaluated and  
proven across ethnic and gender lines in a larger sample before it 
could be considered as part of a package of tests that could be 
defended in court, Sonksen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC repeatedly has said it will not introduce blood testing  
at the Olympics unless a 100-percent accurate test is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Substances that mimic naturally occurring hormones in the body  
have become the drugs of choice in sports because they cannot be 
detected by current testing methods, which involve only urine 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Human growth hormone, which helps build muscles, is one of two  
such drugs officials believe athletes use to cheat. The other -- 
erythropoietin, or EPO -- is an endurance-boosting hormone that 
increases the blood's ability to carry oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study of 155 people, the test correctly identified all 30  
blood samples containing the artificial hormone and eliminated the 
125 that did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The samples were taken from patients in Denmark and sent to  
Strasburger's German lab identified only with numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique is based on the ability to distinguish between  
natural growth hormone and the type that is injected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they look identical, the natural version consists of a  
mix of several different molecular forms. The drug version consists 
of only one form, Strasburger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the injected hormone suppresses the production of the  
natural variety, the test was designed to look for the natural 
hormone's molecular blend. If the blend is absent, the test 
concludes the subject injected the synthetic form. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples must be drawn from a vein, but only a very small  
vial is needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The test can only detect the drug within 36 hours of injection,  
Strasburger said, so athletes would have to be screened at random 
during training.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Shooting Movie-Goer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A man was charged with assault for allegedly  
shooting a fellow movie-goer who complained about his loud, 
sarcastic commentary during a screening of ``Analyze This.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Kubeck and girlfriend Karen McLean sat in front of Kelvin  
and Christina Kirkpatrick on Saturday, according to court documents 
filed by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubeck, 34, began loudly criticizing McLean and the movie about  
a mob boss who needs counseling. After several others asked him to 
be quiet, Kelvin Kirkpatrick sought out the theater manager. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean allegedly hit Kirkpatrick as he walked past, and  
Kirkpatrick told her he was going to call the police. McLean then 
tried to block the theater exit, and Kubeck struck McLean from 
behind, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men began wrestling on the floor. When Kirkpatrick was  
on top of Kubeck, telling him to calm down, Kubeck allegedly pulled 
out a .38-caliber handgun and shot Kirkpatrick in the stomach 
before raising the gun to Kirkpatrick's head, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers, Kubeck used a racial slur and yelled:  
``I'm going to kill you.'' Kirkpatrick, a former Marine who is 
black, jammed his thumb under the hammer of the gun to keep it from 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubeck, who is being held on $250,000 bail, is to be arraigned  
Monday. If convicted on the assault charge, he could be sentenced 
to seven to 10 years in prison, plus another five years for use of 
a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkpatrick was released Monday from Harborview Medical Center.  
Kubeck was treated at Valley Medical Center for injuries to his 
face and nose, and then jailed.

<HEADLINE> Man's Arm Reattached in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A doctor reattached a man's left arm after  
he fell off a ladder while trimming a tree and severed the limb 
with a chainsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariano Mergarejo, 66, lost his balance and fell almost 20 feet  
Sunday. The chainsaw cut off his forearm. As he lay dazed on the 
ground, his wife wrapped the limb in a towel and his 30-year-old 
son called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very sad, more sad than frightened,'' Mergarejo said.  
``I didn't want to lose my arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joanne Werntz, the trauma surgeon on call at Orlando  
Regional Medical Center, performed the nine-hour operation, getting 
to work minutes after the accident. In such cases, time is crucial 
to success. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only have one chance,'' Ms. Werntz said. ``It's worth  
putting the limb back on and it's better to at least try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mergarejo must undergo another operation and six months of  
physical therapy. Ms. Werntz said it may be two years before he 
regains feeling in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was significant damage, but he will have feeling,'' she  
said. ``The emotional and psychological aspects are better than 
having to deal with an amputation and prosthesis.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court Rules on Spousal Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Abused spouses can be justified in  
killing their mates even if they fail to leave home to avoid the 
violence, the Florida Supreme Court said Thursday, reversing a 
ruling it made 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1982 decision did not allow victims of domestic abuse to  
rely on the ``castle doctrine'' for self-defense, ruling victims 
could have fled rather than use lethal force to protect themselves 
from an abuser. The ``castle doctrine'' is based on the premise 
that a person's home is his or her castle, and can be defended with 
lethal force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We join the majority of jurisdictions that do not impose a  
duty to retreat from the residence when a defendant uses deadly 
force in self-defense, if that force is necessary to prevent death 
or great bodily harm from a co-occupant,'' Justice Barbara Pariente 
wrote for the 5-2 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court ordered judges to instruct juries that defendants  
attacked in their own homes have the right to ``meet force with 
force'' regardless of their relationship to the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision also applies to self-defense by children,  
parents and unmarried partners living in the home, or by guests. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion quashed an appeals court affirmation of a murder  
conviction and 18-year prison sentence for Kathleen Weiand in the 
1994 shooting of her husband, Todd Weiand. 
</P>
<P>
	She was freed from prison, however, even before the Supreme  
Court ruled. On Christmas Eve, former Gov. Buddy MacKay and the 
Florida Cabinet granted clemency to Ms. Weiand and five other women 
who killed husbands or boyfriends -- and in one case a father. All 
were diagnosed as suffering from ``battered women's syndrome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1982 decision appeared to be ``grounded upon the sanctity of  
property and possessory rights, rather than the sanctity of human 
life'' and the ``common myth that the victims of domestic violence 
are free to leave the battering relationship any time,'' Pariente 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Attitudes and knowledge about domestic violence have changed  
since then, she wrote, noting studies that show women who flee may 
increase the danger that they will be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Charles Wells and Leander Shaw dissented, writing that  
they were worried it could be misread as sanctioning retaliatory 
violence.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Trade Thomas for Bucks' Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers gave up on Tim Thomas  
Thursday, trading the former lottery pick and Scott Williams to the 
Milwaukee Bucks for Tyrone Hill and Jerald Honeycutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a week of admonitions from coach Larry Brown that the  
Sixers would only trade Thomas if they got an extraordinary offer, 
this deal was far from a blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the seventh pick in the 1997 draft by New Jersey, had  
fallen into a mopup role after being tabbed as the cornerstone of a 
trade in which the Sixers parted with the draft rights to Keith Van 
Horn two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who turns 31 next week, was an All-Star with Cleveland in  
1995 before he was traded to the Bucks with Terrell Brandon in the 
deal that sent Vin Baker to Seattle and Shawn Kemp to the 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeycutt, the Bucks' second-round draft pick in 1997, appeared  
in only three games for Milwaukee this season. Williams has been 
out with stress fractures in both legs and isn't expected back for 
at least two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams started talking about the deal just before the 6 p.m.  
trade deadline and needed more than three hours to finalize it. 
Hill and Honeycutt will join the team Friday night against the New 
Jersey Nets, who acquired Stephon Marbury from Minnesota earlier in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In a minor trade, the Sixers sent the rights to Turkish forward  
Mirsad Turkcan to the New York Knicks for a conditional first-round 
draft pick. The Knicks will give the 76ers a first-round pick that 
originally belonged to Toronto. The Knicks acquired it from the 
Raptors in the John Wallace trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The pick is lottery-protected, meaning the Sixers can't use it  
until the Raptors make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thomas played only eight minutes in an 85-70 victory over  
Charlotte on Wednesday night, Brown said he'd only consider trading 
Thomas for a ``stone-tough'' forward or center, a top swingman or 
``three first-round picks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Hill, he got option No. 1. The 6-foot-9 forward is a  
workaholic under the basket, an outstanding rebounder and a veteran 
who might help youngsters like Nazr Mohammed develop into post 
players. Playing 30 minutes a game for the Bucks, Hill averaged 8.6 
points and 7.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who left Villanova after his freshman year, was  
averaging 4.6 points and was 5-for-19 on 3-point shots. Before the 
trade, he said he would welcome a change if his playing time wasn't 
going to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to stay,'' Thomas said. ``But at the same time, the  
relief is going to come to me when I'm back on the court doing 
things I know I can do. I don't want to sit forever. But it's not 
in my shoes to decide who goes out on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkcan, the 18th pick overall of the 1998 draft, is currently  
playing for Efes Pilssen of the Turkish League. He will be eligible 
to join the Knicks in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by Houston, then was traded to Philadelphia after  
the lockout ended to clear salary cap space for the Rockets' 
acquisition of Scottie Pippen.

<HEADLINE> Orioles in Cuba Set Up Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A logistical team arrived in Cuba on Thursday  
night to begin preparing for the Baltimore Orioles' historic game 
with the Cuban national team on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy to be here,'' Sandy Alderson, the executive  
vice president of baseball operations in the commissioner's office, 
said. ``We're hoping to work out the details of the game in the 
next few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson and other baseball executives were to meet later  
Thursday night with Cuban sports officials. On Friday, they were to 
inspect Latinoamericano Stadium to ensure it meets major league 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	After two months of negotiations among the State Department,  
Cuban government, the commissioner's office, the Orioles and the 
players' association, the sides finally reached an agreement 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from this game and one between Cuba and the Orioles in  
Baltimore later this year will be used mainly to support baseball 
and other sports activities in the two countries, major league 
baseball said. It was a sticking point in the negotiations because 
the Clinton administration did not want profits to go to Castro's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The game will be the first in 40 years involving a major league  
baseball team in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball teams used to visit Cuba regularly, but  
the last were the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers, who 
played exhibition games there in March 1959, about 2 1/2 months after 
Fidel Castro's revolution ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban team will play a return exhibition game at Camden  
Yards. The second game will be played either just before Baltimore 
starts the regular season April 5 or on an off day during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is the No. 1 sport in Cuban and Cubans are looking  
forward to the game as a chance to see how well their players can 
compete against players in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving the United States for Cuba on Thursday, Alderson  
said there wasn't much time to prepare, but saw no major obstacles 
that could undermine the goodwill mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting tremendous cooperation from Cuban officials in  
Washington and from the State Department,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A groundskeeping consultant was among those on the trip to check  
out the stadium. The biggest problem appears to be lack of padding 
on the outfield wall, but Alderson said the commissioner's office 
is helping Cuba sports officials fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very intensive,'' Alderson said of the  
two-day trip.

<HEADLINE> IOC Set for `Painful' Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Describing next week's IOC meeting as the most  
important of his presidency, Juan Antonio Samaranch has told 
members they must take ``painful'' decisions to clean up after the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to all International Olympic Committee members,  
Samaranch also said the organization needs to make ``structural 
changes'' to restore its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called an extraordinary IOC general assembly next  
Wednesday and Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to deal with the 
worst crisis in the organization's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The session will vote on the expulsions of at least five members  
in connection with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members have already resigned.  
</P>
<P>
	The assembly will also vote on a series of reform measures,  
including an overhaul of the bidding and site-selection process for 
the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Samaranch's letter, dated March 9, was obtained by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must confess that I consider the coming extraordinary  
session one of the most important in our history, and the most 
important of my presidency,'' said Samaranch, who has been in power 
since 1980. ``Our duty requires that we take concrete decisions, in 
some cases painful ones, for the whole world will be observing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and Samaranch have come under severe attack from outside  
critics following revelations of cash payments and other improper 
inducements received by IOC members from Salt Lake and other bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must defend our organization, and the Olympic Games,  
through our future actions,'' Samaranch said. ``We must also defend 
the honor and integrity of our members ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the support of international federations and national  
Olympic committees, Samaranch said, ``I am convinced that ... we 
will succeed in bringing about the structural changes that are 
necessary for us to be able to move toward the third millennium 
with confidence and determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am counting on you all to contribute ... to defining a new  
policy for the IOC, in a spirit of renewed unity,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also told members the conclusion of the IOC's  
investigation into the Salt Lake scandal has been delayed and won't 
go before the executive board until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the best efforts and sacrifices of the commission  
members, the report has not yet been finalized,'' he said. ``It 
appears that it will take longer to conclude than was originally 
planned. As soon as it is complete, it will be submitted to the 
executive board for its meeting on 15th March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members resigned or were ousted in the first phase of the  
inquiry that concluded in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the IOC inquiry panel has been looking into 19 other  
cases -- three holdovers from the first phase, plus 16 additional 
names cited in a Salt Lake ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one more member is expected to be expelled in the  
latest phase, while the bulk of the others are expected to be 
exonerated or receive warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, an IOC member since 1987,  
will be ousted under the recommendation of the six-man panel, 
Olympic sources familiar with the case have told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork was named in a Utah ethics report last month that said  
his wife, Julia, borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief Tom 
Welch ``to help a friend in a serious situation.'' The report said 
the money, withdrawn by Welch from his children's' trust fund, was 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those still under investigation from the first phase is  
South Korean executive board member Kim Un-yong, the highest 
ranking IOC delegate implicated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim faces allegations that he used Olympic connections to help  
secure lucrative jobs for his children in broadcasting and 
entertainment. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--A former organizer at the heart of the Salt Lake Olympic  
bribery scandal says the senior U.S. official of the games knew 
about the vote-buying scheme. Dave Johnson, who was senior vice 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and long involved 
in the city's Olympic campaign, told The New York Times that he 
discussed ``everything'' about the program with IOC member Anita 
DeFrantz. DeFrantz, now an IOC vice president, denied Johnson's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC leader Mitt Romney announced a hiring freeze, reductions  
in staff travel and other cuts to save $14 million. He also 
highlighted $84 million worth of expenses -- including extra 
furniture, decorations, and a planned memorial plaza -- that are not 
crucial to the games and should be contingent on revenue.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ministers To Meet Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Positive signs are beginning to emerge  
about Brazil's struggling economy just as the country's top two 
economic officials embark on a world tour aimed at restoring 
Brazil's credibility with investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank President Arminio Fraga and Finance Minister Pedro  
Malan were scheduled to hold separate meetings with investors in 
New York, London and Frankfurt Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their task could be considerably easier now thanks to some good  
news on the economic front. 
</P>
<P>
	First off is a newly revamped agreement with the International  
Monetary Fund, expected to clear the way for Brazil to receive a 
second installment of the $41.5 billion rescue package stitched 
together in November. Brazil received a first payment of $9.5 
billion last December and a second $9.2 billion tranche could be 
released in early April. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the original accord had to be revised after Brazil  
floated its currency, the real, in January. Since then the real has 
lost some 35 percent of its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Devaluation opened the door to inflation, but it has not gotten  
out of control. Analysts say there are signs that inflationary 
pressure has eased somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer prices in the city of Sao Paulo rose 1.2 percent  
between Feb. 8 and March 7, compared with the previous four-week 
period, the University of Sao Paulo's Economic Research Institute 
said Thursday. But it was lower than the 1.4 percent registered at 
the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling things could improve,'' said the  
institute's president Juarez Rizzieri. ``If the real continues 
gaining strength, inflation should come in at a manageable 1.5 or 2 
percent at the end of March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency markets, the real was being traded at 1.88 to  
the dollar on Thursday, slightly weaker than Wednesday's closing of 
1.86 but much stronger than the 2.23 in late February. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Getulio Vargas Foundation released a broader  
inflation index that measures consumer, wholesale and construction 
prices, showing they had risen 4.4 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the foundation's directors, Paulo Sidney de Melo Cota,  
said prices rose because of the currency devaluation, but should 
decline as the economic slowdown constricts demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the government said it is working with an  
assumption that inflation would be 16.8 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	During their tour, Fraga and Malan also hope to show that Brazil  
is determined to put its economic house in order, underscoring this 
week's approval by Congress of a key austerity measures seen as one 
of chief underpinnings of the IMF agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to raise  
a financial transaction tax from 0.2 percent to 0.38 percent, which 
is expected to yield $8 billion in revenue a year. The second vote 
required for the measure to become law is scheduled for next week. 
The Senate approved the measure in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga said he has ``received good signs'' by foreign banks on  
their exposure in Brazil, estimated at about $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many have decided to maintain credit lines, none has told me  
lines would reduced, and a few said they planned to increase credit 
lines to Brazil in the near future,'' Fraga said.

<HEADLINE> Drought Emergency Declared in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush declared an emergency  
in two-thirds of the state Thursday amid worries that the unusually 
dry winter may give way to a summertime drought more ruinous than 
last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency declaration in 167 of the state's 254 counties  
makes Texas eligible for federal aid, which Bush said is needed to 
pay for the movement of firefighting equipment to areas that may 
soon need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to pray for rain,'' Bush said as state  
officials reported that farmers and ranchers already are being hurt 
and reservoir levels are dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, bone-dry weather turned the Texas landscape into a  
tinderbox, sparking more than 10,000 wildfires. The drought 
devastated the state's major crops. More than one-fourth of the 
corn crop was lost, two thirds of the cotton and hay shriveled up 
and close to half of the sorghum, used primarily as animal feed, 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	This year is looking like it could be worse.  
</P>
<P>
	The state has had way below-normal rainfall since the first of  
the year, according to Carl Anderson, agricultural extension 
economist at Texas A&AMP;M University. Last year, the drought began in 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is truly in peril,'' said Texas Agriculture  
Commissioner Susan Combs. ``They simply cannot make it when you 
have drought coupled with low and falling prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I hope that weather forecasts for continued dry and  
warm weather in Texas are proven wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Forest Service said fire danger is increasing across  
Central and West Texas, much of which never recovered from last 
year. The wildfire potential already is greater in parts of West 
Texas and the Panhandle than it was in May 1998, the service said. 
In addition, spring winds are further drying out grazing lands. 
</P>
<P>
	If a drought materializes, it will be the third in four years  
for the nation's second-largest state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the same point today that we were in May and June  
last year,'' said Forest Service Director Jim Hull, who described 
conditions as ``desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state is spending $167,000 a week to position firefighting  
equipment. Last year, during the height of the drought, Texas spent 
$5 million a week, which included the cost of bringing in emergency 
equipment and personnel from outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers and ranchers, still struggling from last year, are  
reporting problems. Boll weevils, beetles that destroy cotton, are 
proliferating because cash-strapped farmers cannot pay for 
eradication. And hay for livestock feed is in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	In far West Texas, reservoir storage is at 23 percent of  
capacity and the lower Rio Grande Valley region is entering its 
sixth year of drought.

<HEADLINE> Texas Under Drought Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush declared an emergency  
today in 167 of Texas' 254 counties because of a year-long drought 
that has persisted because of a lack of the usual winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said this year's drought ``could be as bad or worse than  
the devastation we experienced last year,'' so Texans need to 
conserve water, reduce fire risks and position firefighting 
equipment and personnel in areas of danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 drought parched cropland and sparked hundreds of  
wildfires around the state. Carl Anderson, agricultural extension 
economist at Texas A&AMP;M University, reported two weeks ago that last 
year's drought reduced farm and ranch production values by more 
than $2.4 billion from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said today that dry weather this year has gotten an  
even earlier start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's drought really kicked off the first part of March.  
As it stands right now, this year has had way below-normal rainfall 
since the first of the year,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	What's worse, Bush said in declaring the emergency for the  
western half of the state, ``forecasters predict a dry spring, and 
we know our summers are dry in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he was asking President Clinton for an emergency  
declaration to help the state prepare firefighting teams and gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Senate has approved an emergency appropriation of $25  
million for the Texas Department of Agriculture to assist 
drought-battered cotton farmers in eradicating boll weevils. House 
approval was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs says her agency also is  
taking action to help farmers and ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are already getting calls from livestock producers about  
hay supplies running low,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Combs also said she has contacted agriculture officials in  
other states -- including Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, 
Georgia, and North and South Carolina -- about the possible need for 
donated hay this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that weather forecasts for continued dry and warm  
weather in Texas are proven wrong,'' she said. ``However, if we are 
entering another dry spell, I want to have all the resources in 
place so we can take action quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Marbury Says Nets Have Acquired Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stephon Marbury went on the radio this afternoon  
and said he had been traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the 
New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the two teams could not immediately confirm a  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury said he had heard of the trade from his agent, David  
Falk, and had spoken to Nets co-owner Lewis Katz. Speaking from the 
West Coast on WFAN in New York, Marbury said he planned to fly 
cross country and join the Nets for their game Friday at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	WFAN said the Nets would send Sam Cassell, Chris Gatling and  
Brian Evans to the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who is from Brooklyn, said he was elated to be  
returning home, and would immediately sign a long-term extension 
with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sign tomorrow. It'll be signed tomorrow,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are off to the worst start in the Eastern Conference at  
3-15, including five straight losses that have raised questions 
about coach John Calipari's job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury had helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West. At 12-6, they are only two games behind 
Utah in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk met with Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor about 10 days ago  
to discuss Marbury's future, and Marbury turned down a six-year 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury has long expressed a desire to play for the New York  
Knicks, and it's clear he saw the Nets as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's New York, but it's not New York. It's New Jersey,'' he  
said. ``When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first 
thing they think is that's the other New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell has played in only two games since spraining his ankle  
in the season opener. Gatling had asked to be traded, and Evans was 
showcased in heavy minutes Wednesday night in a loss to the Pacers.

<HEADLINE> NBA Trade Deadline Closing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With half of the NBA ineligible to be dealt and the Glen Rice  
trade completed, tonight's NBA trading deadline activity should be 
lighter than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't put a lid on all the trade talk.  
</P>
<P>
	Rumors were at full strength around the league, from a Stephon  
Marbury-to-New Jersey scenario to the minor Terry Mills and Duane 
Causwell-for-Don MacLean, and Vitaly Potapenko-for-Andrew DeClercq 
swaps that only the real NBA diehards could love. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets coach John Calipari, after losing at Indiana, hinted that  
there was one major deal he considered interesting, and various 
reports said a trade was being discussed that would send Kerry 
Kittles or Sam Cassell and a No. 1 pick to Minnesota for Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-rumored Rice deal finally went down Wednesday as  
Charlotte sent the three-time All-Star to the ever-changing Los 
Angeles Lakers. Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones go to the Hornets, 
and J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong were sent to Rodman-Rambisland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this takes us one step closer to our ultimate goal of  
having an NBA championship team,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With other teams also feeling like legitimate championship  
contenders in this first season of the post-Michael Jordan era, 
there was plenty of trade talk going around. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the discussions centered on Milwaukee point guard  
Terrell Brandon, who will be a free agent at the end of the season 
and has refused to sign an extension with the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're just dealing the cards. The bidding is not in  
yet,'' Bucks coach George Karl said Tuesday night 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday night, the bidding was getting interesting.  
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the talks said a number of multiple-team  
trades -- perhaps even a four-team swap -- were being discussed 
involving Brandon, although none of those proposed deals could be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the names popping up in rumors were Jermaine O'Neal and  
Kelvin Cato of Portland, Derek Anderson, Cedric Henderson and 
Potapenko of Cleveland, Mills and Causwell of Miami, Terry Cummings 
of Golden State, MacLean of Seattle, Tim Thomas of Philadelphia, 
Tyrone Hill and Elliot Perry of the Bucks and Kendall Gill and 
Chris Gatling of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks were known to be discussing a Gatling deal with the  
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teams were interested in acquiring one of the Los  
Angeles Clippers' players whose contract expires at the end of the 
season, such as Lorenzen Wright, Lamond Murray or Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	But as always, it was likely there would be much more talk than  
action -- especially with about 200 players ineligible to be dealt 
under the league's new ``six-month rule'' which says a player can't 
be traded within six months of the day he signs unless it's a 
prearranged sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league is conservative and this season is too crazy and  
too short to make major personnel decisions,'' Karl said. ``I think 
you're going to see everybody wait, except for maybe little 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks have been gauging the market for the past few weeks,  
trying to decide what to do with Brandon, who has said he'll hold 
to his plans to test the free agent market, even if he is traded 
before the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I get an offer that absolutely knocks my socks off, I'm  
not going to trade him,'' Bucks general manager Bob Weinhauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockbuster Lakers-Hornets deal, rumored for over a month,  
came as the Lakers were on an eight-game winning streak that was 
extended to nine with yet another victory over the Clippers -- the 
Lakers' fourth of the season against their crosstown rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to trade such good players, and  
especially so when they are such quality people,'' West said. ``But

	The 25 percent turnover of their roster followed by two weeks  
the firing of coach Del Harris and hiring of Kurt Rambis as his 
successor, as well as the signing of forward Dennis Rodman, the 
NBA's leading rebounder for the last seven seasons.

<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove

<HEADLINE> Gymnast Moceanu Resumes Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The tiny gymnast who at age 14  
captivated millions during the 1996 Olympics is 10 inches taller, 
25 pounds heavier and, Dominique Moceanu said, feels at least a 
decade older. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moceanu, now 17 years old and 5-foot-2, is determined to  
make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to show all those people who doubted me that I can do  
it,'' said Moceanu. ``I want to show them I can do it on my own, 
despite everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu, who has been training at least six hours a day since  
she arrived 3 1/2 weeks ago at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., said she's happy with her progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to get back into competitive shape,'' said  
Moceanu, who had not been in a gym in four months before arriving 
in Colorado Springs to resume training. ``But it's coming along 
faster than I thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my style and my technique is better ... but I've got  
to definitely work on my strength,'' said Moceanu, who said she's 
having the most trouble on the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	She will travel to China on April 5 with Team USA to participate  
in her first competition since she became embroiled in a highly 
publicized legal battle for independence from her father. She 
acknowledges there will be a lot of pressure at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now everyone is waiting to see what Dominique is going to  
do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is watching, the whole world is watching to see what  
I'm going to do. But I'm used to this. And I've gone through too 
much to let it get me down now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The young gymnast also wants to compete in this year's world  
championships, with the ultimate goal of making it to Sydney for 
the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu, who is back with her old coach, Luminita Miscenco, of  
last year, said she decided to come to Colorado to train because of 
the low overhead at the U.S. Olympic Training Center and the 
positive atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be around so many athletes with similar goals,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old gymnast credits Miscenco with reviving her  
career last year. Moceanu sought legal adulthood after her father 
fired Miscenco in October, and she is still not talking to her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 gold medal-winning  
Olympic team and finished ninth in the all-around competition.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials shot within striking  
distance of 10,000 today, breaking through both 9,800 and 9,900 for 
the first time before giving up some of their gains. A rebound in 
oil prices from 12-year lows, which has lifted oil stocks, and 
continued strength in the economy have been propelling the stock 
market to new heights. The blue-chip stock barometer closed up 
124.60 at 9,897.44, after pulling back from a high of 9,935.46 
earlier in the session. NYSE advancers led decliners 1,654-1,339.

Clinton's name that was taken out for their Whitewater land

	BONN, Germany (AP) -- In the biggest upheaval yet in Germany's

sharp differences with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on economic 
policy. After months of uneasy cooperation, left-leaning Finance 
Minister Oskar Lafontaine lost a power struggle to the 
business-friendly Schroeder, signaling a consolidation of the 
chancellor's power. Lafontaine was blamed for destabilizing the 
euro and the German economy with his left-leaning policies, and his 
resignation triggered a share surge in the euro's value to about 
$1.10, from $1.08.

aren't any groups that I could say that we could arm today that 
would march on Baghdad and successfully achieve regime change,'' 
Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni told the House Armed Services Committee.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize GOP Over Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest dustup over the 2000 census,  
House Democrats criticized reports Thursday that Republican leaders 
are planning a major campaign against White House plans to use a 
mix of traditional and scientific methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans oppose use of ``statistical sampling.'' Democrats  
argue it will produce a more accurate accounting of the nation's 
population than the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hastily scheduled news conference, Democrats denounced a  
published report that said Republicans were preparing for a budget 
fight over the census issue that could result in another shutdown 
of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., a sampling advocate, said it was  
``outrageous'' that Republicans were ``willing to undermine the 
entire census to keep political power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report in the Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, said House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has enlisted former Rep. Bill 
Paxon, R-N.Y., to prepare House Republicans for a budget fight over 
the census. The newspaper also said Paxon and a team of political 
consultants were mapping plans to win over the public, including a 
paid media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do think the American people need to know that any effort  
to have a two-count census is going to diminish'' the count, said 
Hastert spokesman John Feehery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 census, which was the first to be less accurate than  
the one before, missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4 million 
people twice. Subsequently, the National Academy of Sciences 
endorsed sampling for the 2000 count. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans took their objections to court, and the Supreme  
Court ruled in January that sampling is unconstitutional for the 
process of redistributing the 435 seats in the House. But the court 
said the law requires its use for other purposes, such as the 
annual distribution of billions of dollars in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director, has announced that  
the agency will produce two separate population counts for the 
census. One will be based on a traditional door-to-door count and 
be used to reshuffle House seats; the other will use sampling to 
find people missed during the first count and produce what 
administration officials say will be a more accurate census. 
</P>
<P>
	The census, which begins on April 1, 2000, involves mailing  
questionnaires to some 100 million households and sending workers 
to find those who don't respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Government Reform census subcommittee  
cleared four measures by its chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., 
that are among a package of proposals Miller says will produce a 
more accurate census without sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills, which advanced to the full House Government Reform  
Committee, would mandate a follow-up mailing of census forms; 
require that they be available in 33 languages, including Braille; 
authorize an additional $300 million for Census Bureau advertising 
and outreach; and require the commerce secretary to administer $26 
million in matching grants for outreach by local governments and 
community groups.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady's Absence Raises Eyebrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Was it pique or a bad back that kept Hillary  
Rodham Clinton home? 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News reported this week that Mrs. Clinton decided not to  
accompany President Clinton to Central America because of a 
disagreement -- not the officially cited reason of an aggravated 
back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was denied by Marsha Berry, the first lady's  
spokeswoman and was disparaged by Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, chatting with a few reporters Tuesday night, said his  
wife, even in pain, probably would have joined him on the Central 
America trip to view damage from Hurricane Mitch, but she didn't 
want to risk ``completely ruining her back for Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady and the Clintons' daughter are scheduled to leave  
March 20 for a tour of Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who deal with this sort of rumor and gossip and innuendo  
should go back to journalism school and do a little more work,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry called the speculation ``not true.''  
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to rest up so she could go (to Africa),'' Berry  
said.

<HEADLINE> AOL, SBC Agree on Internet Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online customers in California,  
Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas may be able to speed 
their access to the Internet under an agreement reached Thursday 
between AOL and SBC Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC will provide high-speed Internet connections through digital  
lines of Southwest Bell and Pacific Bell, which it owns. SBC 
currently provides high-speed digital lines to 2 million homes and 
hopes to increase that number to 8.4 million by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	In January, AOL, the nation's largest Internet service provider,  
announced a similar deal with Bell Atlantic Corp., which hopes to 
have the high-speed connection available to 7.5 million homes in 
the Northeast by the end of the year. Under the Bell Atlantic deal, 
customers would pay about $20 a month for the high-speed connection 
to AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	At a typical speed of up to 640 kilobits per second, the  
high-speed connection is more than 20 times faster than the typical 
desktop computer modems hooked to regular telephone lines.

<HEADLINE> Study: Welfare Workers Need Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of welfare mothers do not have the  
skills to escape poverty, although the economy has plenty of jobs 
for them, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, released Wednesday by the Educational Testing  
Service, analyzes the skills of women on welfare and matches them 
with available jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is many women could improve their prospects of  
moving into the middle class with minimal training. But, the 
authors note, today's overhauled welfare programs provide little 
such training. And even if education were an option, it would be 
difficult to bring welfare recipients with the fewest skills into 
the economic mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare recipients who have some skills but still need to  
improve would benefit most from additional training, but they are 
least likely to get it, the study says, because they are also most 
likely to find jobs on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	As these more qualified recipients leave the rolls, states will  
turn their attention to the people who remain, and some of them may 
qualify for training although they are so far behind that the 
training may not make much difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't get the additional training may find jobs but  
they'll have trouble moving into the economic mainstream, said 
study author Anthony P. Carnevale. 
</P>
<P>
	Without more education, two-thirds of women may leave welfare  
but lack the skills to advance economically. 
</P>
<P>
	Education and training are not permitted under most state  
welfare plans, which emphasize work. The theory is that on-the-job 
training, for everything from skills to attitude, is the best way 
to promote economic self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	The study relies on a traditional analysis of the welfare  
population, as it stood in 1995 before caseloads began to drop 
dramatically. It found: 
</P>
<P>
	--One-third (32 percent) of welfare mothers have advanced or  
competent skills and are prepared for work. Most probably have left 
the welfare rolls and many could move into the middle class with 
the equivalent of one semester of education and training, the study 
found. They are ready for community college work, which could 
increase their wages by up to $10,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--About one-third (37 percent) have basic skills, similar to high  
school graduates in the bottom half of their classes. The jobs for 
which they are qualified pay $15,000 to $20,000 a year and are not 
likely to offer training or advancement opportunities. But basic 
education and training -- again, about a semester's worth -- could 
elevate them into that top group, ready to take jobs that do offer 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	--The bottom third (31 percent) have minimal skills, similar to  
high-school dropouts. They are qualified for only the lowest-paying 
jobs, typically less than $15,000 per year. They face the worst job 
prospects but also would benefit least from more education because 
they need more than four times as much education to bring them to 
the next level. The authors recommend that states offer child care 
and other support services to help them find and keep jobs, even 
dead-end ones. 
</P>
<P>
	ETS, which conducted the study and long has supported education,  
is best known for college entrance exams.

<HEADLINE> Home Care Agencies To Provide Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home health care providers will soon begin  
passing on standardized information about their Medicare patients 
to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last month, about 10,000 home health care agencies have  
been using a 19-page assessment designed by the Health Care 
Financing Administration to collect data on patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Called the Outcome and Assessment Information Set, the survey  
covers a variety of health-related issues and risk factors that 
could affect someone's health, Chris Peacock, an HCFA spokesman, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	These survey includes questions about whether patients are  
depressed or if they have attempted suicide, their financial status 
and living conditions. Home health agencies conduct the assessment 
of the patient within 48 hours of administering care and every 60 
days until service concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the format is new in an effort to standardize the  
information, the assessments are no different from those typically 
conducted by health care providers in evaluating patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to standardize that assessment process,'' he said. The  
data will help ``improve the quality for Americans being treated in 
Medicare-approved institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups have voiced concerns that the questions could  
infringe on patients' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency plans to use the data to identify places it can  
improve performance and to detect overbilling and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The system also is intended to help the agency meet an Oct.1,  
2000 deadline for creating a new prospective payment system for 
home health-care providers. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act includes 
provisions requiring that payment rates for various services be 
standardized.

<HEADLINE> Panel Sends Steel Bill to House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel-state lawmakers are pressing ahead with  
legislation to impose quotas on steel imports, winning the right to 
a House vote over the objections of key Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee sent the bill to the full  
House with an unfavorable recommendation out of fear that 
parliamentary maneuvers would otherwise be invoked to force a vote. 
The full House is expected to vote as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before the committee acted Wednesday, White House chief  
of staff John Podesta threatened a presidential veto, saying the 
bill would violate international trade agreements and ``is not in 
our nation's economic interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the domestic steel industry, reeling from an import surge  
that has forced production cutbacks and layoffs, was elated that a 
steel bill even moved out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was the first to reach the full House since the Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to U.S. markets to get rid of their surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crisis has gone on for far too long,'' said Rep. Pete  
Visclosky, D-Ind., the chief sponsor of the quota bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is likely to draw considerable support from House  
Republicans from districts with steel mills. It faces a tougher 
time in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The House committee debate highlighted rifts within Congress  
about how best to tackle the increase in steel imports and brought 
out concerns that other struggling industries will want special 
remedies as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oil industry has been more hard hit by imports,'' said  
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee chairman. ``Likewise, our 
farmers and ranchers just got through a very difficult stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also argue that quotas could lead to market distortions,  
shortages of certain types of steel and increased prices, hurting 
steel consumers in the automobile, appliance and construction 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., a supporter of the bill, said  
strong sanctions are needed to ``send a strong message to the 
international community that Congress is not willing to roll over 
and be a patsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the insistence of House leaders, the committee reported the  
bill ``adversely'' on a voice vote, meaning a majority of its 
members opposed the measure but agreed to let the House consider 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, said they shared Archer's misgivings about the bill 
but did not want parliamentary tactics from supporters to disrupt 
normal procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who opposes quotas in favor of more  
moderate steel legislation, accused Republicans of trying to divide 
House Democrats from the Clinton administration and give 
Republicans in swing districts ``a boost by appearing to be 
concerned about steel workers and the steel industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would limit foreign-made steel imports to their  
pre-July 1997 levels, before worldwide conditions began changing to 
boost imports dramatically. The measure also would set up an import 
notification system to improve tracking of shipments into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is considering steel tariffs of as much as 71  
percent against Japan and Brazil after issuing a preliminary ruling 
in favor of the domestic industry's complaints that those countries 
have dumped steel in U.S. markets at prices below production costs.

He was 68.

</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins, a staunch  
defender of the homeless and refugees in rulings that challenged 
national policy, died Thursday of colon cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he created ``safe zones'' for the area's homeless to  
stay without threat of police arrest, ruling that Miami had 
violated the Constitution by seizing and destroying the meager 
belongings of homeless people while chasing them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision inspired community leaders to establish what is now  
a nationally recognized system to help the homeless -- shelter, job 
training, counseling and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins' rulings on behalf of Haitian and Cuban refugees vexed  
the Bush and the Clinton administrations' efforts to repatriate 
thousands of refugees from the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba. Both decisions were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins was appointed a federal judge in 1966 by President  
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	He became chief judge in 1977 and took senior status in 1983,  
but continued a heavy caseload. He also sat on panels of the 11th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

instrumental in the early careers of Ray Charles and B.B. King and 
whose 1954 hit ``Reconsider Baby'' was recorded by Elvis Presley, 
died Sunday of kidney disease, diabetes and congestive heart 
failure. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulson was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1993, and his  
``Them Update Blues'' was nominated for a 1995 Grammy. Among his 
other hits were ``Tramp,'' ``Blues Shadows Falling'' and ``Lonesome 
Christmas'' in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	His first success, ``Reconsider Baby,'' came immediately after  
he signed his first record contract. He helped then-newcomers 
Charles and King in the 1950s.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Rev. Walter Allen ``Al'' Dealey Jr., a retired  
newspaper executive and Presbyterian minister, died Tuesday of 
complications from a stroke. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealey was a grandson of Dallas Morning News founder George  
Bannerman Dealey and son of Walter Dealey Sr., a business executive 
at the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Dealey was an executive at the newspaper before  
enrolling in the Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working full time at the newspaper in June 1937. Four  
years later, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve. After retiring 
from active duty with the rank of major, Dealey returned to the 
newspaper and assumed a management position. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1956, Dealey returned to Dallas to organize the  
Churchill Way Presbyterian Church, where he was the first pastor. 
In 1962, he resigned his pulpit to open a full-time office for 
pastoral counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealey is survived by wife Willene Hinchliffe Dealey, two sons,  
four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

controversial language law promoting the use of French in Quebec, 
died Thursday of cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurin entered the legislature in 1970 with a handful of other  
members of the separatist Parti Quebecois members. He was named to 
the Cabinet when Rene Levesque took power in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	As minister of cultural development, he was the driving force  
behind Law 101, the Charter of the French Language, which was 
adopted in 1977.

</P>
<P>
	Micciche worked for the Everett News Gazette, Stars and Stripes  
and the Portsmouth (N.H.) Herald before joining the Globe in 1955.

<P>
	While covering the Massachusetts Legislature from 1956 to 1969,  
he studied law at Suffolk Law School. He graduated in 1968 and

was 12. He later became a reporter for the Portsmouth Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	After covering the state Legislature, Micciche wrote about  
politics for the Globe's editorial page for a year, and then went 
to the paper's Washington bureau. He covered Congress, the Supreme

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stock Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today on continued  
optimism over a strong rally this week in Japanese share prices. 
Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.74 in late afternoon trading, down 0.80  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 119.88 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.14 points,  
or 0.14 percent, to close at 15,502.14. On Wednesday, the index 
jumped 383.30 points, or 2.54 percent, to a seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged lower against the yen, falling to as low as  
119.33 yen, as Hong Kong, Swiss, and U.S. investors sold the U.S. 
currency, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen was gaining strength amid speculation that the big gains  
in Tokyo stocks in recent days may be a harbinger of a Japanese 
economic turnaround, analysts said. The dollar traded as high as 
119.89 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the head of the International Bureau at Japan's  
Ministry of Finance expressed hope for stability in foreign 
exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters upon arriving at the ministry, Haruhiko  
Kuroda said, ``Stable foreign exchange is desirable.'' He wouldn't 
comment on specific exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.77 yen, up from  
131.10 yen in New York late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices soared in early trading in  
line with Wall Street's overnight jump to a new record and improved 
market sentiment in Tokyo, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79.08 points Wednesday, or  
0.8 percent, to 9,772.84, surpassing its previous record close set 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei has gained more than 700 points in the last two  
trading days on hopes for aggressive restructuring steps at 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism was fueled by electronics giant Sony Corp.'s  
announcement of plans to take over three publicly listed 
subsidiaries and eliminate 10 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the afternoon the Nikkei average was up 360 points, but  
settled back toward the end of the session amid profit-taking and a 
growing view that the market could be reaching a peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come quite far and I think we are on the border of a  
resistance level,'' said Kiyoshi Kimura strategist at Societe 
Generale Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony shares dropped a whopping 940 yen, or 7.9 percent, to  
10,910 as players took profits on the stock's strong rally this 
week. Still, Sony shares have risen almost 40 percent over the past 
six trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 8.71 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,196.18. The 
TOPIX rose 24.96 points, or 2.15 percent the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange reached  
1.049 billion shares, the highest since last September. Rising 
issues outnumbered declines 737 to 463, while 123 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.740 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.670 
percent, driving its price down to 100.47 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian riot police fired in the  
air today in Gaza to disperse stone-throwing youths protesting the 
killing of two people in riots the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The two youths died in protests sparked Wednesday when a  
Palestinian military court sentenced a security agent to death for 
his role in a shootout that killed another agent. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 protesters chanting ``We want justice!'' gathered  
today outside the homes of the two youths, Ala Hams and Khamis 
Salameh, as a steady stream of mourners paid respects. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, about 100 protesters faced 200 police in a central  
square, tossing stones and bottles. Police struck the protesters 
with batons and used tear gas to disperse them. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Rajeh Abu Lehieh calmed the crowd with promises that the  
Palestinian Authority would punish those responsible for the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	More violence broke out later, and police fired live ammunition  
into the air and used tear gas to quell the rioters. 
</P>
<P>
	Four demonstrators suffered moderate injuries from gunshot  
wounds, and 32 demonstrators and 17 police were slightly injured, 
said officials at a government hospital in Rafah near the Egyptian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian police declared the area a closed military zone  
after the first clash. They confiscated film from six journalists 
in the area and detained three journalists from the Reuters news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our journalists were doing nothing more than their job,'' said  
Reuters Jerusalem bureau chief Paul Holmes. ``We have urged the 
Palestinian Authority to release them without delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian officials, including police chief Ghazi Jabali,  
denied that the journalists were being held. 
</P>
<P>
	The rioting Wednesday began after Raed Attar was sentenced to  
death for his role in a February shootout that killed Capt. Rifat 
Joudeh. Both men were from prominent families in Rafah and belonged 
to one of the several Palestinian security services that cross into 
each other's turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Attar was a member of the militant Islamic group Hamas before  
joining the Palestinian security services. 
</P>
<P>
	Joudeh's family had lobbied for a death sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, members of Attar's family gathered outside  
the Joudeh home and began throwing stones and bottles. Palestinian 
police opened fire, and the two youths were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Dahlan, the Gaza security chief, said that reports that  
one of the dead youths was killed by shots coming from a nearby 
Israeli army post are being investigated. Israel has denied any 
involvement.

<HEADLINE> Sightseers Search Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PORTAL, Calif. (AP) -- Federal agents were using all-terrain  
vehicles today to search the rugged western border of Yosemite 
National Park for a woman, her daughter and a teen-age friend who 
have been missing for nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after saying the FBI had confirmed his worst fears, Jens  
Sund said he was heartened by the intensified search for his wife 
and daughter and an Argentinian friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm encouraged people are still looking,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He apologized today for more dire comments he made after meeting  
with the FBI on Wednesday at the command center in Modesto. He 
emerged from that meeting saying without elaboration he was 
``devastated'' by the FBI's news. Today, he said the information he 
had received was no different from what he'd been told before: It 
is unlikely the three would be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on an emotional roller coaster,'' Sund said, adding  
that he had been caught off guard at a low moment when he spoke 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The search using all-terrain vehicles, the most focused effort  
by agents since the disappearance, is a few miles from the Cedar 
Lodge in El Portal, a restaurant and motel on Yosemite's western 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	A family friend at the Wednesday briefing said agents did not  
reveal whether they had found the women, or even their missing red 
rental car. ``If they had found the ladies or the car, they 
absolutely would have told us,'' Lee Ulansey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and Silvina  
Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend, were last seen Feb. 15 at the 
lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	A part of Mrs. Sund's wallet was found in Modesto, a two-hour  
ride from the lodge. The FBI had already said that three were 
probably dead. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Agent Nick Rossi wouldn't reveal what agents told the  
family, but he said agents would focus their search around El 
Portal for the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only natural that we would focus our efforts on the area  
where they were last seen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossi also wouldn't say whether the arrest of the restaurant's  
night cleaner Friday night has anything to do with the 
disappearance. The worker was jailed on a parole violation at the 
request of the FBI and his parole officer, the Mariposa County 
sheriff's department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, of Eureka, is a member of the prominent Carrington  
family, which made millions in Northern California real estate. The 
family has offered $300,000 for information, and Sund has stayed in 
Modesto to follow the latest developments.

<HEADLINE> Reds Release Listach, Eischen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Pat Listach, the 1992 American League  
Rookie of the Year, and reliever Joey Eischen were released from 
their minor league contracts by the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to do it now to give them an opportunity to find  
another job, rather than sending them to the minor league camp,'' 
manager Jack McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Listach, hampered by knee, hamstring and shoulder injuries,  
hasn't played in the major leagues since 1997, when he hit .182 in 
52 games with Houston. Listach, 31, was 3-for-10 in five games this 
spring since. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, when the infielder won the rookie award, he hit .290  
and stole 54 bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Eischen, 29, was 2-5 with two saves and a 4.54 ERA in 61  
relievers at Class Triple-A Indianapolis last season. He was hit 
hard in his only inning this spring, allowing two runs and three 
hits against Texas last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati also optioned left-hander Jim Crowell and  
right-hander Keith Glauber to Triple-A Indianapolis and reassigned 
infielders Rod McCall and Jason Hardtke to the minor league camp.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Downgrades Nissan Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service  
has lowered its rating for the long-term debt of Nissan Motor Co. 
to junk status because of the company's staggering debt load. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's reported Thursday that Nissan's rating was cut to Ba1, a  
junk rating, from the investment-grade level of Baa3. Moody's also 
said Nissan's long-term debt could be downgraded further. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings cut reflects the long time period that will likely  
be required for Nissan to reduce its debts to a more manageable 
level, Moody's said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker, has debts estimated  
between $22 billion and $37 billion and has been hammered by weak 
sales in Japan and in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's also cited the challenges facing the company to improve  
its historically low returns in a competitive environment and its 
ongoing efforts to align with a strategic partner. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Germany's DaimlerChrysler abandoned plans to  
acquire an equity stake in the troubled Japanese automaker.

<HEADLINE> Novartis Agrees To Pay Govt. $8M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. will pay the  
government $8 million to settle allegations that a predecessor 
company, Ciba-Geigy Inc., overcharged the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciba-Geigy was accused of failing to provide accurate pricing  
information to VA contract negotiators on four contracts for the 
purchase of pharmaceuticals. As a result, government agencies 
purchasing under the contracts were allegedly overcharged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rely on contractors to provide accurate pricing  
information,'' said acting assistant U.S. attorney general David W. 
Ogden, who announced the settlement Thursday along with Faith S. 
Hochberg, U.S. attorney for New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking advantage of a government contract in this way is like  
reaching into the pocket of taxpayers,'' Hochberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans department discovered the overcharges during an  
audit of contracts with Ciba-Geigy, which was based in Summit, N.J. 
On four contracts awarded between 1987 and 1991, the investigation 
found, Ciba-Geigy did not tell government officials that it offered 
commercial customers lower prices than it offered government 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agencies bought more than $50 million worth of  
pharmaceuticals under the four contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis, which negotiated the settlement with the Justice  
Department, was formed when Sandoz Ltd. and Ciba-Geigy merged in 
1996. Novartis is headquartered in East Hanover, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Debate Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats dropped efforts Thursday to block  
Senate debate on a national missile defense policy, clearing the 
way for consideration of a bill the Clinton administration fears 
will jeopardize anti-missile deals with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who failed twice  
last year by one vote to get the issue to the Senate floor, thanked 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., for agreeing to let debate go 
forward, reflecting growing bipartisan support for a system to 
defend U.S. territory against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., did little more than introduce the  
bill late Thursday, with debate set for Monday afternoon. No vote 
is expected until Tuesday on the legislation, which would declare 
deployment of a national missile defense system to be official U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is progress,'' said Cochran. '' We're very proud to see  
this momentum to address this issue that is so important for the 
national security interests of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill reads: ``It is the policy of the United States to  
deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective national 
missile defense system capable of defending the territory of the 
United States against limited ballistic missile attack, whether 
accidental, unauthorized or delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, administration officials at a congressional  
hearing outlined steps being taken to defend U.S. troops and 
civilians against various types of missile attack. Republicans 
accuse the administration of being feeble in its plans to protect 
against missile firings by terrorists or rogue regimes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that  
China and Russia have held talks on the prospects of a U.S. 
anti-missile umbrella and are united in their opposition to the 
system. China also is concerned about the possibility of U.S. 
arrangements with Japan or Taiwan on missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has threatened a presidential veto, based on  
concern that it would affect negotiations with Russia to make 
changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which restricts 
both nations from building missile defenses. Opponents claim the 
treaty is void, because it was signed with the Soviet Union, not 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the bill is simpler: ``It is the policy of  
the United States to deploy a national missile defense.'' Prompting 
no direct veto threat, it cleared the House Armed Service Committee 
by a 50-3 margin last month. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton included money in his fiscal 1999 budget  
request for beginning to build such a system, but Republicans want 
faster spending. Clinton also has delayed until June 2000 a 
decision on whether to go ahead with a full-scale system. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have pushed for a missile defense system since  
the early 1980s, when President Reagan proposed a space-based 
shield against incoming missiles. The issue has drawn increased 
Democratic support, as well, with the firing of a ballistic missile 
by North Korea last year and reports that Iran is developing an 
offensive missile program.

<HEADLINE> End of Tobacco Fraud Probe Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The end of a five-year fraud investigation of  
Big Tobacco is in sight, and Justice Department prosecutors must 
decide soon whether to try to bring more charges or shut down the 
effort, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting close to, I think, a time when we're going to  
have to make some final decisions,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder said at the Justice Department weekly press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder was responding to a report in today's Wall Street Journal  
that the department's tobacco task force is down to a handful of 
prosecutors ``tying up loose ends.'' The prosecution effort lost 
steam in recent months as the White House turned greater attention 
to a potential civil lawsuit to recover the health-related costs of 
smoking, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it's down to a skeletal force,'' Holder said.  
``The investigation at this point, as I say, is still one that's 
ongoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Justice Department official said later the task force,  
which once employed some two dozen prosecutors and investigators 
working with two grand juries, is slowly getting smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has been investigating various elements  
of the tobacco industry, including many of the major companies. Two 
federal grand juries, one in Washington and another in New York, 
were looking into whether tobacco companies withheld evidence from 
regulators or lied to Congress or regulators about the dangers and 
addictiveness of tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force has so far produced a single guilty plea. Last  
year, a California biotechnology company admitted conspiring to 
grow high-nicotine tobacco secretly in foreign countries so Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. could ``control and manipulate the 
nicotine levels in its cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plea negotiated in Washington, DNA Plant  
Technology Corp., of Oakland, agreed to cooperate in the ongoing 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> US Blasted Over Imprisoned Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. government has not done enough to help  
free a New York woman imprisoned for life in Peru on trumped-up 
charges, her father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am offended by my country! I am offended by my government!  
Where is President Clinton feeling my pain?'' Mark Berenson shouted 
Wednesday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori Berenson, 29, was convicted of high treason and other  
crimes by a Peruvian military tribunal in 1995 for her alleged 
participation in a failed rebel plot to seize control of the 
Peruvian parliament. Her closed trial was held before hooded 
judges, a practice used until 1997 to protect court officials from 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her supporters say the former Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology student was in Peru as a journalist covering social 
issues and was not involved in the alleged plot by the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenson, his wife, Rhoda, and four members of a private human  
rights delegation just returned from Peru, where, by a stroke of 
luck, they managed last weekend to get inside the mountain prison 
where Ms. Berenson is being held. They said it was the first time 
since she was locked up in 1995 that any nonofficial delegation had 
been able to see her without a screen between them, and even 
embrace her. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from the Peruvian government, denying the delegation  
permission to enter the Socabaya prison, arrived in New York this 
week, just as the group was returning to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, the group released a letter that Ms.  
Berenson had written last August to ``members of the community of 
organizations for human rights,'' asserting that ``I am completely 
innocent of the horrendous charges against me, and there could not 
be real evidence that shows such crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Berenson, a statistics professor at  
Baruch College, accused Clinton and other top officials of currying 
favor with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori by ignoring blatant 
human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	For three years, Ms. Berenson was held in the frigid Yanamayo  
prison in the southern Andes Mountains in an unheated, open-air 
cell without running water, where her hands were said to have 
swelled up like boxing gloves from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	She was transferred to the warmer Socabaya prison, 465 miles  
southeast of Lima, but held in isolation for the first 115 days.

<HEADLINE>  Zimmer Ready To Lead Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees became baseball's best  
team because of their unmatched depth -- and that includes their 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that abundance, there's no shortage of candidates to  
fill in for Joe Torre while the manager undergoes treatment for 
prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Zimmer, Torre's trusted sidekick the last three seasons,  
appears likely to run the team during Torre's absence. But while 
Zimmer recovers from knee surgery, the Yankees say Torre's duties 
will be split between coaches Mel Stottlemyre, Willie Randolph, 
Chris Chambliss and former manager Stump Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe pushed all the right buttons the last few years, and  
someone has to take that responsibility now,'' David Cone said. 
``One of the beauties of Joe Torre as a manager is he really 
involves all of his coaches. The whole coaching staff is so well 
respected and so involved and this team is so self-motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who used a baseball bat as a cane, agrees there are few  
decisions to make as the 125-win Yankees prepare for the season. 
When decisions are needed, he will follow Torre's model. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going to manage, I will take responsibility for all the  
decisions,'' said Zimmer, who nearly broke down in tears when asked 
to describe his feelings for Torre. ``We think alike and I will try 
to do the same things he would have done. I want to run the team 
like Joe would have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Zimmer held court in the Yankees' dugout Thursday afternoon,  
Torre spent the day with his family, trying to keep his mind off 
the cancer before choosing a course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Cashman called Torre to read him the box  
scores from Wednesday's split-squad games, deliver reports from the 
coaches and get his input on roster moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's brother Frank, whose heart transplant during the 1996  
World Series colored Joe's first season in pinstripes, visited the 
Yankees' clubhouse one day after arriving in the Tampa area to be 
with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in very good shape, looks great and has no pain,'' Frank  
Torre said. ``All indications are that the cancer is in the early 
stages. It's just a matter of getting his thoughts together and 
deciding which way he will go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Torre said his brother will probably take a few days to  
make his decision. The route he takes will help determine how long 
he will be away from the team, which could be as little as three 
weeks if he takes radiation shots or at least six if he has 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as he eats sleeps and breathes baseball, it is not No.  
1 in his life,'' Frank Torre said. ``If someone upstairs said his 
recovery would be a maybe and he could return next month or it 
would be guaranteed and he could never manage again, it would be a 
no-brainer. He'd miss the game, but his priority is getting 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the responsibility for the team will fall to Zimmer  
and the coaches. Merrill, who managed the team in 1990-91 and is 
currently a special assistant to Cashman, handled the duties 
Thursday night against Texas as Zimmer had his surgically-repaired 
knee checked out by the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who has an 885-858 career record for San Diego, Boston,  
Texas and the Cubs, almost retired after last season, his 50th in 
professional baseball. But he is glad he decided to return, so he 
can step in for his good friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to emphasize, we will get the job done for Joe,'' said  
Zimmer, who will not take over the team until he is recovered from 
knee surgery. ``Hopefully we will start on a good note and win as 
many games as we can until he gets back.''

<HEADLINE> Picture of Mars Crater Taken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Mars seemed to be smiling for the camera  
when a NASA spacecraft began mapping the Red Planet this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Happy Face Crater'' was captured in a wide-angle image  
recorded by Mars Global Surveyor's camera on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature, which has a much more mirthful appearance than the  
better known but decidedly grim ``Face on Mars,'' is really the 
134-mile-wide Galle Crater on the eastern side of a basin called 
Argyre Planitia. 
</P>
<P>
	Features within the circular crater form the eyes and smiling  
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	In color, the picture has a bluish-white tone caused by  
wintertime frost, according to Malin Space Science Systems Inc., 
which operates Surveyor's camera from San Diego and released the 
images Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Happy Face'' was first noticed in images sent back to  
Earth during the Viking 1 mission to Mars in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Viking missions also returned images of the not-so-happy  
``Mars Face,'' a feature that looked like a skull with empty eye 
sockets. That spawned theories that the mile-long feature was the 
creation of some intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Mars Global Surveyor's modern camera took a look at the  
same area a year ago, the gape-mouth visage vanished as sharp 
detail revealed a natural feature, perhaps a butte or mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Global Surveyor, managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion  
Laboratory, was launched in 1996 and reached the planet in 
September 1997. It finally began its main science mission this week 
after a long delay in achieving the proper orbit for mapping.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslavia Shells Kosovo Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOCA ZAGRADSKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav forces poured into  
southwest Kosovo before dawn Thursday and shelled villages near the 
province's second-largest city, dampening the prospects for success 
in upcoming peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, mostly women and children, fled  
the new offensive on tractor-pulled wagons as tank and mortar fire 
boomed near Prizren in an area surrounded by army troops and 
Serbian police. 
</P>
<P>
	The historic city is 40 miles southwest of Pristina, the capital  
of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With no political settlement in sight, the head of the U.N.  
refugee agency warned of a rising level of violence against 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The humanitarian situation on the ground is deteriorating  
rapidly despite the ongoing diplomatic efforts,'' U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said Thursday during a visit 
to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fighting and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's failure to  
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept foreign 
troops in Kosovo to monitor a peace settlement muddied the chances 
of success at talks scheduled for Monday in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Militant commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is  
fighting for independence, also have balked at signing the peace 
proposal and have threatened to boycott the meeting unless Serbs 
appear ready to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanian negotiator Veton Surroi on Thursday blamed the  
head of the delegation, Hashim Thaci, for failing to sign the peace 
plan. ``His behavior is irresponsible,'' said Surroi. ``By signing 
it, we would allow the attention to be shifted to Milosevic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Yugoslav and Serb targets  
in the event Albanians sign the peace deal and Milosevic does not, 
but Holbrooke was low-key about his failure to persuade the 
Yugoslav president to accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to go around rattling rockets and making  
threatening gestures. Our positions are clear and President 
Milosevic knows them, and we will be in continuing contact with 
him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke headed home to brief top U.S. officials in Washington,  
where the House debated a nonbinding resolution on whether U.S. 
troops should be sent to Kosovo to enforce a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed in a year of war, and  
about 300,000 have been driven from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the north, fighting continued Thursday in a region near the  
town of Vucitrn. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatrice Lacoste, a spokeswoman for the Organization for  
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said one Yugoslav army soldier 
was killed in the northern village of Svinjare, while the two sides 
differed on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA's Kosovo Press agency said one of its fighters was  
killed along with five Serb police, and the Serb-run Media Center 
denied any Serb deaths in the north but said six Serbs were injured 
in fighting near Prizren and in the north. 
</P>
<P>
	That fighting was the first in the area since a massive Yugoslav  
offensive in July and August. Rebels returned to the village of 
Jeskova days ago, sparking the Yugoslav army attacks from Hoca 
Zagradska. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers crouched behind village walls, firing machine guns at  
the rebels on a nearby hill. Terrified residents were still fleeing 
during the deafening crash of Yugoslav tank fire, which lasted for 
several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomatic monitors said 300 ethnic Albanians had fled the area,  
with about 100 of them waiting nervously on a line of 
tractor-pulled trucks, hoping to return when the fighting stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Nuredin Bytyqi, was skeptical that Western pressure  
could force Milosevic to accept a settlement for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always refused peace in the past,'' said Bytyqi, who fled  
with his children. ``No one believes he will accept now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov was to meet with Milosevic  
in Belgrade on Friday. But he made clear Thursday that Russia, with 
its close ties to the Serbs, stands behind Belgrade in its 
resistance to the U.S.-drafted peace plan's call for 28,000 NATO 
troops to police an agreement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency also warned of a ``very grim situation''  
along the border with Macedonia, where 7,200 ethnic Albanians are 
believed to have fled in recent days to escape fighting.

<HEADLINE> Browns Give Couch Rave Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Quarterback Tim Couch worked out to rave  
reviews Thursday from the expansion Cleveland Browns and other NFL 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland and others  
watched Couch throw 60-plus passes and dispel rumors about his arm 
strength at an indoor field house adjacent to Kentucky's 
Commonwealth Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations, said  
Couch's workout went ``great,'' and Browns coach Chris Palmer 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he did a nice job,'' Palmer said. ``I think he  
pressed a bit early, but he settled down and threw the ball very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns own the No. 1 pick in next month's NFL draft, and the  
club has made it clear it would prefer to take a quarterback with 
the selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's first pass in his private workout was a short route that  
sailed a little and started to wobble, the quarterback said. 
However, he soon calmed down and Clark said Couch threw a pair of 
post patterns deeper than 60 yards with a lot of zip on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	After completing several 18-yard outs, fly patterns and a  
deeper-than-expected comebacker, Couch gave himself a passing grade 
for his deep-ball test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple of throws I was pressing, but I thought I  
threw the deep ball good, and that was really the only question 
they had,'' Couch said. ``It pretty much went like I thought it 
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Couch's post patterns was caught by former Wildcats  
wideout and NFL hopeful Craig Yeast. His last, a 65-yard post, was 
snared by the quarterback's former Kentucky roommate, receiver 
Kevin Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt in Coleman's mind that Couch is the best  
quarterback available in the draft, but the distance Couch put on 
the ball Thursday surprised even his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of funny to catch one that deep from Tim, but I've  
seen him throw it farther,'' Coleman said. ``Look, Craig Yeast had 
to run through it at 60 yards, and he runs a 4.2 40-yard dash, so 
if you have any questions, they're answered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Couch, the best thing about Thursday's workout was that it  
ended weeks of waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I'm glad this day is over,'' he said. ``This was  
probably tougher than any game. This was a day I've been dreaming 
about since I was a little kid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they've seen me up close, I've performed for them, and  
the ball is in their hands. I've shown them what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up next for the Kentucky quarterback are private workouts with  
interested teams, said Greg Couch, the All-American's brother who 
is part of his management team. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch worked out for the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday without  
throwing, Greg Couch said, because the Bengals were confident in 
his arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest argument I can make for Tim is that he's been the  
best at every level he's played at,'' the elder Couch said. ``He 
feels that if he keeps working hard, there's no reason he can't 
continue that trend in the pros.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch said he doesn't spend time worrying about the  
possibility that he might not be taken first by the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to go make it, whether I'm the first pick or not,''  
he said. ``It's their decision.''

<HEADLINE> Starr's Spokesman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Monica Lewinsky drama, abruptly 
resigned Thursday after an internal review of a recent press leak 
prompted Starr to request a full Justice Department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a Jan. 31 article in The New York Times that  
reported Starr had concluded President Clinton could legally be 
indicted while still in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly went on national television the day after the article  
appeared and said the ``information did not come from our office. 
... We did not leak this information. ... We do not leak grand jury 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bakaly's attorney nor Starr's office would disclose the  
findings of the internal inquiry into the leak, but both made clear 
in prepared statements that it played a role in Bakaly's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having been provided with the preliminary results of the  
internal investigation, this office has referred the matter to the 
Department of Justice,'' Starr said in a statement. Starr said he 
accepted the resignation with ``regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly's lawyer, Howard Shapiro, said in a statement that his  
client would cooperate ``in every way'' with the Justice inquiry 
and said he was ``confident that he will be found not to have 
violated any statute, regulation or court order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that it was Mr. Bakaly's job as OIC spokesman to respond  
to media inquiries concerning the OIC's work, it is no surprise 
that he has been interviewed in connection with the inquiry being 
conducted by the Department of Justice,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly's resignation is to take effect June 1, but Starr placed  
him on paid administrative leave in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed that Starr  
referred the Bakaly matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not yet received the investigative materials in  
connection with the matter from the FBI agents assigned to the 
Office of Independent Counsel,'' Marlin said. ``When we receive it, 
we will determine how best to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times story came at a sensitive time for Starr because a  
federal judge already was investigating his office regarding 
allegations of leaks of grand jury material in the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the January news story, Starr had said he was  
``deeply troubled'' by the latest leak and ordered a review. 
Clinton's lawyer, meanwhile, complained to the judge overseeing the 
case that the report amounted to another illegal leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly did not immediately return a call to his home seeking  
comment Thursday. His lawyer was out of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shapiro said in the statement that his client joined Starr's  
staff ``during a high-profile phase and unavoidably controversial 
phase of the OIC's investigation to communicate the OIC's work to 
the media and public. With that high-profile phase of the OIC's 
work now largely completed, this is a logical time for Mr. Bakaly 
to make the transition back to the private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly, a bespectacled lawyer who also acted as spokesman for  
Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz's investigation of former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, was the official who announced 
from the steps of the Capitol that Starr had sent a referral to 
Congress alleging possible impeachable offenses late last summer.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Reviews U.S. Drug Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Caribbean leaders said Thursday that a  
weekend decision to review a treaty to help the United States fight 
drug trafficking was a message aimed at getting Washington to back 
off in a trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sending an important signal to the U.S., by deciding to  
review the accord,'' Sir James Mitchell, prime minister of St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines said of a move at the semi-annual summit 
of 15-member Caribbean Community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accord draws an inextricable link between trade, economic  
development, security and prosperity,'' Denzil Douglas, prime 
minister of St. Kitts and Nevis, said. ``The U.S. agreed not to do 
anything to undermine the economic well-being of the Caribbean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas said the ``review'' did not amount to a suspension of  
the treaty, as some have interpreted. ``Some (countries) wanted to 
suspend it, but in the end we agreed to a review,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, signed in Barbados by President Bill Clinton in  
1997, calls for cooperation by Caribbean nations in anti-drug 
trafficking measures and extradition of suspects. But regional 
leaders have increasingly complained that Washington has ignored 
its end of the bargain by failing to address economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Caribbean leaders are especially incensed over U.S. efforts to  
get the World Trade Organization to revoke preferences given by 
some European countries to former colonies in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says the preferences hurt U.S.-owned producers with  
huge plantations in Central and South America. The Caribbean 
leaders say they are critical to keeping their banana industry -- 
and other agriculture -- viable during a difficult period. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said Thursday that the region's leaders would decide on  
any further action at a full summit in July. ``We are certainly 
going to look at (the treaty) again, review this thing again. But 
there is a lot of time -- between now and July a lot of things can 
happen,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller Caribbean producers stress that their produce makes up  
only 1 percent of the world market and say they cannot compete with 
the larger Latin American plantations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute escalated last week as the United States ordered  
importers to deposit funds to cover pending sanctions on $520 
million worth of targeted goods imported from the European Union. 
Caribbean nations joined the European Union in charging that the 
sanctions were illegal.

<HEADLINE> Swearing Professor in Mich. Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- An English professor who was suspended for  
using graphic language in class has filed a federal lawsuit in a 
bid to get reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Macomb Community College professor John Bonnell accuses the  
school of violating his civil rights and freedom of speech when it 
suspended him, barred him from campus and placed him under a gag 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	The school investigated Bonnell after a female student  
complained in November that he used vulgar references in his 
lectures. He was suspended with pay last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnell's lawyer, James Howarth, said Bonnell has an  
outstanding, unblemished 32-year career at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The language that he used is used strictly within the context  
of his course and lectures,'' Howarth said. ``The language is not 
directed at any student, nor is it used in general conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth said the phrases were used during discussion of the  
Monica Lewinsky affair, a criminal case involving necrophilia and 
chauvinism in the Roman Catholic Church of the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the school declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Knight Is Impressed With GW Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Listen to Bob Knight long enough and you're  
liable to question if Indiana belongs in the NCAA tournament at 
all, let alone as a sixth seed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoosiers won 22 games and finished third in the Big Ten  
during the regular season, yet Knight sounds like they should be 
underdogs in the South Regional tonight against 11th-seeded George 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that we're really good,'' college basketball's  
winningest active coach said Wednesday. ``We've played really well 
on occasion. But playing really well on occasion does not equate to 
being a really good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana (22-10) won its last three regular-season games, then  
lost to Illinois by 16 points in its opener in the Big Ten 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said George Washington (20-8) has one of the most  
inspiring players in the country, 5-foot-4 Shawnta Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our coaches some time ago, long before the pairings  
were decided upon, that if I was to pick one kid in the country for 
kids to look at and say: `Boy, that's an example of what I want to 
be like' -- it would be Rogers,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a kid that I think has overcome the disadvantages of  
size, in a game where size is important, and become a lethal weapon 
as a basketball player. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, the Atlantic 10 Conference player of the year, averaged  
almost 21 points and had an impressive assist-to-turnover ratio of 
nearly 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has great vision,'' Knight said. ``He may just see guys  
below the waist, but that little son of a gun sees, I'll tell you 
that. And he gets the ball to people and gets it where it ought to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana coach summed up what makes the senior such a force  
on the floor in one word -- ``Heart.'' The George Washington guard 
was flattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big motivating factor,'' Rogers said of his size. ``I'm  
the type of guy who always wants to prove people wrong. I just work 
hard at whatever I do ... You have to have a lot of heart to play 
this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington, in the tournament for the fifth time in the  
last seven years, hasn't advanced beyond the opening round since 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana, making its 14th consecutive appearance under Knight,  
also is looking for some redemption. The Hoosiers have lost five of 
their last six tournament games, including a trio of first-round 
losses from 1995-97. 
</P>
<P>
	In day games at Orlando Arena, Maryland faced last year's  
tournament darling, Valparaiso, and Creighton met Louisville. 
Tonight, St. John's plays Samford. 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington already has had a tough time. Because of bad  
weather, their flights out of two airports in the Washington, D.C., 
area were canceled Tuesday. They wound up staying in a hotel 
overnight and arrived in Florida Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone always asks are you glad to be here,'' Colonials  
coach Tom Penders said. ``After the travel travails the last two 
days, I am really happy to be here ... We had a real adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One team that isn't just glad to be here is Maryland, the No. 2  
seed. The Terrapins have never been to the Final Four, but many 
predict they -- not top-seed Auburn -- will emerge from the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gary Williams hopes a season of being ranked among the  
nation's elite has prepared his team for such a journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there were times when expectations were so high that it  
was tough on our players. Hopefully, we learned from that,'' 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, we were always the team that would sneak up on  
somebody. This year, we usually had the higher ranking when we 
played good teams.''

<HEADLINE>  Hornets Deal Rice to Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Now the pressure's really on the Los  
Angeles Lakers, who acquired the rebounding help and deadly outside 
shooter Shaquille O'Neal wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after adding Dennis Rodman, the Lakers traded for  
sharpshooter Glen Rice from the Charlotte Hornets, along with power 
forward J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Hornets received All-Star guard Eddie Jones and  
center Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the respective rosters, the Lakers waived  
reserve forward Corie Blount and the Hornets waived forward Joe 
Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers also waived Armstrong to make room on their roster  
for rookie Ruben Patterson, who was activated from the injured 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, you hate to see guys like Eddie and Elden go, but I  
think what we received for this team is pretty good,'' O'Neal said 
after the Lakers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 94-75 Wednesday 
night for their ninth straight victory. ``We received a deadly 
shooter and another thuggish power forward, and there's no excuses 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, rumored for over a month, was made on the eve of the  
league's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who reached the Western Conference finals last May  
before being swept by the Utah Jazz, are going for their first 
championship since 1988 -- their fifth title of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Rice and Reid followed by two weeks the firing  
of coach Del Harris and hiring of Kurt Rambis as his successor, as 
well as the signing of Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder for the 
last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it appears, nothing less than a championship will do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that most teams in the league would like the  
people we have,'' executive vice president Jerry West said. ``This 
is the ultimate risk-taking business. We took a risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talked to (Rice) today, he was absolutely elated. We  
think we got a player that will help us -- a lot. We feel this takes 
us one step closer to our ultimate goal of having an NBA 
championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8  
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. He averaged 22.3 points last season to rank sixth 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with Kobe  
Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm assuming he'll play here Friday night,'' West said of  
Rice. ``We had two scouts look at him Monday in Miami. We had 
glowing reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have an option on Rice's contract for next season.  
West made it clear the team intended to keep him, but added, 
``There's no (contractual) promises to Glen Rice or his agent. We 
will address that when the time comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Rice has made 1,216 3-point shots, third  
in league history, and is 101 points shy of the 15,000-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting arguably one of the greatest shooters in the  
game today,'' Rambis said of Rice. ``Teams have to honor him the 
minute he crosses midcourt. We have a terrific potential for an 
in-and-out game with Shaq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 30, was Charlotte's No. 2 scorer this season, averaging  
14.5 points in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll welcome Glen and J.R. just like we welcomed Dennis --  
with open arms,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said. ``Glen brings 
some of the best perimeter shooting that guys have ever seen. I 
think both guys will bring us good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made three days after the resignation of Hornets  
coach Dave Cowens, who was unhappy with his salary. Charlotte won 
over 50 games each of the last two seasons and made the playoffs, 
but is just 5-12 this year after an 85-70 loss at Philadelphia on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets coach Paul Silas, who replaced Cowens, said before the  
game at Philadelphia he was ``elated'' with the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make us a lot more athletic,'' Silas said. ``The  
biggest plus is Elden Campbell is our center, and Derrick Coleman 
will now play (power forward). We have a real good starting lineup 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Jones can play forward or guard, and he wants to be  
here. That's a big plus. I've known him for years, and he's a fine 
young man. To get an All-Star like him is just great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said Jones will play his first game for them Friday  
night in Washington, and Campbell will make his Charlotte debut 
Sunday at New York against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice and Reid are expected to play their first game for the  
Lakers on Friday night against visiting Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 27, an All-Star the last two years playing in his fifth  
NBA season, has established himself as one of the league's best 
3-point shooters and defenders and was one of the most popular 
Lakers players, often eliciting the chant of ``Ed-die, Ed-die'' 
from fans at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even such a chant Wednesday night -- after the trade  
was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, 30, has shown flashes of brilliance since the Lakers  
made him a first-round draft pick in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was one of the most unpopular Lakers, due mainly to  
inconsistency and, perhaps, because of a seven-year, $49 million 
contract signed before the 1996-97 season.

<HEADLINE>  Minnesota Loses After Suspending 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Minnesota is finished in the NCAA tournament. The  
investigation is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaken by an academic scandal, the Gophers were eliminated by  
Gonzaga in the first round of the NCAA tournament Thursday as four 
of Minnesota players were suspended hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came one day after the Saint Paul Pioneer Press  
quoted a former university employee as saying she had done course 
work for at least 20 players in the basketball program, including 
four on the current squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours before tipoff, university president Mark Yudof  
announced that starters Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, along with 
reserves Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford, were suspended pending 
the outcome of an inquiry into allegations of academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins wholeheartedly agreed with Yudof's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't put winning and losing ahead of what's right,''  
Haskins said after the loss. ``I've been that way for 55 years. I 
won't change tomorrow or today. ...Some people sell their souls to 
win. I don't do that. Never have, never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has enveloped Haskins' program in a cloud of  
uncertainty, a mood reflected in the quiet of the Gophers' locker 
room and the blank expressions on the faces of the four suspended 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The depleted team quickly fell far behind the underdogs of  
Gonzaga, a small school seeded 10th in the tournament. After 
trailing by as many as 21 points early in the second half, the 
seventh-seeded Gophers cut the lead to two with 1:43 to go before 
losing 75-63. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players -- in matching black and white warmups -- sat  
glumly at the end of the bench during the game. The only times they 
got on the court was during timeouts, when they peered in from the 
edge of team huddles. 
</P>
<P>
	None spoke to reporters. They were not in the locker room after  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, Tarver and Stanford -- all seniors -- left knowing they'd  
never play another college game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard,'' said their senior teammate, Quincy Lewis.  
``They are my seniors. It was hard. Just leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins insisted he would keep his job.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt about that at all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The team heads home to Minneapolis and an investigation that's  
far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the type of thing that just tests your courage. It  
tests you as a Christian. It tests you as a man,'' Haskins said. 
``I've been tested many times. This is just one more test, for 
whatever reason, but I think we'll pass this test with flying 
colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the university's  
academic counseling unit, told the Pioneer Press she wrote papers, 
helped with take-home exams and did other course work for players 
between 1993 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she was taken on two of the team's road trips,  
including one to Hawaii, and considered it compensation for the 
work. She said she never was asked by coaches to do work for 
players, though she said Haskins once paid her $3,000 in cash to 
tutor a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said Haskins denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press said four former players confirmed the woman's  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' said former player Russ  
Archambault, a freshman on the 1997 Final Four team who left school 
before the next season. ``We used to make jokes about it. ... I 
would go over there some nights and get like four papers done. The 
coaches would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Minneapolis news conference, Yudof said the reputation of  
the university, its program and Haskins were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof envisioned ``fairly Draconian sanctions coming out if this  
proves to be true. The seriousness cannot be overstated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who said he knew nothing of any academic wrongdoing,  
accepted responsibility for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I run the basketball program at the University of Minnesota,  
so yes I'm held responsible for that,'' he said. ``The thing is you 
put your trust and faith in people but a man, from time to time, 
for whatever reason, will let you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few rows behind the bench, a couple hundred fans, clad in  
Minnesota's maroon and gold, cheered their team. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Erban of Stillwater, Minn., who flew in with 80 other fans  
Wednesday night, said he has seen all 16 of the Gophers' NCAA 
tournament games since Haskins came to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel something of an air of sadness, not anger against  
anyone,'' he said, ``an air of sadness for the players, their 
parents, the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if things weren't bad enough, reserve forward-center Kyle  
Sanden twisted an ankle in practice Wednesday and was on crutches. 
That left eight players available. Two fouled out, so Haskins was 
down to six players by the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The university conducted a 24-hour investigation before  
announcing the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen some evidence,'' Yudof said. ``I don't think we  
should characterize it beyond that. ... All we know is that the 
charges are certainly serious, and there seems to be enough 
evidence to support some of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota hired Haskins from Western Kentucky in 1986 after  
another scandal rocked the basketball program. Coach Jim Dutcher 
resigned after three players were accused of rape following a game 
at Wisconsin in 1986. Jimmy Williams, a Dutcher assistant, coached 
the final 11 games of the season, and Haskins took over for the 
1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins led his team to the Final Four two years ago and has 240  
career victories with the Gophers, five short of the all-time 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof called him ``a great coach who has served this institution  
ably for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no doubt that tough days were ahead for him and  
the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too premature to be talking about what the  
consequences of this could be,'' Dienhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an investigation involving another high profile program, an  
FBI inquiry into alleged mob ties to UCLA football players failed 
to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began a sports-betting investigation after the Bruins,  
with a 10-0 record and strong contenders for the national title, 
lost to Florida and Wisconsin to close out last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI has told me we have nothing to be concerned about ...  
that it has no concerns regarding the conduct of UCLA or any of its 
student athletes,'' athletic director Peter Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy P. McNally, FBI assistant director in Los Angeles, said  
Thursday the investigation was complete and there was no evidence 
of any wrongdoing by any members of the team.

</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Alexander Boyd Andrews III, whose exploits  
in a crippled B-17 bomber during World War II inspired the 
best-selling novel and movie ``The War Lover,'' died Sunday at age 
86. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, a retired brigadier general in the Air Force Reserves,  
founded 11 companies, including BTI, N.C. Natural Gas and Sugar 
Mountain Ski Resort. He owned his own mountain, Hanging Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	During a mission over France in 1944, a German shell blew the  
nose off Andrews' bomber, knocked out two engines and killed or 
wounded a gunner, the navigator and the bombardier. The crew 
attempted to nurse the plane back to England because the bombardier 
was too gravely wounded to jump. 
</P>
<P>
	His story inspired the John Hersey novel in 1959, later made  
into a film starring Steve McQueen. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Sidney Gottlieb, who oversaw CIA  
experiments during the Cold War that included the use of LSD on 
unwitting test subjects, died Sunday at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1950s and early '60s, the CIA gave psychedelic drugs  
to hundreds of Americans who were unaware they were part of 
experiments. The agency feared enemies could use the drugs as a 
weapon or for brainwashing. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects included prisoners, mental patients, military  
personnel and college students. At least one subject died, others 
went insane or were otherwise damaged psychologically, according to 
firsthand testimony, government documents and court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before he retired in 1972, Gottlieb concluded that the  
experiments had been useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb was also involved in CIA assassination plots, The New  
York Times reported. During the Eisenhower and Kennedy 
administrations, he carried out orders to develop a poison 
handkerchief to kill an Iraqi colonel, toxic gifts for Fidel Castro 
and a poison dart to kill a leftist leader in the Congo. None of 
the plots succeeded.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Oswaldo Guayasamin, considered Ecuador's top  
painter this century, died Wednesday of a heart attack, leaving his 
masterpiece, the Chapel of Man, unfinished. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Guayasmin, a leftist and close friend of Cuban President Fidel  
Castro, had traveled to Baltimore for treatment of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 in Quito, he began building a brick and copper  
cathedral-shaped building with murals telling the story of ``man in 
the Americas.'' Last month, he said it would be finished in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Guayasamin was known for his fierce anti-U.S. rhetoric. One  
mural featured a skull in a Nazi helmet with the letters CIA.

	LONDON (AP) -- Arnold Machin, whose profile of Queen Elizabeth II  
has appeared on British postage stamps since 1967, died Tuesday at 
age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	The profile of the queen shown on postage stamps is based on an  
image designed by Machin in 1964 for coins that were introduced 
four years later. That image was used by the Royal Mint until 1985.

<P>
	She was circulation, production and advertising manager before  
becoming associate publisher of Town Crier Publications Inc, which

	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Lionel Steinberg, the first table  
grape grower to sign a contract with Cesar Chavez and the United 
Farm Workers, died Sunday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg was a major grower in the Coachella Valley and the  
longtime president of David Freedman &AMP; Co., based in Thermal. 
</P>
<P>
	He served on the California Board of Agriculture under both Gov.  
Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown Sr. and his son, Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry'' 
Brown. He was named board president in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s, Steinberg stood alone among growers in his  
willingness to negotiate with Chavez and his union. He signed the 
historic contract with Chavez on April 10, 1970.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Flu-Related Deaths Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Deaths this flu season are running slightly  
higher than expected, the government reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu season, which runs from late October through early May,  
got off to a slow start but has heated up, with 43 states reporting 
outbreaks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week ending Feb. 27, pneumonia- and influenza-related  
deaths accounted for 8.1 percent of the total deaths reported in 
122 U.S. cities, the CDC said. The agency had expected a rate of 
7.5 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last three weeks in February, in fact, the rate has run  
higher than CDC expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death rate is higher than expected for this time of  
year,'' said Dr. Carolyn Bridges of the CDC's Center for Infectious 
Diseases. ``We may have not yet seen the peak of influenza- or 
pneumonia-related deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flu contributes to the deaths of about 20,000 people in the  
United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC won't release the latest total of deaths. At the end of  
the flu season, the agency will analyze deaths and determine how 
many of those attributed to pneumonia or other causes were actually 
caused by the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	An outbreak at a long-term care facility in Santa Clara County,  
Calif., sickened 60 workers and 37 residents, two of whom died, the 
CDC said, emphasizing the need for health care workers to get flu 
shots.

<HEADLINE>  Hornets Deal Rice to Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Now the pressure's really on the Los  
Angeles Lakers, who acquired the rebounding help and deadly outside 
shooter Shaquille O'Neal wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after adding Dennis Rodman, the Lakers traded for  
sharpshooter Glen Rice from the Charlotte Hornets, along with power 
forward J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Hornets received All-Star guard Eddie Jones and  
center Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the respective rosters, the Lakers waived  
reserve forward Corie Blount and the Hornets waived forward Joe 
Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers also waived Armstrong to make room on their roster  
for rookie Ruben Patterson, who was activated from the injured 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, you hate to see guys like Eddie and Elden go, but I  
think what we received for this team is pretty good,'' O'Neal said 
after the Lakers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 94-75 Wednesday 
night for their ninth straight victory. ``We received a deadly 
shooter and another thuggish power forward, and there's no excuses 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, rumored for over a month, was made on the eve of the  
league's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who reached the Western Conference finals last May  
before being swept by the Utah Jazz, are going for their first 
championship since 1988 -- their fifth title of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Rice and Reid followed by two weeks the firing  
of coach Del Harris and hiring of Kurt Rambis as his successor, as 
well as the signing of Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder for the 
last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it appears, nothing less than a championship will do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that most teams in the league would like the  
people we have,'' executive vice president Jerry West said. ``This 
is the ultimate risk-taking business. We took a risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talked to (Rice) today, he was absolutely elated. We  
think we got a player that will help us -- a lot. We feel this takes 
us one step closer to our ultimate goal of having an NBA 
championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8  
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. He averaged 22.3 points last season to rank sixth 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with Kobe  
Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm assuming he'll play here Friday night,'' West said of  
Rice. ``We had two scouts look at him Monday in Miami. We had 
glowing reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have an option on Rice's contract for next season.  
West made it clear the team intended to keep him, but added, 
``There's no (contractual) promises to Glen Rice or his agent. We 
will address that when the time comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Rice has made 1,216 3-point shots, third  
in league history, and is 101 points shy of the 15,000-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting arguably one of the greatest shooters in the  
game today,'' Rambis said of Rice. ``Teams have to honor him the 
minute he crosses midcourt. We have a terrific potential for an 
in-and-out game with Shaq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 30, was Charlotte's No. 2 scorer this season, averaging  
14.5 points in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll welcome Glen and J.R. just like we welcomed Dennis --  
with open arms,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said. ``Glen brings 
some of the best perimeter shooting that guys have ever seen. I 
think both guys will bring us good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made three days after the resignation of Hornets  
coach Dave Cowens, who was unhappy with his salary. Charlotte won 
over 50 games each of the last two seasons and made the playoffs, 
but is just 5-12 this year after an 85-70 loss at Philadelphia on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets coach Paul Silas, who replaced Cowens, said before the  
game at Philadelphia he was ``elated'' with the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make us a lot more athletic,'' Silas said. ``The  
biggest plus is Elden Campbell is our center, and Derrick Coleman 
will now play (power forward). We have a real good starting lineup 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Jones can play forward or guard, and he wants to be  
here. That's a big plus. I've known him for years, and he's a fine 
young man. To get an All-Star like him is just great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said Jones will play his first game for them Friday  
night in Washington, and Campbell will make his Charlotte debut 
Sunday at New York against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice and Reid are expected to play their first game for the  
Lakers on Friday night against visiting Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 27, an All-Star the last two years playing in his fifth  
NBA season, has established himself as one of the league's best 
3-point shooters and defenders and was one of the most popular 
Lakers players, often eliciting the chant of ``Ed-die, Ed-die'' 
from fans at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even such a chant Wednesday night -- after the trade  
was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, 30, has shown flashes of brilliance since the Lakers  
made him a first-round draft pick in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was one of the most unpopular Lakers, due mainly to  
inconsistency and, perhaps, because of a seven-year, $49 million 
contract signed before the 1996-97 season.

<HEADLINE>  Minnesota Loses After Suspending 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Minnesota is finished in the NCAA tournament. The  
investigation is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaken by an academic scandal, the Gophers were eliminated by  
Gonzaga in the first round of the NCAA tournament Thursday as four 
of Minnesota players were suspended hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came one day after the Saint Paul Pioneer Press  
quoted a former university employee as saying she had done course 
work for at least 20 players in the basketball program, including 
four on the current squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours before tipoff, university president Mark Yudof  
announced that starters Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, along with 
reserves Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford, were suspended pending 
the outcome of an inquiry into allegations of academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins wholeheartedly agreed with Yudof's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't put winning and losing ahead of what's right,''  
Haskins said after the loss. ``I've been that way for 55 years. I 
won't change tomorrow or today. ...Some people sell their souls to 
win. I don't do that. Never have, never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has enveloped Haskins' program in a cloud of  
uncertainty, a mood reflected in the quiet of the Gophers' locker 
room and the blank expressions on the faces of the four suspended 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The depleted team quickly fell far behind the underdogs of  
Gonzaga, a small school seeded 10th in the tournament. After 
trailing by as many as 21 points early in the second half, the 
seventh-seeded Gophers cut the lead to two with 1:43 to go before 
losing 75-63. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players -- in matching black and white warmups -- sat  
glumly at the end of the bench during the game. The only times they 
got on the court was during timeouts, when they peered in from the 
edge of team huddles. 
</P>
<P>
	None spoke to reporters. They were not in the locker room after  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, Tarver and Stanford -- all seniors -- left knowing they'd  
never play another college game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard,'' said their senior teammate, Quincy Lewis.  
``They are my seniors. It was hard. Just leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins insisted he would keep his job.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt about that at all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The team heads home to Minneapolis and an investigation that's  
far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the type of thing that just tests your courage. It  
tests you as a Christian. It tests you as a man,'' Haskins said. 
``I've been tested many times. This is just one more test, for 
whatever reason, but I think we'll pass this test with flying 
colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the university's  
academic counseling unit, told the Pioneer Press she wrote papers, 
helped with take-home exams and did other course work for players 
between 1993 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she was taken on two of the team's road trips,  
including one to Hawaii, and considered it compensation for the 
work. She said she never was asked by coaches to do work for 
players, though she said Haskins once paid her $3,000 in cash to 
tutor a player. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said Haskins denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press said four former players confirmed the woman's  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' said former player Russ  
Archambault, a freshman on the 1997 Final Four team who left school 
before the next season. ``We used to make jokes about it. ... I 
would go over there some nights and get like four papers done. The 
coaches would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Minneapolis news conference, Yudof said the reputation of  
the university, its program and Haskins were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof envisioned ``fairly Draconian sanctions coming out if this  
proves to be true. The seriousness cannot be overstated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who said he knew nothing of any academic wrongdoing,  
accepted responsibility for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I run the basketball program at the University of Minnesota,  
so yes I'm held responsible for that,'' he said. ``The thing is you 
put your trust and faith in people but a man, from time to time, 
for whatever reason, will let you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few rows behind the bench, a couple hundred fans, clad in  
Minnesota's maroon and gold, cheered their team. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Erban of Stillwater, Minn., who flew in with 80 other fans  
Wednesday night, said he has seen all 16 of the Gophers' NCAA 
tournament games since Haskins came to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel something of an air of sadness, not anger against  
anyone,'' he said, ``an air of sadness for the players, their 
parents, the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if things weren't bad enough, reserve forward-center Kyle  
Sanden twisted an ankle in practice Wednesday and was on crutches. 
That left eight players available. Two fouled out, so Haskins was 
down to six players by the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The university conducted a 24-hour investigation before  
announcing the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen some evidence,'' Yudof said. ``I don't think we  
should characterize it beyond that. ... All we know is that the 
charges are certainly serious, and there seems to be enough 
evidence to support some of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota hired Haskins from Western Kentucky in 1986 after  
another scandal rocked the basketball program. Coach Jim Dutcher 
resigned after three players were accused of rape following a game 
at Wisconsin in 1986. Jimmy Williams, a Dutcher assistant, coached 
the final 11 games of the season, and Haskins took over for the 
1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins led his team to the Final Four two years ago and has 240  
career victories with the Gophers, five short of the all-time 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof called him ``a great coach who has served this institution  
ably for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no doubt that tough days were ahead for him and  
the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too premature to be talking about what the  
consequences of this could be,'' Dienhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an investigation involving another high profile program, an  
FBI inquiry into alleged mob ties to UCLA football players failed 
to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began a sports-betting investigation after the Bruins,  
with a 10-0 record and strong contenders for the national title, 
lost to Florida and Wisconsin to close out last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI has told me we have nothing to be concerned about ...  
that it has no concerns regarding the conduct of UCLA or any of its 
student athletes,'' athletic director Peter Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy P. McNally, FBI assistant director in Los Angeles, said  
Thursday the investigation was complete and there was no evidence 
of any wrongdoing by any members of the team.

	Citigroup's goal is to offer customer's the one-stop shopping  
promised by the merger between banking titan Citibank and brokerage 
and insurance giant Travelers Group late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Citigroup is the nation's largest financial company, it  
may have trouble changing customers' banking habits, let alone 
their poor savings patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the nation's savings rate slipped to 0.5 percent -- the  
lowest of any industrialized country and down from 2.1 percent in 
1997, according to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	And although many Americans want to save more, only 10 percent  
think to ask their bank teller for financial advice, according to a 
recent survey commissioned by Citigroup. That may be because long 
lines and fees have forced more customers to use the automated 
teller, telephone or computer to handle their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's plan ``could be good because it increases  
competition and options for consumers and its another way for 
consumers to get information,'' said Tracy Shelton, an attorney for 
the New York Public Interest Research Group. ``A serious drawback 
could be that it's too easy and convenient and limits the kind of 
research people need to do to make the best choice for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To lure customers back inside for financial advice, Citibank is  
going to have to beef up its customer service said Joe Plumeri, 
head of Citbanking North America -- even if that means keeping some 
branches open as late as 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to begin to be available when our customers want us to  
be available,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage customers to save and invest more, Citibank is  
introducing an option to automatically deduct money for investments 
from customers' Easy Checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	And to attract more customers to its Easy Checking accounts,  
Citibank is lowering the monthly fee to $7.50 nationwide. 
Currently, Citibank charges between $9.50 and $25 a month for the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup also will give new and existing customers $25 if they  
enroll in the new automatic-deduction program called AutoSave. The 
offer is good through May 31.

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Grows Outside City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAHRUMP, Nev. (AP) -- When Jack Sanders moved here in 1985, he  
found it to be a great place to grow grapes. Turns out, it's a 
prime spot to grow people, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Situated between booming Las Vegas and California's Death  
Valley, Pahrump's population has grown nearly sixfold since Sanders 
left Marin County, Calif., for a more rural lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The population was about 3,500 when I came here,'' Sanders  
said while workers filled glasses for some of the 110,000 tourists 
who visit his winery annually. ``I've seen it grow from a trickle 
to an international business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this growth comes in a tiny, dusty place that was once best  
known as the home of the Chicken Ranch, the closest legal brothel 
to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	New figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau this week rank  
surrounding Nye County 10th among the fastest-growing counties in 
the United States. Forsyth County, Ga., ranked No. 1, growing at a 
rate of 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many new residents here are refugees from the congestion of  
California and Las Vegas, 65 miles to the east. Los Angeles County 
and Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, ranked Nos. 1 and 5, 
respectively, in terms of the actual number of residents gained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember back when I was young, I thought Pahrump was  
the garden spot of the world, the ideal climate,'' said Nye County 
Commissioner Dick Carver, 54. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed when I was a kid that you'd see anything but  
cotton fields and alfalfa fields in the Pahrump Valley. The cotton 
fields are a thing of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking their place are subdivisions, new roads, schools,  
commercial strips -- growth headaches more familiar in Las Vegas and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Highway 160, the town's main drag, is lined with real estate  
offices and mobile- and manufactured-home dealers. On the 
outskirts, construction crews are busy expanding the winding road 
to Las Vegas into four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't keep up with the law enforcement, and we don't talk  
about numbers of classrooms anymore, we talk about how many schools 
we need,'' Carver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders thinks Pahrump's population could eventually reach  
100,000. If he's right, Nye County as a whole would still be one of 
the least densely populated in the country. At 11.6 million acres, 
Nye is the second-largest county in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Pahrump accounts for two-thirds of Nye's population, yet the  
county seat remains in Tonopah 170 miles to the north. Some suggest 
it might be time to realign Nye County to reflect Pahrump's modern 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seven intersections that need traffic signals, and no  
money to do it,'' said real estate agent Bob Little. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in northern Nye County should wake up and realize  
there's a world out there,'' he said. ``It's like the guy trying to 
sell you a buggy whip in today's world.''

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials shot within striking  
distance of 10,000 Thursday, breaking through both 9,800 and 9,900 
for the first time before giving up some of their gains. A rebound 
in oil prices from 12-year lows, which has lifted oil stocks, and 
continued strength in the economy have been propelling the stock 
market to new heights. The Dow Jones industrial average got as high 
as 9,935.46 in the afternoon, within 65 points of 10,000. It 
finished the day up 124.60, or by 1.3 percent, at 9,897.44. That 
put it within 103 points of the five-digit milestone.

	U.S. Trade Deficit at Record High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. deficit in the broadest measure of  
trade surged to a record high of $233.4 billion last year as the 
global economic crisis resulted in the first drop in sales of 
American farm products and manufactured goods in 13 years. The 
Commerce Department reported that the deficit in the current 
account jumped by 50.4 percent from the 1997 imbalance of $155.2 
billion. While the fourth quarter deficit narrowed a slight 2.9 
percent to $63.8 billion, private economists viewed that as a 
temporary improvement and not a sign of a permanent turn for the 
better.

	Retail Sales Jump in February  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans opened their wallets and purses to  
purchase everything from cars to furniture in February, powering 
retail sales to another strong increase. The sales -- which 
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- jumped 
0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion, the 
Commerce Department said Thursday. That came on top of robust gains 
of 1 percent in January and 1.1 percent in December. And it was the 
seventh in a row. Both the January and December figures were 
revised higher from previous estimates, January's substantially, 
from 0.2 percent.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
rose almost 82 percent from a year ago, boosted by a big gain from 
German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG's purchase of a 50 percent 
stake in barnesandnoble.com. The New York-based company said 
Thursday that it earned $106 million, or $1.47 a share, in the 
fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, compared with $58.3 million, or 81 
cents a share a year ago. Sales were $1.03 billion, up from $968.53

	DODGEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Lands' End Inc.'s fourth-quarter  
earnings fell 38 percent from a year ago, as the catalog giant 
continues to struggle to get its business back on track. The 
company said today that it earned $25.69 million, or 84 cents a 
share, in the quarter ended Jan. 29, compared with $41.25 million, 
or $1.32 a share, in the same period a year ago. The 1998 results

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairmen of Exxon and Mobil told lawmakers  
today the merger of the two oil giants is essential for them to 
compete with the large government-owned oil producers that dominate 
the world market. ``The merger will mean that Exxon-Mobil ... will 
be able to compete in the same scale as the largest foreign 
firms,'' Exxon chairman Lee Raymond told a House subcommittee. 
Exxon plans to purchase Mobil for $73.7 billion in stock, creating 
the sixth-largest oil producer in the world. The only larger ones 
are government-owned.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers struggling after a year of falling  
prices would continue to have additional bankruptcy protection 
under a bill the House passed today. The measure, approved 418-1, 
would extend Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection to farmers for six 
months. Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, enacted in 1986, allows 
family farmers to reorganize their debts instead of liquidating 
assets. It is the second proposed extension of the measure as 
lawmakers continue work on an overall bankruptcy reform bill. 
Chapter 12 is set to expire on April 1.

	PARIS (AP) -- French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel  
plans to cut 12,000 jobs over the next two years, or about 10 
percent of its work force. A large part of the job cuts will come 
from restructuring the group's U.S. operations, said Chairman Serge

<HEADLINE>  Iran President Meets With Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II emerged from a private  
meeting with Iran's president today saying the 25-minute discussion 
was part of ``an important, promising day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As President Mohammad Khatami left the pope's library, the  
Iranian leader said, ``The hope is for the final victory of 
monotheism, morality, peace and reconciliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chanting of Iranian dissidents outside in St. Peter's Square  
could be heard as the two men came out of their meeting with their 
interpreters for a public exchange of gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami's trip to the Vatican was considered the culmination of  
his three-day visit to Italy, the first state visit by an Iranian 
leader to a Western nation since the country's 1979 Islamic 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and pleased, the pope gave the president a  
painting of Sts. Peter and Paul. Khatami presented John Paul with a 
Persian rug with a design of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	In its official communique, the Vatican called the event a warm  
encounter based on ``a spirit of dialogue between Muslims and 
Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami, the Vatican said, referred to an inter-religious  
meeting organized by the pope in the central city of Assisi in 1986 
and said he hoped the ``spirit of Assisi'' would be the model for 
future relations among religions and peoples. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the possibility of  
a stop by John Paul in Iran's capital of Tehran was not discussed. 
There had been speculation the audience could be a prelude to a 
papal stopover during an expected trip to Asia later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican concerns over human rights in Iran and the treatment of  
the tiny Catholic community were discussed during Khatami's meeting 
with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, 
following the papal audience. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 120,000 Christians in Iran, about 13,000 of them  
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Fides, the news agency of the Vatican's missionary  
arm, Iranian Christians are free to worship inside their churches 
but their activities are watched and they are barred from serving 
in the government and armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Peter's Square was off-limits to tourists as part of  
extremely tight security, but somehow approximately 50 chanting 
anti-Khatami protesters got into the square and were surrounded by 
about as many police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Iranian reporters traveling with Khatami said about 10  
opposition protesters surrounded the journalists' cars outside the 
Vatican. Police intervened and pulled them away. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami, a moderate cleric who has pushed for more political and  
social freedom in Iran, spoke Wednesday in a conciliatory way 
towards Western religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the divine religions are not quintessentially different,''  
he declared in an address at the European University Institute at 
Fiesole, outside Florence. 
</P>
<P>
	He called mankind ``the meeting point of the soul's East and the  
reason's West.'' Differences ``should not be taken to mean there 
exists no natural link between the two views,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has also stressed the common ground between  
Christianity, Islam and other faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	In the run-up to the audience, the Vatican rejected criticism of  
the meeting from the Iranian opposition-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pope opens his arms to all those who seek an audience,''  
Sodano said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	During his three-day visit, Khatami has repeatedly advocated  
more open relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to head back to Iran later today.

<HEADLINE> Ingram Micro To Cut 1,400 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Computer distributor Ingram Micro Inc.  
is eliminating 1,400 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force, 
because of slow demand overseas, price competition at home and 
worries about potential Year 2000 problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, one of the leading distributors of personal  
computers, also disclosed today its first-quarter earnings without 
charges for the job cuts would be substantially below analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Its share price tumbled $1.12 1/2 a share, or 6 percent, to $17.50  
in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Jerre L. Stead said most of the job cuts would come in  
U.S. operations. He blamed Year 2000 fears and cautious buying in 
Europe, Latin America and Asia for the job losses. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said increased price competition in the United States  
has hurt profit margins. The $22 billion company expects to begin 
realizing cost savings from the job cuts in the second quarter of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ingram Micro began redeploying employees and  
eliminating positions overseas through attrition, according to the 
company statement. A softness in sales this quarter has forced the 
company to eliminate more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Ingram Micro plans to close its  
California-based consolidation center, realign its sales force and 
create a merchandizing operation that joins purchasing, vendor 
sales and product marketing departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they expect Ingram Micro's net sales for  
the 1999 first quarter to be between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, 
an increase of between 26 percent and 30 percent over the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they also expect net income for the quarter to range  
from $40 million to $45 million before paying any one-time costs 
for work force reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	That amounts to 27 cents to 30 cents a share, and is well below  
the average estimate of 42 cents a share by analysts surveyed by 
First call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As of September 1998, Ingram Micro had more than 14,000  
employees. The company and its subsidiaries operate in 31 countries 
and distribute more than 200,000 products.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Ready To Lead Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees became baseball's best  
team because of their unmatched depth -- and that includes their 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that abundance, there's no shortage of candidates to  
fill in for Joe Torre while the manager undergoes treatment for 
prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Zimmer, Torre's trusted sidekick the last three seasons,  
appears likely to run the team during Torre's absence. But while 
Zimmer recovers from knee surgery, the Yankees say Torre's duties 
will be split between coaches Mel Stottlemyre, Willie Randolph, 
Chris Chambliss and former manager Stump Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe pushed all the right buttons the last few years, and  
someone has to take that responsibility now,'' David Cone said. 
``One of the beauties of Joe Torre as a manager is he really 
involves all of his coaches. The whole coaching staff is so well 
respected and so involved and this team is so self-motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who used a baseball bat as a cane, agrees there are few  
decisions to make as the 125-win Yankees prepare for the season. 
When decisions are needed, he will follow Torre's model. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going to manage, I will take responsibility for all the  
decisions,'' said Zimmer, who nearly broke down in tears when asked 
to describe his feelings for Torre. ``We think alike and I will try 
to do the same things he would have done. I want to run the team 
like Joe would have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Zimmer held court in the Yankees' dugout Thursday afternoon,  
Torre spent the day with his family, trying to keep his mind off 
the cancer before choosing a course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Cashman called Torre to read him the box  
scores from Wednesday's split-squad games, deliver reports from the 
coaches and get his input on roster moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's brother Frank, whose heart transplant during the 1996  
World Series colored Joe's first season in pinstripes, visited the 
Yankees' clubhouse one day after arriving in the Tampa area to be 
with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in very good shape, looks great and has no pain,'' Frank  
Torre said. ``All indications are that the cancer is in the early 
stages. It's just a matter of getting his thoughts together and 
deciding which way he will go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Torre said his brother will probably take a few days to  
make his decision. The route he takes will help determine how long 
he will be away from the team, which could be as little as three 
weeks if he takes radiation shots or at least six if he has 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as he eats sleeps and breathes baseball, it is not No.  
1 in his life,'' Frank Torre said. ``If someone upstairs said his 
recovery would be a maybe and he could return next month or it 
would be guaranteed and he could never manage again, it would be a 
no-brainer. He'd miss the game, but his priority is getting 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the responsibility for the team will fall to Zimmer  
and the coaches. Merrill, who managed the team in 1990-91 and is 
currently a special assistant to Cashman, handled the duties 
Thursday night against Texas as Zimmer had his surgically-repaired 
knee checked out by the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who has an 885-858 career record for San Diego, Boston,  
Texas and the Cubs, almost retired after last season, his 50th in 
professional baseball. But he is glad he decided to return, so he 
can step in for his good friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to emphasize, we will get the job done for Joe,'' said  
Zimmer, who will not take over the team until he is recovered from 
knee surgery. ``Hopefully we will start on a good note and win as 
many games as we can until he gets back.''

</P>
<P>
	High school junior Chloe McInnis has been scoring about 1000 on  
SAT practice tests and doesn't expect to have any problem meeting 
the NCAA's minimum test score of 820. Moreover, she hopes her top 
choice, Georgia Tech, still abides by the now-defunct NCAA standard 
so that academic standards don't slip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting 820 shouldn't be a problem for anyone (going to  
college),'' said the 16-year-old, who has a 3.5 grade point average 
at Eastern Senior High School in Washington, D.C. ``You are a 
student before you're an athlete. You should live up to the 
academic side and the athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Johnson and McInnis, there are two sides to the NCAA  
eligibility rules: those who say the requirements stop driven, 
talented athletes from getting a college education, and those who 
insist athletes must excel in academics if they want to attend 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight-hundred twenty is certainly not a high test score,''  
said Al Papik, assistant athletic director at Nebraska, where the 
average SAT score for entering freshmen is 1130. ``On occasion, our 
coaches will feel there are some students that did not test like 
the students they are capable of being. ... maybe one or two 
students a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Philadelphia this week barred enforcement of  
an NCAA rule saying students must score at least 820 on the SAT to 
compete as college freshmen, in addition to achieving a 2.5 
grade-point average in 13 core courses. The highest score on the 
SAT test is 1600. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA requested a stay Wednesday and asked for more time to  
write replacement eligibility rules and to file appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed by four black athletes who said they were  
denied NCAA scholarships or sports eligibility because they didn't 
meet the minimum test score. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson can understand the frustration. She has a 3.1 GPA at  
Calvin Coolidge High School in Washington, D.C., but scored a 
barely passing 830 after taking the test three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that I could make it in college. The test just makes  
you feel like you're stupid,'' said the 18-year-old, who is headed 
to Maryland in the fall. ``I wish it had been done before I took 
the SAT multiple times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the rules have supporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Admissions director Ed Gillis at Miami, where the average SAT  
score is 1170, said the NCAA rules help broker discussions between 
admissions officers and coaches who seek admission for athletes 
that would not otherwise have met academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that whether you loved the previous regulations or  
hated them, they made it easier for admissions folks and faculty 
and coaches and student athletes (to judge applicants),'' Gillis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Miami already has made its admissions decisions for fall  
1999, Gillis said the court ruling could encourage coaches to 
reevaluate some recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a bunch of student-athletes that coaches had backed  
away from because they weren't going to be qualifiers, then ... the 
whole admission arena for athletes will be thrown into a state of 
confusion,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Marbury Says Nets Have Acquired Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stephon Marbury went on the radio this afternoon  
and said he had been traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the 
New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the two teams could not immediately confirm a  
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury said he had heard of the trade from his agent, David  
Falk, and had spoken to Nets co-owner Lewis Katz. Speaking from the 
West Coast on WFAN in New York, Marbury said he planned to fly 
cross country and join the Nets for their game Friday at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	WFAN said the Nets would send Sam Cassell, Chris Gatling and  
Brian Evans to the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who is from Brooklyn, said he was elated to be  
returning home, and would immediately sign a long-term extension 
with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sign tomorrow. It'll be signed tomorrow,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are off to the worst start in the Eastern Conference at  
3-15, including five straight losses that have raised questions 
about coach John Calipari's job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury had helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West. At 12-6, they are only two games behind 
Utah in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk met with Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor about 10 days ago  
to discuss Marbury's future, and Marbury turned down a six-year 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury has long expressed a desire to play for the New York  
Knicks, and it's clear he saw the Nets as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's New York, but it's not New York. It's New Jersey,'' he  
said. ``When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first 
thing they think is that's the other New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell has played in only two games since spraining his ankle  
in the season opener. Gatling had asked to be traded, and Evans was 
showcased in heavy minutes Wednesday night in a loss to the Pacers.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Relief for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers struggling after a year of falling  
prices would continue to have additional bankruptcy protection 
under a bill the House passed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved 418-1, would extend Chapter 12 bankruptcy  
protection to farmers for six months. Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy 
code, enacted in 1986, allows family farmers to reorganize their 
debts instead of liquidating assets. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second proposed extension of the measure as lawmakers  
continue work on an overall bankruptcy reform bill. Chapter 12 is 
set to expire on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This measure will provide a crucial safety net to farmers,''  
said Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., adding that lawmakers should move 
to make Chapter 12 bankruptcy protections permanent. ``I do not 
want America's family farmers to be held hostage to congressional 
deliberations that may not be completed in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program is intended for farmers who receive more than half  
of their income from farming, who have total debts of less than 
$1.5 million and whose debts from farming operations are at least 
80 percent of total debts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, thousands of farmers have been hit hard by low prices  
that are expected to continue this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, voted against the bill, which the Senate  
has yet to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 808.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers To Reopen Au Pair Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Lawyers for Louise Woodward say they will  
re-examine the death of an 8-month-old boy in her care in light of 
a recent ``60 Minutes'' report that suggested the baby was 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	The former British au pair was convicted in 1997 of  
second-degree murder in the death of Matthew Eappen. The judge 
reduced her conviction to involuntary manslaughter and released her 
from prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers said Thursday that they will review the medical  
evidence in the case following the ``60 Minutes'' report on two 
doctors who believe Matthew was strangled -- not shaken and slammed 
by Ms. Woodward as prosecutors argued at her trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The new theory was proposed by Dr. Floyd Gilles, a  
neuropathologist, and Dr. Marvin Nelson, a radiologist, both 
affiliated with Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth needs to be pursued,'' said defense attorney Andrew  
Good, adding that he had not yet spoken to the researchers about 
their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his firm would review the findings and approach  
prosecutors to see if they could jointly launch an independent 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her good name is important, and she should not be known as a  
convicted felon,'' said defense lawyer Barry Scheck. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Martha Coakley questioned why Ms. Woodward's lawyers  
would suddenly embrace a new defense theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their witnesses said this baby died of an old brain injury, so  
I think their credibility is called into question,'' she said. 
``Every doctor I have worked with says this (strangulation) theory 
is implausible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``60 Minutes'' report stirred controversy, with a group of  
more than 70 physicians criticizing the story in a letter to CBS as 
``preposterous'' and questioning a payment made to Nelson by Ms. 
Woodward's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward, who is attending law school in England, settled a  
civil wrongful death lawsuit with Matthew's parents, Drs. Sunil and 
Deborah Eappen, in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eappen family was unavailable for comment Thursday, but  
their lawyer, Fredric Ellis, criticized the move by Ms. Woodward's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyers appear to be insistent on using the media to  
conduct a never-ending trial in the court of public opinion,'' he 
said. ``All it does is cause pain to the Eappen family.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Deputy Defends Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno's top deputy  
angrily brushed off criticism Thursday that her planned 
investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a bunch of crap,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder  
said. Asked to elaborate, Holder interjected: ``That's c-r-a-p.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holder was responding to comments a day earlier from one of  
Starr's former prosecutors, who said the Justice Department seemed 
to get serious about investigating Starr's alleged misdeeds only 
when the independent counsel's own investigation edged close to 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems the closer we get to the president ... they have all  
of a sudden insisted on conducting a very intrusive investigation 
into the heart of what we have been doing'' in the Monica Lewinsky 
matter, former Starr deputy Robert Bittman said Wednesday on ABC's 
``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holder would not confirm widely circulated reports that Reno  
plans to investigate whether Starr overstepped his authority in the 
early days of the Lewinsky sex and cover-up investigation. But 
during the department's weekly press briefing, Holder defended the 
department's right to do such an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly take the allegations that we have received  
seriously,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly did not immediately respond to a  
telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Bittman and others, including some of Reno's Capitol Hill  
critics, have questioned whether the Justice Department can be 
impartial about Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder said the law that governs how independent counsels are  
appointed also lays out the Justice Department duty ``to 
investigate matters, or at least to consider whether or not to 
investigate matters, that have been raised with regard to the 
conduct of independent counsels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said the Justice Department has told Starr it  
intends to investigate his early dealings with Ms. Lewinsky, 
including allegations that Starr's deputies broke department rules 
by offering her immunity on condition she not discuss it with her 
attorney. Also, the department wants to know whether Starr's office 
had contacts with lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit 
that they did not mention when seeking Reno's approval to 
investigate the Lewinsky case, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has defended his office's conduct and argued that any such  
inquiry should be conducted by an outsider rather than the 
department's internal watchdog, the Office of Professional 
Responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Education Bill Reaches Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's schools would get greater freedom  
in how they spend federal education money under a measure passed 
Thursday by the House. A Senate bill was also up for a vote, but 
without new money for hiring teachers that Democrats also had 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Senate bill, if passed, includes an amendment that  
would let states shift the money they are already slated to get for 
new teachers to special education instead, possibly affecting 
checks heading out this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have chosen the path of partisanship and  
division,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a telephone 
interview. She was out of town due to the death of her 
father-in-law. ``I really would question their sincerity to do 
something before an election, and then five months later they undo 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last fall's spending bill, Congress in a compromise approved  
$1.2 billion to help schools hire about 30,000 new teachers in the 
early grades. President Clinton wants a total of 100,000 new 
teachers hired over seven years, costing more than $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote on the Senate bill was expected later Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The House vote on the more limited bill, without money for  
special education or new teachers, was 330-90. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``ed-flex'' bill, the first education measure of  
this Congress, initially enjoyed strong bipartisan support but 
quickly became a battleground for each party's efforts to put its 
own mark on the nation's education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats wanted the measure to include Clinton's education  
proposals, chiefly more money for new teachers. But Republicans 
insisted those proposals should be raised later in the year and not 
bog down the ``ed-flex'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday broke a nearly weeklong deadlock over  
the issue, agreeing to consider amendments favored by Democrats, 
including money to pay for another year of the Clinton new-teacher 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But several key Democratic amendments failed Thursday. The  
Republican amendment that passed would allow states to shift 
new-teacher money instead to federal special education funding, 
which Republicans contend falls short of what the law allows. 
</P>
<P>
	States say the federal government, which dictates the rules  
states must follow on special education, provides only 7 percent to 
12 percent of the costs for those programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Republican majority voted down two Democratic  
amendments, and Democrats ran out of time in their attempts to 
offer more, including the new-teachers proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``ed-flex'' bill itself would let states and school  
districts apply federal money to programs that serve them best. For 
example, schools could use federal money meant for science and math 
teachers to boost reading instruction if that's what they need. 
</P>
<P>
	The ed-flex bill affects some of the rules governing the $15  
billion in annual federal education spending for kindergarten 
through high school. Laws already prohibit states from waiving 
rules regarding a school's safety, maintenance, students' civil 
rights and instruction of special education students. States often 
view these rules as the most expensive and time-consuming to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed two Republican amendments designed to require  
states to show better proof that they are meeting students' needs 
under their waivers even when ed-flex becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is S 280. The House bill is HR 800.

<HEADLINE> Balloonists Float Over Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Swiss and British balloonists aiming to be the  
first to circle the world nonstop floated over the Pacific Ocean 
Thursday after making it across China, their Geneva control center 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	By early Thursday, Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard and his British  
teammate Brian Jones had passed over Taiwan and were setting a 
course for a six-day journey across the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, the balloon will reach California or western  
Mexico next. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said the two pilots saw little of China because of  
clouds below them as they crossed inside the zone agreed by the 
Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard and Jones, who took off March 1 from the Swiss Alps,  
have covered more than 10,500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon's speed has increased in the past few days. By early  
Thursday, it was nearly five miles high and traveling at 95 mph. 
Its average speed since launch has been 47 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The control center said the balloon had been forbidden from  
flying north of the 26th parallel across China because the 
authorities ``could not guarantee our safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several times during the 14-hour crossing, the balloon came  
within 25 miles of the forbidden zone, and Chinese authorities 
pointed it out to the crew three times, the control center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he  
failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure 
from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson ditched in the  
Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they 
lacked Chinese permission.

<HEADLINE> Browns Give Couch Rave Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Quarterback Tim Couch worked out to rave  
reviews Thursday from the expansion Cleveland Browns and other NFL 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland and others  
watched Couch throw 60-plus passes and dispel rumors about his arm 
strength at an indoor field house adjacent to Kentucky's 
Commonwealth Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations, said  
Couch's workout went ``great,'' and Browns coach Chris Palmer 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he did a nice job,'' Palmer said. ``I think he  
pressed a bit early, but he settled down and threw the ball very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns own the No. 1 pick in next month's NFL draft, and the  
club has made it clear it would prefer to take a quarterback with 
the selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's first pass in his private workout was a short route that  
sailed a little and started to wobble, the quarterback said. 
However, he soon calmed down and Clark said Couch threw a pair of 
post patterns deeper than 60 yards with a lot of zip on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	After completing several 18-yard outs, fly patterns and a  
deeper-than-expected comebacker, Couch gave himself a passing grade 
for his deep-ball test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple of throws I was pressing, but I thought I  
threw the deep ball good, and that was really the only question 
they had,'' Couch said. ``It pretty much went like I thought it 
would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Couch's post patterns was caught by former Wildcats  
wideout and NFL hopeful Craig Yeast. His last, a 65-yard post, was 
snared by the quarterback's former Kentucky roommate, receiver 
Kevin Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt in Coleman's mind that Couch is the best  
quarterback available in the draft, but the distance Couch put on 
the ball Thursday surprised even his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of funny to catch one that deep from Tim, but I've  
seen him throw it farther,'' Coleman said. ``Look, Craig Yeast had 
to run through it at 60 yards, and he runs a 4.2 40-yard dash, so 
if you have any questions, they're answered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Couch, the best thing about Thursday's workout was that it  
ended weeks of waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I'm glad this day is over,'' he said. ``This was  
probably tougher than any game. This was a day I've been dreaming 
about since I was a little kid. 
</P>

	``Now, they've seen me up close, I've performed for them, and  
the ball is in their hands. I've shown them what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up next for the Kentucky quarterback are private workouts with  
interested teams, said Greg Couch, the All-American's brother who 
is part of his management team. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch worked out for the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday without  
throwing, Greg Couch said, because the Bengals were confident in 
his arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest argument I can make for Tim is that he's been the  
best at every level he's played at,'' the elder Couch said. ``He 
feels that if he keeps working hard, there's no reason he can't 
continue that trend in the pros.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch said he doesn't spend time worrying about the  
possibility that he might not be taken first by the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to go make it, whether I'm the first pick or not,''  
he said. ``It's their decision.''

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Charge To Be Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Prosecutors said Thursday they would drop an  
assisted suicide charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian, though he still 
faces murder charges based on a video he supplied to ``60 Minutes'' 
that appears to show him giving a terminally ill man a lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Gorcyca said the decision to drop the charge  
was made so Kevorkian would not be given the opportunity to present 
evidence about the pain and suffering of Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old 
man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to focus on Jack Kevorkian's behavior and be certain  
that jurors are not confused by evidence of Thomas Youk's medical 
conditions,'' Gorcyca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney David Gorosh called the move hypocritical,  
saying jurors still would see much about Youk's life and be 
reluctant to convict Kevorkian of murder. His attorneys also had 
argued that charges of murder and assisted suicide were 
contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian still faces a charge of delivery of a controlled  
substance in Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's trial is scheduled to begin March 22. The  
first-degree murder charge carries a mandatory life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be Kevorkian's first murder trial. He has been charged  
with murder twice, but those charges were thrown out. He has been 
acquitted in three assisted suicide trials involving five deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, had dared prosecutors to charge him after he  
produced the video. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors announced their decision two days after Judge  
Jessica Cooper said the assisted suicide law requires them to show 
Youk intended to kill himself, and doing so naturally would bring 
up testimony about Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kevorkian could not present such evidence in defense of the  
murder charge, she said.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Charge To Be Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Prosecutors have decided to drop an assisted  
suicide charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian so his lawyers won't be 
given a chance to present evidence about the victim's pain and 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian still faces a murder charge based on a video he  
supplied to ``60 Minutes,'' which appears to show him giving Thomas 
Youk, 52, a lethal injection. Youk, who died in September, had Lou 
Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca said Thursday that the  
assisted-suicide charge was being dropped in order to ``focus on 
Jack Kevorkian's behavior and be certain that jurors are not 
confused by evidence of Thomas Youk's medical conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue in this case is Kevorkian's right to kill, not his  
belief in an individual's right to die,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kevorkian attorney David Gorosh said jurors still would see  
much about Youk's life and predicted they would be reluctant to 
convict Kevorkian of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a high-stakes gamble by the prosecution, and I  
think they have a misplaced belief a jury is going to convict Dr. 
Kevorkian of murder,'' Gorosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, had dared prosecutors to charge him after he  
produced the video, but his attorneys argued that charges of murder 
and assisted suicide were contradictory. Kevorkian also faces a 
charge of delivery of a controlled substance in Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison  
upon conviction. Kevorkian's trial is scheduled to begin March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors announced their decision two days after Judge  
Jessica Cooper said that the assisted suicide law requires them to 
show Youk intended to kill himself, and doing so would bring up 
testimony about Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, Kevorkian could not present such evidence in  
defense of the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members have said Youk, of Oakland County's Waterford  
Township, had become confined to a wheelchair, had little movement 
in his arms and hands and was scared of choking on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury will clearly understand how much suffering Thomas  
Youk was under,'' Gorosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has faced off against prosecutors several times during  
the past nine years, when he attended the first of what he has said 
are more than 130 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Murder charges against the retired pathologist have been thrown  
out twice, and three times he has been acquitted on charges of 
assisted suicide. A fourth trial ended in mistrial.

<HEADLINE> Flurry of NBA Trades at Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stephon Marbury, one of the most talented young point guards in  
the NBA, was dealt to the New Jersey Nets in a three-team, 
nine-player swap Thursday just hours before the league's trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other deals were made:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Philadelphia 76ers sent forwards Tim Thomas and Scott  
Williams to the Milwaukee Bucks for forwards Tyrone Hill and Jerald 
Honeycutt; 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Cleveland Cavaliers sending Vitaly Potapenko to Boston for  
Andrew DeClercq and a No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Vancouver Grizzlies traded guard Sam Mack to Houston for  
guard Rodrick Rhodes; 
</P>
<P>
	-- The New York Knicks acquired the rights to Mirsad Turkcan from  
Philadelphia for a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	By far the biggest deal of the day sent Marbury back home to the  
New York metropolitan area to play for the Nets, owners of the 
worst record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey got Marbury after Miami, which was considering  
trading Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown, backed out of a complicated 
four-team deal, The Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP also learned that Minnesota general manager Kevin McHale  
turned down an offer of Latrell Sprewell and Chris Childs from the 
New York Knicks that would have been part of a three-way trade with 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury moved to the Nets along with guards Chris Carr and  
Elliot Perry and forward Bill Curley. The Wolves got guard Terrell 
Brandon from Milwaukee and forward Brian Evans and two draft 
choices from the Nets, including a first-rounder, and New Jersey 
sent Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling to the Bucks, who also get Paul 
Grant from the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were kind of forced into it,'' Timberwolves owner Glen  
Taylor said of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed deal involving Miami also would have included  
Milwaukee, Minnesota and Vancouver, but the Heat pulled out in 
mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	A source closely involved in the trade talks, as well as a  
league official with knowledge of the discussions, said Miami was 
considering sending Hardaway to the Bucks and Brown to the 
Grizzlies. Marbury would have gone to the Heat, the Wolves would 
have gotten Brandon and a No. 1 pick and the Grizzlies would have 
acquired a No. 1 pick along with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Miami discussions were an exploratory thing,''  
said agent David Falk, who represents Marbury. ``When I spoke to 
coach Riley, I told him Stephon really wanted to go home to the New 
York area. I don't know exactly which players Miami was considering 
trading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' offer of Sprewell and Childs was confirmed by two  
different league sources close to the talks who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Wolves offered Marbury the maximum deal under  
the NBA's new labor contract, six years for $71 million, and were 
told Marbury would not accept it and would leave Minnesota when he 
became a free agent this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks also were faced with the prospect of losing Brandon as  
a free agent and getting nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely appreciative of Glen Taylor and (Bucks owner)  
Herb Kohl for allowing us to assist them in getting this very 
complicated deal done,'' Falk said. ``The deadline was 6 p.m., and 
at 6:01, if they hadn't been traded, those players would no longer 
have had any long-term value to those teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury said he would sign a six-year, $71 million extension  
with the Nets on Friday when he joins the team in Philadelphia. His 
acquisition is also expected to increase the Nets' chances of 
re-signing Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn, both of whom are 
clients of Falk. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if the Wolves had some sort of agreement with  
Brandon that will keep him with the team beyond this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. I think any player, anyone who's in any type of  
business enjoys being wanted,'' Brandon said. ``I'm excited about 
being a Timberwolf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell is signed for the next four seasons, so the Bucks face  
no risk of losing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets are off to the worst start in the Eastern Conference at  
3-15, including five straight losses that have raised questions 
about coach John Calipari's job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury helped turn the Timberwolves into one of the most  
exciting teams in the West. At 12-6, they are two games behind Utah 
in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't money,'' Taylor said. ``He grew up in the East and  
wants to play back by his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury has long expressed a desire to play for the New York  
Knicks, and it's clear he saw the Nets as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's New York, but it's not New York. It's New Jersey,'' he  
told WFAN. ``When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first 
thing they think is that's the other New York team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he was disappointed but had no hard feelings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a great future. We liked him here, we  
invested a lot of time in him as a young player. (But) he's gone 
and we're very, very fortunate to land another outstanding guard in 
Terrell Brandon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell played in only two games since spraining his ankle in  
the season opener. Gatling asked to be traded, and Evans was 
showcased in heavy minutes Wednesday night in a loss to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, Curley and Grant have seen little action this season. They  
were included in the trade to make it work under salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the seventh pick in the 1997 draft by New Jersey, had  
fallen into a mopup role after being tabbed as the cornerstone of a 
trade in which the Sixers parted with the draft rights to Van Horn 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who turns 31 next week, was an All-Star with Cleveland in  
1995 before he was traded to the Bucks with Brandon in the deal 
that sent Vin Baker to Seattle and Shawn Kemp to the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was sent back to his former team when Vancouver sent him to  
Houston for second-year swingman Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	After a solid start this season in which he averaged 17.8 points  
a game through eight games, Mack's production cooled off to where 
he was relegated to coming off the bench in Vancouver's last four 
outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we gave up some outside shooting with Sam, but he  
wasn't making very many shots lately. We think that at least what 
we've gotten is better defensively,'' Grizzlies president-general 
manager Stu Jackson said. ``I think with Rodrick, it's one more 
step to adding some versatility to our lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkcan, the 18th pick overall of the 1998 draft, is currently  
playing forward for Efes Pilssen of the Turkish League. He will be 
eligible to join the Knicks in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will give the 76ers a first-round draft pick that  
originally belonged to Toronto. The Knicks acquired it from the 
Raptors in the John Wallace trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Ukrainian-born Potapenko played in all 17  
Cleveland games this season, averaging 8.4 points and 5.5 rebounds 
per game. He was selected by Cleveland as the 12th pick overall in 
the 1996 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had been under a deadline to sign Potapenko to a new  
contract by Saturday or face losing him to free agency after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Potapenko had been used largely as a reserve forward-center  
until a season-ending injury to center Zydrunas Ilgauskas last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-10 DeClercq has averaged 5.4 points and 4.5 rebounds in 14  
games for Boston. As part of the trade, Cleveland also gets one 
first-round draft pick between now and 2001. The Cavs have the 
option of when to use the pick.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Foodborne Illnesses Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cases of foodborne illness caused by certain  
germs, such as salmonella and campylobacter, declined sharply last 
year, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although E. coli cases increased, the Centers for Disease  
Control and Prevention said the decreases in some foodborne 
illnesses were attributable to changes in meat and poultry 
processing under a Department of Agriculture program implemented in 
January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of salmonella infections, which are rarely fatal but  
can cause food poisoning, decreased 14 percent over the last two 
years -- from 14.5 per 100,000 people in 1996 to 12.4 per 100,000 in 
1998, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates of campylobacteriosis, the most widespread cause of food  
poisoning, rose from 1996 to 1997 but then declined 14 percent last 
year, from 25.2 per 100,000 in '97 to 21.7. 
</P>
<P>
	And cases of cryptosporidium, a parasite spread through human or  
animal feces that can be fatal in people weakened by AIDS, cancer 
or old age, dropped 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines ``suggest that the stepped up prevention efforts of  
the USDA and the FDA may be working,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, 
head of the CDC. ``However, the reasons for these declines are not 
fully understood and more study is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After declining 15 percent from 1996 to 1997, E. coli 0157:H7  
infections increased 22 percent from 1997 to 1998. The reasons for 
the increase were unclear. E. coli infections have been linked to 
milk, drinking water, beef and lettuce, among other foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were based on preliminary data from the Foodborne  
Diseases Active Surveillance Network, which began collecting data 
on seven bacterial and two parasitic organisms in 1996 at seven 
sites located in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, 
Minnesota, New York and Oregon.

<HEADLINE>  Friends, Family Honor Joe DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- His brother's words inside the church and  
the crowd's emotional farewell outside perfectly captured the two 
sides of Joe DiMaggio -- the quiet, dignified, reclusive man, and 
the Joltin' Joe who stirred fans' passions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominic DiMaggio, the last of the three sons of Italian  
immigrants who played in the major leagues, spoke little about 
baseball in his brief eulogy Thursday and more about his brother's 
quest for privacy, his love of children and the one significant 
hollow in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio grew up playing on the sandlots of San Francisco,  
Dominic told a private gathering at Sts. Peter and Paul Church, and 
had everything in a Hall of Fame career, except the right woman to 
share his life. He married twice -- in this church in 1939 to 
actress Dorothy Arnold, and at San Francisco's City Hall in 1954 to 
Marilyn Monroe -- but never found happiness in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill that void, Dominic said, Joe DiMaggio dedicated his life  
away from baseball to helping children, privately and publicly, 
including the establishment of a children's wing to a hospital in 
Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 family members and friends, along with baseball  
commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig, attended the 
funeral Mass for the Yankee Clipper, who died Monday at his Florida 
home at the age of 84. The mahogany casket, set before the ornate 
marble altar under a golden dome, remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no baseball mementos, nothing to suggest the enormity  
of DiMaggio's impact on the game and American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very sensitive, very private,'' Selig said. ``Just a  
day I'll remember for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, a small crowd of about 200 came to pay its respects,  
and when the hour-long service ended and the hearse drove off to 
Holy Cross Cemetery in nearby Colma, there were cries of ``Goodbye, 
Joe,'' accompanied by respectful, spontaneous applause. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who came was J.D. Reynolds, son of former New York  
Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds, who flew from his home in Mustang, 
Okla. As a child, Reynolds hung out in the Yankee clubhouse, where 
his father had a locker two down from DiMaggio's. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad said DiMaggio was the greatest player he had ever  
seen,'' Reynolds said. ``My dad said he had a great record because, 
when he was pitching, someone would hit one and Joe would run a 
mile to catch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by police motorcycles and squad cars, the hearse and  
seven limousines bearing mourners pulled up to the church at 10 
a.m. on a baseball-perfect, blue-sky day. Six pallbearers, 
including DiMaggio's estranged son from his marriage to Arnold, 
Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., carried the casket covered with white 
flowers into the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Police barricades surrounded the church, keeping the public and  
hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews across the street 
by the park in Washington Square in this Italian neighborhood where 
DiMaggio roamed as a young man. He received his first communion and 
was confirmed in Sts. Peter and Paul, whose twin steeples tower 
over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Armand Oliveri, a 79-year-old priest who had known  
DiMaggio since the two grew up together, led the funeral Mass, 
which included Psalm 23, as well as readings from the Old and New 
Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a beautiful, dignified, very calm atmosphere,'' Oliveri  
said. ``The family was not upset, in the sense of (being) 
emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri said he spoke to the mourners of ``how Joe had achieved  
greatness, but that his real greatness was the way he carried 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The large, beautiful church, dark and solemn despite the light  
filtering through its stained-glass windows, has been visited by 
President Lyndon Johnson and Vice President Walter Mondale. It also 
was the site of funeral services for former San Francisco Mayor 
Joseph Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi and two celebrants sang ``Amazing  
Grace'' and Schubert's ``Ave Maria'' among five musical works 
requested by the DiMaggio family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very dignified and private, just how they wanted it,''  
Simi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession passed DiMaggio's former home on Beach  
Street, where several fans laid flowers, on its way to Holy Cross 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years; 
and Engelberg.

over North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Armand Oliveri, a 79-year-old priest who had known  
DiMaggio since the two grew up together, led the funeral Mass, 
which included Psalm 23, as well as readings from the Old and New 
Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a beautiful, dignified, very calm atmosphere,'' Oliveri  
said. ``The family was not upset, in the sense of (being) 
emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri said he spoke to the mourners of ``how Joe had achieved  
greatness, but that his real greatness was the way he carried 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The large, beautiful church, dark and solemn despite the light  
filtering through its stained-glass windows, has been visited by 
President Lyndon Johnson and Vice President Walter Mondale. It also 
was the site of funeral services for former San Francisco Mayor 
Joseph Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi and two celebrants sang ``Amazing  
Grace'' and Schubert's ``Ave Maria'' among five musical works 
requested by the DiMaggio family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very dignified and private, just how they wanted it,''  
Simi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession passed DiMaggio's former home on Beach  
Street, where several fans laid flowers, on its way to Holy Cross 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years; 
and Engelberg.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stock Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today on continued  
optimism over a strong rally this week in Japanese share prices. 
Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.74 in late afternoon trading, down 0.80  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 119.88 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.14 points,  
or 0.14 percent, to close at 15,502.14. On Wednesday, the index 
jumped 383.30 points, or 2.54 percent, to a seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged lower against the yen, falling to as low as  
119.33 yen, as Hong Kong, Swiss, and U.S. investors sold the U.S. 
currency, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen was gaining strength amid speculation that the big gains  
in Tokyo stocks in recent days may be a harbinger of a Japanese 
economic turnaround, analysts said. The dollar traded as high as 
119.89 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the head of the International Bureau at Japan's  
Ministry of Finance expressed hope for stability in foreign 
exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters upon arriving at the ministry, Haruhiko  
Kuroda said, ``Stable foreign exchange is desirable.'' He wouldn't 
comment on specific exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.77 yen, up from  
131.10 yen in New York late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices soared in early trading in  
line with Wall Street's overnight jump to a new record and improved 
market sentiment in Tokyo, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79.08 points Wednesday, or  
0.8 percent, to 9,772.84, surpassing its previous record close set 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei has gained more than 700 points in the last two  
trading days on hopes for aggressive restructuring steps at 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism was fueled by electronics giant Sony Corp.'s  
announcement of plans to take over three publicly listed 
subsidiaries and eliminate 10 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the afternoon the Nikkei average was up 360 points, but  
settled back toward the end of the session amid profit-taking and a 
growing view that the market could be reaching a peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come quite far and I think we are on the border of a  
resistance level,'' said Kiyoshi Kimura strategist at Societe 
Generale Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony shares dropped a whopping 940 yen, or 7.9 percent, to  
10,910 as players took profits on the stock's strong rally this 
week. Still, Sony shares have risen almost 40 percent over the past 
six trading days. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 8.71 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,196.18. The 
TOPIX rose 24.96 points, or 2.15 percent the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange reached  
1.049 billion shares, the highest since last September. Rising 
issues outnumbered declines 737 to 463, while 123 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.740 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.670 
percent, driving its price down to 100.47 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> George Mason Won't Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In each of Cincinnati's five losses this season,  
the Bearcats scored 60 points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	So when George Mason takes the court against Cincinnati on  
Friday in the opening round of the NCAA tournament it seems safe to 
assume the Patriots will slow things down to try and pull off the 3 
seed vs. 14 seed upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cincinnati is our mirror image,'' George Mason senior guard  
Jason Miskiri said Thursday. ``We both like to play up and down the 
floor. We play defense. That's out style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers bear out Miskiri's comparision. George Mason  
averages 74.7 points per game, the Bearcats 74.6. The Patriots have 
forced opponents into 562 turnovers while committing 431, 
Cincinnati has forced 521 and committed 444. Their shooting 
percentages are very close. The big difference is in rebounding 
where the Bearcats average 32.8, six more than their opponent, 
while the Patriots average 35.9, almost a half rebound less than 
their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the matter of reputation.  
</P>
<P>
	George Mason (19-10) is in the NCAA tournament for the second  
time in school history. The Bearcats (26-5) are making their 18th 
appearance overall and eighth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have won 10 games in a row, the regular-season and  
conference titles in the Colonial Athletic Association,'' 
second-year coach Jim Larranaga said. ``We feel we've earned the 
right to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats are coming off a loss to North Carolina Charlotte  
in the Conference USA tournament semifinals. That was another of 
the slowdown games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd rather do that. We're much better at it,'' Cincinnati  
coach Bob Huggins said of the up-tempo style. ``This game's going 
to be in the 80s and we'd much rather see that than the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	``But any team that shoots that many 3s and spreads you is  
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixth-seeded Temple (21-10) has always been the team that's  
considered dangerous even before the brackets are announced. The 
usual early March refrain is ``Temple's a team you don't want to 
see in your bracket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, 11th-seeded Kent (23-6) got the Owls in its first-ever  
NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their zone is unique and you definitely don't see it in the  
MAC,'' junior center John Wharton said, referring to the 
Mid-American Conference where the Golden Flashes were champions. 
``We just have to get ready to face it and see how we fare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple junior guard Pepe Sanchez was honest with his assessment  
of the matchup zone and how it affects opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I've been here, I have heard all that about Temple, but  
since I've been here, we haven't got past the second round, so how 
does everybody make so much about it?'' he said. ``Let us 
accomplish something to make them scared of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple, which is making its 11th straight NCAA appearance, may  
be without guard Quincy Wadley, the Owls' top 3-point shooter, who 
is bothered by a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we really don't know,'' Owls coach John Chaney  
said. ``The hand is a little bit stiff. We'll just have to look at 
it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other first-round games at the FleetCenter on Friday night  
will have second-seeded Miami (22-6) against 15th-seeded Lafayette 
(22-7), which is making its first NCAA appearance since 1957, and 
seventh-seeded Texas (19-12) against 10th-seeded Purdue (19-12).

<HEADLINE> Jailed Schizophrenic Awarded $5.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A mentally ill man placed in solitary  
confinement by his jailers for more than two months on a charge 
that was later dropped has been awarded $5.4 million by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court jury decided Wednesday that Monroe  
County Sheriff Dale Trowbridge and jail administrator Lee Robarge 
violated Scott Lawson's constitutional rights by keeping him in the 
cell and ignoring his schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reality, Lawson was locked down for almost 24 hours a day,  
in a cell that was usually dark, and we believe he was treated in a 
way that would drive a person more deeply into his mental 
illness,'' said his lawyer, Michael Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson, of Oshkosh, was originally put in jail on a charge of  
carrying a concealed weapon while looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to post bond and off his medication, Lawson was withdrawn  
and unresponsive while in jail, records show. Other inmates 
complained about him to jailers, who put him in solitary for up to 
30 days at a time, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge was later dismissed when Lawson's lawyer said police  
had lied in a report and ignored evidence of Lawson's mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's office declined to comment on the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County is about 90 miles northwest of Madison.

<HEADLINE> Medicine Labels to be More Readable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers soon should find it easier to use  
those drugstore remedies that now require a magnifying glass just 
to read the safety warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	New regulations taking effect today require all nonprescription  
medicines to carry more consumer-friendly labels so patients can 
tell at a glance which drug will relieve their symptoms -- and how 
to use it safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over-the-counter drugs are strong medicine, but we have to be  
assured that people know how to use them,'' Vice President Al Gore 
said today in unveiling the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a sick child needs an over-the-counter medicine in the  
middle of the night, parents shouldn't have to struggle to decipher 
the label,'' added Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration rule replaces today's labels --  
which often bury crucial information in tiny type and baffling 
medical jargon -- with instructions in larger print and a special 
format highlighting proper dosages and safety warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	It is similar to the simplified nutrition label the FDA put on  
foods in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency proposed the new labels in 1997, but the regulation  
did not become final until today. Clinton administration officials 
expect most drugs to carry the new label within another two years; 
a few manufacturers have until 2004 to phase in the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 drugs, from cough medicines and itch creams to  
highly potent pain relievers and heartburn medicines, are sold 
without a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Although over-the-counter drugs largely are safe, studies  
suggest their misuse causes over 170,000 hospitalizations a year, 
half of which could be prevented by better consumer education. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many over-the-counter drugs bear hard-to-read instructions.  
The print is tiny, particularly difficult for the elderly to read. 
Safety information can be buried in lines of fine print. 
</P>
<P>
	How many patients know, for example, that aspirin and ibuprofen  
sometimes cause stomach bleeding -- a risk exacerbated if you drink 
alcohol while taking them? Or that if you have hypertension, you 
should ask your doctor before taking a decongestant containing 
pseudoephedrine, because that medicine can raise blood pressure? 
</P>
<P>
	Or that if you are going to buy Tagamet or Zantac for heartburn,  
you must cut out caffeine, alcohol and other stomach-irritating 
foods for a while so the medicine can help your stomach heal? 
</P>
<P>
	Even reading and measuring out the right dosage can be a  
challenge. Studies show parents have a hard time dosing small 
children; some drugs even require cutting tablets in half for kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The new labels aim to ease confusion.  
</P>
<P>
	In larger print, the standardized labels have sections marked  
``Warnings'' and ``Directions,'' so consumers can quickly find the 
precise instructions they need. A ``Do Not Use'' section will 
highlight other medicines that interact dangerously with the 
over-the-counter remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore highlighted as an example allergy pills containing the  
antihistamine chlorpheniramine. The new label instructs anyone with 
glaucoma, breathing problems like emphysema or an enlarged prostate 
to ``Ask a doctor before using,'' because chlorpheniramine 
sometimes causes problems for such patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Warnings'' section says this antihistamine causes  
drowsiness, so be careful if you drive after taking the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	You would have to read through 10 lines of fine print on the old  
label to learn that. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the $29 billion nonprescription drugs industry, which  
helped FDA develop the new label, and the National Association of 
Chain Drugstores -- whose pharmacists now help bewildered consumers 
choose over-the-counter remedies -- praised the change.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Fires Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia fired basketball coach Ron Jirsa on  
Thursday after two disappointing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Vince Dooley, speaking at a hastily called  
news conference, said the main reason for the change was the 
Bulldogs' poor finish this season. Georgia lost 11 of its last 14 
games, winding up 15-15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa, who had never held a college head coaching job, was  
appointed to lead the Bulldogs after Tubby Smith left for Kentucky 
following the 1996-1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no real hope or encouragement as we looked to next  
year or looked to the future. That, more so than anything else, was 
the reason for the change,'' Dooley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley said he began to ponder a change after the Bulldogs lost  
their final regular season game to South Carolina. He considered it 
more strongly after the Dogs were beaten by Alabama in the first 
round of the Southeastern Conference tournament, and made his final 
decision after a 77-57 loss to Clemson in the first round of the 
National Invitation Tournament Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley said he hopes to have a new coach in place by April. He  
stressed that unlike Jirsa, the next coach must have a proven 
record as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jirsa did not attend the news conference. He sent a note saying  
he would meet with the media Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooley conceded that Jirsa was caught off guard by the decision  
when the two met Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared to me he was surprised and hurt,'' Dooley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith led the Bulldogs to consecutive 20-win seasons and NCAA  
tournament appearances, reaching the round of 16 in his first 
season. But Jirsa, who was Smith's top assistant, could not 
duplicate his predecessor's success. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997-98, the Bulldogs went 20-15 and settled for a bid to the  
NIT. They reached the semifinals of the NIT to give the school its 
third straight 20-win season. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia was expected to contend for another NCAA bid this season  
with a senior-dominated team that also included sophomore star 
Jumaine Jones and freshman starter D.A. Layne.

<HEADLINE> Bid for Penguins Called 'Dubious' </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- An attorney for Penguins co-owner Roger Marino  
decribes himself as ``dubious'' about Mario Lemieux's bid for the 
bankrupt team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fear is that Mario does not have a realistic and  
confirmable plan at this time,'' Marino's attorney, Harry L. 
Manion, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came as Marino and prospective bidders for the  
team, including Lemieux and Harvey Gainey, owner of a 
Michigan-based trucking company, prepared to meet in New York today 
with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
	Manion said Tuesday that Marino would step aside and let Lemieux  
buy the team unchallenged if Marino were repaid $5 million he lent 
the team and if Lemieux promised not to gut the roster to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins officials filed for bankruptcy in October, saying they  
needed to reorganize the team's finances.

<HEADLINE> FCC: No Internet Regulation Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications  
Commission, bombarded anew with e-mails from computer users fearing 
government regulation of the Internet, tried again Thursday to 
dispel the notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say this as clearly as I can ... as long as I'm  
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission this agency will 
not regulate the Internet,'' Bill Kennard told a meeting of 
telecommunications and Internet analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard was addressing rumors that have circulated on the  
Internet for a long time as well as concerns by some consumer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC last month concluded that a computer user's dial-up  
calls to the Internet are interstate communications subject to 
federal jurisdiction. Internet dial-ups have been treated as local 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has said this decision merely resolves a dispute among  
phone companies over how to compensate each other for Internet 
connections and how to clarify the role of state and federal 
regulators. The agency said the decision will not affect how 
consumers tap into the Internet or how much they pay. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups and others believe the action inadvertently  
could lead to higher charges in the future for Internet access by 
computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen,'' Kennard said. He repeated that the  
FCC has no intention of making computer users pay long-distance 
fees for dial-up access to the Internet, as people now pay when 
they make long-distance telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``these rumors get on the Internet that the big bad FCC  
is going to impose all this regulation on the Internet,'' Kennard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I know this painfully because every so often when one of  
these rumors flares up I get, literally, about 600 e-mail messages 
a day by people who are telling me to keep my hands off the 
Internet,'' Kennard added. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Kennard said the FCC is monitoring to ensure cable  
companies providing high-speed Internet services are not freezing 
out competitors or restricting consumers' options for Internet 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, in recent decisions, has declined to force cable  
companies to share their high-speed lines with competitors. But the 
FCC has said it would keep watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the FCC is organizing meetings with the various  
stakeholders in this debate ``so that we can get a better handle on 
the problem and monitor the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, public interest advocates, America Online and  
others continue to press the FCC to require that cable companies 
give other companies access to those lines so they can offer 
competing services. The cable industry and AT&AMP;T, which just 
acquired cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., oppose the idea.

<HEADLINE> 78 U.S. Airports to Undergo Security Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 80 of the nation's largest airports  
will undergo an extensive security review by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, as it cracks down on reported lapses in controlled 
access to secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA launched the six-week review after auditors in a survey  
of five airports found inadequate safeguards for keeping 
unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. Once federal officials 
have scrutinized security measures at the nation's 78 largest 
commercial airports, they will then look into smaller commercial 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it would be worthwhile to look at the issue of  
access to non-public areas of airports on a broader scale,'' FAA 
spokesman Eliot Brenner said Wednesday. The agency will also 
determine whether it needs to do ``red team testing'' -- such as 
sending undercover agents to try to penetrate security -- to ensure 
that identified problem areas have been addressed after the review. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at  
five major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations 
Committee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the 
auditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas 
and even board the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a high percentage of tests involving airport access  
controls, our successful penetration of secure areas almost always 
resulted in our boarding an aircraft,'' said Alexis Stefani, the 
Transportation Department's deputy assistant inspector general for 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani told lawmakers many of the problems found in a similar  
audit in 1993 still exist. For example, Stefani said, undercover 
personnel could enter through emergency exits and penetrate air 
cargo facilities by following airport personnel through access 
control points. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of individuals encountered by the agents failed to  
challenge them for unauthorized access and in some cases, airport 
law enforcement officials failed to respond to emergency door 
alarms. At two airports, undercover auditors bypassed passenger 
screening checkpoints and entered the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani attributed the ``human element'' as the primary weakness  
in keeping unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's inspection and testing of airport security also needs  
strengthening, Stefani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for  
security, while airports are responsible for controlling access to 
secured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and 
cargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been 
responsible for maintaining security equipment and systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to airports, Retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the  
FAA's associate administrator for civil aviation security, said 
unauthorized personnel sneaking past controlled access represents a 
serious security breech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowing intruders to piggyback through access doors, not  
challenging intruders on the ramp, and intruders being able to get 
aboard aircraft, combine to make a significant vulnerability,'' 
Flynn wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that ``redundant measures, such as guarding the  
individual aircraft,'' could be required if the problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported in its Wednesday editions that  
federal agents were able to get through security doors 46 times at 
four major airports, walk around on the tarmac and board 51 
airplanes unchallenged.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Premature Births Up for Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of single-born premature babies among  
white women climbed 8 percent between 1989 to 1996 but dropped 
among blacks and other minorities, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the narrowing of the racial gap, black babies are still  
nearly twice as likely to be born premature than white ones, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they were unable to explain the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it reflects things such as improved health status  
among African American women in general and possibly improved 
access to prenatal care,'' said Dr. Lucinda England, a CDC 
epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Among blacks, the rate decreased nearly 10 percent, from 180.4  
per 1,000 live births in 1989 to 162.5 in 1996, the CDC said. The 
rate among whites climbed from 74.8 to 80.8. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate dropped 3.6 percent among Hispanics, 2.8 percent among  
American Indians and Native Alaskans and 2.3 percent among Asians 
and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures include medically induced births, but Ms. England  
said such births played only a small role in the increase among 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the U.S. rate of premature single births inched up 0.3  
percent to 97.3 per 1,000 live births. There was a 19 percent jump 
among premature multiple births.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Guatemala 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore and Brian McBride scored  
first-half goals as the United States defeated Guatemala 3-1 
Thursday night in the opener of the U.S. Cup '99 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore took a pass from McBride and scored on a diving kick in  
the 22nd minute for his 18th international goal. Moore later 
received a red card and will miss Saturday's game against Mexico in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride gave the Americans a 2-0 lead in the 37th minute on a  
header off a pass from Ante Razov, a shot that sailed over leaping 
Guatemalan goaltender Edgar Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Perez scored Guatemala's only goal on a penalty kick in  
the 51st minute, called after a foul by Eddie Lewis on Guillermo 
Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala's Erick Miranda received a red card in the 90th  
minute, leaving both teams a player short. Frankie Hejduk, one of 
the few players who stood out for the Americans at last summer's 
World Cup, got the final goal four minutes into injury time, 
bouncing a shot past Estrada following Lewis' free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico and Bolivia played the second half of the doubleheader at  
the Los Angeles Coliseum. Guatemala will play Bolivia in the 
completion of the tournament, which is sponsored by Nike, on 
Saturday at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans improved to 3-0-1 in 1999 as they attempt to win  
the U.S. Cup for the third time. They were champions in 1992 and 
'95. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 11 U.S. starters had played in five or fewer  
international matches entering the game. Ben Olsen, the youngest 
member of the U.S. roster at 21, had two solid scoring chances 
early in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Thornton, arguably the No. 4 or No. 5 U.S. goalkeeper, made  
two saves. Kasey Keller, the top U.S. goalkeeper, was originally 
scheduled to join the American team for the tournament but remained 
with Leicester for Saturday's English Premier League game against 
Charlton.

<HEADLINE> NASA To Fix Hubble Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Astronauts will rush to the Hubble  
Space Telescope this fall -- eight months early -- to fix its 
deteriorating pointing system. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA approved the emergency repair mission on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are one failure away from losing all science on the Hubble  
Space Telescope,'' said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	By splitting the originally planned June 2000 mission into two  
parts -- one in October and the other in late 2000 or early 2001 -- 
Hubble's science program hopefully will be preserved and the 
astronauts' chores will be more manageable, Weiler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had waited until June 2000, there is a very reasonable  
chance that we could lose three, four or even more months of 
science,'' Weiler said. ``This is a rather good insurance policy 
we're buying here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than what's  
already been budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, needed for pointing and  
stability, have failed since astronauts' last service call, in 
1997. And a third gyroscope suffered a partial breakdown a month or 
two ago and is considered unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct  
observations throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the $2 billion telescope would be safe in orbit without  
any working gyroscopes, NASA does not want to risk losing any 
valuable science time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency where we're in  
danger of losing the entire mission or the entire spacecraft,'' 
Weiler said. ``You can think of it more as a science emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble -- NASA's so-called crown jewel of observatories -- was  
launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror. Spacewalking astronauts 
corrected the telescope's vision in 1993, restoring Hubble to a 
world-class instrument able to see to the fringes of the universe, 
and returned in 1997 to add or replace 11 major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides replacing all six gyroscopes in October, spacewalking  
astronauts will install a new computer, radio transmitter, guidance 
sensor and data recorder, and fix peeling insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	During their second visit, the same astronauts will equip Hubble  
with new solar panels, an advanced camera and a newfangled cooling 
unit for an infrared camera that has run out of the frozen nitrogen 
needed for observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four astronauts who will do the repairs have been training  
since last summer and can easily accommodate the early flight, 
officials said. One of the four worked on Hubble in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will have to rearrange the shuttle flight schedule to  
squeeze in the Hubble mission. Those details have yet to be worked 
out.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Expected To Head Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheap gas prices that drivers have been  
enjoying for months are heading higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices have rallied in recent days on hopes that major  
producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran will agree to cut output 
and ease the world's oil glut. The surge means a few more cents per 
gallon at the pump for drivers, but relief to beleaguered U.S. oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Higher prices would help a lot of companies here, so I  
wouldn't mind paying a little bit more,'' Houston resident Karen 
McQuilling said Thursday after filling up her sport-utility vehicle 
with 89-cent gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures slipped Thursday after three days of gains,  
down 38 cents to $14.31 per barrel. Despite that decline, crude is 
still at levels not seen since November and is up 33 percent from a 
12-year low of $10.72 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to hopes for reduced output, oil prices have been  
aided by a harsh winter in some parts of the United States and 
increased industrial demand, said George Gaspar, an analyst with 
Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge has carried over to Wall Street, where stocks in oil  
companies such as Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and BP Amoco have been 
rising in hopes that their slumping profits would be revived by a 
turnaround in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	And the results are already showing at the pump, where gasoline  
prices rose last week for the first time since September. The 
average price of self-serve regular gasoline was 94 cents per 
gallon, up a penny from two weeks earlier, according to Lundberg 
Survey Inc., which polls 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	If oil production cuts are announced and sustained, analysts  
said crude oil could rise to $17 or $18 per barrel in the next 
several months -- adding another 10 to 20 cents per gallon to 
average gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased demand during the spring and summer travel season  
historically adds a few cents per gallon to pump prices as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But that rosy scenario for oil producers and gas-stations owners  
still would not mean much hardship for drivers because gas prices 
are now at their lowest point since 1979, said AAA spokesman Mitch 
Fuqua. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 18 months ago, for example, the average price for regular  
gasoline was $1.27 per gallon -- 35 percent higher than its current 
level, according to Lundberg Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we jump 5 cents, 10 cents, 15 cents, we're still going  
to be experiencing a bargain at the pump,'' AAA's Fuqua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility also remains that OPEC members will be unable to  
agree on a plan to cut production or won't follow through on any 
pledges for cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia's oil minister has said that members of OPEC will  
agree on production cuts ahead of the cartel's meeting March 23, 
and traders have been optimistic that producers are serious about 
trying to reduce supply. But OPEC has been plagued in the past by 
persistent cheating on output quotas by some members. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC has a history where they don't always succeed, so you  
have to be a little bit cautious,'' said Alvin Silber, an analyst 
with Herzog, Heine, Geduld.

<HEADLINE> Some Say Washington Apples Are Soft / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) -- Consumers are complaining that the Red  
Delicious apple -- the symbol of Washington's apple industry -- too 
often is about as delicious as a wad of cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys initiated by the Washington Apple Commission suggest  
that many shoppers are not getting the crunchy, good apple they 
expect when they bite into a Red Delicious these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers say the apple's attractive, deep red color  
promises something tasty, but the inside disappoints. Taste and 
texture are inconsistent, too often on the bland and mushy side. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is candid feedback about our product. We can listen to it  
or not,'' said Steve Lutz, president of the commission. ``The 
future of the Red Delicious is not over. But we better listen to 
what the consumers are saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lutz spoke at the 15th annual Washington Tree Fruit Post-harvest  
Conference and Trade Show, attended by more than 600 
representatives of the fruit industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Delicious is still the top choice of shoppers across the  
country, according to the 1998 survey. Thirty-eight percent of 
respondents from 2,000 households said it was their favorite apple. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's also the variety that has experienced the biggest  
decline in sales. Consumers list crispness as the most important 
quality of a good apple. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want soft, they'll buy a banana,'' Lutz said.  
</P>
<P>
	Half of those surveyed said they would buy more apples if they  
knew they would be crisp. 
</P>
<P>
	The disparity between 38-percent public approval and an industry  
where half the crop is Red Delicious has been bad for the industry 
this year, said Ron Skagen, general manager of Wells and Wade Fruit 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with what we're  
delivering to them,'' said Skagen, who noted that returns are at 
their lowest in years. ``Even the most successful Red Delicious 
growers are losing money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While warehouses and growers have focused on putting a beautiful  
crimson apple on store shelves, they've lost ground on internal 
quality and taste. One recent study shows that some new strains 
have sacrificed taste to achieve the redder color, said Jim 
Mattheis, a USDA researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was obvious last year when a cool spring, a hot  
summer and a huge crop made it difficult to harvest the fruit and 
get both crispness and color. By the time most apples had turned 
fully red, they were overripe. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutz said no one in the survey even mentioned color as an  
important factor. 
</P>
<P>
	But fruit salesmen say that's not the reality they know.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even though consumers may not mention color, color is huge,''  
said Mike Saunders of Northwestern Fruit Co. in Yakima. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores won't accept anything less than a fully red apple, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lutz said perhaps the time has come to promote quality over  
color. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now spending 40 cents a box on advertising our apples,''  
said Skagen. ``It's going to be wasted money if we can't deliver 
the product we advertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers offered these suggestions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Using hormonal sprays that can retard maturity until good color  
is achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	--Picking the crop at the right maturity for the market in which  
it will sell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cooling the fruit as quickly as possible after harvest and  
keeping it cool throughout packing and storage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Considering controlled atmosphere storage for all apples that  
will be stored for more than 30 days.

<HEADLINE> China Banks To Increase Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's banks will increase lending to private  
enterprises and other companies outside the state sector to spur 
economic growth, the chief of the central bank said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments by Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of  
China, dovetailed with plans by the National People's Congress, now 
holding its annual session, to amend the constitution to emphasize 
the importance of private enterprise in China's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai also told reporters China planned to keep its currency, the  
yuan, stable this year and to allow more foreign banks to do 
business in China. He also said China would make ``very large 
concessions'' in its bid to enter the World Trade Organization, 
although he gave few details. 
</P>
<P>
	China's private sector has grown despite difficulties getting  
loans from state banks. The government is counting on private 
enterprise to absorb many of the millions of people laid-off in the 
reform of debt-ridden state factories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We attach great importance to the development of the non-state  
sector,'' Dai said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank would encourage state-owned banks to lend to  
small private businesses by allowing them to charge higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai gave no specific figures about how much lending to the  
non-state sector would increase. Such loans accounted for 42 
percent of $1.05 trillion issued by all financial institutions in 
1998, an increase of 3 percent from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-state part of China's economy is a broad mix of private  
businesses, collectives and foreign-invested ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	In repeating assurances that the yuan would not be devalued, Dai  
said China expects to maintain a favorable balance of payments and 
steady exports this year. Contrary to some recent reports, there 
are no plans to study a possible devaluation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On China's bid to join the World Trade Organization, Dai said  
China would make ``very large concessions'' and hoped negotiations 
could ``proceed from the starting point that China is a developing 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China wants to be admitted to the WTO as a developing nation so  
that it can make fewer concessions on cuts in import duties and 
equal treatment for foreign companies. The United States and other 
countries insist China should do more to open its markets before it 
is eligible to join. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai also promised to increase the number of foreign bank  
branches allowed to operate in the country. More than 170 are 
licensed now, but Dai did not give a target of how many would be 
added this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai denied that the bankruptcy of Guangdong International Trust  
and Investment Corp., or GITIC, had shaken foreign investors' 
confidence in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The government closed GITIC, the investment arm of China's  
wealthiest province, in October, and it became the country's first 
financial institution to declare bankruptcy in January with debt of 
$4.3 billion, much of it to foreign creditors.

<HEADLINE> NFL Likely To Pass New Replay Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the NFL, two plus two equals instant replay.  
</P>
<P>
	After a season of officiating problems, the NFL appears set to  
bring back the often controversial system next week at its annual 
league meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	It will come in the form of what the league calls ``two plus  
two,'' which give coaches two challenges per game to dispute plays 
before the final two minutes of each half. In the final two minutes 
of each half, or in all of overtime, the officiating crew will 
review plays on instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, recommended by the competition committee, will combine  
elements of the replay system that was in effect from 1986-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Browne, the league's chief spokesman, said Wednesday that he  
believes replay has the best chance for approval this year since it 
was taken out seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was approved 7-1 by the league's competition committee  
this week, with Cincinnati's Mike Brown, a longtime dissenter, the 
only ``no'' vote. It still must get 24 votes from the 31 teams to 
be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The new element is the challenge, which will give coaches the  
right to challenge what they think is a bad call. The referee would 
make the final decision from a monitor on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	If the protest is turned down, the team will lose a timeout. If  
it's upheld, it will not. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final two minutes, a replay official in the press box can  
halt play any time he sees a questionable call, even if a team has 
used both its challenges. But the referee will still make the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay official would also question calls in overtime.  
</P>
<P>
	Replay has been voted down each year since it was voted out in  
1992, in part because the coaches haven't been able to agree on a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher, a member of the  
competition committee, said Wednesday he believes it will get the 
24 votes necessary for approval. Several teams that have voted 
against it in the past, including the New York Giants -- who have 
never voted for it -- have said they might reconsider their 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major items likely to come up during the meetings include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A decision on whether to award the 32nd franchise to Houston  
or Los Angeles, two cities that lost teams this decade. The owners 
are believed to be leaning toward Los Angeles, the larger market, 
but are unlikely to award a franchise to either of the two 
competing groups. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Browne said things are still up in the air.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be one word or two -- `Houston' or `Los Angeles,'''  
Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A decision on whether to approve the $800 million bid for the  
Washington Redskins by real estate mogul Howard Milstein. Browne 
said the major item still to be cleared up is collateral for a $400 
million loan -- Milstein wants to use the team as collateral, the 
league's finance committee doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An update on the status of Edward DeBartolo Jr., the owner of  
the San Francisco 49ers. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 
January that it was unlikely that DeBartolo would have a role in 
the team in 1999 after pleading guilty to failing to report a 
felony and fined $2 million in connection with a gambling license 
in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A series of other rules changes, the most notable of which  
would encourage kickoff returns by placing the ball at the 25-yard 
line instead of the 20 if a kickoff goes out of the end zone. The 
idea is that strong-legged kickers would put the ball in play if 
the opponent gained five yards if they put the ball through the end 
zone.

	DiMaggio Funeral Set for Today  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Final preparations have been made at Sts.  
Peter and Paul Church for Joe DiMaggio's funeral later today. The 
church, whose twin steeples tower over the North Beach neighborhood 
in which DiMaggio spent most of his childhood, is to be closed to 
the public as Father Armand Oliveri leads a service for DiMaggio, 
who died Monday at his Florida home at the age of 84. Oliveri, 79, 
who had known DiMaggio since the two grew up together in North 
Beach, said the service will be a regular funeral Mass.

	Medical Privacy Issues Considered

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is considering proposals that would  
restrict access to medical records and require a patient's consent 
before leaving insurance companies, employers and doctors' offices 
without a patient's consent. ``Today, video rental records have 
greater protection than sensitive medical information,'' said Sen. 
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who proposed a series of greater 
protections yesterday with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Their bill 
seeks to limit access to records that, increasingly, can be moved 
easily from computer to computer.

	States Found Not Saving for Future  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study has found that more than three-fourths  
of America's states are failing not putting enough aside in ``rainy 
day'' funds for a future recession. The report by the 
liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ranked 
Michigan and Minnesota as tops in building up reserve funds. They 
were in a small group that included only eight states judged able 
to deal with a recession without having to resort to either 
significant cuts in state spending or sizable tax increases.

	U.S. Defends China Spy Actions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took top national security officials almost  
a year to determine there were ``serious problems'' requiring 
security changes at nuclear weapons labs after receiving a 1996 
briefing about possible espionage. National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger said he received a ``very preliminary'' briefing in 1996 
that China may have obtained critical nuclear warhead information 
from the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. But only after a more 
detailed briefing in July 1997 were the problems involving China 
and the labs brought into sharp focus, he said yesterday.

	4 Killed in La. Church Shooting

	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- A man burst into a church service and  
opened fire as he walked down the aisle last night, killing his 
wife, child and a member of the congregation and injuring four 
others. He also fatally shot his mother-in-law at home before going 
to the church, police said. The gunman calmly reloaded his 
semi-automatic pistol in the middle of the shooting spree at the 
New St. John Fellowship Baptist Church, said the Rev. Wilbert 
Holmes, who was conducting the prayer service. The gunman fled but 
was found in a shed less than 100 yards from the church, police 
said. Police shot a gun out of his hand as he tried to shoot 
himself. The suspect was wounded in the hand and taken to a 
hospital in Gonzales, 20 miles southeast of Baton Rouge.

caressing a naked Nicole Kidman. The racy segment of ``Eyes Wide 
Shut'' shown at the ShoWest convention yesterday was personally 
selected by the famed and idiosyncratic director, who died Sunday 
at age 70. Even before Kubrick's death, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' had 
become the stuff of myth in Hollywood. It had a staggering 12-month 
shooting schedule and was made under conditions of extreme privacy.

top-level corporate backers to pledge reforms in the wake of the

Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games moves slowly

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr throughout the Monica Lewinsky drama, 
abruptly resigned today after an internal review of a recent press 
leak prompted Starr to request a full Justice Department

angered some Democrats who nevertheless voted for the measure -- 
contained a provision that would allow states to shift money

Clinton's name that was taken out for their Whitewater land

agent, David Falk, and had spoken to Nets co-owner Lewis Katz. 
Speaking from the West Coast on WFAN in New York, Marbury said he 
planned to join the Nets for their game tomorrow at Philadelphia. 
Marbury said Nets guard Sam Cassell and two other players will be 
going to Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Agree on EU Farm Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union agriculture ministers  
agreed today on major reforms of the EU farm subsidy program, part 
of a general overhaul of EU finances to cover costs of admitting 
new members from eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reached before dawn after an overnight negotiating  
session must be approved by EU leaders at a March 24-25 summit in 
Berlin. The farm subsidy plan is part of a general overhaul of EU 
finances to cover the costs of admitting new members from eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement means the EU's farm spending will actually  
increase in the short term as farmers are compensated for a 20 
percent reduction of subsidized prices, but eventually costs should 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always knew it would be necessary to increase spending to  
obtain reform. Reform costs money,'' said British Agriculture 
minister Nick Brown at the end of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's farmers have protested against proposed cuts. Some  
30,000 held a rowdy demonstration outside EU headquarters last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's executive commission said the reform package will make  
EU agriculture more competitive on world markets and bring benefits 
to consumers and the EU economy as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms are meant to facilitate the accession of  
farm-intensive central and eastern European countries to the 
15-member EU in the next decade and to liberalize EU agriculture 
ahead of world trade talks due to start at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longer term, the reform aims to phase out the costly  
system under which the EU buys up surplus produce at artificially 
high prices to guarantee farm incomes even when overproduction 
forces down the market price. That should eventually be replaced by 
a more efficient system of direct handouts to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the package was backed by all EU nations except  
Portugal. France reserved approval pending an overall EU budget 
deal at the Berlin summit.

<HEADLINE> Garth's Day at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Here's how it went for Garth Brooks on  
Thursday at spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks returned to camp after spending five  
days in Los Angeles with his mother, Colleen, who had a cancerous 
spot removed from her mouth on Tuesday. He promptly got into his 
first real ``A'' game, striking out as a pinch-hitter in the 
Padres' 14-8 win over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOW NOTE:* Pretty much the whole at-bat. Facing veteran  
right-hander Julian Tavarez, Brooks jumped away from an inside 
fastball, took a slider for a strike, took a bad swing and miss at 
a slider and struck out on a fastball. He's 0-for-9 this spring, 
counting two intrasquad games, a ``B'' game, Thursday's game and a 
non-counting ``A'' game. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``This is the first day I looked like a  
celebrity trying to play baseball,'' Brooks said. ``My mom is 
great, she's here with me, and I should be thankful. But damn, I 
didn't have a good at-bat, and that bothers me. I don't have any 
hits, but other than my first at-bat in an intrasquad, this is the 
first bad one.''

<HEADLINE> FAA To Check Security at Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 80 of the nation's largest airports  
will undergo an extensive security review by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, as it cracks down on reported lapses in controlled 
access to secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA launched the six-week review after auditors in a survey  
of five airports found inadequate safeguards for keeping 
unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. Once federal officials 
have scrutinized security measures at the nation's 78 largest 
commercial airports, they will then look into smaller commercial 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it would be worthwhile to look at the issue of  
access to non-public areas of airports on a broader scale,'' FAA 
spokesman Eliot Brenner said Wednesday. The agency will also 
determine whether it needs to do ``red team testing'' -- such as 
sending undercover agents to try to penetrate security -- to ensure 
that identified problem areas have been addressed after the review. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at  
five major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations 
Committee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the 
auditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas 
and even board the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a high percentage of tests involving airport access  
controls, our successful penetration of secure areas almost always 
resulted in our boarding an aircraft,'' said Alexis Stefani, the 
Transportation Department's deputy assistant inspector general for 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani told lawmakers many of the problems found in a similar  
audit in 1993 still exist. For example, Stefani said, undercover 
personnel could enter through emergency exits and penetrate air 
cargo facilities by following airport personnel through access 
control points. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of individuals encountered by the agents failed to  
challenge them for unauthorized access and in some cases, airport 
law enforcement officials failed to respond to emergency door 
alarms. At two airports, undercover auditors bypassed passenger 
screening checkpoints and entered the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani attributed the ``human element'' as the primary weakness  
in keeping unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's inspection and testing of airport security also needs  
strengthening, Stefani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for  
security, while airports are responsible for controlling access to 
secured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and 
cargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been 
responsible for maintaining security equipment and systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to airports, Retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the  
FAA's associate administrator for civil aviation security, said 
unauthorized personnel sneaking past controlled access represents a 
serious security breech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowing intruders to piggyback through access doors, not  
challenging intruders on the ramp, and intruders being able to get 
aboard aircraft, combine to make a significant vulnerability,'' 
Flynn wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that ``redundant measures, such as guarding the  
individual aircraft,'' could be required if the problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported in its Wednesday editions that  
federal agents were able to get through security doors 46 times at 
four major airports, walk around on the tarmac and board 51 
airplanes unchallenged.

<HEADLINE> 4 Minn. Players To Miss NCAA Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- University of Minnesota officials today  
declared four basketball players ineligible for the school's 
first-round game in the NCAA tournament, saying there was evidence

the serious allegations,'' said McKinley Boston, the university's 
vice president for athletics and student development. ``We would 
rather not risk the reputation of the university by playing an 
ineligible player at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We view this at the university as very, very serious  
business,'' university president Mark Yudof said. ``The University 
of Minnesota needs to adhere to the highest standards of ethical 
conduct and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do that, we're not engaging in education, we're  
engaging in miseducation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A copyright story in Wednesday's Saint Paul Pioneer Press raised  
allegations of academic fraud by at least 20 players. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players declared ineligible for today's game against  
Gonzaga at Seattle were Kevin Clark, Miles Tarver, Antoine Broxsie 
and Jason Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	A former university employee said she wrote papers, helped with  
take-home exams and did other course work for players from 1993 to 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Four former players confirmed to the newspaper that work was  
prepared for them in possible violation of the student code of 
conduct and NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' former player Russ  
Archambault said. ``We used to make jokes about it. ... I would go 
over there some nights and get four papers done. The coaches would 
be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other three former players who confirmed work was done for  
them are Courtney James, Kevin Loge and Darrell Whaley. Another 
former player, Trevor Winter, said he was aware of the practice, 
according to the Pioneer Press. But he denied it to the Star 
Tribune a day after the Pioneer Press story appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press spent three months investigating the academic  
counseling program after the university reported a violation to the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the academic  
counseling office, estimated she did more than 400 pieces of work 
for players, including some starters on the 1996-97 Final Four 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff provided the Pioneer Press with computer files  
containing more than 225 examples of course work for players that 
she says she wrote and players turned in. Gangelhoff said she kept 
only about half her files. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff also provided printed copies of five pieces of course  
work that she said had been turned in by students. Some of the 
papers had grades and instructor's comments written on them. All 
five pieces also appeared in Gangelhoff's computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and Tarver refused comment when questioned by the Pioneer  
Press at their Seattle hotel Tuesday night. The newspaper could not 
reach Broxsie or Stanford for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other players, Jermaine Stanford and Ryan Wolf denied  
that Gangelhoff did their course work. Micah Watkins, Voshon Lenard 
and Hosea Crittenden refused comment. Bobby Jackson said Gangelhoff 
mostly just typed his papers. That also is a possible NCAA 
violation.

<HEADLINE> Overreaction to School Gun Plot Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGTON, Wis. (AP) -- Back in November, authorities boasted  
that they had averted a bloodbath by arresting a group of boys who 
planned to steal guns from one of their fathers, take high school 
administrators hostage and shoot students who had picked on them. 
</P>
<P>
	This agricultural town of 9,500 people, best known for its  
chocolate factory and an annual competition for the world's best 
liar, seemed to have narrowly escaped the tragic fate of 
communities like West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and 
Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	But four months later, the case is limping to a close, with  
police missteps forcing prosecutors into plea bargains. And 
authorities are having to defend themselves against accusations 
they overreacted to the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, prosecutors wanted to charge the boys as adults,  
meaning they could have gone to prison for 120 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But two boys who said they backed out of the plot were never  
charged. And the remaining three, once charged with conspiracy to 
commit murder, ended up pleading no contest to juvenile charges of 
reckless endangering. Those boys, all 16, can be held in juvenile 
detention for only two years, until they turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Nielsen, the lawyer for the alleged ringleader, said he was  
baffled as to how tough talk from a group of teen-agers who never 
even touched a gun became ``the biggest case in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's the slightest question about people  
overreacting to this case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they did the right thing, considering the school  
tragedies in other towns. They learned of the alleged plot from an 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The choice comes down to doing something and seeing what  
evidence there was or doing nothing and waiting to see what 
happens,'' said Ron Patla, police chief in this town about 60 miles 
southwest of Milwaukee. ``I don't think our response was any kind 
of an overreaction at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Burlington High School Principal Jose Martinez, one of the  
targets of the alleged plot: ``I'm grateful that the police did 
what they did. People want to say that we overreacted, but what was 
the alternative? I think the students were serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three boys arrested had been charged with nine counts  
altogether, including three of conspiracy to commit murder. But 
prosecutors eventually dropped all but one count of murder 
conspiracy against each, saying that charge would cover all of the 
offenses alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on the recommendation of psychologists, prosecutors also  
withdrew their request to try the boys as adults. Still, the boys 
could have gotten three years in juvenile detention if convicted of 
murder conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last week, the case, which was based largely on the boys'  
statements to police, all but collapsed. A judge threw out the 
alleged ringleader's confession because of evidence police did not 
properly read him his rights and because they used inappropriate 
tactics to get the statement. The judge said the interrogators' 
jocular manner did not convey to the boy how serious the 
accusations were. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are reviewing the circumstances under which the boys were  
read their rights. The police chief would not comment on the 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of  
School Administrators, said administrators in Burlington aren't the 
only ones more sensitive to threats since the series of school 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``School people got the message that if people are threatening  
mass violence, you better take it seriously instead of waiting and 
hoping it's just a prank or a teen-age hoax,'' Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bond, principal at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky.,  
said he wishes someone in his school had relayed a similar warning. 
In 1997, a 14-year-old student opened fire on a group of 
schoolmates praying in the hall, killing three. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been handled before the perpetrator entered the  
building,'' Bond said. ``You would have never heard of us. We 
wouldn't have three kids dead.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Expecting Bigger Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans hope new projections  
of budget surpluses will help them fatten tax cuts they want to 
give Americans for the upcoming election year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans say that when the Congressional Budget Office  
completes its annual summertime analysis this August, it probably 
will conclude that the robust economy has made revenue collections 
stronger than now forecast. They say that could mean a projected 
fiscal 2000 surplus perhaps $10 billion higher than it appears 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to make next year's tax reduction as large as possible,  
Republicans realize they can achieve that simply by waiting for the 
CBO report. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when he would write his tax bill, Chairman Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, ``I think 
I'll wait until CBO updates this summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., has not  
decided when he will write his tax bill. But his committee usually 
waits until after Ways and Means has approved one. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, GOP budget writers have been limited by their  
self-imposed pledge not to touch surpluses generated by Social 
Security. Because all of the expected $133 billion surplus in 2000 
would come from Social Security, that has left Republicans 
scrambling for other ways to pay for next year's tax reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	They think they have found about $15 billion worth of savings  
for 2000, a modest start for a tax-cutting package they say will 
total $800 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said  
Wednesday that the 2000 budget his committee plans to vote on next 
week will state that if CBO surplus projections grow this summer, 
the extra money would go to cut taxes. Senate Budget Committee 
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is considering similar language. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a bigger surplus, the number is bigger for the tax  
cut,'' Kasich said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear exactly how Kasich and Domenici would protect the  
extra money for tax cuts. One possibility would be to require 60 
votes in the 100-member Senate to use the funds for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing that would achieve another GOP goal too: making it harder  
for President Clinton and Democrats to use the extra surpluses for 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	As they have done before, White House aides accused Republicans  
of unwisely planning to use surpluses for tax cuts instead of 
helping Medicare, which faces financial problems in the coming 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern right now is the fact that they are planning a  
large tax cut, rather than shoring up Medicare,'' said White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, CBO has repeatedly made its forecasts more  
optimistic, only to underestimate the health of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private analysts say the economy's continued strong  
performance -- growing 6.1 percent in 1999's final quarter -- means 
the surplus trend is only upward, although the magnitude is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican leaders made public details of their plan  
to ensure that Social Security surpluses totaling $1.8 trillion 
over the next decade be used only to strengthen that program or to 
reduce the accumulated national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP proposal, the debt held by the public would have  
to decline every two years by an amount equal to the Social 
Security surpluses for that same period. Using the money for 
another purpose, other than shoring up Social Security, would take 
60 Senate votes. 
</P>
<P>
	With Social Security facing fiscal pressures from the impending  
retirement of baby boomers, the White House's Toiv said the GOP 
plan does not extend Social Security's solvency ``by even one 
day.''

<HEADLINE> Pyramid Schemes in Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's an age-old racket getting a second wind  
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal regulators warn that cyberspace versions of these  
so-called pyramid schemes are no better than the traditional ones. 
In the end, people will still end up throwing money into ventures 
that rarely live up to their promises of big returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission along with a number of state  
officials announced Thursday 33 law enforcement actions against 67 
defendants promoting such Internet pyramid schemes. The commission 
also launched a sweep of the World Wide Web to locate sites that 
might be hosting illegal multilevel marketing scams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to taking on the con artists who think they  
can use the Internet to promote illegal schemes,'' said Jodie 
Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet has helped breathe new life into the schemes. A  
consumer merely has to type ``get rich quick'' into an Internet 
search engine and Web sites appear guaranteeing huge profits if 
they invest some of their money and can sign on others to do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple people may make money, but two or three  
levels down, the pyramid topples,'' said Holly Cherico, a 
spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus in 
Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	What distinguishes pyramid schemes from legitimate multilevel  
marketing ventures is that they focus on recruiting new members, 
not on selling products, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one pyramid operation cited by the FTC, Five Star Auto Club  
Inc. of Poughquag, N.Y., promised online consumers an opportunity 
to lease their ``dream vehicle'' for free while earning anywhere 
from $180 to $80,000. All they had to do was pay an annual fee and 
$100 in monthly payments and recruit others to join. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission alleged that those who signed up received no  
free lease on a car and no earnings from the deal. The FTC has 
filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in White Plains, N.Y., 
against the Five Star Auto Club Inc. seeking a permanent injunction 
and consumer redress. A federal court already has temporarily shut 
down the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, these schemes take your money to pay off some other  
people,'' said Cleo Manuel, of the National Consumers League. 
``Ultimately, someone is going to be left holding the bag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel said con artists try to reassure consumers that the  
scheme is legitimate by using ``shills'' -- decoys who are paid by 
the company to say they made huge profits in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials warn that the Internet makes it easy for such  
fraudulent operations to hide, shut down or move when someone 
begins to catch on. Well-constructed Web sites might also give the 
appearance of legitimacy and be more convincing than newspaper 
advertisements making the same false claims. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail offers an alternative way to target consumers, while  
making the schemes more difficult for law enforcers to trace, said 
Jim Lanford, co-editor of Scambusters, an online magazine about 
Internet fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of CD-ROMs with e-mail addresses on them. Some  
people just go in and harvest from a news group,'' said Lanford. 
Then individuals who buy into the operation e-mail others they know 
-- friends or family members -- to let them in on their big 
discovery. E-mail offers the possibility for easy mass targeting, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same old scheme. It's just cheaper to do,'' Lanford  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say that as with anything that sounds too good to be  
true, it probably is. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only people getting rich are the con artists,'' says Peter  
Hildreth, president of the North American Securities Administrators 
Association. ``Ask yourself -- if it's such a great moneymaking 
idea, why is someone telling 100,000 of their closest friends about 
it on the Internet?''

	The Nets-Miami Heat game originally was to be televised to ``a

Marbury from the Minnesota Timberwolves to New Jersey, 93 percent

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Seeks Outsiders for IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Henry Kissinger and Jacques Delors have been  
asked to help redesign the International Olympic Committee, 
according to the panel's president. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said in an interview to be  
published Friday that he is looking outside the world of sports to 
try to restore the committee's credibility amid the worst scandal 
in its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The new panel, which Samaranch said Fiat tycoon Giovanni Agnelli  
has already agreed to join, would advise on an IOC overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told the Milan-based Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper  
that the new IOC could be comprised of 35 representatives each from 
international sports federations and national Olympic committees, 
``plus a group of athletes of great prestige and some global 
personalities of unquestioned fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no active athletes in the current IOC assembly.  
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger, a former U.S. secretary of state, and Delors, the  
main architect of the European Union, could lend credibility to the 
efforts. It was not clear if they had agreed to serve. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and Samaranch have come under harsh attack from outside  
critics following revelations of cash payments and other improper 
inducements to IOC members from Salt Lake and other bid cities.

<HEADLINE> Knight Jabs NCAA for Late Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Some things just don't sit well with Bob  
Knight. Try, for example, late starting times for NCAA tournament 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Indiana coach has been an outspoken critic of  
television dictating when teams play. So it's no surprise he's not 
happy about his Hoosiers facing George Washington in a first-round 
South Regional game that figures to start well after 10 p.m. EST on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's an abomination. That word won't get me in  
trouble because there will be a lot of NCAA people who have to look 
it up,'' Knight said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana-George Washington game will start 25 minutes after  
the conclusion of the St. John's-Samford game that begins at 7:40 
p.m. -- assuring another Late Knight with Bob. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my humble opinion, the 10 o'clock start should never be a  
part of college basketball. ... No matter who wins the game, the 
kids aren't even going to bed until 2 in the morning,'' Knight 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is a real imposition. And I've said that for 15  
years, to every NCAA tournament committee that had the 10 o'clock 
start, which is an indication of how much influence I've had on 10 
o'clock starts.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. deficit in the broadest measure of  
trade surged to a record high of $233.4 billion last year as the 
global economic crisis resulted in the first drop in sales of 
American farm products and manufactured goods in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the deficit in the current  
account jumped by 50.4 percent from the 1997 imbalance of $155.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While the fourth quarter deficit narrowed a slight 2.9 percent  
to $63.8 billion, private economists viewed that as a temporary 
improvement and not a sign of a permanent turn for the better in 
America's trade fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Latta, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, said she  
expected the 1999 current account deficit to hit $286 billion, 
reflecting continued global economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a global economic slowdown with recessions in  
one-third of the globe and slowing growth in Europe. That means 
weak demand,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's deficit surpassed the old record of $168 billion in  
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1987 deficit was equal to 3.7 percent of the total  
economy, the 1998 imbalance was only 2.7 percent of a bigger U.S. 
economy. But if this year's deficit does climb to around $290 
billion, that would make it equal to 3.3 percent of the gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, bulging trade deficits would be a major political  
problem for the occupant of the White House. But the imbalances 
this time are occurring as domestic growth remained strong, pushing 
unemployment to the lowest levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republican Pat Buchanan, announcing his presidential  
candidacy earlier this month, pledged to fight against cheap 
imports and make sure that American workers ``are not here to serve 
the financiers of some new world order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current account is considered the best gauge of the  
country's international standing because it measures not only trade 
in goods and services, but also investment flows between countries 
and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures released Thursday showed a deterioration in most  
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of American goods fell by 1.2 percent to $671.1 billion  
last year, the first drop in this category since 1985. Two-thirds 
of the decline came from falling farm sales and the other one-third 
from a decline in sales of manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade surplus in services, such as airline fares, sales  
of insurance and consulting fees, fell to $78.9 billion last year, 
down from a surplus of $87.7 billion in 1997, reflecting primarily 
a drop in foreign tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit in investment income, the difference between what  
foreigners earn on their U.S. investments and what Americans earn 
abroad, rose to $22.5 billion, after a $5.3 billion deficit in 
investment earnings in 1997, the first red ink in this category on 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the mid-1980s, the United States was the world's largest  
creditor country, but as Americans have given billions of dollars 
to foreigners to pay for deficits in merchandise trade, the country 
is now the world's largest debtor nation. That means foreigners now 
have larger U.S. holdings and thus bigger investment earnings than 
Americans make on their overseas holdings.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Belle Goes Ballistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Albert Belle ended his calm,  
uneventful spring training Thursday with a tirade in the Baltimore 
Orioles clubhouse in which he angrily threw his glove, two bats and 
his helmet into his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle also scattered several letters that were sitting on his  
chair. He then quickly undressed, showered and stormed out of the 
clubhouse without exchanging a word with any of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The tirade occurred after a questionable third-strike call in  
the sixth inning of the Orioles' 4-2 exhibition victory over the 
New York Mets. The strikeout ended an 0-for-3 day that left him at 
3-for-13 (.231) this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year contract with the Orioles on Dec.  
1, had been quite civil during spring training despite his 
well-documented confrontations with fans, umpires and opposing 
ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after arriving early to camp in February, Belle  
addressed the media twice in three days. He also made a point of 
signing dozens of autographs before and after the Orioles' 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed autographs before Thursday's game, too.  
</P>
<P>
	But the dormant volcano finally erupted after a check-swing  
strikeout against Greg McMichael. On his way to the clubhouse, 
Belle muttered to himself as he stormed past players in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	He then shattered one of his bats during the tirade, which  
occurred in front of a few teammates and a handful of reporters 
waiting to talk to pitcher Mike Mussina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just mad at himself, just like when he gets mad at  
people when they ask him questions,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``It 
shows me he wants to hit and that he demands excellence from 
himself. There's nothing wrong with that; I just told (clubhouse 
attendant) Jimmy Tyler to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles reliever Jesse Orosco, who was in the clubhouse at the  
time, avoided Belle before walking back onto the field. Orosco 
later said the demonstration was simply a prime example of Belle's 
competitive nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took an oh-fer. As long as he doesn't hurt anybody, no  
problem,'' Orosco said. ``He wants to perform well in every game, 
even in the spring. That's just the type of intensity he takes the 
ballpark. I think he figures the only way he can get tuned up for 
the regular season is by playing every game as if it means 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the Orioles announced they no longer will open  
the clubhouse to reporters while exhibition games are in progress.

<HEADLINE> Will Gumbel Return to Morning TV? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two years ago this week, CBS won an intense  
three-network bidding war for the services of former ``Today'' host 
Bryant Gumbel by agreeing to pay him nearly $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's virtually an invisible man.  
</P>
<P>
	His newsmagazine canceled, Gumbel hasn't appeared on the air for  
CBS since he was host of a news special in December. It's not clear 
when he'll appear on-screen again. CBS says it is discussing future 
projects with Gumbel, but won't disclose more. 
</P>
<P>
	To some at the network, the comeback path appears clear: a  
return to morning television as host of CBS's perpetually 
struggling ``This Morning,'' where Gumbel would compete against the 
morning institution where he reigned for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel's agent, Ed Hookstratten, said CBS officials have talked  
with Gumbel about being host of the morning show, but the idea is a 
long way from reality. Gumbel sent word through a spokeswoman that 
he didn't want to talk publicly about the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``He enjoyed his 15 years on `Today,''' Hookstratten said.  
``He's been away from it for a few years. He may be amenable to it, 
I don't know. But it hasn't gotten to the point of `Hey, Bryant, 
will you do it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing Gumbel to ``This Morning'' would allow CBS to take a  
serious run at ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for second place in 
morning TV, an increasingly lucrative time of day for networks. 
``Today'' is so far ahead that it's not a realistic target at this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' very briefly surged past ``Good Morning  
America'' in the ratings at the end of last year, but has settled 
back into third place since Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson were 
installed as hosts of the ABC show. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is talking about a range of changes to ``This Morning,'' now  
anchored by Mark McEwen and Jane Robelot, CBS News President Andrew 
Heyward said. ``We are pleased with its progress but are not 
satisfied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bryant and I are colleagues and friends and we talk all the  
time,'' Heyward said. ``Of course, the morning show is part of 
this. But there have been no offers, no negotiations, no demands. 
All of this is a work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good Morning America'' may actually pave the way for Gumbel's  
return. Luring Sawyer and Gibson to be hosts established the 
precedent of news stars returning to morning television, making it 
easier for CBS to approach Gumbel about this job. Sawyer worked for 
CBS's morning show in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be slightly strange for those of us who  
worked with him every day to be competing against him,'' said Jeff 
Zucker, executive producer of ``Today.'' ``On the other hand, I 
would certainly welcome it because more competition is always great 
and Bryant is certainly terrific at this. It would be strange but 
kind of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's far more complicated than adjusting a chair for him on  
the morning show set. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is considering an expensive real estate deal to build a  
street-front studio for ``This Morning'' off New York's Central 
Park, imitating the successful ``Today'' window at Rockefeller 
Plaza. Without it, many at CBS doubt Gumbel would want the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' would also probably have to change its unique  
format that turns over much of its first hour to its affiliates for 
local news. 
</P>
<P>
	The network gave away that time a few years ago to stave off a  
mutiny by affiliates angry at low ratings. Persuading these local 
stations to give the time back, or perhaps accept time in the 
second hour, would take delicate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	A key man in these discussions is Steve Friedman, executive at  
CBS's affiliate in New York City. Friedman's also a former 
executive producer of ``Today'' when Gumbel worked there. A 
decision on what to do about ``This Morning'' is expected before an 
important meeting of CBS affiliates in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people, including Zucker, claim any insider knowledge about  
what Gumbel will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a big decision to make,'' Zucker said.  
``Bryant's not going to be pushed into it no matter how much the 
media speculates or people talk about it. He'll do what's best for 
him, as he should. At the end of the day, he's also a very loyal 
company man and he'll do what he's asked to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after he was in huge demand, Gumbel, 50, is in a  
peculiar sort of limbo: making millions to bide his time. The 
talent that helped him rise from local sports reporting to the 
rarified air of network star -- particularly his ability to conduct 
a tough, live interview -- is in mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
	His status as highly-paid benchwarmer is a natural flashpoint  
for resentment, especially since he works for a network run by Mel 
Karmazin, an aggressive cost-cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	There appear to be few other options for Gumbel at CBS. The  
network has already renewed its three prime-time newsmagazines for 
next season, and he has worked for none of them. There's no room 
for Gumbel's ``Public Eye,'' which received lukewarm ratings and 
reviews before being canceled. Dan Rather isn't going anywhere, and 
Gumbel has said he isn't interested in anchoring the evening news, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel has been working with Dunbar Productions, his syndication  
company set up as part of his deal with CBS, although none of its 
projects has been revealed. He continues as host of ``Real Sports'' 
on HBO. And much of his time the past month has been spent running 
a charity golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	If he says no to the morning show, the next step will likely be  
negotiations to buy out his CBS contract.

<HEADLINE> Oil-Laden Ship Finally Sunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- Three hundred miles offshore, the  
oil-laden wreckage of the New Carissa finally sank Thursday after 
being fired upon by a Navy destroyer, explosive charges and even a 
torpedo. 
</P>
<P>
	First, remote-controlled explosive charges blew holes in the  
hull of the wreck that has plagued the Oregon coast for more than a 
month, fouling miles of beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	When that failed to sink the ship, the destroyer USS David R.  
Ray opened up a barrage of 70 shots from its 5-inch guns, and then 
the nuclear sub USS Bremerton fired a torpedo shot that exploded 
just below the hulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, two hours after demolition experts began their efforts,  
the stubborn wreck slipped under the water back-end first and began 
its descent two miles to the sea floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had nine lives and it was not willing to cooperate with  
us,'' said Navy Cmdr. Cliff Perkins, the destroyer's commanding 
officer. ``This thing seems to have a life of its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salvage experts said sinking the ship 300 miles out in the  
Pacific was the only way to finish off a wayward wreck that has 
fouled two Oregon beaches and was still believed to hold 130,000 
gallons of fuel oil. 
</P>
<P>
	At depths of 12,000 feet, where temperatures never rise above 34  
degrees, experts say the sticky bunker fuel will be trapped in a 
semisolid state. 
</P>
<P>
	The saga of the New Carissa began Feb. 4, when the 639-foot  
freighter with 400,000 gallons of fuel oil on board ran aground off 
Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of that was burned off by explosives experts. Hours  
after the Feb. 10 fire, the ship split in two, spilling 70,000 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to tow the bow out to sea failed when it broke away and  
washed ashore 80 miles north at this tiny town along the Central 
Oregon Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on the beach, more than 604 dead birds have been found on  
both nearby shorelines since the grounding, 273 of them with 
splotches of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Globs of oil -- about the size of pencil erasers -- continue to  
wash ashore. Meantime, the 220-foot stern section still sits, 
half-buried, in the beach at Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the House Transportation and Infrastructure  
Committee approved legislation that would give the Coast Guard new 
tools to regulate foreign-flagged vessels like the New Carissa in 
U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., would require  
foreign ships to give notice 24 hours before entering U.S. waters, 
give the Coast Guard authority to deny a vessel entry into U.S. 
waters based on safety concerns and make it clear that the Coast 
Guard has authority to direct the movements of foreign vessels 
during hazardous conditions.

<HEADLINE> Contraceptive Sponge Brought Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New Jersey company is preparing to bring  
back the Today Sponge, the most popular over-the-counter 
contraceptive for women before it was taken off the market in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Allendale Pharmaceuticals Inc. told The Associated Press on  
Wednesday that it has bought the contraceptive sponge from its 
previous manufacturer and hopes to begin selling it again by fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a great need for the sponge,'' said Allendale  
chief executive Gene Detroyer, who plans to formally announce the 
product's return at a contraceptive meeting in San Francisco this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	It was good news for family planning groups.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased and excited that it's coming back,'' said Susan  
Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which says that there are not 
enough contraceptive choices for American women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women need different methods at different points in life. ...  
Certainly it's not for everyone,'' Tew cautioned. ``But those 
contraceptive sponge users loved that method'' before Today 
disappeared in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	With its low risk of side effects, the sponge was attractive to  
women who had problems with prescribed hormonal contraceptives or 
difficulty with more complex inserted devices. 
</P>
<P>
	But its appeal was limited by a relatively high failure rate,  
about 10 percent in women who had never borne children and somewhat 
higher in women who had gone through childbirth, Tew noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitehall-Robins Healthcare quit selling the Today Sponge in  
1995 for financial reasons: It decided it would cost too much to 
correct manufacturing problems the Food and Drug Administration had 
uncovered at the old factory where the sponge was made. To the 
distress of women's groups, it pulled Today off the market instead 
of upgrading the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA stressed that there never was any problem with Today's  
safety, just with the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	No contraceptive sponge has been sold in the United States  
since. Women in France, Canada and a few other countries can buy 
competing sponges made abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the FDA never revoked the Today's approval, getting it  
back on the market should be a quick process, said Allendale 
co-founder Robert Staab. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products, parent company of Whitehall-Robins,  
confirmed Wednesday that it is notifying the FDA of the change in 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Allendale then must have its own sponge factory, outside  
Philadelphia, inspected for safety in order for the FDA to allow 
sales to resume. Staab said the factory already manufactures 
medicines for large U.S. drug companies in compliance with FDA 
rules, so he expects no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 116,000 American women were using Today in 1995. That's a  
small proportion of the 38 million women who used some 
contraception that year; sterilization and the pill were the No. 1 
and 2 choices then and now. 
</P>
<P>
	But Today was the most popular choice that did not require a  
doctor's visit. The only other woman-controlled nonprescription 
choices are spermicidal foams or suppositories and the female 
condom. Unlike those options, the sponge can be inserted up to 24 
hours before sex and doesn't require repeat applications for 
repeated intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The donut-shaped device, coated in the spermicide nonoxynol-9,  
is simply pushed up the vagina to cover the cervix. It has a loop 
to grasp for removal, and comes with warnings not to leave it in 
for more than 30 hours due to avoid a low risk of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroyer would not reveal how much his private company paid to  
buy the Today Sponge. But he noted that at Today's peak, it brought 
in about $17 million in annual sales and said he is confident of 
recouping the investment.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Reach 10-Month High / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose for a sixth consecutive week, to 7.11 
percent, the highest level in 10 months, Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average this week, up from 7.06 percent last week, was the  
highest since mid-May and marked a significantly higher level than 
the 6.74 percent average at the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The average reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early  
October as worried world investors poured money into U.S. financial 
markets. Economists attribute the recent climb to strong demand in 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.75 percent this week, also the highest since mid-May and 
up from 6.70 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.88 percent, up from 5.74 percent the 
previous week and the highest in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged 0.8 percent of the loan amount for each type of mortgage.

<HEADLINE> Japan Economy May Have Shrunk Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's recession-hobbled economy probably shrank  
in the final three months of last year, marking five straight 
quarters of negative growth, the country's top economic official 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic Planning Agency Chief Taichi Sakaiya said the 0.7  
percent contraction reported in the July-September period would 
probably be revised to show a smaller drop. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, would make it more likely that growth in the  
October-December period would be negative when compared to the 
previous quarter, Sakaiya said in a taped television appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya's comments came hours before the EPA released official  
figures on gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and 
services produced in the country -- for the October-December period. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of that upward revision in July-September, we'll  
likely see something like ... a negative effect on 
October-December,'' Sakaiya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya said that although there are signs of improvement in the  
economy, conditions remain severe overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings figures for the current fiscal year, to be released in  
May, are expected to show corporate profits falling by the largest 
margin in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in GDP in an additional quarter would make it more likely  
the economy would shrink for a second fiscal year in a row. The 
economy shrank by 0.7 percent for the last fiscal year ending in 
March 1998, its first annual drop since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to prevent the recession from dragging on further,  
Japan's Parliament plans a record budget for the fiscal year 
beginning on April 1. The $682.5 billion budget includes a stimulus 
package of public works and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is also in the midst of a massive bailout of  
Japan's many troubled banks. The banks were left with massive loans 
gone sour and leftover from the excessive lending and speculation 
of the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> NBA Trade Deadline Closing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With half of the NBA ineligible to be dealt and the Glen Rice  
trade completed, tonight's NBA trading deadline activity should be 
lighter than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't put a lid on all the trade talk.  
</P>
<P>
	Rumors were at full strength around the league, from a Stephon  
Marbury-to-New Jersey scenario to the minor Terry Mills and Duane 
Causwell-for-Don MacLean, and Vitaly Potapenko-for-Andrew DeClercq 
swaps that only the real NBA diehards could love. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets coach John Calipari, after losing at Indiana, hinted that  
there was one major deal he considered interesting, and various 
reports said a trade was being discussed that would send Kerry 
Kittles or Sam Cassell and a No. 1 pick to Minnesota for Marbury. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-rumored Rice deal finally went down Wednesday as  
Charlotte sent the three-time All-Star to the ever-changing Los 
Angeles Lakers. Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones go to the Hornets, 
and J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong were sent to Rodman-Rambisland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this takes us one step closer to our ultimate goal of  
having an NBA championship team,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With other teams also feeling like legitimate championship  
contenders in this first season of the post-Michael Jordan era, 
there was plenty of trade talk going around. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the discussions centered on Milwaukee point guard  
Terrell Brandon, who will be a free agent at the end of the season 
and has refused to sign an extension with the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're just dealing the cards. The bidding is not in  
yet,'' Bucks coach George Karl said Tuesday night 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday night, the bidding was getting interesting.  
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the talks said a number of multiple-team  
trades -- perhaps even a four-team swap -- were being discussed 
involving Brandon, although none of those proposed deals could be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the names popping up in rumors were Jermaine O'Neal and  
Kelvin Cato of Portland, Derek Anderson, Cedric Henderson and 
Potapenko of Cleveland, Mills and Causwell of Miami, Terry Cummings 
of Golden State, MacLean of Seattle, Tim Thomas of Philadelphia, 
Tyrone Hill and Elliot Perry of the Bucks and Kendall Gill and 
Chris Gatling of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks were known to be discussing a Gatling deal with the  
Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teams were interested in acquiring one of the Los  
Angeles Clippers' players whose contract expires at the end of the 
season, such as Lorenzen Wright, Lamond Murray or Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	But as always, it was likely there would be much more talk than  
action -- especially with about 200 players ineligible to be dealt 
under the league's new ``six-month rule'' which says a player can't 
be traded within six months of the day he signs unless it's a 
prearranged sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league is conservative and this season is too crazy and  
too short to make major personnel decisions,'' Karl said. ``I think 
you're going to see everybody wait, except for maybe little 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks have been gauging the market for the past few weeks,  
trying to decide what to do with Brandon, who has said he'll hold 
to his plans to test the free agent market, even if he is traded 
before the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I get an offer that absolutely knocks my socks off, I'm  
not going to trade him,'' Bucks general manager Bob Weinhauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockbuster Lakers-Hornets deal, rumored for over a month,  
came as the Lakers were on an eight-game winning streak that was 
extended to nine with yet another victory over the Clippers -- the 
Lakers' fourth of the season against their crosstown rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to trade such good players, and  
especially so when they are such quality people,'' West said. ``But 
in Glen Rice, we feel we've acquired the best shooter in the NBA 
and also one of the league's best players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 percent turnover of their roster followed by two weeks  
the firing of coach Del Harris and hiring of Kurt Rambis as his 
successor, as well as the signing of forward Dennis Rodman, the 
NBA's leading rebounder for the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 rebounds  
in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three with 
Charlotte. He averaged 22.3 points last season to rank sixth in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with Kobe  
Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our injuries this season, this trade really gives  
our team two quality starters and a chance to compete for a playoff 
spot,'' Charlotte general manager Bob Bass said. ``It has greatly 
improved our team.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mouseketeer Sentenced to 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former Mouseketeer was sentenced Thursday  
to two years in federal prison for using phony or bounced checks to 
buy investments and lying about it to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Darlene Fraschilla, who changed her last name from Gillespie  
after her January marriage, showed no emotion as the sentence was 
read. In addition to prison, she must pay $6,144 in restitution and 
serve three years of supervised release. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lourdes G. Baird ordered her to report to  
prison by July 26. Mrs. Fraschilla, who was one of the nine 
original Mouseketeers on the Mickey Mouse Club television show from 
1955-1959, had faced up to 90 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fraschilla said she plans to appeal. ``I believe with all  
my heart that ... I will truly be vindicated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors convicted her in December on a dozen counts of  
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, obstruction of justice 
and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said she helped her then-boyfriend, Jerry  
Fraschilla, in a scheme to buy more than 194,000 shares of stock 
valued at $827,000 in 1992 and 1993 by writing checks on closed and 
overdrawn accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 61, of Oxnard pleaded guilty to 21 counts of fraud  
last year and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and probation. 
He also was ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution.

<HEADLINE> Study Link Genes, AIDS Progression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have found inherited genes that may  
explain why some people infected with HIV quickly develop AIDs 
while others with the virus live for years in relatively good 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery has no immediate benefit for HIV patients, but it  
increases understanding about how the virus attacks the body, said 
Mary Carrington, one of the researchers involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Such understanding could eventually help researchers design  
vaccines or drugs against HIV, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a genetic study of about 500 people infected with HIV,  
Carrington and fellow researchers at the National Cancer Institute 
found that differences in the inherited pattern of what are called 
HLA Class I genes determined who became sickest the soonest and who 
was able to hold off the disease progression. A report on the study 
appears Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington said Thursday that there are three different HLA  
Class I genes, identified as A, B and C. People inherit two copies 
of each one of the genes. This means there can be as many as six 
unique combinations or as few as three. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more different forms of this gene a person has, the more  
resistant that individual is to progression of the disease,'' said 
Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
	An HIV infection in people with non-matching HLA Class I gene  
pairs, for instance, may not progress to AIDs for six to 12 years, 
the researchers found. Those who inherited matched pairs of the 
genes tend to develop AIDS in three years or less. 
</P>
<P>
	HLA Class I genes are part of the immune system. Their job is to  
identify cells that are infected with virus and to leave a signal 
molecule on the surface of the infected cell. Another part of the 
immune system, the cytotoxic T-cell, will kill cells marked by the 
signal molecule, thereby blocking the spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The HIV virus is constantly changing and, eventually, will find  
a form that is not recognized by any of the HLA Class I genes, said 
Carrington. If an individual has a variety of HLA genes, it takes 
longer for the HIV to develop changes not recognized by the immune 
system. For this reason, said Carrington, a person with a variety 
of gene forms will avoid AIDs for a longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington said that about 40 percent of the people examined in  
the study had a gene pattern that gave a slow disease progress, 
while about 45 percent had a gene combination that led to rapid 
progression. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three HLA genes have many alleles, or forms that  
differ only slightly from each other. For instance, there are about 
200 different forms of the HLA-B gene, said Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that people with paired copies of two of  
the gene forms, identified as B35 and Cw04, tended to progress to 
AIDS most rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington said 8 percent to 9 percent of the tested patients  
had the B35 form. About 10 percent of the white patients had the 
Cw04 form, she said, but it was present in about 25 percent of 
black patients.

<HEADLINE> Gang Leader May Talk to McVeigh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After more than five years in solitary  
confinement, the leader of the Latin Kings gang has been given 
permission to socialize with two fellow inmates -- the Unabomber and 
the Oklahoma City bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Luis Felipe was anxious to talk with them in the first  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Felipe can take his  
exercise with the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, and Oklahoma City 
bomber Timothy McVeigh at the Super Max Penitentiary in Florence, 
Colo. But he was forbidden to have any contact with World Trade 
Center bombing mastermind Ramzi Yousef. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe ordered the murders of at least six people while in state  
prison, and two of them were killed. He is serving a life sentence 
for federal racketeering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Lawrence Feitel, had asked that Felipe be allowed to  
take his exercise with the three bombers, who are prisoners in his 
unit. The lawyer was unaware that prison officials already had 
offered the privilege to Felipe, who has consistently refused the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to speak to those bombers,'' Felipe said in  
a letter opposing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge John Martin Jr. wrote in his opinion  
that ``the court does not perceive any substantial danger in 
permitting Felipe to have ... contact ... with McVeigh and 
Kaczynski.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge forbade contact between Felipe and Yousef, saying  
``there is some danger that Felipe might try to use Yousef to 
convey messages out of prison.'' Yousef is linked to other 
terrorism suspects and Islamic radical organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said they believe Felipe would continue to send  
coded messages to the outside world through visitors and other 
prisoners if he were not isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	Feitel made the request after Felipe told him in a letter he was  
losing his ability to think coherently and formulate sentences 
because of his isolation. He has been in solitary confinement for 
more than five years, including time spent in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to be able to exchange a few words and to talk to  
someone -- not about anything sinister -- I would hope that would 
relax his own misery,'' Feitel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe is allowed to correspond with a half-dozen people,  
including Feitel. All correspondence is censored. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors had urged Martin to bar Felipe from talking  
to the other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to justify allowing his first contact with  
other prisoners to be with such relatively sophisticated and 
dangerous individuals,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a 
letter to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last year, the Latin Kings had 2,400 members in New York --  
1,000 of them behind bars. The gang was formed in the 1940s in 
Chicago prisons and it also has branches in Illinois, Rhode Island, 
Connecticut and Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900 but Ends at 9,897.44 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average hurtled toward  
10,000 Thursday, falling just short amid a big gain in oil stocks 
and fresh evidence about the hardy U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow broke through the 9,800 and 9,900 marks by noon, peaking  
at 9.935.46 before pulling back. A late rally failed to breach the 
five-digit milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close, the Dow, a market bellwether which measures the  
value of 30 of America's corporate icons, was up 124.60 to 
9,897.44, a new high for the second day in a row. The Dow is up 
nearly 8 percent on the year and has gained more than 200 points in 
the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock measures also were up. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500-stock index rose 10.84 to 1297.68, just missing its first close 
above 1,300. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 6.25 
at 2,412.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Although crude oil futures prices fell 
Thursday, prices have been rising steadily for more than a week, 
recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which gained 1  
13/16 to 85 1/16, and Exxon, which rose 1 7/16 to 74 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor interest in the 10,000 mark for the Dow also seemed to  
be feeding on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short term, at the margins, traders feel its inevitable  
that we will go to 10,000 and they are playing that dynamic to push 
the Dow higher,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for 
Legg Mason of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Dow gainer was American Express, which rose 5 7/8 to  
123 1/2 after Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities raised its 
investment opinion of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad stock indicators were driven higher even without the  
usual help from technology stocks, which were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more (business) sectors that participate in a market  
advance is a sign the market looks very good,'' Cripps said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cripps cautioned that many small-company stocks are still  
struggling, always a concern about the strength of any stock rally 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping Thursday's rally was new retail sales data showing  
the U.S. economy is growing without any inflationary threats. Since 
there are no signs that the economy is overheating, investors 
believe that the Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to 
boost interest rates in coming months. Higher interest rates 
increase the cost of borrowing for consumers and corporations and 
as a result can cool economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for  
unemployment checks remained under 300,000 for the sixth 
consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt resignation of Germany's finance minister, Oskar  
Lafontaine, was also seen by some as a positive development. Some 
of Lafontaine's policies, such as proposals for high taxation, were 
seen as harmful to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 902.62 million shares vs. 832.59 million in  
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.19 to 611.67 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.51 to 721.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.04 to 401.08.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent to a new record, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Moves Closer to World Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Lasse Kjus moved closer to clinching  
his second World Cup overall title with a fourth-place finish in 
the super-G today, as one of his two main rivals -- Austrian Hermann 
Maier -- conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus picked up 50 points and improved to 1,409 -- 92 better than  
fellow Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt, and 102 in front of Maier 
with two races yet to run and Sunday's men's giant slalom set to 
end the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who had won four consecutive super-Gs and has already  
clinched the season title in that discipline, was seventh and 
Aamodt was a weak 16th. Maier picked up 36 points but Aamodt got 
none as only the top 15 get points in the World Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can win the overall title after Saturday's slalom,''  
Kjus said. ``My only serious threat is Aamodt. It was a good day 
for me. My super-G form this year was not so good, so fourth is 
really good for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the two-time '98 Olympic champion and last season's  
overall World Cup winner, threw in the towel with two races left. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he still had a chance, Maier replied, ``Of course, next  
year.'' He added that he woulnd not ski the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	He trails by 102 points and the maximum he could pick up in the  
giant slalom would be 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally in such a race I should have been the winner,'' said  
Maier, adding that a prevailing tailwind helped skiers who race 
upright, but not Maier who runs in a deep tuck. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt made a mistake at the top of the course that cost him  
precious time. ``That's why I lost almost a second to Maier,'' he 
said. ``I was disappointed because after I almost fell I skied 
really well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the 1994 overall champion, Kjus, the '96 overall World  
Cup king, and Maier -- the defending champion -- are all strong in 
giant slalom, but Maier is a much weaker slalom skier than the two 
Norwegians. 
</P>
<P>
	With most eyes on the top three in overall, Austrians swept the  
first three places in the super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Mayer won his first super-G -- and the fourth World Cup  
of his career -- in 1 minute 28.71 seconds, followed by Austrians 
Andreas Schifferer (1:29.06) and Josef Strobl (1:29.53). 
</P>
<P>
	High winds caused the women's super-G to be put off today until  
Friday.

<HEADLINE> $2B in Farm Disaster Aid Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is coming under  
criticism from some members of Congress after news that $2 billion 
in disaster aid for farmers won't be delivered until June. 
</P>
<P>
	The news means the emergency aid will get to farmers nearly  
eight months after Congress approved it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas,  
called the delay ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now billions of dollars that should already be in  
the hands of farmers and ranchers,'' Combest said Wednesday, noting 
that farmers need the money as they go into the new planting 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman wrote to Combest and Senate  
Agriculture Committee Chairman Dick Lugar, R-Ind., that 
administering the aid is ``far more complex than past natural 
disaster assistance programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the agency is inundated with aid disbursements  
during this tumultuous farm year, including assistance packages of 
$50 million for hog farmers and $200 million for dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting these payments out as expeditiously and as fairly as  
possible is a top personal priority for me,'' Glickman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved the money as part of a $6 billion emergency  
package to aid farmers suffering from free-falling commodity 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said one of the things complicating the disbursement is  
that it covers farmers who suffered crop losses over several years 
before 1998 or who had losses only in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``USDA must go through one additional step of determining which  
will pay the applicant more before issuing final payments,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, meanwhile, spent  
Wednesday looking at ways to overhaul a crop insurance program for 
farmers, even while acknowledging an uphill battle for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA unveiled details of between $2 billion and $2.5 billion  
worth of reforms, including raising coverage, making higher-level 
coverage more affordable and covering multiyear disasters as well 
as livestock. Several lawmakers have also introduced proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our proposal is specific, and it is designed to fill the most  
glaring crop insurance voids,'' Glickman said. ``It will make crop 
insurance more affordable and worth buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it won't be easy as Congress faces pressure to use budget  
surpluses for Social Security and Medicare. ``I've got to figure 
out what the tide will bear,'' Lugar said of attempts to get money. 
</P>
<P>
	About 79 Republican lawmakers sent a letter to House Budget  
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, this week urging him to 
address crop insurance in his committee's budget resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers don't have crop insurance and those who do complain  
that it is too expensive and inadequate. With low prices expected 
to continue for much of this year, lawmakers have said it is 
critical to strengthen crop insurance to have an adequate safety 
net for farmers, who lost decades of government subsidies as part 
of the 1996 farm law.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Atkins Dead at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins, a staunch  
defender of the homeless and refugees in rulings that challenged 
national policy, died Thursday of colon cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he created ``safe zones'' for the area's homeless to  
stay without threat of police arrest, ruling that Miami had 
violated the Constitution by seizing and destroying the meager 
belongings of homeless people while chasing them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision inspired community leaders to establish what is now  
a nationally recognized system to help the homeless -- shelter, job 
training, counseling and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins' rulings on behalf of Haitian and Cuban refugees vexed  
the Bush and the Clinton administrations' efforts to repatriate 
thousands of refugees from the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba. Both decisions were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's physically a small man ... but he's an intellectual

<HEADLINE> Susan Lucci Nominated Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If everyone's a little preoccupied on the set of  
``The Young and the Restless'' the next two months, they have a 
good excuse: they're all practicing acceptance speeches for the 
Daytime Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS soap earned a record 21 nominations Thursday. And, yes,  
Susan Lucci was nominated again. The hard-luck actress who has 
never won earned her 19th best actress nomination for Erica Kane on 
``All My Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be presented May 21 in a prime-time ceremony  
televised by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Springer was snubbed as a nominee for outstanding talk  
show host even after nemesis Oprah Winfrey took herself out of the 
running. Springer's top-rated slugfest wasn't nominated for best 
talk show, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the six acting categories had multiple nominees from  
``The Young and the Restless.'' Three members of the show's cast -- 
Ashley Jones, Camryn Grimes and Heather Tom -- will compete for the 
outstanding younger actress award. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most nominations by one show ever in one year. It  
breaks the previous record of 20, achieved four times, most 
recently by ``The Young and the Restless'' two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Hospital'' was next with 13 nominations. ``The Rosie  
O'Donnell Show'' and ``Sesame Street'' both earned 11 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey, after winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime  
achievement award last year, took herself out of the running for 
best talk show host. Still, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' earned seven 
nominations, including best talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Spielberg, whose more immediate concern may be the  
Academy Awards, may have to expand his trophy case. The children's 
shows he produces, ``Animaniacs'' and ``Pinky, Elmyra and the 
Brain,'' earned two nominations each. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners are selected by members of the National Academy of  
Television Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> 'Coach' Star to Convert Bathhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Jerry Van Dyke is hoping to convert an  
old bathhouse in Hot Springs National Park into a ``Planet 
Hollywood-type'' restaurant and museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyke, who played Luther Van Dam in the ``Coach'' television  
series, already runs a theater in his adopted hometown of Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wants to expand into Bathhouse Row, where many bathhouses  
were built at the turn of the century to take advantage of the 
area's natural hot springs. The national park bathhouses are owned 
by the federal government, which seems interested in the idea of 
leasing a spot to Van Dyke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a very positive factor for Bathhouse  
Row,'' said Roger Giddings, superintendent of Hot Springs National 
Park. 
</P>

	Van Dyke, an Illinois native, lives in Benton with his wife,  
local country singer Shirley Jones.

<HEADLINE> Picture of Mars Crater Taken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Smile, Mars -- NASA is snapping your  
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Happy Face Crater'' was captured in a wide-angle image  
recorded by Mars Global Surveyor's camera on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature, which has a much more mirthful appearance than the  
better known but decidedly grim ``Face on Mars,'' is really the 
134-mile-wide Galle Crater on the eastern side of a basin called 
Argyre Planitia. 
</P>
<P>
	Features within the circular crater form the eyes and smiling  
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	In color, the picture has a bluish-white tone caused by frost,  
according to Malin Space Science Systems Inc., which operates 
Surveyor's camera from San Diego and released the images Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Happy Face'' was first noticed in images sent back to  
Earth during the Viking 1 mission to Mars in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Viking missions also returned images of the not-so-happy  
``Mars Face,'' a feature that looked like a skull with empty eye 
sockets. That spawned theories that the mile-long feature was the 
creation of some intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Mars Global Surveyor's modern camera took a look at the  
same area a year ago, the gape-mouth visage vanished as sharp 
detail revealed a natural feature, perhaps a butte or mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Global Surveyor, managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion  
Laboratory, was launched in 1996 and reached the planet in 
September 1997. It began its main science mission this week after a 
long delay in achieving the proper orbit for mapping.

<HEADLINE> FBI: McDougal Loan Paid Clinton Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- For the first time, prosecutor Kenneth  
Starr's office alleged today that a fraudulent $300,000 federal 
loan taken out by Susan McDougal in the mid-1980s was used to help 
pay off an earlier loan taken out in President Clinton's name for 
the Whitewater land venture. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony at Mrs. McDougal's obstruction of justice and  
contempt trial, FBI agent Mike Patkus made the first link between 
the fradulent federal loan and a possible benefit to Clinton, who 
at the time of the 1986 transactions was Arkansas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has testified he knew nothing about the fraudulent Small  
Business Administration-backed loan Mrs. McDougal received and also 
never had any financial transactions or loans from the failed 
savings and loan owned by Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	But Patkus testified that he discovered a $27,600 loan from  
Madison S&AMP;L to Clinton taken out in 1982 while pouring through 
microfilm records of the failed thrift. And he then traced for the 
jury a series of complex transactions that showed how the 1982 
Clinton loan came to be reimbursed through the $300,000 loan Mrs. 
McDougal took out from a SBA lender four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus, an accountant, said Whitewater real estate agent Chris  
Wade paid off most of the $27,600 loan in Clinton's name and then 
was reimbursed from proceeds by another bank loan Mrs. McDougal 
took out. Mrs. McDougal then took the proceeds from the fraudulent 
$300,000 loan and paid off the bank loan used for Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's testimony was further evidence that, after failing to  
charge Clinton and his wife in the five-year Whitewater 
investigation, Starr's office plans to use Mrs. McDougal's trial to 
air the evidence he gathered against the first family. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with defying a federal judge's order to  
testify before the federal grand jury that investigated the 
Whitewater matter and the Clintons' financial dealings. Prosecutors 
allege her refusal to testify has kept them from determining if 
Clinton committed perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Starr's prosecutors introduced a series of Whitewater  
loan documents, in an effort to show the close relationship between 
Mrs. McDougal and the Clintons. Each one of the eight documents 
introduced at the trial bears the signature of the Clintons, Mrs. 
McDougal and her late ex-husband James. The documents show that the 
bank loan for approximately $200,000 used to purchase the 
Whitewater property in northern Arkansas was repeatedly extended by 
the bank for over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer intends to use the trial to raise  
questions about Starr's tactics and fairness, charging in opening 
statements Wednesday that they wanted his client to falsely 
implicate the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was not going to cooperate with an investigation that was  
totally flawed and corrupt,'' attorney Mark Geragos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr prosecutor Mark Barrett said ``we vigorously and  
categorically deny that'' Starr's office had sought perjured 
testimony from Mrs. McDougal to implicate the Clintons.

<HEADLINE> Alcatel To Cut 12,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel  
plans to cut 12,000 jobs over the next two years, or about 10 
percent of its work force. A large part of the job cuts will come 
from restructuring the group's U.S. operations, said Chairman Serge 
Tchuruk. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel declined to provide further details on where the job  
cuts will come, saying only that the company plans to reduce staff 
in the United States and Europe through layoffs, voluntary 
departures and subcontracting business. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials noted, however, that labor laws in the United  
States make it easier to reduce staff levels there than in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Halbron noted, for example,  
its U.S. subsidiary DSC Communications has cut 1,000 jobs since 
Alcatel acquired it last September. Another 700 employees are 
expected to leave in 1999, Halbron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel has a total of 10,000 employees in the United States, at  
telecommunications and internet technology operations throughout 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the cuts, Alcatel will fail to meet an operating  
profit target of 8 percent of revenues this year, Tchuruk said at a 
news conference Thursday. Instead, he said he expects operating 
profit margins of 7 percent, compared to 4 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Tchuruk said the 10 percent staff reduction in 1999 and 2000  
would save 300 million euros, or $327 million, a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel cut 770 jobs in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Halbron said the company's telecom activities should post a 40  
percent rise in operating profit in 1999 from 575 million euros in 
1998, while the cables and components division should show a steady 
performance after turning in operating profits of 426 million euros 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, French steelmaker Usinor said it would shed  
3,000 jobs over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Francis Mer said the company will look at ``all  
available options'' for reducing its work force. He added that 
1,500 jobs will be cut in 1999 and the remaining 1,500 over 2000 
and 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Usinor is in the midst of a restructuring plan started this  
year.

<HEADLINE> Atom Laser Invented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have invented a device that shoots  
streams of atoms in any direction the same way that a laser sends 
out beams of light. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough, made possible by nudging super-cold,  
super-slow atoms into a beam, could lead to a revolutionary new 
tool for making extremely small computer chips, said William D. 
Phillips, who led a federal team that developed the device. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the work appears Friday in the journal Science.  
</P>
<P>
	``An optical laser works by sending out a very narrow beam of  
photons (light elements),'' Phillips said. ``An atom laser works 
like a light laser, except it is sending out atoms instead of 
photons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concept may hint at the legendary atomic ray gun of science  
fiction, but Phillips said there's no obvious weapons use. 
</P>
<P>
	However, just as when the optical laser was invented 40 years  
ago, the potential applications of an atom laser may not yet be 
apparent, said Phillips, a Nobel laureate who works for the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The more immediate use would be to create measuring and  
navigation devices that could be up to 10 times more precise than 
the optical laser systems now in use, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology first  
developed an atom laser in 1997, but the technique used there only 
permitted the atoms to spill downward, in response to gravity. 
Instead of a narrow beam, the atom laser was like a dripping blob. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' approach has the advantage of making a more narrow  
beam and of being able to point it in any direction, said Wolfgang 
Ketterle, a leader of the MIT team. 
</P>
<P>
	The atom lasers originate with a concept first conceived 70  
years ago by Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The famed physicist suggested that matter would reach a bizarre  
state if all the atomic motion, or natural vibration, in a cloud of 
atoms could be brought to a near standstill. The lack of motion 
causes the matter to become extremely cold -- almost to absolute 
zero -- and the atoms to link up in a lock-stepped single unit. It's 
rather like arranging a jumble of identical books into a neat, 
perfectly aligned stack. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Colorado researchers proved the theory correct by using  
magnetic fields to still a cloud of atoms and produce what is known 
now as a Bose-Einstein condensate. Researchers quickly realized 
that if the perfectly aligned atoms could be moved as a coherent 
unit, they would form an atom laser, just as perfectly aligned 
photons can form optical lasers. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' team created a Bose-Einstein condensate using sodium  
and then hit the frozen cloud with two pulsing light lasers of 
slightly different frequencies. The different frequencies caused 
the sodium atoms to escape from the condensate and move outward in 
a coherent beam. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said his group advanced the MIT work, which he called a  
``landmark experiment,'' by learning how to use the laser beams to 
accelerate atoms to a speed of about 2 1/2 inches a second. This is 
enough to make the beam multidirectional. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet unlike a light laser, the atom laser works only if it is  
shooting into a vacuum, said Phillips. If it is shot into the 
atmosphere, the atom laser would break up because the atoms in the 
beam would encounter the atoms in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The atom laser may one day be used to build extremely small  
computer chips. Eventually it may even be possible to construct 
devices one atom at a time, Phillips said.

<HEADLINE> Wheelchair Mom Found Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A mother who gets around town in a  
wheelchair with her young daughter strapped to her lap was found 
innocent Thursday of endangering the girl by sometimes wheeling 
around in city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Dillery, who has muscular dystrophy, could have been  
sentenced to up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine on the 
misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery, 30, hugged her lawyers and wiped away tears as  
relatives rushed from their seats to hug her after the verdict was 
announced. Her supporters cheered and screamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the verdict, she said she was ``just looking  
forward to being with Kelsi,'' her 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was charged with child endangering after a driver  
told police last July that her daughter, Kelsi, then 4, had hit her 
head on the mirror of a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Rob DeLamatre said Ms. Dillery was putting Kelsi in  
danger by strapping her on her lap. Police have tried to cooperate 
with Ms. Dillery and suggested alternative ways of travel, but she 
continues to ride in the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery refused a plea offer, prosecutors said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery says she sometimes must travel in the street because  
some of the city's sidewalks aren't accessible to her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Disability rights activists say her case shows the barriers they  
face every day. Supporters of Ms. Dillery -- some who also must use 
wheelchairs -- attended the trial in this city between Toledo and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney K. Ronald Bailey said there was no evidence  
that Ms. Dillery's conduct was reckless and that city and police 
officials have no idea what it's like to be in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've never sat in the seat of a wheelchair, but they can  
tell you what it must be like,'' Bailey told the jury in closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	He called no witnesses in the trial. ``We don't think they made  
their case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLamatre said the case needed to be tried. ``This has all been  
about safety,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was convicted in January of using her wheelchair in  
a street on a different occasion. She was ordered to pay $100 in 
fines and court costs on a charge of being a pedestrian in the 
street.

<HEADLINE> New Fighting Breaks Out in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- New fighting broke out in southern  
Kosovo today, a day after a top U.S. envoy failed to persuade 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a Western-backed 
settlement for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav and Serbian forces descended on the southwest town of  
Prizren and new skirmishes were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been some fighting, and there might be more  
coming,'' Dieter Wolf, a monitor with the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe said, speaking via telephone from the 
town. There were no immediate details on the buildup and intensity 
of combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fighting -- and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's failure to  
convince Milosevic to accept foreign troops in the rebellious 
province in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia -- cast doubt on the 
chances of success at new peace talks scheduled for Monday in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands  
driven from their homes in a year of fighting in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was to return to Washington today to brief the Clinton  
administration on the standoff. It was unclear whether he would be 
returning to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO threat to strike Yugoslav and Serbian targets stands in  
case the ethnic Albanians sign a peace plan and Milosevic does not. 
But Holbrooke was low-key today ahead of a meeting in Belgrade with 
ambassadors of the six-nation Contact Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to go around rattling rockets and making  
threatening gestures,'' he said. ``Our positions are clear and 
President Milosevic knows them, and we will be in continuing 
contact with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the continued fighting was not a direct threat to  
the upcoming talks, saying: ``That's fairly traditional preceding 
negotiations and during them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International mediation efforts were to continue today with  
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was uncertain whether Russia, despite its close ties to  
the Serbs, would be more successful in convincing Milosevic. Russia 
has consistently maintained that any peace agreement respect 
Yugoslav sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting from Moscow, the Interfax news agency cited Ivanov as  
saying the Kosovo conflict must be resolved peacefully -- 
effectively repeating Russian opposition to the NATO threat of 
airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has consistently taken Milosevic's side in the conflict.  
Ivanov has said that Russia would consider sending peacekeeping 
troops to Kosovo, but repeated Wednesday that it would only do so 
with Milosevic's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's fighting follows violence Wednesday that left at least  
four villages in flames and sent hundreds of ethnic Albanians 
fleeing the border area near Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	A moderate ethnic Albanian politician, Fehmi Agani, said the  
Kosovo Albanians may not even show up for Monday's peace talks 
unless the Serbs appear ready to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, European Union envoy Wolfgang Petrisch said the talks  
would go ahead, ``concentrating on the implementation issue'' -- 
shorthand for NATO deployment to police the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks in Rambouillet, France, were suspended Feb. 23 after  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to win either Serb or 
ethnic Albanian approval for the plan, which provides for autonomy 
but not independence for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the ethnic Albanians signing on to the agreement, NATO  
cannot carry out threatened airstrikes on Serb targets to force 
Milosevic to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued after the talks, Milosevic said the peace  
plan is ``a good basis'' for a political settlement of the Kosovo 
crisis. But he continued to reject the deployment of NATO troops to 
police it. 
</P>
<P>
	His government-run television denounced U.S. policies as  
``aggressive'' and called for the defense of Kosovo whatever the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S-sponsored deal calls for 28,000 NATO troops -- including  
4,000 Americans -- to police a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for American troops to take part in the mission has  
also led to resistance in Congress, which is not eager to approve 
another Balkan operation in addition to one in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives scheduled a debate for today on  
whether U.S. troops should be sent to Kosovo. A Senate vote on the 
same issue could come as early as next week.

<HEADLINE> Lands' End Earnings Down 38 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DODGEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Lands' End Inc.'s fourth-quarter  
earnings fell 38 percent from a year ago, as the catalog giant 
continues to struggle to get its business back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgeville, Wis.-based company said Thursday that it earned  
$25.69 million, or 84 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 29, 
compared with $41.25 million, or $1.32 a share, in the same period 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results include a $7 million restructuring charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $541.17 million, up from $480.42 million last year.  
The company said the increase in sales was primarily due to 
additional catalogs and pages mailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the core catalog, which represents about 60 percent of  
its total sales, were down from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet sales, however, more than tripled from a year ago to  
$61 million. Lands' End said it had 15 million visits to its site 
last year and 20 percent of its customers were new to Lands' End. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company's results were below Wall Street analysts'  
expectations, its stock rose on the Internet news, gaining $3.75, 
or 12 percent, to close at $34.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Lands' End is in the midst of restructuring its business to  
boost sales and profits. In the last six months, the catalog 
retailer has pushed out its chief executive and head of sales, cut 
more than 10 percent of its salaried employees and closed three 
outlet stores. 
</P>
<P>
	President and chief executive David Dyer said that Lands' End  
next fall will reduce the number of catalogs and pages it sends 
out. In addition, the company will begin to mail fewer catalogs to 
those shoppers who prefer shopping online. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made much progress in this past quarter, especially in  
getting our inventory more closely aligned with sales, 
restructuring our organization into functional operating units and 
putting people in key leadership roles,'' Dyer said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Lands' End earned $31.18 million, or $1.01 a  
share, compared with $64.15 million, or $2 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $1.37 billion, up from $1.26 billion.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura's Wife Is Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The wife of Gov. Jesse Ventura is ill and  
has been told by her doctor to do nothing for a month, the 
governor's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not feeling well and she is sick,'' governor's  
spokeswoman Erika Carter said of Terry Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter refused to elaborate on the nature of the illness.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura told The Free Press of Mankato on Wednesday that Mrs.  
Ventura, was under stress from doing two jobs. In addition to her 
duties as first lady, Mrs. Ventura runs a horse-training business 
at the family's 32-acre ranch in Maple Grove, northwest of 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his election, the governor has argued his wife should be  
paid for the tasks associated with her work as first lady, 
including supervising the governor's St. Paul residence.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Funeral To Be Quiet Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Across the street, in Washington Square,  
scaffolding was built for TV cameras, and barriers were set up to 
block access to Sts. Peter and Paul Church for Joe DiMaggio's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	In the church, where DiMaggio received his first communion and  
married his first wife, there was a feeling of serenity. And that's 
exactly the atmosphere the Yankee Clipper requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, whose twin steeples tower over the North Beach  
neighborhood in which DiMaggio spent most of his childhood, was to 
be closed to the public today as Father Armand Oliveri led the 
service for DiMaggio, who died Monday at his Florida home at the 
age of 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri, 79, who had known DiMaggio since the two grew up  
together in North Beach, said the service was a regular funeral 
Mass, including Psalm 23 as well as readings from both the Old and 
New Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominick DiMaggio, Joe's younger brother and a fellow major  
leaguer, was to give the eulogy. Oliveri said there would only be 
about 40 people attending the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they wanted it to be family, and that was about  
it,'' Oliveri said. ``Perhaps some close friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ornate church, dark and solemn despite the light filtering  
through its stained-glass windows, has been visited by President 
Lyndon Johnson and Vice President Walter Mondale. It also was the 
site of funeral services for former San Francisco Mayor Joseph 
Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications at the church entrance Wednesday that  
a dignitary was about to be eulogized there. There was no mention 
of DiMaggio on a bulletin board announcing the times for Masses in 
English, Italian and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside Sts. Peter and Paul, secretary Aurora Piazza leafed  
through a church book to a two-page spread of DiMaggio and actress 
Dorothy Arnold from their wedding on Nov. 19, 1939. Piazza, who 
grew up in North Beach, waited outside the church on that autumn 
day 60 years ago to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi, who will be joined by two singers for  
the funeral service, was preparing ``Amazing Grace'' and Schubert's 
``Ave Maria'' among five musical works requested by the DiMaggio 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's estranged son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., was to be  
one of the pallbearers carrying the casket from the church after 
the service. The funeral procession was set to pass DiMaggio's 
former home on Beach Street on its way to Holy Cross Cemetery in 
nearly Colma. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jr., who had not talked with his dad in two years, was  
DiMaggio's only child. His mother was Dorothy Arnold, whom DiMaggio 
divorced in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in 1954 and they 
divorced later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone disputed that Steinbrenner wasn't  
invited, saying the Yankees owner was asked to accompany the family 
to the West Coast. Cerrone said Steinbrenner declined the 
invitation because he didn't want an exception to the guest list 
made in his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was one more person outside the family to be there,  
Joe would have wanted George Steinbrenner,'' Engelberg said 
Wednesday. ``He really loved George, and said he was one of the 
most humane people he knew. I agree. But the family had to say, and 
reluctantly so, no one else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years, 
and Engelberg.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Chief Shaping Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mitt Romney, the new chief executive of  
the committee planning the 2002 Winter Games, is slicing $84 
million in frills and pageantry out of the budget, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first meeting with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's  
management board on Thursday, Romney said he has imposed a hiring 
freeze, plans fewer and less elaborate hospitality suites and will 
give away fewer tickets during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's no more free lunch for the board.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will treat you all to pizza today,'' Romney told the  
management committee, which hired him last month amid a 
reorganization prompted by Salt Lake's role in the Olympics' 
biggest corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But from now on board trustees will have to buy their own  
lunches for meetings, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of a plan to cut all spending that doesn't have to do  
with staging great games for the athletes, Romney said. ``Olympic 
sport and the athletes come first,'' he said. ``Profit, pride and 
pageantry come second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he is confident new sponsors will line up to finance  
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of sponsors that are willing to sign on,'' he said. And  
he said that Salt Lake already has commitments for more sponsor 
support than Atlanta had by the time it staged its more expensive 
1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he acknowledged to reporters after the management board's  
meeting, which included three hours in executive session, that 
uncertainty about scandal-wary sponsors warrants careful scrutiny 
of the budget and extra marketing of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to pull out all the stops,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The cuts also are required by higher costs and mistakes made  
when the budget was written last year, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Staffers wrongly assumed federal funding would cover $41 million  
in expenses that the SLOC instead will be responsible for, Romney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer hardware, software and timing aspects of the games  
are now expected to cost $25 million more than budgeted, bringing 
the total to what Romney called an astonishing $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC will need to spend $9 million more on legal fees and  
marketing, mostly because of the scandal, and Romney's figures also 
include $5 million for a medal plaza, an expense the SLOC had 
previously expected a sponsor to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he added $1 million more to the budget for new  
sports the SLOC will propose adding to the Winter Games. There has 
been talk of adding skeleton -- a kind of headfirst bobsledding -- 
women's bobsled, and more snowboarding and cross-country skiing 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The net effect of the changes was to reduce the SLOC's overall  
budget by $17 million to $1.436 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he continues to scour the budget for excesses, and  
will operate under his new plan until the board of trustees acts to 
revise the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items targeted for lower spending are furniture in the  
athletes' Olympic Village rooms; food service; Olympic decorations 
of the city and sports venues; publications; a memorial plaza to 
honor athletes and donors; staff travel; and bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney also described some $67 million in new revenue he would  
like to go after, including charging a fee for making hotel 
reservations for those in the Olympic community; donations from the 
federations of new sports added to the games; charging for events 
that would have been free; and hitting up private foundations and 
even the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business, the management board directed the ad hoc  
committee working on open meetings, records and 
conflict-of-interest policies to come up with proposals more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the closed executive session they discussed ways to  
improve communication between board members and the executives 
running the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney also fielded a bit of criticism in the open meeting, when  
trustee John Price said he was peeved to have no advance knowledge 
when the SLOC hired senior executives this week and signed a $5 
million public relations contract two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You made major decisions in three weeks that the management  
committee knew nothing of. I had to read it in the papers,'' Price 
told Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney agreed the communication has been poor and said he has  
plans to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee that preceded the SLOC in winning the 2002  
Winter Games has been accused by investigators of unethically 
spending $1.2 million to woo the votes of International Olympic 
Committee members. The U.S. Justice Department continues to look 
into whether laws were broken.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota To Investigate Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The University of Minnesota raced to investigate  
a report that a former employee wrote papers, did take-home exams 
and other course work for 20 men's basketball players over the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The university was trying to determine whether four players --  
including two starters -- were eligible for today's game against 
Gonzaga in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players -- Kevin Clark, Miles Tarver, Antoine Broxsie  
and Jason Stanford -- declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice president of  
institutional relations, said the players could be ruled ineligible 
but reinstated pending the outcome of an investigation. An NCAA 
spokeswoman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Four former players told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press that work  
was prepared for them, a possible violation of the student code of 
conduct and NCAA regulations. Another former player, Trevor Winter, 
who now plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves, said he was aware of 
the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' said Russ Archambault, one  
of the former players who acknowledged that Jan Gangelhoff, the 
former office manager in the academic counseling unit, did work for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to make jokes about it. ... I would go over there some  
nights and get like four papers done. The coaches would be laughing 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins said Wednesday that he planned to discuss the  
allegations ``when the season's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage we're here to play basketball,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she was taken on two of the team's road trips,  
including one to Hawaii, and considered it compensation for the 
work. She said she never was asked by coaches to do work for 
players, though she said Haskins once paid her $3,000 in cash to 
tutor a player. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Mark Yudof said Haskins denied the  
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disturbed by the allegations,'' Yudof said. ``My  
reaction was a great deal of sadness and worry, but I also have a 
lot of respect for Clem Haskins and for our program and I think we 
shouldn't jump to conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Jackson, another former player who also plays for the  
Timberwolves, said Gangelhoff mostly just typed his papers. That 
also is a possible violation of National Collegiate Athletic 
Association rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Two players denied Gangelhoff did their course work, the Pioneer  
Press reported Wednesday. Five others refused comment; seven could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, 50, estimated that from 1993 to 1998 she did more  
than 400 pieces of course work for players, including some starters 
on the 1996-97 Final Four team. She gave the Pioneer Press computer 
files containing examples of course work she said she wrote and 
players turned in. Some of the papers had grades and instructor's 
comments written on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bring in these high-risk kids, and they know that  
everything they did in high school was done for them,'' Gangelhoff 
said. ``It's got to stop somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elayne Donahue, the retired head of the academic counseling  
unit, said she was unaware of any fraud. But Ms. Donahue said she 
was ignored when she warned athletic department administrators that 
Gangelhoff was tutoring players in violation of department policy.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Belle Goes Ballistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Albert Belle ended his calm,  
uneventful spring training Thursday with a tirade in the Baltimore 
Orioles clubhouse in which he angrily threw his glove, two bats and 
his helmet into his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle also scattered several letters that were sitting on his  
chair. He then quickly undressed, showered and stormed out of the 
clubhouse without exchanging a word with any of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The tirade occurred after a questionable third-strike call in  
the sixth inning of the Orioles' 4-2 exhibition victory over the 
New York Mets. The strikeout ended an 0-for-3 day that left him at 
3-for-13 (.231) this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year contract with the Orioles on Dec.  
1, had been quite civil during spring training despite his 
well-documented confrontations with fans, umpires and opposing 
ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after arriving early to camp in February, Belle  
addressed the media twice in three days. He also made a point of 
signing dozens of autographs before and after the Orioles' 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed autographs before Thursday's game, too.  
</P>
<P>
	But the dormant volcano finally erupted after a check-swing  
strikeout against Greg McMichael. On his way to the clubhouse, 
Belle muttered to himself as he stormed past players in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	He then shattered one of his bats during the tirade, which  
occurred in front of a few teammates and a handful of reporters 
waiting to talk to pitcher Mike Mussina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just mad at himself, just like when he gets mad at  
people when they ask him questions,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``It 
shows me he wants to hit and that he demands excellence from 
himself. There's nothing wrong with that; I just told (clubhouse 
attendant) Jimmy Tyler to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles reliever Jesse Orosco, who was in the clubhouse at the  
time, avoided Belle before walking back onto the field. Orosco 
later said the demonstration was simply a prime example of Belle's 
competitive nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took an oh-fer. As long as he doesn't hurt anybody, no  
problem,'' Orosco said. ``He wants to perform well in every game, 
even in the spring. That's just the type of intensity he takes the 
ballpark. I think he figures the only way he can get tuned up for 
the regular season is by playing every game as if it means 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the Orioles announced they no longer will open  
the clubhouse to reporters while exhibition games are in progress.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Fast-Food Giant Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Seven-year-old Sharimee Cerilo's  
relatives showed her some of Manila's most famous sights during her 
recent visit from the countryside. But when she returned home, the 
first thing she rushed to tell her friends was, ``I got to eat at 
Jollibee!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine fast-food chain's mix of local flavors,  
aggressive advertising, reasonable prices and perky 
orange-and-yellow honeybee trademark have made it one of the 
country's most recognized brands. 
</P>
<P>
	It has brushed aside U.S. fast-food chains to become the  
undisputed market leader, forcing even McDonald's to swallow its 
pride and offer chicken and rice breakfasts and sweet spaghetti to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	While other Asian companies have been struggling to survive the  
region's financial crisis, Jollibee's profits and market share have 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
	It says it now controls 52 percent of the Philippine fast-food  
market with 302 outlets, beating McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken 
and Wendy's combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it reported a net income of $22.2 million, a 32  
percent rise from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	After first venturing outside the country in 1985, Jollibee now  
has 27 stores in 10 countries, including one U.S. outlet in Daly 
City, California. Most are in areas with large numbers of overseas 
Filipino workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Daly City outlet since it opened last year  
has encouraged Jollibee to open six more outlets on the West Coast 
in 1999, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	Manolo Tingzon, general manager of Jollibee's international  
division, said it has been swamped with applications to open 
franchises or joint ventures in New York, New Jersey, Texas and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	One group of businessmen has asked for an exclusive franchise  
for the state of Hawaii, but Jollibee is holding off for the 
moment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow ourselves to be swept away by the wave of  
applications, maybe next year we will be on the East Coast, but we 
want to do it slowly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new stores this year are to be in California's Union City,  
San Jose, San Francisco, Vallejo, and Greater Los Angeles -- all 
places with large Filipino-American communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign operations currently account for about 5 percent of the  
company's gross revenues, but company officials hope they will 
eventually increase to at least 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jollibee's overseas push hasn't been without problems.  
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, which was hard hit by Asia's currency crisis,  
Jollibee found itself stuck with five stores and canceled plans to 
open five more last year. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope, Jollibee lowered prices, modified its products and  
moved from one supplier to another as the price of imported beef 
and chicken rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unstable, really unstable,'' Tingzon said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company was able to maintain its customer base, and sales in  
rupiah terms even rose 35 percent, but because of the devaluation 
of the Indonesian currency the company suffered a drop in profits.

	In the Philippines, Jollibee's success depends largely on its  
localized menu, which includes sweet Philippine-style spaghetti 
topped with chopped hotdogs, peach-mango pies, burgers with a slab 
of pineapple and bacon, and noodles with a sauce of pork rind and 
shredded smoked fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts question whether that recipe for success can translate  
overseas beyond local Filipino communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success factor for Jollibee in the Philippines is they  
know the 'mouths' of Filipinos,'' says Mike Gotera, an analyst for 
DBP Daiwa Securities. ``It's too early to say if they can duplicate 
that outside the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Daly City outlet, nearly 100 percent of the customers  
initially were Filipinos, but that has now dipped to about 80 
percent, Tingzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jollibee says it is keeping its core menu of burgers, fried  
chicken and Philippine-style spaghetti at overseas outlets but 
adjusting its ``taste profile.'' In Brunei, for example, the 
chicken sauce is a little more spicy. The name ``hamburger'' has 
been changed to ``beef burger'' in Muslim areas, and in Indonesia 
the company has adopted ``nasi lemak,'' a local rice and chicken 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they do succeed in this strategy, then any country is open  
to them,'' Gotera says.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Lends Confidence to Penn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- When your name is Michael Jordan, you'd better be  
good. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn guard Michael Jordan is, and so is the confident Quakers  
team he leads into tonight's first-round NCAA tournament game 
against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we can play with anyone in the nation,''  
Penn's Paul Romanczuk said, ``and we hope to prove that in this 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan seems to wear his famous name with ease, shrugging off  
the wisecracks he has heard since the day he took his first jump 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been dealing with it for a long time, ever since I  
started playing,'' he said. ``I just take the good with the bad. 
The good is, I get to come here. I get a lot of press. I get a lot 
of publicity. ... The bad is the heckles. People look me up on the 
internet just to talk trash. It's funny, though, and you have to 
sit back and laugh at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody who has seen Jordan play laughs anymore. He is first-team  
all-Ivy League and a first-team Big 5 selection (the all-star team 
for Philadelphia's five major basketball schools). 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan is as good as any guard we have gone against,''  
Florida coach Billy Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody, of course, would say this MJ is anywhere near as good as  
the other one. But he is plenty good in the Ivy League, where the 
tuition and the academic requirements are steep. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Fran Dunphy describes his star in terms that would  
perfectly fit Jordan's more famous namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is as fine a player as we have had, in all  
honesty,'' Dunphy said. ``In 1995, we had two players who went to 
the NBA. Michael is in that category. He is very good defensively. 
He is an outstanding scorer and yet is unselfish at many things he 
does. He makes people around him better, and the best thing is his 
competitiveness. He just refuses to lose and hates to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who was third in the Ivy League in scoring (15.3 points)  
and second in assists (131), directs a Penn team that does not fit 
the common perception of the Ivy League, a stereotype built on the 
years of seeing Princeton's methodical, deliberate style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Princeton has everybody mystified,'' Jordan said. ``We're  
totally the opposite. We like to get up and down. We like to shoot 
the 3. A lot of people look at the Ivy League and they think `These 
guys aren't athletic.' But we're just as athletic as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Penn strolled through the Ivy League without adversity.  
On Feb. 9, the Quakers experienced one of the worst collapses since 
the stock market crash of 1927. Playing at home against Princeton, 
Penn led 40-13 with 15 minutes to play -- and lost 50-49. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the beginning of the end, it proved to be a new  
beginning. The Quakers won seven of their remaining eight, 
including a regular season-ending 73-48 romp at Princeton, to earn 
the league title and No. 11 seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn (23-5) will need all of its athletic skill and all of its  
Ivy League smarts against the high-octane attack of Florida (20-8), 
the No. 5 seed. The Quakers are not quaking at the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Florida is going to be a good matchup for us,''  
Romanczuk said. ``We watched some film on them and it appears that 
they're a perimeter-oriented team who likes to press a little bit, 
force some turnovers, and capitalize on that by shooting 3's, not 
so much different from our team. We like to shoot a lot of 3's as 
well. We like to think that we have a more balanced attack, and 
hopefully we can take advantage of that.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's schools would get greater freedom  
in how they spend federal education money under measures passed 
Thursday by the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill -- in a move that angered some Democrats who  
nevertheless voted for the measure -- contained a provision that 
would allow states to shift money slated for President Clinton's 
new-teachers plan to special education instead, possibly affecting 
checks heading out this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have chosen the path of partisanship and  
division,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a telephone 
interview. She was out of town due to the death of her 
father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 98-1. Sen. Paul  
Wellstone, D-Minn., a vocal opponent of the bill, cast the lone 
vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The House vote was 330-90.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``ed-flex'' bills would let states and school districts  
apply money for certain federal programs to other programs that 
serve their students best. For example, schools could use federal 
money meant for science and math teachers to boost reading 
instruction, if that's what they need. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills, the first education measures of this Congress,  
initially enjoyed strong bipartisan support but quickly became a 
battleground for each party's efforts to put its own mark on the 
nation's education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had wanted the measure to include Clinton's education  
proposals, chiefly more money to help schools hire new teachers. 
But Republicans insisted those proposals should be raised later in 
the year and not bog down the ``ed-flex'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In last fall's spending bill, Congress in a compromise approved  
$1.2 billion to help schools hire about 30,000 new teachers in the 
early grades. Clinton wants a total of 100,000 new teachers hired 
over seven years at a cost of more than $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	After a weeklong deadlock, Senate leaders agreed to allow votes  
on the Democratic class-size proposals, only to shoot them down. 
The defeats included Murray's proposal to pay for another year of 
the Clinton new-teachers plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican amendment that passed would allow states to shift  
the new-teacher money that's already been approved to federal 
special education funding, which Republicans contend falls short of 
what the law allows. 
</P>
<P>
	States say the federal government, which dictates the rules  
states must follow on special education, provides only 7 percent to 
12 percent of the costs for those programs. The special education 
law allows for the federal government to contribute a maximum of 40 
percent of a state's special education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge applauded the ed-flex  
bill and special education funding move, saying his state would get 
about $600 million for federal special education instead of the 
$150 million it now gets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then there would be a huge amount to hire teachers, for after  
school programs and for dropout programs,'' Ridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stopped short of vowing to veto the legislation, but he  
promised to work to eliminate the special education funding 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate ... passed an amendment that would allow local  
school districts to completely opt out of class size reduction,'' 
Clinton said in a statement. ``The Senate used this bill to 
undermine one of our most important educational achievements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators said Congress should wait for the upcoming  
appropriations to increase special education financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a false choice, said Bob Chase, president of the National  
Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union. ``Both 
Democrats and Republicans would like to see more special education 
funding. But it should be straight funding and not dollars already 
allocated for class-size reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate negotiators will have to work out differences  
between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still time to improve the bill before it goes to the  
President,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who voted for 
the ed-flex bill despite his opposition to the amendments. ``I 
would do all I can to delete (the special education funding) 
amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Republican majority also voted down two  
Democratic amendments, and Democrats ran out of time in their 
attempts to offer more, including the new-teachers proposal. The 
House bill did not include money for special education. 
</P>
<P>
	The ed-flex bill affects some of the rules governing the $15  
billion in annual federal education spending for kindergarten 
through high school. Laws already prohibit states from waiving 
rules regarding a school's safety, maintenance, students' civil 
rights and instruction of special education students. States often 
view these rules as the most expensive and time-consuming to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed two Republican amendments designed to require  
states to show better proof that they are meeting students' needs 
under their waivers even when ed-flex becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is S 280. The House bill is HR 800.

	House OKs Clinton Kosovo Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a contentious debate, the House voted  
bipartisan support late today for President Clinton's Kosovo 
policy, turning back a GOP-led effort to oppose sending U.S. troops 
there as peacekeepers. Clinton had warned that such a restriction, 
even though nonbinding, could have jeopardized already-endangered 
peace talks due to resume in Paris on Monday. On a 237 to 178 vote, 
the House first turned aside a proposal by Rep. Tillie Fowler, 
R-Fla., to protest any American troop engagement in the war-torn 
Serbian province.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. agreed today to pay $63.5  
million in fines to settle charges that it boosted its financial 
performance by unlawfully diverting millions of dollars from 
unclaimed customer accounts into its own coffers. The settlement 
will not affect Bankers Trust's planned merger with Deutsche Bank 
AG, both banks said in a statement. The plea brought a speedy 
resolution to accusations that the bank made false entries in its 
books to conceal the true source of $19.1 million its employees 
diverted.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield, Lewis Rhetoric Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis sees Evander Holyfield as being at  
the top of a mountain he must be knocked off if Lewis is to make a 
lasting mark in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't place Lewis on such a high plateau.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox Lewis is just a bump in the road I have to get past,''  
Holyfield said. ``No (one) man can define my career. My career is 
built on all the things I've had to go through and all the people I 
had to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, uncharacteristically, has said he will knock out  
Lewis in the third round. The WBA-IBF champion said it's not a 
prediction, but the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	He will get a chance to put his fists where his mouth is when he  
and Lewis, the WBC champion, fight Saturday night for the 
undisputed heavyweight title before a sellout crowd of more than 
20,000 in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Holyfield win, he would join Muhammad Ali as the only  
three-time undisputed heavyweight champion. Even should the winner 
not be considered champion by several fringe sanctioning 
organizations, there would be no doubt he would be the world's 
premier heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, the 36-year-old Holyfield's place in boxing legend  
is secure. He was an undisputed cruiserweight champion who overcame 
charges he was a blown-up heavyweight. He also has beaten such 
marquee fighters as George Foreman, Larry Holmes and Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case, however, for the 33-year-old Lewis, who  
feels he hasn't gotten his due, especially from boxing media and 
fans in the United States, despite only one loss in 35 fights. His 
best performance, a one-round knockout over Andrew Golota Oct. 4, 
1997, was too short and too easy to satisfy his critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very important fight for me,'' Lewis said. ``It's a  
defining fight for me. I just want to showcase myself and prove to 
the world I'm the best fighter on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, feels Lewis needs to win  
impressively. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight is everything for him,'' Steward said. ``His whole  
career will be defined on that night. If he doesn't win and win 
aggressively, he'll never be a great fighter or even a good 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steward trained Oliver McCall when McCall knocked out Lewis in  
the second round Sept. 24, 1994, and he trained Holyfield when he 
outpointed Riddick Bowe Nov. 6. 1993. He has been with Lewis for 
his nine fights since the loss to McCall. Don Turner trains 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't think Steward's knowledge of him will help  
Lewis. ``He's not going to get in the ring,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward wasn't with Holyfield when he was stopped by Bowe in the  
eighth round Nov. 4, 1996. It was Holyfield's second loss in three 
fights against the 6-foot-5 Bowe, who weighed 235, 246 and 240 
pounds for those bouts. Holyfield's weights were 205, 217 and 213 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bowe is the most talented big guy I've fought,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lewis still has to prove his ability to Holyfield, he is  
as big as Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-5 Lewis weighed in officially Thursday at 246 pounds,  
three more than for his previous fight, for the 12-round 
pay-per-view bout expected to start between 11:15 p.m. and 11:3O 
p.m. EST. Holyfield weighed 215 pounds, two less than his last 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``With his size, I can't see anybody outboxing Lennox Lewis,''  
Steward said. ``So Evander Holyfield is going to have to work 
inside. It's very hard to put pressure on the big man. Lennox is 
not just tall, he's strong. There's a difference between being tall 
and being big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to get inside first,'' Lewis said. ``I don't think I'm  
going to allow him to get inside and do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis doesn't appear to be as good a technician as Bowe, but he  
might be stronger and he probably hits harder, especially with his 
right hand. He has 27 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has 26 knockout wins on his 36-3 record, and while he  
knocked out Buster Douglas with a single right, many of his wins 
inside the distance have resulted from attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is expected to come out firing because Lewis has had  
trouble in the early rounds. There was the second-round knockout by 
McCall, and he was in serious trouble in the first round against 
Shannon Briggs last March 28. Briggs' inexperience allowed Lewis to 
get off the hook and eventually stop Briggs in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people question Lewis' stamina, but Holyfield has said the  
fight won't last long enough for it to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A question asked of Holyfield will be, has he at age 36 suddenly  
become an old fighter? 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is guaranteed $20 million, while Lewis' purse is $10  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be two other championship bouts on the card.  
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Vargas (15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will  
defend the IBF junior middleweight title against Howard Clarke 
(26-10-2, eight knockouts) of England. 
</P>
<P>
	James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of Pittsburg, Calif., will  
defend the WBA welterweight title against Sam Garr (25-2, three 
knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.

	Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, feels Lewis needs to win  
impressively. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight is everything for him,'' Steward said. ``His whole  
career will be defined on that night. If he doesn't win and win 
aggressively, he'll never be a great fighter or even a good 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steward trained Oliver McCall when McCall knocked out Lewis in  
the second round Sept. 24, 1994, and he trained Holyfield when he 
outpointed Riddick Bowe Nov. 6. 1993. He has been with Lewis for 
his nine fights since the loss to McCall. Don Turner trains 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't think Steward's knowledge of him will help  
Lewis. ``He's not going to get in the ring,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward wasn't with Holyfield when he was stopped by Bowe in the  
eighth round Nov. 4, 1996. It was Holyfield's second loss in three 
fights against the 6-foot-5 Bowe, who weighed 235, 246 and 240 
pounds for those bouts. Holyfield's weights were 205, 217 and 213 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bowe is the most talented big guy I've fought,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lewis still has to prove his ability to Holyfield, he is  
as big as Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-5 Lewis weighed in officially Thursday at 246 pounds,  
three more than for his previous fight, for the 12-round 
pay-per-view bout expected to start between 11:15 p.m. and 11:3O 
p.m. EST. Holyfield weighed 215 pounds, two less than his last 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``With his size, I can't see anybody outboxing Lennox Lewis,''  
Steward said. ``So Evander Holyfield is going to have to work 
inside. It's very hard to put pressure on the big man. Lennox is 
not just tall, he's strong. There's a difference between being tall 
and being big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to get inside first,'' Lewis said. ``I don't think I'm  
going to allow him to get inside and do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis doesn't appear to be as good a technician as Bowe, but he  
might be stronger and he probably hits harder, especially with his 
right hand. He has 27 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has 26 knockout wins on his 36-3 record, and while he  
knocked out Buster Douglas with a single right, many of his wins 
inside the distance have resulted from attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is expected to come out firing because Lewis has had  
trouble in the early rounds. There was the second-round knockout by 
McCall, and he was in serious trouble in the first round against 
Shannon Briggs last March 28. Briggs' inexperience allowed Lewis to 
get off the hook and eventually stop Briggs in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people question Lewis' stamina, but Holyfield has said the  
fight won't last long enough for it to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A question asked of Holyfield will be, has he at age 36 suddenly  
become an old fighter? 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is guaranteed $20 million, while Lewis' purse is $10  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be two other championship bouts on the card.  
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Vargas (15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will  
defend the IBF junior middleweight title against Howard Clarke 
(26-10-2, eight knockouts) of England. 
</P>
<P>
	James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of Pittsburg, Calif., will  
defend the WBA welterweight title against Sam Garr (25-2, three 
knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust Agrees To Pay $63.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. agreed Thursday to pay $63.5  
million in fines to settle charges that it boosted its financial 
performance by unlawfully diverting millions of dollars from 
unclaimed customer accounts into its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will not affect Bankers Trust's planned merger  
with Deutsche Bank AG, both banks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea, entered by a bank lawyer before a federal judge,  
brought a speedy resolution to accusations that the bank made false 
entries in its books to conceal the true source of $19.1 million 
its employees diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust will pay a $60 million fine to federal authorities  
as well as a $3.5 million fine to the state of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In certain instances, these individuals acted contrary to the  
express legal advice of the bank's outside counsel,'' Bankers Trust 
lawyer David Daniel Brown IV told U.S. District Judge John G. 
Koeltl, reading from a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this group of employees included the senior manager  
and the controller of the business unit, the bank believes that a 
small number of ... employees were involved in the knowing 
falsification of the bank's records,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement that the bank  
initially minimized the extent of its officers' and employees' 
culpability. She said an investigation is still ongoing; Bankers 
Trust said it would continue to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that, because of pressure to meet revenue  
and expense targets, the bank's officers and employees stole the 
money and used it to pad Bankers Trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's employees then allegedly doctored the books to cover  
up the theft. Most of the wrongdoing allegedly occurred in the 
bank's Client Processing Services division. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea agreement, the bank agreed to fully restore to  
customers and various states all the money that was improperly 
recorded as income or reserves from 1986 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the bank reported the false record-keeping in March  
1996, as soon as workers not involved in the wrongdoing discovered 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank then substantially changed the management of  
the departments involved in the scheme and overhauled policies and 
procedures so unclaimed property could no longer be put in the 
bank's own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Newman, chairman and CEO of Bankers Trust, said separately  
that the settlement should not have a significant affect on the 
bank's future business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it is appropriate to put this three-year-old matter  
behind us as we near our merger with Deutsche Bank,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolf E. Breuer, a spokesman for the board of managing directors  
for Deutsche Bank, said Bankers Trust has already informed the 
German bank about the issue. ``We commend Bankers Trust for its 
actions to address this problem, and we welcome their decision to 
settle this matter now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breuer said the merger should be approved by the second quarter  
of 1999.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Flu-Related Deaths Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nation's slow-starting flu season has gotten  
worse, with 43 states reporting widespread or regional flu 
activity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last three weeks of February, pneumonia- and  
influenza-related deaths were slightly higher than expected, the 
CDC reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week ending Feb. 27, such deaths accounted for 8.1  
percent of the total deaths reported in 122 U.S. cities. The agency 
had expected a rate of 7.5 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have not yet seen the peak of influenza- or  
pneumonia-related deaths,'' said Dr. Carolyn Bridges of the CDC's 
Center for Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	An outbreak at a long-term care facility in Santa Clara County,  
Calif., sickened 60 workers and 37 residents, two of whom died, the 
CDC said, emphasizing the need for health care workers to get flu 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu contributes to the deaths of about 20,000 people in the  
United States each year. The CDC does not release the total number 
of flu deaths until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak of flu season usually extends from December to early  
March. The CDC keeps track of flu cases through the middle of May.

<HEADLINE>  L.A. Clippers Keep On Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Even Billy Crystal, their most famous  
fan, is having a rough time with this. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been exceptionally hard the last couple of years,'' the  
actor said from his courtside seat at the Sports Arena. ``The guys 
are great guys, I know a few of them. After a while, how much of 
this can you take?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows? The Los Angeles Clippers just keep on losing, with no  
end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	They suffered a 94-75 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at the  
Forum on Wednesday night for their 17th straight loss, matching the 
worst start to a season in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're one loss away from having the futility record all  
to themselves, and that could happen Thursday night if they lose to 
the much-improved Sacramento Kings at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rooting for them, I want them to win at least one game,''  
said Eileen Foster, who works in one of the Sports Arena's souvenir 
shops. ``I feel sorry for them. I can't believe they're so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, the Clippers were at home and lost to the  
Lakers 103-99. And most of the announced crowd of 13,380 seemed to 
be pulling for the Lakers. No great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have made the playoffs just three times since the  
1975-76 season, and have had just one winning season in the last 19 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering this season, they were 416-814 since moving to Los  
Angeles from San Diego in 1984. That's just a little more than one 
win in every three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dudas has been a season ticket-holder since 1989, and he's  
seen a lot of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans aren't rational,'' he said. ``There are a few of us,  
4,000 or 5,000 dedicated Clipper fans. They have to be dedicated to 
cheer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Clippers coach Chris Ford has tried to stay upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job to stay positive,'' Ford said. ``It's not easy.  
Winning's easy, losing's tough at any level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Darrick Martin said that for the franchise to change, the  
change must start at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got guys who don't know what's going on, who don't feel  
appreciated here,'' Martin said. ``Everyone wants to feel 
appreciated. I've talked to different guys on other teams who say 
when things are going bad, the general manager, the owner, come and 
talk to you. It hasn't happened here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does get frustrating at times. I don't like to lose. I've  
lost a lot of sleep over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he thinks Ford has handled things admirably.  
</P>
<P>
	``Me, I'd probably be throwing chairs right now if I coached the  
team,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor, a second-year forward who scored 24 points  
Tuesday night, recalled the Phoenix Suns of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix started 0-13 and made the playoffs,'' he said. ``I  
don't give up, not on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Lawler, the Clippers' play-by-play radio announcer, thinks  
the team will be helped by the move next fall to the new Staples 
Center, where the Lakers and NHL's Los Angeles Kings will also 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be easier to attract free agents, and the team  
will be well under the salary cap after this season,'' Lawler said. 
``It's absolutely there for the team this summer. I think it's 
going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does 20-year-old Lakers star Kobe Bryant -- at least at some  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 20-year career here, I'm sure they're going to have some  
pretty good teams,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the Clippers have been down for so long, Bryant  
needed some time to come up with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad luck,'' he said. ``A lot of bad luck.''

<HEADLINE>  Rice Says He'll Fit in With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Glen Rice says he's ready to hit the  
floor running despite not having played in a game since last 
season, and believes he'll fit in just fine with the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, who called  
Rice ``one of the great players in the NBA today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dapper in a dark blue suit, Rice met with the media Thursday at  
the Forum following his first practice with the Lakers, who 
acquired him a day earlier from Charlotte along with J.R. Reid and 
B.J. Armstrong, who was waived shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was absent from the news conference because he missed an  
airplane flight to California. West said Reid was expected to 
arrive later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both new players are expected to play for the Lakers on Friday  
night when the team risks a nine-game winning streak against Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets received guard Eddie Jones and forward-center Elden  
Campbell in the blockbuster deal on the eve of the NBA's trade 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I want to do is come here and fit in, help  
this team get to the next level,'' Rice said. ``Just as I expected, 
all the guys welcomed me with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to get this show on the road. We have all the  
pieces of the puzzle, now we have to go out there and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have changed their look substantially in the last two  
weeks, firing coach Del Harris and replacing him with Kurt Rambis; 
signing Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder in each of the 
last seven seasons; and now adding Rice and Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring us a dimension we haven't had here for a  
long, long time,'' West said of Rice. ``I've heard from a number of 
people in the NBA today who thought we did well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to play now, the elbow is 100 percent,'' he said.  
``I've been doing a lot of running, extra running as a matter of 
fact. I don't have time to get rusty, I've always been focused. 
Yeah, I haven't played in any games. (But) I don't think that will 
be a problem at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward acknowledged to be one of the NBA's most  
accurate long-range shooters, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. The three-time All-Star averaged 22.3 points last 
season to rank sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with  
Kobe Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice also figures to make life easier for center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely enough shots for everybody out there,''  
Rice said. ``I'm opening it up for Kobe and Shaq. A lot of people 
have been doubling (O'Neal). I don't know if they're going to want 
to continue doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he believes the Lakers (15-6) should now be  
considered the favorites to win their first NBA championship in 11 
years, Rice replied, ``I feel that way, yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it on paper, it has championship written all  
over it,'' he said of his new team. ``But you can't win on paper. 
You have to do it on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the time had come for him to leave the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had three great seasons there, I've got to thank them for  
that,'' he said. ``I'm a Laker. I've got to forget about Charlotte. 
It was something I wanted done. Things weren't going well for me in 
Charlotte. I'm glad that that's over with. I'm where I want to be. 
I'm ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why my last name's Rice, so we can get it cooking.''

be a problem at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward acknowledged to be one of the NBA's most  
accurate long-range shooters, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. The three-time All-Star averaged 22.3 points last 
season to rank sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with  
Kobe Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice also figures to make life easier for center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely enough shots for everybody out there,''  
Rice said. ``I'm opening it up for Kobe and Shaq. A lot of people 
have been doubling (O'Neal). I don't know if they're going to want 
to continue doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he believes the Lakers (15-6) should now be  
considered the favorites to win their first NBA championship in 11 
years, Rice replied, ``I feel that way, yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it on paper, it has championship written all  
over it,'' he said of his new team. ``But you can't win on paper. 
You have to do it on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the time had come for him to leave the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had three great seasons there, I've got to thank them for  
that,'' he said. ``I'm a Laker. I've got to forget about Charlotte. 
It was something I wanted done. Things weren't going well for me in 
Charlotte. I'm glad that that's over with. I'm where I want to be. 
I'm ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why my last name's Rice, so we can get it cooking.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs More Airport Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *House committee approves big boost in aviation spending    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to make flying safer and smoother, a  
House committee approved a big increase in airport spending 
Thursday while a Senate panel heard frustrated travelers demand 
better treatment from airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Transportation Committee, by a voice vote, passed a  
measure that would double funding for the Federal Aviation 
Administration over the next five years, to about $20 billion in 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill by Chairman Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., would find the  
additional money by separating the Aviation Trust Fund, which holds 
revenues from airport user taxes, from the general federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, which has its own FAA bill, opposes such a  
move because it would reduce the general budget's expected 
surpluses by billions of dollars in the coming years. But Shuster 
succeeded last year in protecting a similar highway trust fund from 
use by other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's bill also would try to increase competition to  
smaller, underserved airports through funding aid and increasing 
flights out of Chicago's O'Hare, New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy, 
and Washington's Reagan National. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would end caps on slots -- each equivalent to a  
takeoff and landing -- at the Chicago and New York airports by March 
1, 2000. Proponents contend the airports have the capacity, modern 
jets have lower noise levels and new flights would serve smaller 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington could get as many as six new slots for service to  
underserved airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., also  
has sought to help smaller markets hurt by airline deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's version of FAA reauthorization, which has cleared his  
committee, would open up the Chicago and New York airports and add 
48 slots at Washington, half of which would extend beyond the 
1,250-mile limit set in 1986 for flights from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reauthorize the FAA stalled last year when Rep. Henry  
Hyde, R-Ill., objected to increased flights at O'Hare. Other 
lawmakers worried about congestion at those major airports, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The House legislation also would let local authorities double  
passenger facility charges, now $3 at many airports. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase from $1.95 billion to $5 billion annually  
spending on the Airport Improvement Program, which pays to build 
runways and taxiways and deals with noise pollution. Hub airports 
dominated by one carrier would have to file competition plans 
before receiving more funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Current FAA funding expires March 31, but the House has approved  
a temporary six-month extension to give Shuster and McCain time to 
resolve differences in their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The two chairmen also have different, although largely  
compatible, bills on increasing the rights of airline passengers 
contending with delays, bumping and lack of information at the 
nation's airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore also introduced an administration ``bill  
of rights'' for passengers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's committee heard from disgruntled passengers Thursday, a  
day after the House panel listened to similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	One traveler, Jeanne Johanningmeier of Kingston, Pa., spoke of  
how she spent nine hours on the runway of the Detroit airport last 
January when a snowstorm paralyzed operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like we were prisoners, that there was nothing we could  
do and that we were at the mercy of the airline. We wondered why 
they couldn't bring buses out to get us or at least bring us food 
and water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under McCain's bill, passengers could find out if a flight has  
been overbooked and if they have been offered the lowest possible 
price. They also would get accurate information about delays and a 
refund within 48 hours of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about guarantees of French wines and  
blockbuster movies in coach,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Hallet, president of the Air Transport Association of  
America, assured the committee that airlines are moving to improve 
service and ``the intrusion of government bureaucracy'' was 
unnecessary.

<HEADLINE> House To Debate US Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is moving ahead with debate on the  
possible deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo, despite appeals for a 
delay from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 1996 
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, a former Senate majority leader, and Albright cautioned  
that divisive congressional debate could undermine already-fragile 
chances of reaching agreement when peace talks resume Monday in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to throw cold water on a possible agreement you  
vote no,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was scheduled to vote today on whether to send 4,000  
U.S. troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping force, as 
President Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a solemn duty to have this vote,'' said House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate vote is expected as early as next week.  
</P>
<P>
	The House was considering a nonbinding resolution by House  
International Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., that asks 
members whether they believe U.S. troops should go to Kosovo to 
enforce a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many members of Congress have serious reservations about  
deploying our armed forces to Kosovo as peacekeepers. Others 
strongly support the president's policy,'' Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the resolution is nonbinding, ``It does mean something  
when Congress has passed a resolution,'' Dole told a House hearing 
Wednesday. At the president's request, Dole has served as a special 
U.S. envoy to the Albanian side in the Kosovo dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the upcoming peace talks between Kosovo's ethnic  
Albanians and Serbs, prospects seemed further dashed Wednesday when 
special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed to persuade Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to sign onto the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, speaking to the House International Relations Committee  
after reports that Holbrooke's mission had failed, said, ``Why 
should Milosevic sign it? The Albanians haven't signed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole went to the Balkans last weekend to persuade rival Albanian  
factions to sign onto the accord. He left without getting the 
consent of Kosovo's hard-line guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, earlier Wednesday, told a separate House hearing, ``A  
vote at any time to oppose an authorization would be taken by both 
sides as a green light to resume fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Milosevic's latest defiance seemed to build support in  
the GOP-led chamber for the administration position rather than 
diminishing it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who  
prosecuted the House impeachment case against Clinton, indicated he 
probably would support the administration this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending U.S. troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers may be ``something  
we have to do,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I don't think we should deceive ourselves --  
that this is something we can get out of easily. People are going 
to get shot and some of those people are going to be our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman conceded that ``any political agreement to prevent  
further suffering in Kosovo will very likely require an 
international military force to ensure the implementation of the 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gilman also questioned the willingness of the rival factions  
to support such a pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Albright and Dole told Congress there was no way any peace  
accord could be reached at the bargaining table without the 
certainty that U.S. troops would be part of any peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he is ready to commit 4,000 U.S. troops to be  
part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo -- but 
only if a peace accord can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Serb positions if the  
Albanian side agrees and the Serbian side, led by Milosevic, 
declines.

<HEADLINE> Customs Retrain Drug Searchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beset by investigations and lawsuits alleging  
abusive tactics, the Customs Service is retraining officers who 
check airline passengers for drugs and trying new technology to 
reduce the need for invasive body searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes come as new statistics show the number of cocaine  
and heroin smugglers caught at airports dropped by one-fourth in 
1998. That poses a two-pronged problem for Customs officials eager 
to reverse the decline while tempering public anger over the way 
travelers are searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``This search authority is crucial for us,'' Commissioner  
Raymond Kelly said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
``We're trying to show movement in the right direction so that we 
keep the authority but make it a less onerous process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In pursuit of smugglers who swallow packets of drugs, officers  
have subjected passengers to strip searches, taken them in 
handcuffs to hospitals for X-rays, and detained some for hours or 
even days. Almost 100 black women in Chicago are pursuing a joint 
lawsuit claiming they were singled out unfairly because of their 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, Customs is facing 12 lawsuits over searches of  
airline passengers, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small fraction of the 69 million passengers who pass  
through Customs each year are questioned. About 50,000 were 
subjected to some level of body search in 1997. Searches usually 
begin with a frisk or pat-down and, with reasonable suspicion, can 
proceed to a strip search, X-ray or monitored bowel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs were found on about one-fourth of passengers subjected to  
partial or full strip searches, the agency says. The rate was close 
to 100 percent a decade ago, Kelly said, but smugglers have become 
more sophisticated and difficult to recognize. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly acknowledged body searches can be traumatic and have  
become a ``significant problem'' for Customs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee, the General Accounting Office and  
the Treasury Department are all investigating Customs' airport 
searches. Illinois senators raised the issue last year after 
WMAQ-TV reported on complaints from black women searched at 
Chicago's O'Hare airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the AP reported that travelers across the country  
were complaining of abusive searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Customs has taken several steps to defuse the issue:  
</P>
<P>
	--An extensive new training program began last month for  
inspectors at airports. ``It involves both what to look for but 
also how to handle people, cultural diversity training, that sort 
of thing,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Since Feb. 1, inspectors at Miami and New York's Kennedy  
airports have given travelers chosen for a pat-down the option of 
standing in front of a body-imaging machine instead. Twenty-three 
people have agreed to the low-radiation imaging, which looks 
through clothing. In Miami on Tuesday, one of the machines revealed 
3 1/2 pounds of marijuana in a bicycle tire strapped around a man's 
waist, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Body imaging may be added to other airports if it proves  
effective and less objectionable to passengers, a spokesman said. 
In some cases, travelers also have been given the option of 
submitting to an X-ray in lieu of a strip search. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Customs Service plans to install X-ray machines and  
technicians at major airports to check suspects without 
transporting them to a hospital. The agency is looking for a 
contractor and has requested $9 million for the program in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Customs is also researching whether breathalyzer technology  
could be used to detect latex condoms and balloons, which smugglers 
fill with drugs and swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	--Signs and brochures were being installed in airports this week  
to explain why travelers might be subjected to a body search, and 
new comment cards make it easier to complain about mistreatment. 
Customs also wants to add a search warning to the declarations 
forms travelers fill out. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are surprised,'' Kelly said. ``Someone says, 'Go over  
there' and the next thing you find out, you're being searched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials are worried that the lawsuits over searches,  
generally filed against individual officers, may be having a 
chilling effect on inspectors, Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy 
said. A traveler won a $450,000 judgment against Customs officers 
in San Francisco last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of travelers caught carrying cocaine or heroin under  
their clothes or inside their bodies fell from 916 seizures in 1997 
to 677 in fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is concern that these lawsuits have caused people to  
back off a little bit,'' contrary to agency policy, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said other factors may include a temporary shift of some  
resources away from personal searches for a crackdown on cargo 
smuggling last year and inventive new tactics used by drug 
suppliers. For example, some now send a decoy passenger to distract 
inspectors while four or five drug couriers on the same flight slip 
by undetected.

<HEADLINE> Computers Ready for Dow 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street traders were worried more Thursday  
about inflated stock prices than any computer snafus as the Dow 
Jones industrial average edged within a few dozen points of the 
five-digit milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago some consultants warned that old software could read  
10000 as 0000 and cause some computers to go haywire, or interpret 
it as a major crash and trigger automatic selling. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer and industry experts say any glitches have been  
patched, and would have been largely irrelevant, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a non-event,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist  
for Deutsche Bank, North America. ``It might just be kind of like a 
joke to see the Dow is at zero rather than 10000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because, while the Dow is a commonly accepted gauge of  
market activity with the public, the 10,000 milestone holds little 
interest among professional traders and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more concerned about the level of the Dow than the  
five-digit Dow. The market is as high as a kite,'' said Alan 
Davidson, president of the 130-member Independent Broker-Dealer 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Other industry groups were equally ambivalent.  
</P>
<P>
	The Securities Industry Association, the New York Stock Exchange  
and several major brokerages said they envisioned no problems 
resulting from the extra digit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a statement that  
it had been assured any appropriate measures have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Hall, vice president of Trigent Software Inc., a software  
services firm in Southborough, Mass., said updating software to 
recognize a fifth field is not an unusual or out of the ordinary 
task for people who maintain systems.

<HEADLINE> Ashland Chemical To Be Two Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Ashland Inc. is dividing its wholly-owned  
Ashland Chemical Co. into separate distribution and specialty 
chemicals businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The new divisions announced Thursday will be called Ashland  
Distribution Co. and Ashland Specialty Chemicals Co., and will 
replace Ashland Chemical in Ashland Inc.'s portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	They will continue to be based in Dublin, Ohio, the site of  
former Ashland Chemical headquarters. No staffing level changes are 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland chairman and chief executive Paul W. Chellgren said the  
move provides each new divison with ``greater market focus, better 
definition in the marketplace and an enhanced ability to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland Inc. has interests in coal, oil, gasoline, chemicals and  
highway construction. Its brands include Valvoline motor oil and 
Zerex antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. D'Antoni, senior vice president of Ashland Inc. who has  
served as president of Ashland Chemical since 1988, has been named 
group operating officer responsible for the distribution and 
specialty chemical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter M. Bokach was named president of Ashland Distribution Co.,  
while James A. Duquin will be president of Ashland Specialty 
Chemicals Co. Both report to D'Antoni.

<HEADLINE> Balloonists Wary of Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to  
fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, 
trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones  
of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward 
Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said. 
</P>
<P>
	They are expected to fly over the ocean for six days instead of  
hugging the Asian coastline and hitting North America farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	``What frightens us most about crossing the Pacific is bad  
weather in an area where rescue will be long and possibly 
difficult,'' the control center quoted Jones as saying. ``I'm just 
hoping we won't bump into any bad weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard and Jones were flying at 55 mph at an altitude of 26,200  
feet. They have covered about than 12,000 miles since taking off 
March 1 from the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	The control center said the balloonists were so concerned about  
the Pacific they didn't take time to celebrate crossing China, one 
of the major hurdles of their trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese allowed them to pass through a narrow strip and  
reminded them three times during the 14-hour crossing that they 
were sometimes less than 25 miles from the no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he  
failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure 
from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson gave up over  
the Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they 
lacked Chinese permission.

<HEADLINE> UNC-Charlotte Has Faced Adversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Very little has gone right for North  
Carolina-Charlotte this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Redshirt freshman Ouseynou Kane got stuck in Dekar, Senegal,  
because of visa problems and never made it back to school. Guard 
Dalonte Hill was lost for the season with a knee injury in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, redshirt freshman Charles Hayward's leukemia returned in  
December. After losing star center DeMarco Johnson to the NBA and 
coach Melvin Watkins to Texas A&AMP;M, the 49ers were picked last in 
their division of Conference USA. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers went 22-10 against the 11th-toughest schedule in  
the nation and became only the fourth team ever to claim a 
conference postseason crown with four victories in four nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bobby Lutz said he always had faith his team would  
overcome the obstacles ``but I wouldn't have wagered a lot on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers' adverse fortune wasn't over. On Selection Sunday, the  
49ers got a fifth seed. Their reward? Twelfth-seeded Rhode Island, 
a 1 1/2-point favorite in the first-round matchup at the Bradley 
Center Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I was surprised,'' 49ers senior forward Galen Young  
said Thursday. ``But we've been considered underdogs the whole year 
no matter who we play. So, we just take it as another chance to 
show what we can do as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had to prove ourselves day in and day out. So, this is  
just another test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a big one.  
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island (20-12) is led by sophomore sensation Lamar Odom, a  
6-foot-10, 220-pound forward whom could be a high pick in this 
summer's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Young said the 49ers weren't troubled by the thought of facing  
Odom, who averages 17.7 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not just caught up in the Lamar Odom mystique,'' he  
said. ``They're certainly much more than a one-man team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Reynolds-Dean (13.3) and Preston Murphy (11.1) average  
in double figures and Tavorris Bell (9.3) and Luther Clay (9.4) 
come close. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNCC-Rhode Island winner will face No. 4 seed Arizona or No.  
13 Oklahoma. In other games at the Bradley Center Friday, 
top-seeded Michigan State, led by Mateen Cleaves, faces Mount St. 
Mary's and 800-game winner Jim Phelan, and eighth-seeded Villanova 
meets ninth-seeded Ole Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick disdains the oddsmakers' picking  
his team as the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand it,'' Harrick said. ``All I know is five  
vs. 12. Huge underdog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they figured we should have been a higher seed,''  
Reynolds-Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the line, UNC-Charlotte's Kelvin Price said the 49ers  
didn't spend much time chafing after learning their opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``After our seed was announced we all went to the hotel where  
Charles is staying and spent about 30, 40 minutes there,'' Price 
said. ``He's a great inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward's cancer is in remission but his future on the court is  
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles is still first in our mind more than this game or any  
other game,'' Lutz said. ``But we're not going to do anything to 
try to use his situation to help us on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he shares with his teammates is just that. All I did is  
make sure Charles knows how much we care about him and how much 
we're pulling for him and have been praying for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Hayward's fight has held great lessons for his team, Lutz  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these guys were here last year and they saw what  
Charles went through and that has helped our team grow up on and 
off the court,'' Lutz said. ``We don't take things for granted as 
much as some 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds would. Because we see how 
precious each day is. And we see how important it is to enjoy what 
you're doing, like the game of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was difficult watching Hayward beat cancer and come back so  
strong only to be stricken again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes all of us very sad because it just doesn't seem  
fair,'' Lutz said. ``But at the same time, to watch how he deals 
with it, inspires me and I think it inspires our team to try to do 
things the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I go see him I'm thinking, `How can I make him feel  
better?' And when I walk away, he has made me feel better.''

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Guatemala 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An untimely shove by Joe-Max Moore will keep  
him from helping the United States try to win the U.S. Cup '99 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore and Brian McBride scored first-half goals as the Americans  
defeated Guatemala 3-1 Thursday night. But they'll be without 
Moore's valuable experience Saturday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a red card late in Thursday's match and was  
suspended for the game against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to hurt us,'' American coach Bruce Arena said of  
Moore's absence. ``It was probably not a smart situation for 
Joe-Max to be caught in. I thought it was an unnecessary card to 
show at that point in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala's Erick Miranda also received a red card for the  
incident in the 90th minute that left both teams a player short. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the ball was cleared, he volleyed me in the back of the  
leg,'' Moore said of Miranda. ``I turned around and bumped him with 
my shoulder, and he went down like a ton of bricks. The linesman 
picked up on it. It was stupid for me to react like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore gave the Americans a 1-0 lead when he took a pass from  
McBride and scored on a diving kick in the 22nd minute for his 18th 
international goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian headed it back in front of the goal perfectly and it was  
a short hop, so I just tried to get to it with the sole of my foot, 
and it worked out well,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride increased the Americans' lead to 2-0 in the 37th minute  
on a header off a pass from Ante Razov, a shot that sailed over 
leaping Guatemalan goaltender Edgar Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Perez scored Guatemala's only goal on a penalty kick in  
the 51st minute, called after a foul by Eddie Lewis on Guillermo 
Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Hejduk, one of the few players who stood out for the  
Americans at last summer's World Cup, got the final goal four 
minutes into injury time, bouncing a shot past Estrada following 
Lewis' free kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have played much better,'' Moore said. ``We could  
have held the ball better, we could have gotten a little more in 
front of the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico rallied from a one-goal deficit with two consecutive  
goals by Joel Sanchez in a six-minute span to beat Bolivia 2-1 in 
the second half of the doubleheader attended by 34,154 at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum. Guatemala will play Bolivia in the completion of 
the tournament, sponsored by Nike, on Saturday at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans improved to 3-0-1 in 1999 as they attempt to win  
the U.S. Cup for the third time. They were champions in 1992 and 
'95. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 11 U.S. starters had played in five or fewer  
international matches entering the game. Ben Olsen, the youngest 
member of the U.S. roster at 21, had two solid scoring chances 
early in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Zach Thornton, arguably the No. 4 or No. 5 U.S. goalkeeper, made  
two saves. Kasey Keller, the top U.S. goalkeeper, was originally 
scheduled to join the American team for the tournament, but 
remained with Leicester City for Saturday's English Premier League 
game against Charlton.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota To Investigate Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The University of Minnesota raced to investigate  
a report that a former employee wrote papers, did take-home exams 
and other course work for 20 men's basketball players over the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The university was trying to determine whether four players --  
including two starters -- were eligible for today's game against 
Gonzaga in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The four players -- Kevin Clark, Miles Tarver, Antoine Broxsie  
and Jason Stanford -- declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice president of  
institutional relations, said the players could be ruled ineligible 
but reinstated pending the outcome of an investigation. An NCAA 
spokeswoman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Four former players told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press that work  
was prepared for them, a possible violation of the student code of 
conduct and NCAA regulations. Another former player, Trevor Winter, 
who now plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves, said he was aware of 
the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' said Russ Archambault, one  
of the former players who acknowledged that Jan Gangelhoff, the 
former office manager in the academic counseling unit, did work for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to make jokes about it. ... I would go over there some  
nights and get like four papers done. The coaches would be laughing 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins said Wednesday that he planned to discuss the  
allegations ``when the season's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage we're here to play basketball,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she was taken on two of the team's road trips,  
including one to Hawaii, and considered it compensation for the 
work. She said she never was asked by coaches to do work for 
players, though she said Haskins once paid her $3,000 in cash to 
tutor a player. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Mark Yudof said Haskins denied the  
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disturbed by the allegations,'' Yudof said. ``My  
reaction was a great deal of sadness and worry, but I also have a 
lot of respect for Clem Haskins and for our program and I think we 
shouldn't jump to conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Jackson, another former player who also plays for the  
Timberwolves, said Gangelhoff mostly just typed his papers. That 
also is a possible violation of National Collegiate Athletic 
Association rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Two players denied Gangelhoff did their course work, the Pioneer  
Press reported Wednesday. Five others refused comment; seven could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, 50, estimated that from 1993 to 1998 she did more  
than 400 pieces of course work for players, including some starters 
on the 1996-97 Final Four team. She gave the Pioneer Press computer 
files containing examples of course work she said she wrote and 
players turned in. Some of the papers had grades and instructor's 
comments written on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bring in these high-risk kids, and they know that  
everything they did in high school was done for them,'' Gangelhoff 
said. ``It's got to stop somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elayne Donahue, the retired head of the academic counseling  
unit, said she was unaware of any fraud. But Ms. Donahue said she 
was ignored when she warned athletic department administrators that 
Gangelhoff was tutoring players in violation of department policy.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out Murder Convictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge today threw out the murder convictions of  
a man who spent 17 years in prison and came within two days of 
execution before journalism students cast doubt on his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God, I'm innocent of all charges. Thank God, I'm free,''  
Anthony Porter said after today's court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Fitzgerald praised the work done by  
prosecutors, defense attorneys and ``others outside the system'' in 
freeing Porter from death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm personally and profoundly grateful that we were spared the  
unthinkable, unthinkable conclusion to this case,'' Fitzgerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was released on bond Feb. 5. He walked out of jail and  
threw his arms around Northwestern University journalism professor 
David Protess and several students from the investigative reporting 
class who gathered evidence suggesting Porter was wrongly convicted 
of two murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, came within two days of being executed in September  
before the Illinois Supreme Court decided his case required another 
look, citing Porter's mental state and low IQ. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, key witnesses have recanted their testimony and  
another man, Alstory Simon of Milwaukee, was recorded on videotape 
admitting to the shooting deaths of Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn 
Green, 19, in Chicago's Washington Park in August 1982. He said he 
acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is the 11th death row inmate exonerated in Illinois since  
capital punishment was reinstated in 1977. The dramatic freeing of 
Porter and others has led to calls for a moratorium on executions 
and an overhaul of the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1977, Illinois has executed 11 people. Another execution  
is scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first time Protess and his students have  
investigated old murder cases. In June 1996, four men who had spent 
18 years in prison for a double murder were released after students 
helped uncover new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter remains convicted of two armed robbery charges. A hearing  
was scheduled for April 20 to hear evidence on overturning those 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Porter is innocent of all the charges,'' said defense  
attorney Daniel Sanders, who said he believed the robbery charges 
would be dropped at the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Fraternity Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A duel between two Michigan State  
University fraternity brothers to see which one was the tougher has 
left one hospitalized and the fraternity suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured 20-year-old student was admitted to Sparrow Hospital  
on Friday, a day after the incident, complaining of severe back 
pain. He required kidney dialysis. He remained hospitalized 
Wednesday, university spokesman Terry Denbow said today. Neither he 
nor the hospital gave any details. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Phi Beta Sigma member was not seriously hurt. Neither  
was identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident began when the two entered into a hitting contest  
to determine who was toughest, chapter president Raynard Dennis 
said. Police said the contest spanned several hours the night of 
March 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hazing,'' said Dennis, who didn't witness the  
incident. ``It was something that occurred amongst brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times it has to do with male pride.''  
</P>
<P>
	Phi Beta Sigma's national organization suspended the chapter  
pending an investigation, Denbow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus police said they were investigating the incident as an  
assault. No charges were filed immediately.

<HEADLINE> Oil-Laden Ship Finally Sunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- It took 70 shells from a Navy destroyer,  
explosive charges and, finally, a torpedo to sink the New Carissa. 
</P>
<P>
	The greasy effects of the ill-fated freighter linger, however,  
as Oregon authorities try to decide how to clean up miles of 
oil-slicked beaches in a mess blamed for killing hundreds of birds. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounded ship that had plagued the Oregon coast for more  
than a month seemed determined to go down fighting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had nine lives and it was not willing to cooperate with  
us,'' said Cmdr. Cliff Perkins, commanding officer of the Navy 
destroyer USS David R. Ray. ``This thing seems to have a life of 
its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The saga of the New Carissa began Feb. 4, when the 639-foot  
freighter, laden with 400,000 gallons of fuel oil, ran aground off 
Coos Bay. About half of the fuel load was burned off by explosives 
experts Feb. 10, but hours later the ship split in two, spilling 
70,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to tow the oil-laden bow section to sea last week failed  
when it broke away during a storm and washed ashore at this tiny 
town along the central Oregon coast, 80 miles north of Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Monday, a powerful tugboat began towing the bow -- still  
loaded with 130,000 gallons of fuel -- 300 miles out to sea. There, 
sunk at depths of 12,000 feet where temperatures never rise above 
34 degrees, experts said the sticky bunker fuel would be trapped in 
a semisolid state. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting the bow to the bottom was another exercise in  
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Remote-controlled explosive charges blew holes in the hull. When  
that failed to sink the ship, the USS David R. Ray opened up with a 
barrage of 70 shots from its 5-inch guns. Then the nuclear sub USS 
Bremerton fired a torpedo shot that exploded just below the hulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, two hours after demolition experts began their efforts,  
the stubborn wreck slipped under the water. A skimming vessel was 
busy sucking up a 1,000-yard-wide slick of nearly 40,000 gallons 
that emerged after the Navy scuttled the ship, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The empty 220-foot stern still sits half-buried in the beach at  
Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 604 dead birds have washed up on shore -- 273 of them  
splotched with oil -- while gooey globs about the size of pencil 
erasers have soiled the coastline since the ship first ran aground. 
</P>
<P>
	At one marshy beach near Waldport, officials decided a full  
cleanup might cause more damage than the oil itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to get the oil off that is to take the grass with  
it,'' said Howard Hile, a contractor hired by the ship's insurer to 
oversee the cleanup efforts. ``We'd do more harm trying to clean it 
up.''

<HEADLINE> Staying Ahead of NCAA Guillotine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They were never exactly students.  
</P>
<P>
	They're no longer athletes.  
</P>
<P>
	The worrisome thing is what they probably won't be next: Young  
men with enough of a future to throw to the cat. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday morning, barely five hours before their team met  
Gonzaga in the NCAA tournament, officials at the University of 
Minnesota voluntarily declared four members of their own basketball 
team ineligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The final score -- Gonzaga 75, Minnesota 63 -- speaks volumes  
about how much the Gophers missed the four, especially starters 
Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver. It also tells you how solid the 
evidence must have been, since the school's rush to judgment came 
before the NCAA even had a chance to offer use of its in-house 
guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
	But university vice president McKinley Boston must have heard  
the blade being sharpened when he got up to speak at a news 
conference in Minneapolis. ``We would rather not risk the 
reputation of the university by playing an ineligible player at 
this time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations of academic fraud surfaced in the Saint Paul  
Pioneer Press, where a story quoted former university employee Jan 
Gangelhoff saying she did more than 400 pieces of course work for 
at least 20 players during a five-year period. Four former players 
confirmed her account. 
</P>
<P>
	As if that wasn't damning enough, former player Russ Archambault  
said, ``The coaches knew. Everybody knew. We used to make jokes 
about it. ... I would go over there some nights and get like four 
papers done. The coaches would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that seems funny now is the subject of one of the  
papers that Gangelhoff claimed she wrote and Tarver turned in: It 
was whether college athletes should be financially compensated by 
the schools they represent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not coincidentally, that very issue provides the foundation for  
a new basketball league that plans to be up and running by 
November. The brainchild of Babson College accounting professor 
Paul McMann, it's called the Collegiate Professional Basketball 
League and its business plan is stunningly simple. Each player in 
the CPBL gets a $5,000 signing bonus, a $9,000 annual salary, plus 
tuition, room and board at any college they attend for up to four 
years after they leave the league. 
</P>
<P>
	By paying kids as athletes in-season, McMann believes there is  
less temptation to take or make money under the table, which was at 
the root of the Northwestern point-shaving scandal that rocked last 
year's Final Four. And by letting them be full-time students the 
rest of the year (or not, if the kids choose), the pressure to 
cheat academically is lessened as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the CPBL makes it is anybody's guess. As the American  
Basketball League recent collapse reminds, gambling on the public's 
appetite for variations of the same handful of games is risky 
business. But if the NCAA lacks the good sense to fear the CPBL, it 
shouldn't be above stealing an idea whose time has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that the NCAA can't  
force member schools to use a minimum score on the Scholastic 
Assessment Test as the bottom-line measurement of whether incoming 
freshmen were eligible to play. Now that a new standard is 
necessary, anyway, why apply another bandage when radical surgery 
is what's required? 
</P>
<P>
	Pay the kids a stipend; the cost should be offset by savings  
realized from fewer NCAA investigations. Make the scholarships 
open-ended. Let some kids opt to be athletes only during the season 
and students only when their seasons are over, instead of neither. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the most recent count, 44 percent of men's Division  
I basketball players graduate. And those like the four ballplayers 
declared ineligible by Minnesota wind up with even fewer tools to 
begin building a future. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, a kid named Kevin Ross became the poster child in the  
campaign to tighten up academic standards for college athletes. He 
attended Creighton University on a basketball scholarship, but 
after four years, he was still reading at an elementary school 
level. Five years later, depressed and battling alcoholism, he 
started hurling furniture through the window of his hotel room down 
to the street below. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after that, with lots of tutoring and not a little  
counseling paid for by some of the people he had embarrassed, Ross 
was holding down a job as a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's that much better for others,'' he said at  
the time, ``because I still get letters from athletes around the 
country that would bring tears to your eyes.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Exonerates UCLA in Bet Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An FBI investigation into an alleged  
mobster's ties to UCLA football players failed to uncover any 
evidence of wrongdoing, agents and school officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI has told me we have nothing to be concerned about ...  
that it has no concerns regarding the conduct of UCLA or any of its 
student athletes,'' athletic director Peter Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began a sports-betting probe after the Bruins, with a  
10-0 record and strong contenders for the national title, lost to 
Miami and Wisconsin to close out last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific-10 Conference champions were ranked as high as No. 2  
nationally and played in the Rose Bowl game against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy P. McNally, FBI assistant director in Los Angeles, said  
late Thursday that the investigation was complete and there was no 
evidence of any wrongdoing by any members of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI investigation began after UCLA players were seen with  
Dominic Montemarano, a 60-year-old ex-convict also known as ``Donny 
Shacks'' who was sent to prison in 1987 on federal racketeering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding he may have been under their regular  
surveillance,'' Dalis said. FBI spokesman Ray Escudero said he 
couldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, based in Overland Park, Kans., said the investigation  
had nothing to do with point shaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're comfortable that that is not the issue. The issue is  
more who they have associated with. There's no point shaving,'' 
said Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of gambling and agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the key thing is there was nothing found, nothing  
illegal. Nothing has happened that is wrong here,'' UCLA football 
coach Bob Toledo said. ``They associated with a guy the FBI's 
concerned with but they did nothing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has photographs of four or five UCLA players socializing  
with the target of the investigation, Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding was they had attended some social events into  
his home for `Monday Night Football' on several occasions. My 
understanding is they had no understanding of this guy's 
background,'' Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
	All-American quarterback Cade McNown was one of the players  
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown said in a statement that he voluntarily underwent a  
polygraph test, passed it and was told ``there would be no further 
inquiry necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, expected to be a first-round selection in next month's  
NFL draft, left the university after the Rose Bowl to focus on 
preparing for his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo said he hasn't talked to McNown since taking him to the  
FBI office on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cade McNown is a squeaky-clean kid. Cade McNown is a fierce  
competitor, as good a kid as you'd ever meet,'' the coach said. ``I 
think they probably met this guy, someone introduced them, they 
thought he was a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've hung around with some older people too.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins won their first 10 games to give them a 20-game  
losing streak dating back to the previous season before losing at 
Miami 49-45 on Dec. 5. UCLA then lost to Wisconsin 38-31 in the 
Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports of a federal points shaving probe hit the UCLA  
campus like a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a farce,'' UCLA linebacker Ali Abdul-Aziz said. ``We  
would never do that to ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether they shaved points or not, but this is  
definitely a black mark on the football program and the school and 
all of us,'' said R.K. Crane, a 24-year-old UCLA junior political 
science major. 
</P>
<P>
	Dalis said the FBI expects to complete its investigation Friday  
after conducting one more interview -- ``Not a player,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show Montemarano has a home in Century City, but there  
was no telephone listing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This person is not a representative of our interests, has  
never been left tickets,'' Dalis said.

<HEADLINE> Swearing Professor in Mich. Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- An English professor who was suspended for  
using graphic language in class is suing to get reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Macomb Community College professor John Bonnell accuses the  
school of violating his civil rights and freedom of speech when it 
suspended him, barred him from campus and placed him under a gag 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks unspecified damages. A  
school disciplinary hearing that had been scheduled for Thursday 
was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The school investigated Bonnell after a female student  
complained in November that he used vulgar references in his 
lectures that offended her. He was suspended with pay last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnell's lawyer, James Howarth, said Bonnell has an outstanding  
32-year career at the school unmarked by any discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``His students love him,'' Howarth said. ``The language that he  
used is used strictly within the context of his course and 
lectures. The language is not directed at any student, nor is it 
used in general conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth said the phrases were used in discussions of the Monica  
Lewinsky affair, a criminal case involving necrophilia and gender 
chauvinism in the Roman Catholic Church of the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the school said the faculty contract forbids any  
discussion of a disciplinary matter until there has been a 
resolution.

<HEADLINE> Utah Leads NCAA Ski Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUMFORD, Maine (AP) -- Twin brothers Rune and Frode Kollerud  
finished 1-2 in the men's freestyle cross-country race Thursday, 
carrying Utah into the lead of the NCAA Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Rune, born three minutes after his brother in Norway, finished  
about seven seconds ahead of him in the 10-kilometer race at Black 
Mountain -- 27 minutes, 19.6 seconds to 27:26.1. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and second; we can't do better,'' Frode Kollerud said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ekaterina Ivanova of Vermont continued her domination in the  
women's 5-kilometer race, winning by nearly 13 seconds ahead of 
Steffi Kindt of Alaska-Anchorage on the blustery, snowy day. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the brothers finished second and third in both  
cross-country races. Now, they will have a chance in Saturday's 
20-kilometer race for two 1-2 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the first for Rune this season, while Frode has  
won twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The finish, together with Pat Casey's 20th, gave the Utes 97  
points and a total of 348.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Colorado, which led after Wednesday's giant  
slalom, collected 88 points from its men for 346. Vermont was third 
with 317. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth, which took a six-point lead over Colorado after the  
women's race, fell back to fourth at 310 after doing no better than 
17th in the men's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, one of the favorites, made the biggest gain. After a  
miserable giant slalom, the Pioneers started the day 90 points 
behind in eighth place, They finished in fifth at 303, 45 points 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's six skiers all were in the top 11. Joern Frohs finished  
third behind the Kolleruds and Britta Wienand and Irene Eder were 
third and fourth among the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanova, who entered Vermont in January after skiing for the  
Russian national biathlon team, won her 18th race in 18 tries, 
including two against the U.S. National team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she were a U.S. citizen, she would be our best Olympic  
skier,'' Vermont cross-country coach Bruce Cranmer said.

<HEADLINE> Multinationals Cite Harmful Tax Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives of four multinational companies  
urged Congress on Thursday to overhaul U.S. international tax rules 
that they say put them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert H. Perlman, vice president of Intel Corp., told the  
Senate Finance Committee that if the California-based computer chip 
giant were founded today, he'd recommend locating the headquarters 
in the Cayman Islands for tax reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tax code competitively disadvantages multinationals simply  
because the parent is a U.S. corporation,'' Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	One key problem, he said, is that Intel's foreign operations in  
certain countries will lose 35 cents on the dollar to U.S. taxes -- 
money that could be spent on critical research -- while a Japanese 
competitor keeps the entire dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who's going  
to win that battle,'' Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Perlman in calling for tax code changes were officials  
with Peoria, Ill.-based heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc., 
newly merged automaker DaimlerChrysler Corp. and Swiss-based 
engineering company ABB Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to maintain our philosophy of 'build it here and  
sell it there,' we need a modern tax policy that is consistent with 
our global focus,'' said Robin Beran, assistant treasurer at 
Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies targeted for improvement the complexity of the  
U.S. code, the need to treat the 15-country European Union as one 
entity and the double income taxation triggered by many operations 
abroad despite U.S. credits for taxes paid to foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of such double taxation led DaimlerChrysler to  
place its world headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, after the 
recent merger, with an American subsidiary in Auburn Hills, Mich., 
said chief tax counsel John L. Loffredo. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it came to the choice of whether the new company should  
be a U.S. company or a German company, the U.S. tax system put 
Chrysler at a decisive disadvantage,'' Loffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the Finance Committee said they will pursue  
international tax reforms this year, both for U.S. companies 
operating overseas and for foreign firms with business in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tax laws must encourage international businesses to come  
here and to strengthen U.S. businesses overseas,'' said Senate 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats argued that an equal priority for Congress  
should be to ensure that foreign-controlled firms pay their fair 
share for operations in the United States. Sen. Byron Dorgan, 
D-N.D., said a forthcoming General Accounting Office study would 
likely show that 30 percent of such firms are now escaping U.S. 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us simplify. Let us reduce the complexity. But let us do  
it in a way that closes the loopholes,'' Dorgan said. ``They have 
access to the best marketplace in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Closing Corporate Tax Shelters Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans lawmakers appear receptive to  
President Clinton's proposals to scrap corporate tax shelters, but 
top accounting firms made it clear they plan to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, told Treasury Department officials at a hearing 
Wednesday that the GOP will ``explore'' the 11 proposals, estimated 
to raise $11.7 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The area of corporate tax shelters is one field which merits  
review,'' said Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Kies, managing partner of national tax services at  
the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, told the panel the 
Treasury Department's definition of a shelter is ``broad and 
amorphous,'' could prompt challenges to legal transactions and 
gives the government too much power. 
</P>
<P>
	``These proposals are overreaching, unnecessary and at odds with  
sound tax policy and principles,'' Kies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Lubick, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said  
the Clinton administration is ``pleased'' at the prospects of 
working with Congress on the corporate tax shelters. Lubick said 
the growth of such shelters is cutting into federal revenue and 
lead to ``a perception of unfairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Corporate tax shelters erode the integrity of the tax system  
as a whole,'' Lubick said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department has identified several such shelters  
that it feels should be eliminated. They include corporate 
takeovers aimed at avoiding taxes, fees paid for advice on how to 
create shelters and taxes avoided by people who lease tax-exempt 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the brightest minds in the country spend their every  
waking hour figuring out ways to avoid taxes others have to pay,'' 
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means panel was not receptive to dozens of other  
revenue-raising proposals included in Clinton's budget for fiscal 
2000. They mainly affect such things as business accounting 
methods, stock transactions, insurance company profits and trade 
association investment income. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting Congress has rejected 30 of Clinton's proposals, Rep.  
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said the tax increases should not be 
approved while federal budget surpluses are projected at $1.6 
trillion over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're doing is raising the money to pay for new  
spending,'' Johnson told the Treasury officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubick responded that the new revenue was needed to keep  
Clinton's budget in balance without cutting other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The core of this budget is fiscal discipline,'' Lubick said.  
</P>
<P>
	Archer noted that the president's budget offers no broad tax  
relief, only specific credits and deductions for such programs as 
long-term care of the elderly, school construction and revitalizing 
inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given how difficult the tax forms already are to fill out, I'm  
not sure the taxpayers will welcome these ideas,'' Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's budget does include $82 billion in tax relief  
targeted at middle-class people. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is only beginning to grapple with tax proposals for  
fiscal 2000, including a range of Republican tax cut ideas. The 
Ways and Means Committee probably will not begin writing a tax bill 
for next year until summer, when new budget surplus projections are 
expected.

<HEADLINE> Study Says States Not Saving Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to saving up for a rainy day,  
most state governments are acting like spendthrift grasshoppers 
rather than thrifty ants, according to a new study from a budget 
research institute. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three-fourths of the states are failing to put aside  
enough in their ``rainy day'' reserves to be prepared for a future 
recession, even a mild one, the liberal-leaning Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities said in a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ranked Michigan and Minnesota as tops in building up  
reserve funds, but they were in a small group of only eight sates 
that the center judged would be able to deal with a recession 
without having to resort to painful cuts in spending or sizable tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	And the survey rated Idaho, Oregon, Texas and West Virginia as  
doing the worst in terms of building up necessary reserves to be 
ready for future bad times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is hoping for another recession, but it's only prudent  
to ask whether states have done enough to prepare for the next 
one,'' said Iris Lav, one of the authors of the report, ``When It 
Rains, It Pours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center, an advocacy group for low-income programs, hopes its  
study will be used during upcoming debates in state legislators 
over whether to use growing surpluses to provide state tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lav said the report tried to analyze the validity of a rule  
of thumb that a reserve equal to 5 percent of a state's operating 
budget is sufficient to deal with problems down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came to the conclusion that number is too low. It  
determined that a state, on average, needs to hold reserve balances 
totaling 18 percent of current spending, basing its estimate on a 
review of what actually happened during the last recession, from 
1990 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	That mild recession translated into hard times for many states,  
forcing them to push through hefty tax increases and make cuts in 
spending to deal with declines in state tax collections. Unlike the 
federal government, many states have requirements that their 
budgets be in balance. 
</P>
<P>
	State reserve balances totaled 4.7 percent when the last  
recession began in 1990, the report found. But even with reserves 
at that level, near the 5 percent benchmark, no fewer than 35 
states had to cope with potential or outright budget deficits 
during a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the last recession was considered relatively mild and  
officially lasted only nine months at the national level, many 
states faced fiscal shortfalls,'' said Alan Berube, co-author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope with shortfalls in the early 1990s, states approved  
record tax increases and cut spending and services sharply. The 
center said that programs for low-income households were 
particularly hard-hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Memories of those hard times have prompted many state  
governments to establish ``rainy day'' funds designed to build up 
reserves during good times. Currently, 45 states have such funds, 
holding what the center projected would be $29.4 billion at the end 
of states' current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the center estimated that will be $50.5 billion short of  
what they would need to cope with a three-year period of recession 
and economic weakness similar at the start of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The center arrived at this figure and its state-by-state  
estimates based on assumptions that state tax collections would 
fall as much as they did in the last downturn while spending 
demands would keep rising at the pace they have in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this scenario, Michigan, with a projected budget surplus  
of $1.14 billion at the end of the current 1999 fiscal year, would 
have $700 million more than it needs to deal with a hypothetical 
recession beginning in the middle of the year 2000 and lasting for 
three years. That would mean it would not have to resort to 
cutbacks in government programs or tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The $700 million is equal to 8 percent of Michigan's 1999 state  
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Idaho's projected reserve of $56 million at the end  
of 1999 would fall short by $531 million in covering expected money 
problems arising from a recession beginning in 2000, the center 
estimated. The $531 million is equal to 33 percent of Idaho's 1999 
budget.

<HEADLINE> Extent of Haitian Disaster Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Doubts have been raised over how many people  
drowned in a Haitian smuggling venture that was described as one of 
the deadliest ever off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the survivors have given conflicting stories, and the  
brother of one survivor accused him of lying to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know what to believe,'' said Frank Doyle of  
the U.S. Border Patrol's West Palm Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard said as many as 40 people drowned Saturday when  
two Haitian boats sank in choppy waters off the coast of West Palm 
Beach. The report was based on the statements of two of three 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavannes Caseus of Florida said his brother, one of the  
survivors, is lying to authorities because he fears he may be 
charged or deported. 
</P>
<P>
	Caseus told today's editions of The Miami Herald that his  
brother, who is using the name Peter Pierre, was one of 18 people 
on a single boat. Caseus said his brother and another survivor 
fabricated the story about two boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother is piling lies upon lies, and I told him that,''  
Caseus said. The brother even lied about his name, Caseus said. His 
real name is Wilner Caseus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard was alerted to the sinking when a freighter  
heard voices screaming for help in the early morning darkness. A 
Coast Guard helicopter found one man, Carmel Auguste, who told them 
he was on a boat with four others. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during its investigation, the Coast Guard received a  
report from the Bahamas that two boats were overdue. They assumed 
the Haitians were traveling on the two boats. 
</P>
<P>
	When questioned, Auguste said his boat may have been carrying as  
many as 15 people based on voices he heard below deck. 
Investigators said the men then told them there were two boats, and 
that both sank when one caught fire and the passengers tried to 
climb aboard the second to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard found two bodies and saw another two sink below  
the surface, but no boats were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Coast Guard has not revised the number of Haitians  
believed to be missing. However, they are investigating whether the 
number of deaths were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are hoping the third survivor, who's hospitalized  
and has not been questioned, will shed light on the sinking.

<HEADLINE> SEC Teams Hope To Prove Deserving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All eight Southeastern Conference teams who'll play in the NCAA  
women's basketball tournament are firmly convinced they belong in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the tough part: proving it to the rest of the country.  
</P>
<P>
	When the tournament begins Friday night with 16 games at eight  
sites, the SEC teams will be closely watched to see how they fare -- 
especially by those who feel they were unfairly left out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there always will be focus in these situations,''  
said Mississippi State coach Sharon Fanning, who guided the Lady 
Bulldogs to their first NCAA berth. ``We need to go out and take 
care of business and hopefully, things will fall into place for all 
of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State, which plays North Carolina State at Lubbock,  
Texas, in the Midwest Regional Saturday, got in with a 7-7 league 
record and 17-10 overall mark. Kentucky and Alabama of the SEC also 
made it with 7-7 conference records and Florida (19-13) earned a 
berth after going 6-8 in the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kent of the Mid-American Conference was bypassed  
despite a 22-7 record and 14-2 league mark. Western Kentucky was 
21-7 with a third-place finish in the Sun Belt and didn't get 
picked. Neither did New Mexico, which was 22-6 overall and 12-2 in 
the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But LSU coach Sue Gunter said if any league deserves to have  
eight teams playing this weekend, it's the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there always are going to be teams left out,'' Gunter  
said. ``But if you're trying to put together the best field 
possible, then you have to forget how many teams are coming in from 
what conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a sign our game is maturing and is putting  
together a field that truly represents the best teams. The 
automatic bids make it fair. After those automatic bids go, then 
let's put the best possible field together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LSU (20-7), the fourth seed in the West, plays Evansville at  
home Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (28-2) winner of the last three national championships  
and the top seed in the East, heads the SEC contingent and plays at 
home Saturday night against Appalachian State (14-14). Georgia and 
Auburn of the SEC also made the 64-team field. 
</P>
<P>
	Two SEC schools meet teams from the Big 12, a 3-year-old league  
that has been clamoring for respect in women's basketball and has 
five spots in the NCAA bracket. This is the chance to get some 
respect, Texas coach Jody Conradt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all hear about the SEC and its dominance and some of if it  
is justified,'' said Conradt, whose team plays Auburn in the East 
Regional at Blacksburg, Va., Saturday. ``Any time we can play an 
SEC team and be successful, then it's going to help our league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other SEC-Big 12 matchup also is Saturday: Kentucky against  
Nebraska in the West at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon, which meets Cincinnati in the Mideast at Ames, Iowa,  
will be one of the more determined teams playing Friday night. The 
fifth-seeded Ducks felt they deserved a No. 4 seed, which would 
have kept them at home. Instead, for the second straight year, they 
got sent to Ames, where they lost to Rutgers in the first round 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a lot to prove right now,'' said Oregon guard  
Shaquala Williams, the Pac-10's freshman of the year. ``We felt 
like we should have been a higher seed. But the only way we can 
prove it is to win some games. You can do as well as you want in 
the regular season, but you're judged by what you do in March.''

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Hollywood is on the brink of the biggest  
technological change since sound and color: digital projectors that 
will allow movie theaters to do away with equipment that has 
changed little since Thomas Edison's day. 
</P>
<P>
	The new technology will also eliminate some of the most familiar  
of symbols of the movie industry -- celluloid and the film reel. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the revolution is director George Lucas, whose eagerly  
anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace,'' will be shown in May in four digitally equipped 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	In two to five years, increasing numbers of movie houses could  
go digital as exhibitors work out the technical and business 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very dedicated and very enthusiastic about the digital  
cinema,'' Lucas told thousands of theater operators at the ShoWest 
industry convention Wednesday. He cited the ``quality, the savings 
in cost and the ability to do things that just aren't possible 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In digital cinema, the movies are shot on film and then  
converted to a digital format. Eventually, shooting may also be 
done on digital cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The completed movies are then distributed from studios to  
theaters by satellite, by fiber-optic cable or on special discs. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies are then shown on a digital projector. One such  
projector, developed by Texas Instruments, creates a screen image 
by bouncing light off 1.3 million microscopic mirrors squeezed onto 
a 1-square-inch chip. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents a big advance over the standard film projector,  
whose basic technology has barely changed since Edison's 
Kinetoscope in 1891. The Kinetoscope used George Eastman's 
celluloid film on 35 mm stock -- just like today's projectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology also represents an advance in movie distribution.  
Currently, studios distribute movies by making prints and shipping 
them to theaters all over the country in huge, heavy reels. 
</P>
<P>
	As for audiences, they will see a cleaner, sharper image that  
won't show wear and tear with repeated showings. That means no 
scratches or declining color quality late in a movie's run. 
</P>
<P>
	During a demonstration at ShoWest, with film and digital scenes  
projected side-by-side on a big screen, the only problem with 
digital appeared to be color, with whites taking on a yellow hue, 
blues becoming purplish, and skin tones giving actresses a 
manequin-like complexion. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital technology allows theaters more flexibility in show  
times and the number of screens showing a particular movie, since 
theaters aren't limited by a finite number of film prints. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing nobody is saying is what digital movies will do to  
ticket prices, which last year averaged $4.70 in the United States. 
A digital projector runs about $100,000, compared with about 
$30,000 for a standard one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed with the quality. It's almost to the  
point where it's ready,'' said Mike Goakey, director of 
construction for Signature Theaters, with 145 screens in California 
and Hawaii. ``I think the big issue is going to be the money end of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Goakey, like many at ShoWest, predicted theaters could be  
going digital within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, there are great savings from digital. But they go to  
the movie studios, which won't have to pay the enormous costs of 
making prints and shipping them. 
</P>
<P>
	For digital movie theaters to succeed, exhibitors say the  
studios must pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues are: When will it come and who pays for it?'' said  
Peter Ivany, chief executive of Hoyts Cinemas Limited, with 
theaters in the United States and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that beaming multimillion-dollar films via  
satellite will invite movie piracy. The digital companies insist 
there are encryption programs that will adequately scramble the 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Mayson of Eastman Kodak -- which would be the big loser in  
digital theaters since it is Kodak film that the world's movie 
projectors run -- warned that one supposedly unbreakable code has 
already been broken.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Tycoon Loses Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An imprisoned Pakistani shipping tycoon lost his  
appeal Thursday of his 1997 conviction in the fraud that led to the 
spectacular failure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the Court of Appeal's ruling Thursday, Lord  
Justice Christopher Rose called the evidence against Abbas Gokal 
``overwhelming'' and said he was at the heart of a highly 
sophisticated fraud ``with international consequences of great 
gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal, 62, is serving a 14-year sentence for two counts of  
conspiracy -- plotting to commit false accounting and conspiring to 
defraud BCCI -- in a fraudulent scheme that funneled $1.2 billion 
out of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the sentencing, the judge said his actions had threatened the  
integrity of the entire international banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main grounds of Gokal's appeal had been the  
circumstances in which he was brought within this jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal was arrested in July 1994 in Frankfurt, Germany, as his  
flight from Karachi, Pakistan, to the United States stopped for 
refueling. He was extradited to Britain in December 1994 and went 
on trial in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors convicted him after hearing prosecutors from Britain's  
Serious Fraud Office contend that he had siphoned the money out of 
BCCI and then used it to pay for private jets, fancy homes and 
Rolls-Royces. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal said he was innocent and had to use public assistance to  
get legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gokal's Gulf Group, a Middle East shipping company, was the  
biggest borrower from BCCI. He and his brothers, Mustafa and 
Murtaza, once controlled more than 100 shipping vessels in the 
Middle East, but their financial empire ran into trouble in the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, BCCI kept giving them money and juggled its books to  
try to cover up the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustafa and Murtaza Gokal have avoided prosecution by staying in  
Pakistan, which has no extradition treaty with Britain. Other 
alleged conspirators are out of the reach of British justice, 
mostly in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Tar Heels Want Old Mystique Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Three losses to ACC rival Duke and two more to  
Maryland were tough enough to handle. Now, North Carolina is trying 
to regain some of its swagger after finding itself in the 
unfamiliar position of being overlooked in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year is similar to my freshman year,'' 6-foot-9 forward  
Ademola Okulaja said Wednesday. ``The stands (during practice at 
Seattle's Key Arena) weren't full. There was a clap here and there 
and some stupid comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people don't expect too much and don't think we're a  
good team. But we're going to try and prove them wrong. We don't 
play for the crowd. We play for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels (24-9), the No. 3 seed in the West, will open  
tournament play tonight against No. 14-seed Weber State (24-7). 
</P>
<P>
	In other games at the Key Arena today, No. 7 Minnesota (17-10)  
met No. 10 Gonzaga (25-6), No. 2 Stanford (25-6) played No. 15 
Alcorn State (22-6) and No. 6 Florida (20-8) faces No. 11 
Pennsylvania (21-5). 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota wasn't sure of the status of four players, including  
starters Miles Tarver and Kevin Clark, because of an academic 
scandal on the Minneapolis campus. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the university started an investigation of a report  
in Wednesday's Saint Paul Pioneer Press quoting a former university 
employee as saying she did take-home exams and other course work 
for the four current players and at least 16 former players. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Tarver and Clark, the Minnesota players named in  
the Press story were Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, beaten by Duke 96-73 in the ACC tournament  
championship game Sunday, qualified for the NCAA tournament for a 
record 25th consecutive year. That wasn't enough for spoiled Tar 
Heels' fans, whose favorite team won the NCAA title in 1993 under 
Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Guthridge, Smith's former assistant who replaced him when  
he retired before the 1997-98 season, understands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been better to stay closer to home because that  
would have meant we had done better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this year Duke and Maryland both did better than we did.  
We deserve to come out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthridge took North Carolina to the Final Four last season,  
where the Tar Heels lost to Utah in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Although North Carolina lost six ACC games this season, the Tar  
Heels are confident they will play well in the NCAA tournament. 
They used a zone defense to help beat Maryland in the ACC 
tournament semis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels are bigger than Weber State, winner of the Big Sky  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to go,'' North Carolina freshman forward Kris Lang  
said. ``We know that we have a height advantage and we're going to 
utilize it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're smaller and hopefully we can score over them,''  
Okulaja said. ``I'll try to go as far as possible because it's my 
last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina-Weber State game could be the final one for  
Ron Abegglen, 62, who has announced he will retire after this 
season. The announcement came in August, after he was placed on 
administrative leave for three weeks after being accused of 
domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Weber State made the NCAA tournament and beat  
Michigan State before losing to the Allen Iverson-led Georgetown 
53-51. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as emotional as I thought I'd be,'' Abegglen said. ``I  
might shed a tear or two, but you're not going to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weber State feature 6-6 junior forward Harold Arceneuax, the Big  
Sky player of the year who comes into the tournament averaging 21.5 
points.

<HEADLINE> Reports: FBI Probes UCLA Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI is investigating members of the UCLA  
football team for an alleged point-shaving scheme last season, 
according to the Los Angeles Times and a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players have been questioned by FBI agents since an  
investigation was launched three weeks ago, and star quarterback 
Cade McNown underwent a polygraph test and passed, the Times 
reported in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	KFWB-AM radio reported the investigation Wednesday night, citing  
unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times cited unnamed sources who indicated that a reputed New  
York mobster might have connections to some team members. 
</P>
<P>
	All players have been exonerated so far, both news organizations  
said. However, no other names or specific allegations were 
released. It was not immediately clear if the allegations involved 
one or more games. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, agents wanted to speak to four players, and at least  
one interview has yet to be scheduled, the Times quoted sources as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for McNown issued a statement Wednesday that  
confirmed he was among those the FBI questioned, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown voluntarily took the lie detector test, passed it and was  
told ``there would be no further inquiry necessary,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Dellins, UCLA's sports information director, did not  
immediately return phone calls placed to his office and home 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also did not return phone calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	UCLA spokeswoman Diana DeCardenas said she had not heard about  
an investigation and referred calls to Dellins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard about this,'' DeCardenas said. ``This is the  
first we have heard of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA Athletic Director Pete Dalis told the Times the university  
had notified Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of gambling and agents, 
of the FBI inquiry. Dalis stressed that agents ``assured'' UCLA the 
FBI had ``no concerns regarding the conduct of UCLA or any of its 
student-athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA finished the season with a 10-2 record, winning its first  
10 games before losing at Miami 49-45 on Dec. 5. The Bruins then 
lost to Wisconsin 38-31 in the Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA won the Pacific-10 Conference championship and was ranked  
second in the country before losing to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, expected to be a first-round selection in next month's  
NFL draft, left the university after the Rose Bowl to focus on 
preparing for his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two games, the defense gave up a lot of points,''  
senior linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo told the Times. He said has 
not been approached by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayanbadejo said point shaving wouldn't make sense for UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
	``But when something like point shaving comes up, how does the  
defense have any control over point shaving?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Brad Melsby also told the paper: ``From what I  
understand, they're looking for some sort of point deal. They're 
not going to find anything. We all know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melsby also said he has not been interviewed by the FBI.  
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the investigation told the Times that the  
Bruin players had been observed and possibly photographed in recent 
months with Dominic Montemarano, 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Montemarano, also known as ``Donny Shacks,'' was convicted in  
1987 in federal court of racketeering charges. He was sentenced to 
18 years in federal prison, but later released from federal 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	A source recalled seeing 20 to 25 current or former UCLA players  
at a Long Beach restaurant. Sitting with them, the source said, was 
Montemarano, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that Montemarano could not be reached for  
comment at his home in suburban Century City.

<HEADLINE> Report: IOC Official Knew of Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former organizer at the heart of the Salt Lake  
Olympic bribery scandal says the senior U.S. official of the games 
knew about the vote-buying scheme, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson, who was senior vice president of the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee and long involved in the city's Olympic 
campaign, told The New York Times that he discussed ``everything'' 
about the program with Anita DeFrantz, an International Olympic 
Committee member from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz denied Johnson's statement, which marked the first time  
that the current IOC vice president and highest-ranking woman in 
the Olympic community was said to have had direct knowledge of the 
cash-and-gifts plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1992 to 1995, every time we had an IOC member visit Salt  
Lake, she either flew to Salt Lake or during their visit would talk 
to them on the telephone,'' Johnson said of DeFrantz. ``She would 
call me and ask, 'Was he good or was he bad?' She wanted to know if 
someone had asked us to do something that would put us in a 
difficult position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who resigned in January and has been identified as one  
of the operators of the inducement scheme, told the Times that if 
an IOC member had demanded favors, DeFrantz's response was, 
``'That's not good,' or something like that. She didn't say, 'Don't 
do it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said the discussions Johnson described ``never  
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never asked if it was OK, or if they should do anything,  
or if it was a way to win the games,'' she told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal  
and 19 others remain under investigation. De Frantz has not been 
implicated in any of the half-dozen investigations made public so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report also said that minutes of the bid committee's  
senior management meetings and the handwritten notes of the lawyer 
who was the committee's secretary for 1994-95 were shredded or 
otherwise destroyed in the offices of Ray Quinney &AMP; Nebeker, the 
bid committee's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	James S. Jardine, the firm's managing director who also served  
as the bid committee's lawyer, said the documents detailed the 
committee's actions over the final months of the bid process and 
were the only files destroyed. He could offer no reason for the 
action or say who might have carried it out.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs ATM Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee has overwhelmingly  
approved a measure that would require ATM surcharges to be 
disclosed clearly at teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted 48-1 on Wednesday to attach the measure to  
larger legislation it is drafting to remove Depression-era barriers 
between banks, securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, a consumer activist criticized a closed-door  
meeting Tuesday between Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil 
Gramm, R-Texas, and lobbyists from the three industries. Gramm 
discussed with the industry representatives how they could lobby 
senators on his version of a financial overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad he doesn't call us in, to get the consumer  
perspective across to him,'' said Mary Griffin, insurance counsel 
for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATM surcharge measure would require clear disclosure of the  
surcharges, which come on top of charges by customers' own banks 
for using a machine operated by another bank. The double charges 
would have to be posted on the ATMs and on the terminal screen 
after consumers log in. Consumers would have to be given the chance 
to terminate their transaction before paying the surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
	Most banks already do those things voluntarily, but surveys by  
the consumer organization U.S. Public Interest Research Group 
indicate that 10 percent to 15 percent of ATMs nationwide do not.

<HEADLINE> Panel in Bank Policy Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee appeared  
deadlocked Thursday over a measure to protect the privacy of 
consumers doing business with the financial conglomerates that 
would be created under sweeping legislation the panel is preparing. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress tries again to lift the Depression-era barriers  
against mergers between banks, securities firms and insurance 
companies, there have been fears about how customer information 
will be shared among affiliates of the big new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee on Thursday spent its third day laboring  
on a draft of the overall bill, for which the Clinton 
administration has expressed strong support, with several lawmakers 
and aides working behind the scenes on the privacy measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, sponsored by Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the  
panel's senior Democrat, and Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., would be 
attached to the financial overhaul legislation. It would require 
new financial conglomerates to give consumers the right to opt out 
of arrangements for sharing of all of their personal data with 
affiliated companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an ``opt-out'' is considered less stringent than an  
``opt-in,'' which requires a consumer's express written consent 
before personal data can be used by a financial institution or 
disclosed to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and aides of the banking panel struggled Wednesday  
night and Thursday to come up with a proposal, LaFalce said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy is such an important issue for the average person,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal banking regulators also have pointed to consumers'  
growing fears about companies' enhanced ability to track, use and 
even sell personal financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the legislation would create serious privacy risks for Americans as 
banks, brokerages and insurers compiled profiles of customers' 
buying habits, hobbies and even health information. 
</P>
<P>
	A hypothetical scenario: A woman's husband has died, and she's  
received a check from his life insurance policy. The insurance 
company tips off an affiliated securities firm, and she starts 
getting phone calls from a broker trying to sell her the latest hot 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Or: A bank customer applies for a loan. The loan officer then  
checks with the bank's affiliated health insurance company and 
discovers that the customer has cancer. The loan is denied for that 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	But legislation to protect privacy could jeopardize industry  
backing for the overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists for the three financial-services industries indicated  
Thursday that adoption of such a privacy measure could kill their 
support for the overall legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one of the key reasons that Wall Street, the banking  
industry and insurers have been pushing financial overhaul 
legislation is that it would open numerous opportunities for them 
to market their services by using shared customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	A current example is the big effort by financial giant Citigroup  
to sell Citibank customers the investments and insurance offered by 
the bank's merger partner, Travelers Group. Over the next six 
months, New York-based Citibank plans to train and license up to 
3,000 of its branch employees in financial analysis and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, created by one of the biggest mergers in U.S.  
corporate history, got permission from the Federal Reserve to 
operate for several years -- so the company didn't have to wait for 
enactment of financial overhaul legislation before it combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Banking Committee's conciliatory mood shifted  
Wednesday, it overwhelmingly approved a compromise provision 
requiring ATM surcharges to be clearly disclosed at the automated 
teller machines. The 48-1 vote attached the surcharge measure to 
the financial overhaul legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharges come on top of charges by customers' own banks  
for using a teller machine operated by another bank.

<HEADLINE> Judge Tosses Questioned Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge dismissed murder charges Thursday against  
a man who spent nearly 17 years on death row before Northwestern 
University student journalists helped gather evidence to clear him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm personally and profoundly grateful that we were spared the  
unthinkable, unthinkable conclusion to this case,'' Cook County 
Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald said in clearing Anthony Porter, 
who had been just two days away from being executed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm innocent of all charges. Thank God, I'm free,'' Porter  
said as he walked out of the courtroom, flanked by his attorneys 
and a crowd of well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Supreme Court decided two days before Porter's  
execution date that his case merited another look based on his 
attorneys' claims that his low I.Q. made him mentally unfit to be 
killed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released Feb. 5 after journalism professor David Protess  
and several students from his investigative reporting class at 
Northwestern gathered evidence suggesting Porter had been wrongly 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, key witnesses have recanted their testimony and  
another man, Alstory Simon of Milwaukee, was recorded on videotape 
admitting to the 1982 shooting deaths of two teen-agers in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Private investigator Paul Ciolino elicited the confession from  
Simon by using a phony eyewitness account. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is the 11th death row inmate exonerated in Illinois since  
capital punishment was reinstated in 1977. Since 1977, Illinois has 
executed 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Gainer, an assistant state's attorney, moved to have the  
murder charges dismissed after deciding that ``the evidence is 
compelling that Mr. Porter is innocent of the murders.'' But he 
asked for a separate hearing on an armed robbery charge, saying the 
evidence on that charge was not as overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fitzgerald suggested it was unlikely Porter would face  
anything more than time served if those charges are not dropped at 
the April 20 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's attorney, Daniel Sanders, said Porter was innocent of  
the armed robbery as well and that he expected the worst that could 
happen was a new trial in which Porter would be found innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's immediate plans included a celebratory dinner. Marshall  
Hartman, another of his attorneys, said he planned to take his 
client out for a good steak.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Export Hopes / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures posted gains in trading  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat opened lower on thoughts that Wednesday's rally may have  
been overdone, but rebounded to close mostly higher. Market 
participants were enthusiastic about export prospects and potential 
production problems in China and Russia, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans opened lower on bearish news from the latest U.S.  
Agriculture Department supply/demand report, but recovered to close 
slightly higher. The USDA report showed a sharp increase in soybean 
ending stocks as demand in the United States continues to slip. But 
analysts said much of the negative news had already been factored 
into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices climbed higher following gains in soy meal and a rally in  
the soy oil market, as well as the continuation of a seasonal 
upswing. Soybeans also followed wheat as it rallied. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn followed wheat higher and also received mild support from  
the USDA report. There was favorable news of raised export sales 
and lower-than-expected ending stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 2 cents to $2.77 1/4 a bushel; May  
corn was up 1 cent to $2.24 1/2 per bushel; May oats were up 2 cents 
to $1.11 1/2 per bushel; May soybeans were up 1 1/4 cents to $4.78 cents 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle, lean hogs and pork bellies all 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures were off 1.10 cent to 67.40 cents per  
pound; March feeder cattle was off .47 cent to 72.00 cents per 
pound; April lean hogs were off .63 cent to 42.67 cents per pound; 
May pork bellies were off .80 cent to 50.75 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Church Gunman Kills Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- The pastor had just started reading a Bible  
lesson about being born again when the gunman kicked open the 
doors, fired twice into the ceiling and ordered everybody to hit 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	He then marched down the aisle, shooting between the benches as  
screaming parishioners scattered in horror and pausing once to 
calmly reload. Among the crowd, police said, were the man's wife 
and child. 
</P>
<P>
	``His little boy turned and said, `Daddy.' That's when he shot.  
He hit his wife first and then the baby,'' congregation member 
Lolita Enkadi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then he just started emptying his gun. He shot one in the  
back of the head. We were all trying to get down. I just lay on the 
bench and started praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shon Miller's wife and son and another member of the New St.  
John Fellowship Baptist Church congregation were killed and four 
others were wounded Wednesday night at the one-story stucco church 
20 miles southeast of Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller also shot his mother-in-law to death at home before  
traveling the few blocks to the church, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safest place in world I always thought was a church and  
now that sanctuary has been broken,'' police Chief Bill Landry 
said. ``We'll all be a long time getting over this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said it took three hours of searching around the  
single-family homes and winter cabbage gardens near the church in 
this small town of 7,000 before they found Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	When they discovered him in a shed about 100 yards away, he  
tried to kill himself, Landry said. An officer blasted the pistol 
out of his hand with a shotgun at close range, wounding him. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was taken to Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans,  
where he was listed in guarded condition. He was paralyzed from the 
waist down with buckshot wounds to the back, right hand and face, 
said hospital spokesman Jerry Romig. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller will be charged with four counts of first-degree murder  
and three counts of attempted first-degree murder, Landry said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the firing started, about 50 to 75 worshippers were inside  
the building where the congregation is holding services while the 
big brick church down the street is renovated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Wilbert Holmes said he thought it was some kind of  
prank when the gunman burst through the foyer doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he started shooting,'' Holmes said ``I would think I was  
his easiest target. Everybody else was sitting down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his targets were in the congregation.  
</P>
<P>
	The shooting lasted long enough for the gunman to empty one clip  
in the semi-automatic pistol and then reload and continue shooting 
into the pews. As he left, Holmes heard him mumble something like, 
``That will show you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landry said investigators were still compiling the names of the  
victims, but the minister said the slain wife was Carla Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the other victims were a 53-year-old woman and  
19-year-old man. Two people were hospitalized in critical 
condition, and two teen-agers were in good condition -- one of them 
Ms. Enkadi's 16-year-old son, Donald Rideau, who was shot in the 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadine Wilson, Mrs. Miller's cousin, said the Millers married  
about two years ago and that she left him shortly later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a domestic problem that turned into domestic  
violence,'' Landry said.

<HEADLINE> US Rescues Cost Taxpayers Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal taxpayers pay millions of dollars a  
year to rescue capsized boaters, stranded hikers or injured campers 
-- as well adventurers whose own actions get them into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Coast Guard and the National Park Service, two  
federal agencies with multimillion-dollar search-and-rescue 
operations, say they're not in the business of deciding which 
rescues are warranted and which aren't. But lawmakers in some 
states want those who disregard warnings to pick up the costs of 
rescuing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said they don't want to send out bills because  
it might discourage those in need from calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if a small child is missing and we need a number of  
helicopters?'' asked Ken Phillips, the search and rescue 
coordinator at Grand Canyon National Park, which charges only for 
transporting an injured person to a hospital. ``If we have the 
feeling that it places a financial burden on the family, it's 
almost going to cause emergency response personnel to want to take 
short cuts. That's going to hurt victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some state lawmakers say that people who get into danger  
because they ignore warnings should pay for the rescues themselves 
instead of having taxpayers pick up the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard spent $380 million of its $4 billion budget on  
search-and-rescue operations in 1997, while the National Park 
Service spent $3.4 million the same year, the most recent figures 
available. The Air Force also helped with rescues but did not have 
figures immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The totals include rescues of people who became endangered by  
unforeseen circumstances as well as those who were taking risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, at least 95 ice fishermen have been rescued from  
lakes in one area alone this winter, prompting state lawmakers to 
introduce legislation requiring those who put themselves in danger 
by ignoring warnings to pay rescue costs, or perform community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the Coast Guard and local agencies spent a total of  
$85,000 to rescue 18 fishermen from an ice floe that broke off in 
Michigan's Lake St. Clair and was sinking in a snowstorm. The 
operation, conducted in gusty winds that drove wind chills below 
zero, required several boats and a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the fishermen used bad judgment by going out on  
the lake too early in the season, before the ice was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people just defy the laws of consequence,'' said  
Democratic state Rep. William Callahan, a sponsor of the measure. 
``They will think twice before they do something stupid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar bills have been introduced annually in Hawaii, where  
federal and county rescuers spent $75,000 in 1992 to rescue a movie 
cameraman trapped in a steaming volcanic crater. The cameraman had 
been shooting movie footage of the world's most active volcano, 
Kilauea. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service in 1993 considered requiring mountain  
climbers and others engaged in risky adventures to pay for their 
own rescues, but dropped the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, some national parks are stepping up efforts to  
discourage reckless behavior and thrill seekers. At Denali National 
Park and Preserve in Alaska, hikers who wish to climb Mount 
McKinley, North America's highest peak, must register in advance 
and list previous mountain climbs. In addition, each climber is 
charged $150, which helps finance rescues. 
</P>
<P>
	Others think the federal government should ask risk-takers to  
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point: the $130,275 the Coast Guard spent to rescue  
three balloonists who failed in their attempt to circle the world 
and ditched their craft off Oahu, Hawaii, on Christmas Day. The 
balloonists included Richard Branson, the British chairman of the 
Virgin records, soda and airlines empire, and U.S. millionaire 
Steve Fossett. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rescue, Branson said he would pay if asked. But the  
Coast Guard didn't ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who knowingly take a risk to try to set a record ought  
to assume the financial costs,'' said Peter Sepp, a spokesman for 
the National Taxpayers Union, a Washington-based group that 
advocates less government spending. ``These are people who know the 
dangers but are going ahead anyway. Taxpayers should not subsidize 
thrill seekers.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks Acquire Turkcan, Sign Camby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks made two moves Thursday,  
signing Marcus Camby to a six-year, $39 million extension and 
obtaining the rights to Mirsad Turkcan from Philadelphia for a 
first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby, who has seen limited playing time this season after being  
acquired from Toronto in the Charles Oakley trade, gets $31.25 
million guaranteed over the first five years, with the team holding 
an option for a sixth year. 
</P>
<P>
	With incentives, the contract could be worth as much as $48  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was traded here, I knew it was a place I wanted to be  
for a long time,'' Camby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came on the day of the NBA trading deadline  
</P>
<P>
	Camby, the second overall pick of the 1996 draft, ended up  
getting much less than other players in that class. Allen Iverson, 
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Kobe Bryant, Antoine Walker, 
Ray Allen and Zydrunas Ilgauskas all signed extensions for $70.9 
million -- the maximum allowed under the new collective bargaining 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied. I'm content. I'm set financially for the rest  
of my life,'' Camby said. ``I really can't worry about what the 
next man gets, I'm just happy for everyone who got an extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkcan, the 18th pick overall of the 1998 draft, is currently  
playing for Efes Pilssen of the Turkish League. He will be eligible 
to join the Knicks in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	He was originally drafted by Houston, then was traded to  
Philadelphia after the lockout ended in order to clear salary cap 
space for the Rockets' acquisition of Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will give the 76ers a first-round draft pick that  
originally belonged to Toronto. The Knicks acquired it from the 
Raptors in the John Wallace trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The pick is lottery-protected, meaning Philadelphia won't get it  
until Toronto makes the playoffs.

	SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- The Rev. Jan Paulsen has been elected  
president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulsen, vice president since 1995, is a native of Norway and is  
the first European to lead the denomination which has 9.7 million 
members worldwide and 876,000 in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulsen succeeds the Rev. Robert Folkenberg, 58, president since  
1990, who submitted his resignation in February. The church had 
ordered a special investigation of his business dealings after a 
California businessman sued Folkenberg and the church, accusing 
them of reneging on a 1993 business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulsen, a one-time local pastor, teacher and college president,  
is a graduate of Andrews University, an Adventist school in 
Michigan, and the University of Tuebingen in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Adventist church, known for Saturday worship and  
evangelistic efforts, is a fast-growing denomination that claims 
five new congregations per day.

 *Caribbean islands added to U.S. diocese    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Archdiocese of Newark now includes part  
of the Caribbean -- the Turks and Caicos islands. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of U.S. dioceses have served parishes overseas, but  
this is the first time a foreign territory has officially joined a 
U.S. diocese, diocesan spokesman Brian Hyland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen or so resort islands, about 90 miles north of the  
Dominican Republic, have been colonies of Great Britain for two 
centuries. But the Vatican asked Archbishop Theodore McCarrick to 
take charge of the islands' Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the archdiocese sent two priests to aid two  
seminarians serving pastoral assignments on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarrick, president of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico  
in the 1960s, has been active for years in Caribbean parishes. The 
archdiocese currently serves parishes in Puerto Rico.

 *Deaf churches share $1 million    	
</P>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two Alabama churches for the deaf will  
share a $1 million bequest from a friend of the pastor who 
pioneered deaf ministry in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The churches, both Episcopalian, are St. John's Church for the  
Deaf in Cahaba Heights and St. Mark's Church for the Deaf in 
Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefactor, Mary Brigham, died in 1998. She was a friend of  
St. John's founder, the Rev. Robert C. Fletcher, and his wife, 
Estelle. Ms. Brigham was not deaf, but the Fletchers were. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fletchers' children, including actress Louise Fletcher who  
won an Oscar for her role as Nurse Ratchet in ``One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest,'' were on hand when the money was presented to the 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is, 'Thank God,''' the actress said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brigham and her mother had become friends of Mrs. Fletcher

marriage.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's up to the pope, of course, but Cardinal  
John O'Connor says this may be his last year as archbishop of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter inviting all the priests of the archdiocese to an  
annual Mass celebrating the priesthood, O'Connor said, ``I don't 
want to sentimentalize this, but it is obvious that this may well 
be my final Chrism Mass as archbishop of New York. Your 
participation with as many of your parishioners as possible would 
therefore be especially welcomed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mass is scheduled for March 30, five days before Easter.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor will be 80 in January, and church law prohibits  
cardinals from voting for a new pope or holding certain church 
offices after age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor has been archbishop since 1984 and a cardinal since  
1985.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Trade Barnaby to Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres traded disgruntled  
forward Matthew Barnaby to Pittsburgh for Stu Barnes on Thursday 
night, ending months of speculation about Barnaby's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby asked for a trade last year, but then led the team into  
the Stanley Cup semifinals with 13 points in the playoffs after the 
Sabres talked him into staying. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, who scored 30 goals and 65 points in his best season  
last year, will join his fourth team in his eighth season in the 
NHL. The 28-year-old center has 20 goals and 12 assists in 64 games 
this season, and a plus-minus rating of minus-12. He was tied for 
third in the league with 15 power-play goals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to coming to Buffalo,'' said Barnes, who  
added that he planned to be at the Sabres' practice Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes' 13 power-play goals this season made him especially  
attractive to the offense-hungry Sabres, who went 0-for-6 on the 
power play in a 5-2 loss to Tampa Bay on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he's going to bring offense,'' Sabres general  
manager Darcy Regier said. ``He has very good play-making skills 
and we think he's going to help us in a lot of areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby, unhappy since the departure of former coach Ted Nolan  
in the summer of 1997, led the team in playoff goals last season 
after asking to be traded. This year, he was back in the trade mix. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden I was losing fans and friends, and I never  
want to be known like that, and it will never happen again,'' 
Barnaby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby asked to be traded last year just before the deadline,  
but a deal was never made. Barnaby had seven goals in 15 playoff 
games last season after having just five in 72 games during the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time coming,'' Barnaby said. ``It's time for  
a change. Relief I guess would be the word. It got to the point 
where the only time I felt happy was when I heard my name in trade 
rumors, and that's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres saw the trade as necessary as much to shake things up  
as to unload Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that we neeed to make a change, whether it was minor or  
not, quite a while ago,'' Regier said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being happy is what I want to be,'' Barnaby said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rob Ray was happy for his friend.  
</P>
<P>
	``In a way I'm mad that he won't be a member of our team, but  
I'm also happy that it's over for him,'' he said. ``He can put 
everything behind him and concentrate on hockey again.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Accused of Fraud Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's investigators alleged  
for the first time Thursday that a fraudulent loan to Susan 
McDougal in the 1980s was used to retire a $27,600 debt in 
President Clinton's name that was taken out for their Whitewater 
land venture. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening testimony at Mrs. McDougal's obstruction of justice  
and contempt trial, FBI agent Mike Patkus told jurors he would have 
liked to ask her ``whether Bill Clinton had any knowledge'' about 
the link between the two loans but she refused to answer questions 
before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have used the early stages of Mrs. McDougal's trial  
to air evidence they say calls into question the president's sworn 
testimony during a 1996 criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of Patkus' testimony, McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos  
attacked Starr's tactics. He said prosecutors had let Mrs. McDougal 
``languish in jail'' and did not even try to question her about the 
Clinton loan while they attended to the needs of her ex-husband, 
who was cooperating with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from Geragos, Patkus told how Jim McDougal had  
been moved from a Kentucky prison he did not like to one in Texas 
he favored. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison move is ``personally offensive,'' said Geragos, who  
suggested that Starr had interceded with the federal Bureau of 
Prisons to arrange it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 trial, Clinton testified he never received any loans  
from the failed savings and loan owned by James and Susan McDougal 
and also knew nothing about the fraudulent $300,000 loan she 
received in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus testified that using microfilm records he discovered that  
the McDougals' S&AMP;L had made out a loan and cashier's check totaling 
$27,600 to then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The check -- which does not bear Clinton's endorsement -- paid off  
an earlier debt in the Whitewater real estate venture started by 
the Clintons, Mrs. McDougal and her ex-husband, James, who died 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus then traced for the jury a series of complex transactions  
that he said showed how the 1982 Clinton loan came to be reimbursed 
through the $300,000 loan Mrs. McDougal took out from a Small 
Business Administration-backed lender four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent said that Mrs. McDougal paid off part of the Clinton  
loan and that Whitewater real estate salesman Chris Wade paid off 
the rest, using money he borrowed from Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI agent testified that the Wade loan was eventually paid  
off with a check from Whitewater, which was replenished with money 
from a bank loan to the McDougals, who then used money from the 
$300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal to pay off the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus testified that he discovered the microfilmed copy of the  
Clinton check in early December 1996 after James McDougal tipped 
off Starr's office about it. Starr's office got the original check 
in 1997 from the trunk of an abandoned car hit by a tornado south 
of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, has suggested in the past that  
James McDougal simply made out the check and that Clinton didn't 
know about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, however, Starr deputy Hickman Ewing said  
that ``the question remains whether Bill Clinton knew about it or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Mrs. McDougal, who listened intently to Patkus' testimony,  
Ewing said, ``She smiled in the courtroom like maybe she knows the 
answers.'' Patkus revealed that he and another FBI agent had 
discovered a handwritten document from Madison Guaranty identifying 
apparent borrowers. ``B Clinton'' is among the names on the paper, 
Patkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly refused to testify about the loans,  
despite being granted limited immunity from prosecution after being 
convicted in May 1996 on four felony counts regarding the $300,000 
loan which was deposited in her and her husband's personal checking 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she knows of no crimes involving the Clintons and that  
Starr's office is trying to get her to lie about the first family. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Whitewater prosecutors made their comments Thursday  
about linking the $300,000 loan to Clinton, a House Judiciary 
Committee official asked the local federal court to supply it with 
key documents from the case. Majority Republican officials said 
they did not make the request. Democratic officials could not 
immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, which is the one that voted to impeach Clinton,  
called the district court clerk's office seeking a copy of Mrs. 
McDougal's indictment, her request to have the indictment 
dismissed, the government's response to the request and the judge's 
order turning down Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	The clerk's office was carrying out the request.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was charged with two counts of criminal contempt  
and one count of obstruction of justice after refusing to testify 
before the grand jury in September 1996 and April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Vienna Philharmonic Returns to NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two years after it voted to end its ban against  
women, the Vienna Philharmonic was back in New York, still not a 
female face in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra's all-Mozart program Thursday night at Carnegie  
Hall began a tour that takes it to New York for three concerts and 
to Japan for five. Because the three Mozart symphonies didn't 
require a harp, the only female among the orchestra's 170-person 
membership, Anna Lelkes, wasn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 155-year-old ban against women was ended in February  
1997, only one other female has passed through auditions to the 
hiring stage: harpist Julie Palloc. And the orchestra says she 
won't be eligible for full membership until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Change clearly does not come easy to this group of Austrians,  
neither in hiring nor in sound. Their program under conductor 
Riccardo Muti was as mainstream as conceivable: Symphonies Nos. 38, 
36 and 40, plus an encore of ``The Marriage of Figaro'' overture. 
</P>
<P>
	In passage after passage, those creamy strings dominated, just  
as they have for years. Each section stays together so precisely 
that individual instruments are rarely heard unless that is what 
the conductor wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Muti, who also led the orchestra on last year's U.S. tour,  
seemed much more at ease than he did during his New York 
Philharmonic debut in January. He has a long relationship with the 
Viennese and conducted this same program in Vienna about six weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no extremes in his interpretations, just a  
flawlessness in sound. While it is fulfilling, it is rarely moving. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the evening, the orchestra played a  
conductorless version of Mozart's ``Maurerische Trauermusik,'' in 
memory of Judith Arron, the late executive director of Carnegie 
Hall, and then stood in a moment of silence. Miss Arron, who 
brought the orchestra to Carnegie Hall for 33 concerts during her 
10 years in charge, was voted the Vienna Philharmonic's Franz 
Schalk Gold Medal in September. She died of cancer in December.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Tickets Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the countdown to the Women's World Cup enters  
its final 100 days, ticket sales have been stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-team soccer championship opens June 19 at Giants Stadium,  
with the United States playing Denmark. The title game is July 10 
at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 260,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament,  
including 45,000 since last month's draw. And the biggest 
promotional campaigns have yet to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of demand, anticipation and excitement  
for the tournament,'' Marla Messing, president of the U.S. 
organizers, said during a conference call Thursday. ``We expect 
full or almost full stadiums for certain games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been well beyond where we expected it to be. The best  
benchmark is we hoped to be at 95,000 as of December '98, and at 
that point we were at about 200,000 tickets sold. We believe we 
will be between 400,000 and 500,000 for the tournament, and our 
earlier projections were about 380,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are especially impressive because they seem to be  
driven by the faithful soccer fan. The general American sports 
fans, who usually rally around major events -- the men's World Cup 
five years ago was the most profitable in history -- haven't gotten 
as involved in ticket-buying yet, another encouraging sign for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets prices average from $9-$75, depending on the location,  
and are sold in strips for each site. Individual game tickets are 
not yet on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1994 men's World Cup in the United States, tickets were  
priced at $25-$475 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the demand is greater than we had projected,''  
Messing said. ``It's one of two things: the people we thought would 
buy are buying a whole lot earlier, or a lot of people are 
interested in coming to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense is it is a soccer crowd, because the sales are  
driven by word of mouth or when the U.S. team appears on TV. We 
believe it is a sophisticated soccer audience buying the tickets, 
and they do not need to see a lot of advertising. We do believe as 
we get closer to the tournament, we will see the `big event people' 
get involved and want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a soccer audience right now, but people, from the '94  
World Cup, have a sense of what it is and they want to be a part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to East Rutherford, N.J., and Pasadena, Calif.,  
games will be held in Chicago; Foxboro, Mass.; Washington; 
Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Calif; and Stanford, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing emphasized that the level of excitement for the third  
Women's World Cup is building abroad, too. While the men's event is 
followed passionately throughout the soccer community, the previous 
two women's tournaments (in China and Norway) weren't nearly so 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a bit difficult to get specific on the legacy of  
the tournament,'' he said, ``but given the reception of the 
tournament in the USA, it has had a significant impact, with 
national teams putting lots of resources behind their teams and 
getting them ready for the World Cup and the Olympics to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``National teams are telling us because of the reception in the  
USA and the attention being given to the women's World Cup, it 
gives them ammunition to go to their federations and get them 
behind the women's team.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on German Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell Thursday after the surprise  
resignation of Germany's finance minister, who many perceived as 
anti-business. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's fall against the yen was driven by the U.S.  
currency's fall against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.33  
Japanese yen, down from 119.88 yen on Wednesday. The euro was 
quoted at $1.1023, up from $1.0940. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold off their dollars and bought euros, Swiss francs  
and British pounds following the abrupt resignation of Oskar 
Lafontaine, Germany's finance minister, who lost a power struggle 
with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came one day after Schroeder warned his Cabinet  
members they were promoting policies he said discouraged investment 
and undermined key government initiatives to fight unemployment, 
two Berlin dailies reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder singled out Lafontaine for having underestimated the  
burden of a new tax plan on industry, the papers said. He also 
criticized plans to impose speed limits and to extend family leave, 
saying those policies would harm business. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Hans Tietmeyer, the influential head of Germany's  
central bank, was quoted as warning that continuing political 
demands could harm the euro. The remarks apparently were directed 
to Lafontaine, who has repeatedly called on the European Central 
Bank to lower interest rates to stimulate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation ``is seen as a very important plus for the  
Europeans because Lafontaine had been seen as something of a 
confrontational policymaker,'' said Lisa Finstrom, a senior 
currency futures analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar came off on that,'' Finstrom said. ``The yen was  
pulled up as the European currencies rallied in the wake of the 
Lafontaine resignation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar started the trading day by falling against the rising  
yen in Asia as Japanese stocks rallied. But the dollar later rose 
as an influential Japanese official, Eisuke Sakakibara, the vice 
Finance Minister for international affairs, said he thought ``an 
excessive rise of the yen is undesirable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rallied further against the yen and the euro during  
European trading, boosted in part by strong U.S. economic data 
showing strong retail growth in February and revised data showing 
an even stronger January. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4541 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4603, and 1.5252 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5222. The British 
pound rose to $1.6364, up from $1.6271. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7743 German 
marks, down from 1.7876; 5.9524 French francs, down from 5.9952; 
and 1,757.47 Italian lire, down from 1,769.91.

<HEADLINE> Privacy for Medical Records Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is considering proposals that would  
restrict access to medical records and require a patient's consent 
before such records leave insurance companies, employers and 
doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Senate bills offered this week would strengthen medical  
records privacy. Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, also may revive a 
privacy bill offered last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, video rental records have greater protection than  
sensitive medical information,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
who proposed a series of greater protections on Wednesday with Sen. 
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bill, backed by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,  
D-S.D., and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., seeks to 
limit access to records that, increasingly, can be moved easily 
from computer to computer. The House sponsor is Rep. Edward Markey, 
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would require a patient's initial consent to use  
medical information for their own treatment or payment of claims. 
The patient again would have to give permission before the 
information could be passed on to another party, such as a drug 
company looking for new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would restrict access to information within  
businesses so that people not directly involved with health 
benefits could not see individual records. Managers who need to 
review costs, for instance, could get aggregate data, but not 
necessarily individual information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have inadequate rules on who can use that information or  
for what purposes,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that drug companies, health researchers, banks and  
cost-cutting employers all have access to individual records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some companies can even sell the information in those files,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has an August deadline for enacting some sort of  
medical privacy legislation. The deadline was included in the 1996 
law, written by former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Kennedy, 
that help workers keep health insurance when they changed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A competing bipartisan privacy bill, by Sen. James Jeffords,  
R-Vt., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is somewhat less strict than 
the Democratic version. 
</P>
<P>
	It would provide the same limits on access within businesses.  
But health insurers could use individual records more easily for 
such purposes as audits and quality-care reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills also seek to strength privacy in medical research,  
with the bipartisan bill requiring the Department of Health and 
Human Services to strengthen protections for federally funded 
research overseen by a review board. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter that also is raising privacy concerns, home  
health care providers soon will begin passing on standardized 
information about their Medicare patients to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last month, about 10,000 home health care agencies have  
been using a 19-page assessment designed by the Health Care 
Financing Administration to collect data on patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Called the Outcome and Assessment Information Set, the survey  
covers a variety of health-related issues and risk factors that 
could affect someone's health, Chris Peacock, an HCFA spokesman, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	These survey includes questions about whether patients are  
depressed or if they have attempted suicide, their financial status 
and living conditions. Home health agencies conduct the assessment 
of the patient within 48 hours of administering care and every 60 
days until service concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the format is new in an effort to standardize the  
information, the assessments are no different from those typically 
conducted by health care providers in evaluating patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to standardize that assessment process,'' Peacock  
said. The data will help ``improve the quality for Americans being 
treated in Medicare-approved institutions.''

<HEADLINE> Activists Pelt Chevron Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Activists angered by the foreign business  
dealings of Chevron Corp. pelted the oil company's chief executive 
with pies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Derr was hit Wednesday as he arrived for a high school  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	In a parody of Chevron's television advertisements, the  
activists yelled: ``Do people really kill Nigerians for oil? People 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police searched for six suspects who fled on foot and face  
misdemeanor battery charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Derr toweled off and then went ahead with his talk.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of environmental groups have claimed that we are  
complicit in several deaths in Nigeria which involved the military 
police, and the fact is we have no involvement whatsoever,'' said 
Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, three members of the Biotic Baking Brigade were  
sentenced to six months in jail for throwing pies at Mayor Willie 
Brown to protest his policies on the homeless.

<HEADLINE> Theater Owners See Kubrick Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Movie theater operators got the first public  
glimpse of a scene from the final film of the late Stanley Kubrick 
-- 90 seconds of a naked Tom Cruise passionately kissing and 
caressing a naked Nicole Kidman. 
</P>
<P>
	The racy segment of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' shown at the ShoWest  
convention Wednesday was personally selected by the famed and 
idiosyncratic director, who died Sunday at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
	After it was screened, there was a brief moment of silence in  
the cavernous hall before the crowd of more than 3,000 applauded 
warmly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's short. It's provocative,'' Warner Bros. chairman and  
co-CEO Terry Semel said. The movie starring the Hollywood couple is 
set for a July 16 release. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Kubrick's death, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' had become the  
stuff of myth in Hollywood. It had a staggering 12-month shooting 
schedule -- the longest ever for a major studio film -- and there 
were questions of whether Kubrick, a notorious perfectionist, would 
ever finish it. Kubrick hadn't made a film since ``Full Metal 
Jacket'' in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of his other films, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' was made under  
extreme secrecy by Kubrick, one of the few directors ever given 
total artistic control. Even the two top executives at Warner Bros. 
-- Semel and Robert Daly -- did not see the movie until last week. 
</P>
<P>
	They watched it in a screening in New York City also attended by  
Kidman and Cruise. Kubrick was so concerned about secrecy that he 
ordered the projectionist to turn his back during the screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the novella ``Dream Story'' by Arthur Schnitzler,  
``Eyes Wide Shut'' was described by Semel as a ``suspenseful story 
about a married couple's sexual obsessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about just how sexual it would be were answered  
immediately at ShoWest, an annual convention for theater operators. 
</P>
<P>
	The clip opened with Kidman standing naked in front of a mirror.  
Cruise, shown nude from the waist up, caresses and kisses her while 
the soundtrack blares a bluesy song with the lyrics, ``Very bad, 
bad things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a film ... that will be rated R,'' Semel said.

<HEADLINE> Tips To Guard Against Pyramid Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission offers these tips for consumers to  
guard themselves against illegal pyramid schemes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid any plan that offers commissions for recruiting  
additional distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Beware of plans that ask new distributors to spend money on  
high-priced inventory. These plans can collapse quickly and also 
may be illegal pyramids in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be cautious of plans that claim you'll make money through  
continued growth of your ``downline'' -- the commissions on sales 
made by new distributors you recruit -- instead of through sales you 
make yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Beware of shills -- ``decoy'' references that the promoter pays  
to describe fictional success in earning money through the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do your homework. Check with your local Better Business Bureau  
and state attorney general about any plan you're considering, 
especially if the claims about your potential earnings or the 
product sound too good to be true.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Premature Births Up for Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of single-born premature babies among  
black women decreased nearly 10 percent between 1989 to 1996 but 
increased 8 percent among whites, government researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Premature births dropped from 180.4 per 1,000 live births among  
black women in 1989 to 162.5 in 1996, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention said Thursday. The rate among whites climbed 
from 74.8 to 80.8. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the narrowing of the racial gap, black babies are still  
nearly twice as likely to be born premature than white ones, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they were unable to explain the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it reflects things such as improved health status  
among African American women in general and possibly improved 
access to prenatal care,'' said Dr. Lucinda England, a CDC 
epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate dropped 3.6 percent among Hispanics, 2.8 percent among  
American Indians and Native Alaskans and 2.3 percent among Asians 
and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures include medically induced births, but Ms. England  
said such births played only a small role in the increase among 
whites. Part of the reason for the increase among white women was a 
jump in the birthrate of infants born at 33 to 36 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the U.S. rate of premature single births inched up 0.3  
percent to 97.3 per 1,000 live births. There was a 19 percent jump 
among premature multiple births.

<HEADLINE> Scarlet Letter Stands on Lawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYSIDE, Wash. (AP) -- Dixie Lyczewski has turned off the  
flashing strobe light, but the 7-foot-tall scarlet ``A'' in her 
front yard will stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The yard display is a result of a dispute between Mrs. Lyczewski  
and her husband, Tim. They separated last August after 26 years of 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 20-year-old daughter, Tarah, built the display using  
plastic irrigation pipe wrapped in red garlands three months ago. 
It's shaped like the letter ``A,'' as in ``adultery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she got the idea from Nathaniel Hawthorne's ``The  
Scarlet Letter'' after her father began dating and moved in with 
another woman before her parents' divorce was final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were raised with high morals,'' she said. ``I told my dad  
that we'll take it down if he stops living with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Lyczewski said he is frustrated about the display, but a  
restraining order prevents him from getting a close look at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to do it to embarrass me, but they're doing a  
better job of embarrassing themselves,'' he said. ``They see it as 
an affair. I'm 48 years old, and I see it as a relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyczewski agreed to turn off a flashing strobe light on the  
display on Tuesday after 208 residents filed a petition to have the 
display removed and the city brought a public-nuisance complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy about it,'' she said. ``But the `A' will stay  
up.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Illinois Guard Official Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Illinois Army National Guard's  
former chief of staff has been charged with using bribes and lying 
under oath to thwart an investigation into his alleged sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. James M. Burgess, recently put on retirement status from  
his $102,907-a-year post, could spend up to 85 years in prison and 
be fined $2.5 million if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-count indictment Wednesday charged him with obstruction  
of a proceeding, two counts of perjury, two counts of bribery, 
three counts of witness tampering and two counts of false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleges he engaged in the illegal acts during an  
investigation into sexual harassment and adultery by the 
Washington-based National Guard Bureau and later the Department of 
the Army, the FBI and a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the perjury charges alleges Burgess lied when he said,  
``I'm not interested in any other woman than my wife. And 
especially if they happen to work for me and they happen to work 
here.''

	Burgess, 52, was arrested Wednesday. His arraignment and custody  
hearing was delayed until Friday. Prosecutor Patrick Chesley said 
he intends to oppose releasing Burgess on bail, saying the law 
allows people to be kept in custody when they might obstruct 
justice or influence witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely surprised and upset the grand jury returned an  
indictment,'' his attorney, Jon Noll, said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment further.  
</P>
<P>
	The probe initially looked into allegations that Burgess  
committed adultery, harassed female employees and was engaged in an 
``improper relationship,'' according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury concluded that not only did Burgess try to thwart  
the investigation but that he had attempted to cover up actual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment cites repeated statements Burgess made under oath  
to a military investigator in 1997 in which he denied any sexual 
harassment. But, according to the indictment, Burgess ``repeatedly 
had sexually harassed, touched in a sexual manner and made improper 
sexual advances toward females.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Nissan, Renault Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA of France are  
likely to reach a broad agreement on some sort of business 
combination as early as next week, Kyodo News service reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Nissan said he couldn't comment on the content  
or the progress of the negotiations, including when a decision 
might be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuing discussions with other companies, including  
Renault, for a business-tie up to improve Nissan's 
competitiveness,'' the spokesman said, adding that ``nothing has 
been decided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyodo reported Friday that Nissan and Renault are hoping to  
reach agreement on some sort of deal, including whether the French 
automaker should acquire a stake of up to 33.4 percent in the 
struggling Japanese automaker, ahead of Nissan's fiscal year end on 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	A 33.4 percent stake gives a shareholder the right to veto key  
company decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the negotiations agenda is the appointment of Renault  
executives to the Nissan board, according to unidentified sources 
cited by Kyodo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, Japan's No. 2 automaker, was forced to rethink its  
restructuring strategy after equity talks with DaimlerChrysler AG 
collapsed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said  
Thursday that it has lowered its rating for Nissan's long-term debt 
because of the company's staggering debt load. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, which has a strong foothold in the European market for  
small cars, appears interested in Nissan's advanced environment 
technologies amid tougher clean-air requirements, Kyodo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies also appear to be a good match because their  
production bases do not overlap, the report added.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexican court has ordered two people  
accused of being leftist rebels to serve five years in prison on 
charges of conspiracy and incitement to rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	Erika Zamora Pardo and Efren Cortez Chavez were sentenced  
Wednesday in Acapulco, the government news agency Notimex said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zamora and Cortez were arrested after a June 7 clash in the  
village of El Charco. Officials say troops on an anti-drug patrol 
stumbled across a meeting of a rebel group at a schoolhouse there 
and that a gunbattle ensued. Eleven people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some villagers claimed troops surrounded the schoolhouse and  
massacred those inside, an account repeatedly denied by the 
government.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Former Venezuelan  
President Carlos Andres Perez said Thursday he will resign from the 
Senate to participate in efforts to rewrite the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez said he is afraid President Hugo Chavez, who led a failed  
coup against him in 1992, will use the Constitutional Assembly to 
create a dictatorship in the South American country. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez made the comments during a visit to the Dominican Republic  
to attend a ceremony honoring Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the former 
leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez claims a new constitution is needed to overhaul a  
political system he blames for Venezuela's persistent poverty, 
despite the country's vast oil reserves. He has called a May 2 
referendum on a new version.

	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican police searched Thursday for  
45 boys who escaped from a juvenile detention center in the western 
city of Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, all younger than 18 years old, fled late Wednesday  
after staging a riot at the center, said Ignacio Salazar Mariscal, 
director of social rehabilitation for Jalisco state. 
</P>
<P>
	One guard was wounded in the riot by 60 youths, who were armed  
with pipes and homemade knives. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys who escaped managed to climb a 16-foot wall surrounding  
the center, Salazar said. The detention facility is located at the 
edge of Guadalajara, 280 miles northwest of Mexico City.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A cholera outbreak has killed  
three senior citizens in El Salvador and sickened at least 100 
other people, health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three deaths occurred in February in communities on the  
outskirts of San Salvador, where the majority of cases have been 
reported, said Carlos Rosales, the director-general of health. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, about 100 people have sought medical treatment  
for cholera at the country's main hospitals, he said. More than 10 
of the cases were registered in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary investigations by a U.S. research team have traced  
the outbreak to bacteria found in vegetables cultivated near the 
main rivers north of San Salvador.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The governor of a central Mexican state said  
he won't allow a country club project that has caused years of 
hostility and violence in a wealthy mountain community south of 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jorge Morales Barud ordered the cancellation of the project  
Wednesday, saying the area it was planned for is an ecological 
reserve, the newspaper Reforma reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one resident of Tepoztlan was killed in clashes over  
the project, which was to include 800 houses, a hotel, an 18-hole 
golf course, a tennis club and a telecommunications center. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the project, planned for 462 acres of private  
land inside the Tepozteco National Park, would harm the environment 
and threaten their small-town lifestyle.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Guillen To Report Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Right fielder Jose Guillen, who missed  
more than two weeks of spring training because of visa problems, 
intends to report to the Pittsburgh Pirates' camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, 22, picked up his visa Thursday at the U.S. consulate  
in the Dominican Republic and caught a flight to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials had questioned the validity of Guillen's marriage  
license. 
</P>
<P>
	The team media guide lists Guillen as single, but Pirates  
general manager Cam Bonifay said Guillen was married in his 
hometown of San Cristobal during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen can expect a chilly reception when he gets to camp.  
Manager Gene Lamont is upset Guillen suggested last week that the 
Pirates were to blame for his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time when guys have to realize they have to take  
care of things themselves,'' Lamont said. ``There was a feeling the 
Pirates weren't helping him. That's a lie. Hopefully, he'll be 
appreciative of what the Pirates have done. ... There comes a time 
when people have to grow up. Maybe this will wake him up.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Pres. Hails Nuclear Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's president trumpeted his  
country's new nuclear status in an annual address Thursday and 
urged a quick move to an Islamic system of government. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition lawmakers led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  
heckled President Rafiq Tarar during the speech, nearly drowning 
him out at times. Wearing black arm bands, the hecklers pounded 
tables, clapped their hands and shouted ``Shame, shame!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bhutto has demanded that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's  
government be removed, accusing it of widespread harassment of 
opponents, interference with the courts, and sanctioning 
extrajudicial killings by the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bhutto has twice been removed from power in Pakistan on  
similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarar, a religious conservative and former judge, advocates a  
strong Islamic system, including the segregation of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised the government's move to enact a controversial  
constitutional amendment that would impose an Islamic system on 
Pakistan. The amendment has been passed by the National Assembly, 
which Sharif controls, but has been held up in the Senate, 
dominated by his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics fear the amendment could lead to a harsh system of  
justice akin to the one imposed by the Taliban religious army that 
rules neighboring Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarar also praised the country's new nuclear status.  
</P>
<P>
	``I pay tribute to the scientists, the architects of the atomic  
program, whose genius, hard labor and perseverance made this feat 
possible,'' Tarar said of last May's underground nuclear 
explosions, which came in response to similar tests by neighbor and 
rival India. ``The decision constitutes a golden page in our 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also lauded Pakistan's new long-range missile, capable of  
carrying a nuclear warhead, as a testament to its military 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who harbor aggressive designs against Pakistan would do  
well to keep this awareness in mind,'' Tarar warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tit-for-tat nuclear tests drew international  
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars in the last 50 years,  
and world leaders fear their dispute over the Himalayan state of 
Kashmir could lead to another war that might escalate into a 
nuclear confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Rice Says He'll Fit in With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Glen Rice says he's ready to hit the  
floor running despite not having played in a game since last 
season, and believes he'll fit in just fine with the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, who called  
Rice ``one of the great players in the NBA today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dapper in a dark blue suit, Rice met with the media Thursday at  
the Forum following his first practice with the Lakers, who 
acquired him a day earlier from Charlotte along with J.R. Reid and 
B.J. Armstrong, who was waived shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was absent from the news conference because he missed an  
airplane flight to California. West said Reid was expected to 
arrive later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Both new players are expected to play for the Lakers on Friday  
night when the team risks a nine-game winning streak against Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets received guard Eddie Jones and forward-center Elden  
Campbell in the blockbuster deal on the eve of the NBA's trade 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I want to do is come here and fit in, help  
this team get to the next level,'' Rice said. ``Just as I expected, 
all the guys welcomed me with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to get this show on the road. We have all the  
pieces of the puzzle, now we have to go out there and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have changed their look substantially in the last two  
weeks, firing coach Del Harris and replacing him with Kurt Rambis; 
signing Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder in each of the 
last seven seasons; and now adding Rice and Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring us a dimension we haven't had here for a  
long, long time,'' West said of Rice. ``I've heard from a number of 
people in the NBA today who thought we did well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to play now, the elbow is 100 percent,'' he said.  
``I've been doing a lot of running, extra running as a matter of 
fact. I don't have time to get rusty, I've always been focused. 
Yeah, I haven't played in any games. (But) I don't think that will 
be a problem at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward acknowledged to be one of the NBA's most  
accurate long-range shooters, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. The three-time All-Star averaged 22.3 points last 
season to rank sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with  
Kobe Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice also figures to make life easier for center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely enough shots for everybody out there,''  
Rice said. ``I'm opening it up for Kobe and Shaq. A lot of people 
have been doubling (O'Neal). I don't know if they're going to want 
to continue doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he believes the Lakers (15-6) should now be  
considered the favorites to win their first NBA championship in 11 
years, Rice replied, ``I feel that way, yeah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it on paper, it has championship written all  
over it,'' he said of his new team. ``But you can't win on paper. 
You have to do it on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the time had come for him to leave the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had three great seasons there, I've got to thank them for  
that,'' he said. ``I'm a Laker. I've got to forget about Charlotte. 
It was something I wanted done. Things weren't going well for me in 
Charlotte. I'm glad that that's over with. I'm where I want to be. 
I'm ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why my last name's Rice, so we can get it cooking.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House and Senate passed bills that would  
give states more flexibility in spending federal aid. But the first 
education votes of the year set in motion a possible showdown with 
President Clinton over his plan to provide money for hiring new 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ed-flex bills, which passed 98-1 in the Senate and  
330-90 in the House on Thursday, are designed to free states from 
some strings attached to federal aid. Yet the Senate version of the 
bill would shift to special education programs money that was 
supposed to help pay for Clinton's new-teachers plan this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill did not include money for special education, so  
House and Senate negotiators will have to work out differences 
between the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators and Democratic lawmakers who helped pass the bill said  
Congress should wait for the upcoming appropriations to increase 
special education financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still time to improve the bill before it goes to the  
president,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who voted for 
the Senate bill despite his opposition to the special-ed provision. 
``I would do all I can to delete (the special education funding) 
amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said he was pleased with the votes,  
the first of this Congress on education issues. The special-ed 
provision, he said, could help Pennsylvania achieve the $600 
million its needs to meet federal demands to educate those 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then there would be a huge amount to hire teachers, for  
after-school programs and for dropout programs,'' Ridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., cast the lone vote against the  
Senate bill. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who tried to increase 
funding for the teacher-hiring plan, did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have chosen the path of partisanship and  
division,'' Mrs. Murray said in a telephone interview Thursday 
after the Senate, voting along party lines, rejected her plan for 
new class money and won the right to shift current new-teacher 
money to special education money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not immediately threaten a veto, but promised to  
work to eliminate the special education funding provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate ... passed an amendment that would allow local  
school districts to completely opt out of class size reduction,'' 
Clinton said in a statement. ``The Senate used this bill to 
undermine one of our most important educational achievements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bills first had strong bipartisan support but quickly became  
mired in each party's efforts to put its own mark on the nation's 
education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley called the Senate vote a  
retreat from a bipartisan agreement made in the spending bill last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokeswoman Julie Green could not estimate how many  
districts would shift their money to special education if given the 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned that this (the amendment) would severely  
hamper the overall effort to reduce class sizes,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	In last fall's spending bill, Congress approved $1.2 billion to  
help schools hire about 30,000 new teachers in the early grades. 
Clinton called for 100,000 new teachers to be hired over seven 
years at a cost of more than $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the federal government, which dictates the rules  
states must follow on special education, provides only 7 percent to 
12 percent of the costs for those programs. The special education 
law allows the federal government to contribute a maximum of 40 
percent of a state's special education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make it clear that our first obligation is to  
fulfill the needs demanded from the laws already on the books,'' 
said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a false choice, said Bob Chase, president of the National  
Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union. ``Both 
Democrats and Republicans would like to see more special education 
funding. But it should be straight funding and not dollars already 
allocated for class-size reduction.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'Lion In Winter' Draws Roars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``What family doesn't have its ups and downs,''  
sighs Eleanor of Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, most don't reach the depths -- or heights -- achieved by  
Eleanor and her estranged husband, Henry II, king of England, in 
``The Lion in Winter.'' James Goldman's comedy is being splendidly 
revived on Broadway by the Roundabout Theater Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Family Feud 1183 A.D. where not only are the  
barbarians at the gate, they are in the castle, as father, mother 
and three sons battle, bribe and backstab their way to power. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite a fight, particularly since the joustings, verbal and  
otherwise, are led by Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing, two 
terrific performers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishburne plays Henry II, king of England and a lot of France,  
too. Channing is Eleanor, his catty, clawing wife who has been 
imprisoned for leading several rebellions against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	But now it's Christmas time -- ``What shall we hang, the holly or  
each other?'' the king remarks -- so Eleanor has been given 
temporary freedom to prowl the castle. 
</P>
<P>
	She stirs up quite a bit of trouble. The question is, who will  
succeed Henry on the throne? The king favors his youngest son, 
John, a pimply, unpleasant youth. The queen wants her oldest child, 
Richard Lionheart, to succeed his father. Then there's the 
calculating middle child, Geoffrey, determined to support whichever 
brother will make him chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
	Causing additional grief is Philip, the ambitious young king of  
France and brother to Henry's young mistress, Alais. Philip 
connives with the best of them, using his sister and his affection 
for Richard for his own gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliances switch, collapse and then reconfigure as the  
combatants on stage look out only for themselves. Conspiracy is the 
order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's vaguely historical play is deliberately anachronistic.  
He uses real people in made-up circumstances. The language and some 
of the situations are oddly modern. So are the relationships, which 
are simultaneously funny and scary.These folks could use a good 
dose of family therapy. But then Christmas always brings out the 
worst in people. 
</P>
<P>
	Channing is delicious. Dressed in fur and bright red, she first  
enters with guns blazing, wittily dismissing her sons and eager to 
settle scores with her errant husband. She is one of those 
performers whose comic timing not only gets laughs but builds 
character. Yet the actress manages to get a little heartache into 
her portrayal, too, particularly in one poignant moment as she 
watches Henry kiss his young mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishburne roars with the power of an aging lion, a beast who  
realizes that he soon will be toothless and forced to pass his 
power to a younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the three sons, Chuma Hunter-Gault, Neal Huff and Keith Nobbs  
are distinctive types: Hunter-Gault all-bluster as Richard, Huff 
all-conniving as Geoffrey and Nobbs all-whining as John. Roger 
Howarth effectively insinuates himself into their lives as the 
sexually ambiguous Philip. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mayer directs the play in full battle mode. He doesn't  
allow the pace to slacken or the actors to let down their guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Better known as a movie than a play (the film starred Peter  
O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn), ``The Lion in Winter'' is 
relentless in its pursuit of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, who died last year, once said ``The Lion in Winter'' is  
``concerned with things that ordinarily are somber: hatred, 
vengeance, lost love, greed, the threat of death, to name a few.'' 
It is, indeed, but it laughs all the way -- and in high style -- to 
its final curtain.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 87.14 at 9,859.98 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil and technology holdings led stocks higher  
today, as the Dow surged past the 9,800 barrier for the first time 
buoyed by a new retail spending report that shows the U.S. economy 
humming along. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 87.14 to 9,859.98, as the blue-chip index set a new record for 
the second day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also were rising.  
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales -- which represent about a third of the nation's  
economic output -- jumped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally 
adjusted $236.5 billion, the Commerce Department said today. That 
came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reflection of the healthy job market, the Labor Department  
said today that first-time claims for unemployment checks remained 
under 300,000 for the sixth consecutive week for the first time 
since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon rose 2 5/16 to 75 5/8 to lead the Dow. Most petroleum stocks  
rose for the second straight day today amid the first rise in oil 
prices in many months. Mobile rose 3 7/8 at 95 1/4 and Texaco was up 2 1/4 
at 56 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big Dow movers included IBM, up 2 15/16 at 184 7/16 and  
American Express, up 2 3/8 at 120. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.96 to 1,297.80 ,  
another record. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 
18.63 to 2,424.63, or less than a 100 points off its record of 
2,510.09 set Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 274.66 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.94 at 611.42, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 4.32 at 719.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.6 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.53 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike  
Tyson had a celebrity visitor Thursday at the Maryland jail where 
he is serving time on assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr., in the Washington, D.C., area on business  
for his magazine, George, stopped by the Montgomery County 
Detention Center at about 9 p.m. to spend an hour with Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said he came as a friend and that he's gotten to know  
Tyson informally over the past year. He described Tyson as ``a much 
different man than his public image would suggest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer was putting his life back together before he ended up  
back in jail and ``has an opportunity to do so in the future,'' 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is serving a one-year sentence after pleading no contest  
to charges he assaulted two motorists following a minor traffic 
accident last summer in Gaithersburg, Md.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Jump in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans opened their wallets and purses to  
purchase everything from cars to furniture in February, powering 
retail sales to another strong increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales -- which represent about a third of the nation's  
economic output -- jumped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally 
adjusted $236.5 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That came on top of robust gains of 1 percent in January and 1.1  
percent in December. And it was the seventh in a row. Both the 
January and December figures were revised higher from previous 
estimates, January's substantially, from 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department reported today that the  
deficit in America's broadest measure of foreign trade, the current 
account, soared by 50.4 percent last year to an all-time high of 
$233.4 billion as the global financial crisis continued to batter 
American farmers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of U.S. goods fell last year for the first time in 13  
years, but so far the turmoil in trade has not derailed the overall 
U.S. economy. Falling overseas demand has been more than made up by 
healthy growth in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have worried off and on this year that the  
Federal Reserve might start raising interest rates unless the 
economy slows on its own. But today's strong retail sales report 
was taken in stride. Investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial 
average up by 34 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, auto sales were particularly strong, up 1.8 percent.  
And sales of everything else rose a healthy 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors are combining to drive spending higher,  
including unemployment near a 29-year low, low interest rates, 
record stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks and a substantial increase in federal tax 
refunds, compared with last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reflection of the healthy job market, the Labor Department  
said today that first-time claims for unemployment checks remained 
under 300,000 for the sixth consecutive week for the first time 
since 1974. Claims edged up 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Good weather across much of the country probably encouraged some  
additional spending as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans appetite for new goods is helping power brisk economic  
growth at a time when export sales are soft, thanks to the economic 
crisis that began in Asia nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, other strong sales gains included furniture, up 1  
percent; building supplies and hardware, 1.2 percent; apparel and 
accessory shops, 1 percent; food stores, 0.9 percent, the most in 
nearly two years; drug stores, 1.3 percent; restaurants and bars, 
0.8 percent, and gasoline stations, 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at department and other general merchandise stores rose  
0.5 percent, a decent increase on top of an extremely strong 2.6 
percent advance in January.

<HEADLINE> House Condemns China Over Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare display of unanimity, the House  
joined the Senate on Thursday in prodding the Clinton 
administration to sponsor a U.N. resolution condemning Beijing for 
human rights abuses in China and Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	On a 421-0 vote, the House urged the U.S. delegation to sponsor  
such a resolution later this month at the annual meeting of the 
United Nations Commission on human rights in Geneva. It follows a 
99-0 Senate vote on the measure last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have expressed reluctance to sponsor  
such a resolution, even though they have done so in the past. State 
Department officials said, however, that a decision has not been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican sponsors of the House resolution added to their list  
of grievances recent reports that China had stolen weapons 
technology from the United States in the 1980s enabling it to make 
smaller nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Republican colleagues are in no position to be surprised  
that China has been spying on the United States,'' argued Rep. Tom 
Lantos, D-Calif., a senior member of the House International 
Relations Committee. ``That spying has been going on during the 
last many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lantos said he was nonetheless voting for the resolution,  
saying, ``Human rights transcend parties and differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, at a House hearing Thursday on U.S.-Chinese  
relations, Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., urged the Clinton 
administration to reconsider whether Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's 
visit to Washington set for early April should take place. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Zhu's visit should not take place ``while the rape of  
Tibet is going on. We cannot act as though it's business as 
usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, chairman of the House International Relations Committee's  
human rights panel, said the administration's approach to China was 
``all carrot and no stick'' and urged a tougher economic approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said it was time for  
Congress and the Clinton administration to begin a critical 
re-examination of relations with China because the existing policy 
of engagement was not producing results. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on  
East Asia and Pacific affairs, said Congress needs to examine 
``whether in the administration's eagerness to engage China, we 
have not overlooked the fact that our return on improvement in 
China's domestic and international behavior has been negligible at 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not advocating closing off dialogue or imposing  
economic sanctions but increasing moral pressure so the 
relationship becomes ``a two-way street, not a one-way to a dead 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., the House sponsor of the  
human-rights resolution, said, ``In the last eight months, the 
communist government in China has carried out the most symptomatic 
crackdown on democracy activists since the Tiananmen Square 
massacre of 1989.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the administration certain that it still wants a strategic  
partnership with such a government?'' Gilman asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said the unanimous votes would send a powerful message  
to the Beijing government as well as to democracy advocates in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ignored a similar resolution passed by  
Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had pushed human-rights condemnations of  
China at past Geneva sessions but declined to do so in 1998 because 
Clinton was then planning a visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution asserts that ``the government of the People's  
Republic of China demonstrates a pattern of continuous, serious, 
and widespread violations of internationally recognized human 
rights standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It states that the United States ``should introduce and make all  
efforts necessary to pass a resolution criticizing the People's 
Republic of China at the 1998 session of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks Deal Brandon and Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Off to a 12-5 start and 6-0 so far in March,  
the Milwaukee Bucks are shuffling their lineup anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trades Thursday sent point guard Terrell Brandon and forward  
Tyrone Hill elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon went to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a  
nine-player deal also including the New Jersey Nets, and Hill was 
dealt to the Philadelphia 76ers in a four-player trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bucks general manager Bob Weinhauer said the trades don't  
mean he and first-year coach George Karl are giving up the goal of 
breaking a seven-year playoff drought this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always concerned about change. This we don't look at as  
change for the sake of change,'' Weinhauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``George and I discussed this at length yesterday and today  
about where we are. It's almost going to be like starting over with 
a new training period, only with less practice time, and yes, that 
was a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we do not feel that this will take us out of the playoff  
picture,'' he added. ``Our guys will regroup and they will 
compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, a former All-Star, told KFAN Radio in Minneapolis he  
was happy about the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. I think any player, anyone who's in any type of  
business enjoys being wanted,'' Brandon said. ``I'm excited about 
being a Timberwolf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl had been reluctant to see Brandon go because of the way the  
team has jelled under his leadership. Brandon refused to negotiate 
a contract extension in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks got point guard Sam Cassell and power forward Chris  
Gatling from the Nets, plus Paul Grant from the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell has played in only two games since spraining his ankle  
in the season opener. Gatling had asked to be traded. Grant, a 
former Wisconsin center, has seen little action. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota sent point guard Stephon Marbury, power forward Bill  
Curley and guards Elliot Perry (from Milwaukee) and Chris Carr to 
the Nets, and the Nets sent small forward Brian Evans to Minnesota, 
along with two draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who said he would prefer to be traded if Brandon left the  
Bucks, was traded to the Sixers with Jerald Honeycutt for Tim 
Thomas and Scott Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks and Sixers started talking about the deal just before  
the 6 p.m. trade deadline and needed more than three hours to 
finalize it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continually trying to build this team into a  
championship-caliber team, and the trade deadline comes at a very 
inopportune time,'' Weinhauer said. ``We would like for it to be 
further on in the season like it normally is, but it's here and we 
have to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the opportunity to move some players and to pick up some  
other pieces of the puzzle, one, gives us instant scoring off the 
bench in Chris Gatling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sam Cassell is a proven point guard who has played on two  
world championship teams with the Houston Rockets. He is a solid 
offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim Thomas, the seventh pick in the draft, (is) a solid young  
player,'' he said. ``Now we're trying to blend age with youth and 
bring the team along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the seventh pick in the 1997 draft by New Jersey, had  
fallen into a mopup role with the Sixers. He is averaging 4.6 
points and was 5-for-19 on 3-point shots and had said before the 
trade that he would welcome a change if his playing time wasn't 
going to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who turns 31 next week, was an All-Star with Cleveland in  
1995 before he was traded to the Bucks with Brandon in the same 
deal that sent Vin Baker from Milwaukee to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeycutt, the Bucks' second-round draft pick in 1997, appeared  
in only three games for Milwaukee this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has been out with stress fractures in both legs and  
isn't expected back for at least two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was expected to join the Bucks with Friday night's game  
at Indiana. Milwaukee is half a game behind the Pacers for the 
Central Division lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Grant will stay on the injured list and the Bucks  
plan to pick up a player on a 10-day contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell, who aggravated his ankle sprain in warmups this week,  
and Gatling were to have their physical exams in Milwaukee Friday 
or Saturday and could see action Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll determine Sam's status when he comes in here and gets  
his physical,'' Weinhauer said.

<HEADLINE> Report: IOC Official Knew of Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The senior Olympic official in the United States  
knew ``everything'' about Salt Lake's improper efforts to win IOC 
votes, a former organizer at the heart of the bribery scandal says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report in Thursday's New York Times, Dave Johnson, who was  
senior vice president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and 
long involved in the city's Olympic campaign, said he repeatedly 
discussed the situation with Anita DeFrantz, an International 
Olympic Committee member from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1992 to 1995, every time we had an IOC member visit Salt  
Lake, she either flew to Salt Lake or during their visit would talk 
to them on the telephone,'' Johnson said of DeFrantz. ``She would 
call me and ask, 'Was he good or was he bad?' She wanted to know if 
someone had asked us to do something that would put us in a 
difficult position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who resigned in January and has been identified as one  
of the operators of the inducement scheme, told the Times that if 
an IOC member had demanded favors, DeFrantz's response was, 
``'That's not good,' or something like that. She didn't say, 'Don't 
do it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews with the Times, DeFrantz denied Johnson's  
statement, which marked the first time that the current IOC vice 
president and highest-ranking woman in the Olympic community was 
said to have had direct knowledge of the cash-and-gifts plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never asked if it was OK, or if they should do anything,  
or if it was a way to win the games,'' she told the newspaper, 
adding that the discussions as recalled by Johnson ``never 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Frantz declined further comment Thursday, as she attended a  
SLOC board meeting in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal  
and 19 others remain under investigation. De Frantz has not been 
implicated in any of the half-dozen investigations made public so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times also reported that minutes of the bid committee's  
senior management meetings and handwritten notes of the lawyer who 
was the committee's secretary for 1994-95 were shredded or 
otherwise destroyed in the offices of Ray Quinney &AMP; Nebeker, the 
bid committee's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	James S. Jardine, the firm's managing director who also served  
as the bid committee's lawyer, said the documents detailed the 
committee's actions over the final months of the bid process and 
were the only files destroyed. Jardine could offer no reason for 
the action or say who might have done it.

<HEADLINE> House Panel At Odds on Bank Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the spirit of bipartisanship frayed,  
members and aides of the House Banking Committee tried last night 
and today to draft a measure to protect consumers' financial 
privacy. The measure would be attached to legislation to knock down 
Depression-era barriers separating banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies. It would require companies within new 
financial conglomerates to give consumers the right to opt out of 
arrangements for sharing of their personal data with the affiliated 
companies. Lawmakers and aides of the banking panel have been 
working to come up with a proposal, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, 
the committee's senior Democrat, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy is such an important issue for the average person,''  
LaFalce said. 
</P>
<P>
	But lobbyists for the three financial services industries  
indicated that adoption of such a measure could kill their support 
for the overall legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the conciliatory mood shifted Wednesday, the panel  
managed to overwhelmingly approve a compromise provision requiring 
ATM surcharges to be clearly disclosed at the teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-1 vote attached the surcharge measure to sweeping  
legislation that would allow banks, securities firms and insurance 
companies to merge and get more deeply into each other's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But several hours later, some lawmakers started pushing divisive  
proposals. LaFalce angrily warned Republicans that ``the chances 
for passage of this bill will come to an end'' if they tried to 
choke off debate on amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee was to try again today, after adjourning its  
second all-day drafting session Wednesday without completing work 
on the bill -- for which the Clinton administration has indicated 
its strong support. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATM surcharge measure, sponsored by LaFalce, Committee  
Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., 
was a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier attempt to ban the surcharges outright, pushed by  
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the House's lone independent, gave 
way to the milder disclosure measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require clear disclosure of the surcharges, which come  
on top of charges by customers' own banks for using a machine 
operated by another bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically:  
</P>
<P>
	--The fact that double charges are imposed on people who aren't  
customers of that bank would have to be posted in a sign on the 
teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
	--The surcharge amount would have to be specified on the screen  
after consumers log in. Consumers would have to be given the chance 
to terminate their transaction before paying the surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
	--When issuing ATM cards to customers, banks would have to  
provide a warning that surcharges may be assessed by other banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks currently do at least some of those things  
voluntarily at the ATMs they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole dissenting vote came from Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill.,  
who said she believed the banks could sufficiently police 
themselves in operating automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Antitrust Division last year started  
looking into whether the nation's largest ATM networks are 
illegally preventing small banks from eliminating the double 
charges. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hazelwood Blames Oil Spill on Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A decade after his ship spilled 11  
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, Exxon Valdez 
skipper Joe Hazelwood reiterated his belief that the accident was 
not his fault. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CBS' ``60 Minutes'' scheduled to air  
Sunday, Hazelwood blamed third mate Greg Cousins, who was on the 
bridge and failed to turn the tanker away from Bligh Reef despite 
orders to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood told CBS that he realizes the world views him ``as  
some drunken fool,'' but he denied being intoxicated on March 24, 
1989, when the tanker struck the reef several hours after leaving 
the oil terminal in Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The former tanker skipper admitted that he had at least three  
vodkas earlier in the evening, but said his real mistake was to 
leave Cousins in charge as the tanker moved south out of the Valdez 
Arm and into Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect and hindsight being 20/20, of course, I never  
would have left the bridge if I had any idea about what was going 
to happen,'' Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone number could not be found for Cousins. But during  
the 1994 civil trial against Exxon, which resulted in a $5 billion 
verdict against the company, Cousins testified that he wasn't sure 
why he failed to order the right turn that would have taken the 
900-foot tanker away from the reef. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been poor seamanship on my part, (or) lack of  
experience -- I don't know,'' Cousins said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood was in his cabin doing paperwork when Cousins called  
down to him warning of trouble. The ship hit the rocks a moment 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that moment I felt a shudder, and I got sick to my stomach,  
physically sick,'' Hazelwood recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	He was cleared in 1990 of a charge of piloting the tanker while  
drunk, but was convicted of negligently discharging oil. He is 
scheduled to begin serving 1,000 hours of community service this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood, now working as a law clerk in New York City, is  
expected to travel to Anchorage to pick up trash along highways and 
clean up litter in parks as part of a 10-person work crew.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Rules Against Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has dealt the nation's bankers  
a setback, denying their request to block a new government rule 
allowing more people to join credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Wednesday denied  
the American Bankers Association's request for an injunction 
barring the National Credit Union Administration from putting the 
rule into effect. She has yet to rule on the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time the banking industry's largest trade  
group has gone to court over the issue. The first legal action led 
to a 1998 Supreme Court ruling favoring the banks over the credit 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCUA, an independent federal agency, ``continues to pose a  
threat to small financial institutions,'' said Beth Climo, an 
official of the bankers' group. Unless the agency is ``reined in, 
we will see a migration of customers and dollars'' to big credit 
unions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule, adopted by the agency in December, codifies a law  
enacted last summer in a stinging defeat for the banking industry. 
The legislation overrode the Supreme Court ruling by allowing 
federally chartered credit unions to continue to include more than 
one occupational group in their memberships -- as long as each group 
doesn't exceed 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	NCUA Chairman Norman D'Amours had voted against the rule, saying  
he feared it would hurt smaller credit unions, although he did not 
believe it was illegal. The other two board members, Yolanda Wheat 
and Dennis Dollar, voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit union industry has said the new rule will allow  
millions of people -- including employees of small businesses -- to 
join lower-cost credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group maintained that the rule went beyond the  
bill's intent by promoting big, expansive credit unions with 
multiple membership groups at the expense of small, local ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions compete with banks -- especially small community  
banks -- by often providing lower-cost loans and other services at 
more favorable rates for their members. They contend they are the 
best source of help for people of modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has bitterly protested credit unions'  
exemption from federal taxes, which was retained by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose  
Friday morning on the strength of another rally on Wall Street. The 
dollar was slightly lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 137.83 points, or 0.89 percent,  
to close the morning session at 15,639.97. On Thursday, the average 
closed up 22.14 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.62 yen at midday, down 0.12 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo but above its level of 119.33 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices started sharply higher Friday amid continued  
bullish market sentiment and another rise to a new record on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 124.60  
points to close Thursday at 9,897.44. The rally was buoyed by 
higher oil stocks and more evidence that the U.S. economy is 
growing at a non-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said market sentiment in Tokyo remained mostly  
favorable due to continued active buying from foreign and 
individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the New York market rallying, (the) Tokyo market is also  
likely to test higher levels,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general 
manager at Chuo Securities Co. ``There is little sense of the 
market being overheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 6.87 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,203.05 
points. The TOPIX closed up 8.71 points, or 0.73 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was slightly below its late  
Thursday level, but analysts said it was gaining strength on 
yen-dampening comments from Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi 
Sakaiya. 
</P>
<P>
	In a taped television appearance Friday, Sakaiya said Japanese  
gross domestic product for the October-December quarter was likely 
to be slightly down. 
</P>
<P>
	Data on Japan's fourth quarter GDP was scheduled for release  
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was the Bank of Japan's generous  
increase in the surplus of banking reserves in the money market on 
Friday, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.56 yen, up from  
131.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.765  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.755 percent, driving its price 
down to 100.27 yen from 100.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slip on Stock Rally / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were unchanged to slightly  
lower Thursday as another rally in the stock market and a strong 
economic indicator lessened their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 3/32  
point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.56 percent from 5.53 percent 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Dow Jones industrial average closing in on the  
10,000-point mark, not many investors are rushing to bonds as a 
safe haven investment. The Dow added 124.46 to 9,897.44 Thursday, a 
new high for the second day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	A report showing strong retail sales last month also kept bond  
investors cautious. Bond investors are wary of signs of economic 
growth since they could augur higher interest rates or inflation, 
either of which are bad news for fixed-income investments like 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to down 
1/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, was off 
0.43 point at 1,283.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.48 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.68 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.51 percent. One-year yields were 4.76 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.02 percentage point from late Wednesday to 5.53 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.88 percent from 4.56 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 1/32 from 124. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.23 percent from 5.22 percent.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Calls `Fearful' Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bosses of the biggest sponsors of the  
Olympics have been getting a sales pitch from the embattled boss of 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in an unusual move to gain  
support for the scandal-scarred International Olympic Committee, 
has called the chairmen and CEOs of several top-level corporate 
backers to pledge reforms in the wake of the Salt Lake bribery 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He initiated the call to our vice chairman, John Alden, and we  
expressed our concerns,'' said UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg, 
among the marketing officials who confirmed the exchanges 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she did not know of any similar calls since UPS became  
an Olympic sponsor in the summer of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Another official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  
Samaranch made the calls ``just to discuss the situation 
tete-a-tete'' with the top decision-makers of $50 million sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was made to allay fears'' that the IOC is not committed to  
changes in its membership and operations, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one more IOC member is expected to be expelled as an  
internal investigation of alleged wrongdoing in Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games moves slowly toward a 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, an IOC member since 1987,  
will be ousted under the recommendation of the six-man panel, 
Olympic sources familiar with the case told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said  
that a few of the 19 IOC members still under investigation in the 
Salt Lake City case would be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork, never in a leadership position in the IOC, was named  
in a Utah ethics report last month that said his wife, Julia, 
borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief Tom Welch ``to help 
a friend in a serious situation.'' The report said the money, 
withdrawn by Welch from his children's' trust fund, was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected expulsion of Wallwork was reported Wednesday by the  
Chicago Tribune and confirmed by sources to the AP. At least two 
international newsletters that report on the Olympics also said 
Wallwork would be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC commission, headed by vice president Dick Pound of  
Canada, was still working on its report Wednesday, and it was 
uncertain when it would make its recommendations to the ruling 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound was unavailable for comment, with telephone messages left  
at his Montreal office not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	But another commission member, Jacques Rogge of Belgium, said  
the report might not come until next Monday, when the executive 
board meets in Lausanne, Switzerland, prior to a special IOC 
general assembly dealing with the Olympics' worst corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pound commission's initial phase ended in January, with nine  
members expelled or resigning and another three under 
investigation, including South Korean executive board member Kim 
Un-yong, the highest ranking IOC delegate implicated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on whether the commission has decided Kim's  
fate on allegations that he used Olympic connections to help secure 
lucrative jobs for his children in broadcasting and entertainment . 
</P>
<P>
	Another high-profile case, meanwhile, appeared to be headed for  
no more than a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, an IOC member from Australia, was expected to be  
censured for accepting travel to ski resorts and the Super Bowl, 
the Olympic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing officials said Samaranch took the initiative to  
call sponsors over the last two weeks as he prepared for an 
extraordinary IOC general assembly to deal with the scandal, which 
has rocked the world's biggest sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls were upbeat and filled with pledges to clean up the  
corruption and never let it happen again, according to the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those called was M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and CEO of  
he Coca-Cola Co., one of the IOC's oldest sponsors. Ivester told 
Samaranch that the IOC must ``modernize'' its organization. 
</P>
<P>
	If was not known if Samaranch called John Hancock president  
David D'Alessandro, his most public critic among the leaders of 11 
corporations in The Olympic Program, the highest level of 
sponsorship of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Samaranch's phone calls came as The Wall Street Journal  
reported that some sponsors were making contingency plans in case 
the IOC failed to make major changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said the plans included scaled-backed Olympic ads,  
replacing the Olympics with sponsorship of other sports and 
possible legal action against the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Obesity Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have identified the first gene known to suppress  
obesity and regulate the burning of calories, a key step that may 
help in developing a drug that keeps people trim. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene, known as Mahogany or the MG gene, was discovered in  
mice. It is the sixth gene found to be implicated in obesity, but 
researchers said it is the first discovered to regulate metabolism 
and the expenditure of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of two studies published in today's issue of the journal  
Nature, scientists at Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, 
Mass., tested groups of mice with normal and mutated MG genes. They 
fed the mice diets with varying percentages of fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice with a mutated MG gene did not gain weight whether they ate  
a high-fat diet or a low-fat one. Mice with the normal gene gained 
weight on the high-fat diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said they were optimistic that the gene would play  
the same role in humans, but cautioned that it has been 
demonstrated only in mice (Mahogany refers to the animals' brown 
fur). 
</P>
<P>
	And though the findings suggest the gene plays an important role  
in diet-related obesity -- which afflicts most of the 54 percent of 
American adults who are too hefty -- obesity is thought to more than 
a matter of genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a complex problem for which diet, exercise and  
biology all are important,'' said geneticist Craig Warden of the 
University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason why it could be several years before the  
researchers can transform their discovery into a fat-busting drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pessimistic that we'll ever get that pill that allows us  
to remain sedentary, eat high-fat diets and stay lean,'' said 
University of Colorado obesity researcher James Hill. ``But that's 
what Americans want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molecular biologist Karen Moore, who directed the MG study for  
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, said the findings could show 
researchers how to develop a drug to control obesity by mimicking 
the activity of the mutated gene. 
</P>
<P>
	The process of how such a drug could enter a cell is described  
in the second study in Nature, by Stanford University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other obesity researchers said the MG studies provide key  
information in understanding how the body warehouses fuel when 
people eat more than necessary.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900; Pulls Back To 9,841 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the threshold of an historic milestone, the  
Dow was retreating from its record highs this afternoon after 
surpassing 9,800 and 9,900. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 68.27 at 9,841.11, after pulling back from a high of 9,935.46, 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock measures also were rising, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index also hitting a new high and flirting with its 
first close ever above 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up 1  
11/16 at 84 15/16, and Exxon, which rose 1 1/2 at 74 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Dow gainer was soft-drink maker Coca-Cola, which  
rose 3 9/16 to 66 1/4 after an analyst from Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette Securities raised his investment opinion of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor interest in the magical 10,000 mark for the Dow also  
seemed to be feeding on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short term, at the margins, traders feel its inevitable  
that we will go to 10,000 and they are playing that dynamic to push 
the Dow higher,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for 
Legg Mason of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in years, the broad stock indicators were  
driven higher even without a surge in technology stocks. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.70 to 2,397.30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more sectors that participate in a market advance is a  
sign the market looks very good,'' Cripps said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cripps cautioned that many small cap stocks are still  
struggling, as evidence by the Russell 2000 measure falling 0.56 to 
400.56 
</P>
<P>
	Helping today's rally was new retail sales data showing the U.S.  
economy is growing without any inflationary threats. Since there 
are no signs that the economy is overheating, investors believe 
that the Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to boost 
interest rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department said today that  
first-time claims for unemployment checks remained under 300,000 
for the sixth consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 751.69 million 
shares, up from 642.30 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.30 to 1,290.14.  
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.24 at 608.72, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.75 at 717.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Duke To Begin Title Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Duke's top-ranked Blue Devils rolled into  
town Thursday, ready to start their final push to a coveted NCAA 
title. They found their path blocked by an unlikely and 
unintimidated opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	To a man, the Florida A&AMP;M Rattlers admitted to having allowed  
themselves to fantasize what it would be like to knock off the Blue 
Devils in Friday's East Regional first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure if we take this one, the next week or two we'd  
probably go on Jay Leno and all that -- get the big hype,'' 
sophomore guard Morris Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Monroe Pippins took it one step further.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was wondering if we'd even have to play any more games if we  
beat them,'' Pippins said. 
</P>
<P>
	All kidding aside, the Rattlers (12-18) know they face a  
monumental task in trying to become the first No. 16 seed in NCAA 
tournament history to knock off a top seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (32-1) comes in riding a school-record 27-game winning  
streak. The Blue Devils lead the nation in scoring at 93.3 points 
and margin at 25.4 a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent most of the week searching the hills of Tallahassee,  
looking for rocks big enough to hit them,'' said Florida A&AMP;M coach 
Mickey Clayton, whose Rattlers are making their first NCAA 
tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round games Friday at the Charlotte Coliseum,  
Tennessee (20-8) plays Delaware (25-5), Wisconsin (22-9) meets 
Southwest Missouri State (20-10) and the College of Charleston 
(28-2) takes on Tulsa (22-9). 
</P>
<P>
	The Rattlers' improbable route to the NCAA field of 64 and their  
pairing against the sport's dominant team this season took center 
stage Thursday as the teams went through their final preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's practice at the coliseum drew by far the biggest crowd of  
the day, and when the Blue Devils held their news conference, the 
Florida A&AMP;M players stopped by to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have never thought I'd ever play Duke,'' Pippins said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Rattlers didn't look like they had any  
chance of qualifying for the postseason. They lost 13 of their 
first 14 games and wound up in the play-in game of the Mid-Eastern 
Athletic Conference tournament. A four-game run through that event 
earned Florida A&AMP;M an automatic berth into the NCAAs, capping a 
year marked by numerous injuries, scheduling problems and travel 
snags. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, the Atlantic Coast Conference champion, is favored to  
defeat Florida A&AMP;M by dozens -- nearly four dozen, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, they've beaten everybody in the ACC by 25 or 30,'' Scott  
said, ``and now they're going to the MEAC, so you know it had to be 
a little higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippins, a senior guard who doubles as Florida A&AMP;M's leading  
scorer and top comic, once again tried to make light of the Blue 
Devils' heavily favored status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really hoping they would just give us those 45 points,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not going to happen, but the Blue Devils may make things  
more interesting by holding out Trajan Langdon, who is nursing a 
sprained foot that sidelined him for the final two games of the ACC 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	After Langdon practiced on a limited basis Thursday night, coach  
Mike Krzyzewski pronounced his senior wing guard ``very doubtful'' 
for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I don't think he's going to play, even though he  
does feel better,'' Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Bennett, coach of fifth-seeded Wisconsin, has the luxury of  
knowing that if his Badgers do have to face the Blue Devils, the 
game would not come until the third round of the tournament. That 
gives him some time to reflect on what it would take to derail what 
has been an untouchable team, at least since the first week of 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to play a perfect game and hope that they're off  
their game,'' Bennett said. ``You've got to catch a few breaks 
along the way. I think you'd have to make it a halfcourt game. 
You'd have to nail a number of 3-pointers and eliminate most of 
your turnovers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett thought about what he had just said and paused, shook  
his head and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if that isn't as close to a perfect game as possible,'' he  
said, his voice trailing off without finishing the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri coach Steve Alford offered a similar  
sentiment, but also offered some hope for the rest of the NCAA 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're crazy if you don't like watching Duke play and you  
don't think Duke is the favorite to come out of this bracket. But 
favorites don't always come out of brackets,'' Alford said. 
``That's why they call it the madness of March, because things 
happen that characteristically you don't think should happen. 
That's why I think college basketball just supersedes anything else 
that takes place in sports during the year. It's a three-week stint 
where anything can happen.''

<HEADLINE> Susan Lucci Nominated Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe 19 will be Susan Lucci's lucky number. The  
veteran soap actress snagged yet another Daytime Emmy Award 
nomination today for best actress for her role as Erica Kane on 
``All My Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's still searching for her first win after 18 previous  
nominations in the category. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk show kingpin Jerry Springer was snubbed again, passed over  
as a nominee for outstanding talk show host even after nemesis 
Oprah Winfrey took herself out of the running. Springer's top-rated 
slugfest didn't get a nomination for best talk show, either. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS daytime drama ``The Young and the Restless'' earned 21  
nominations, including a staggering 14 in the various acting 
categories. ``General Hospital'' was next with 13 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and ``Sesame Street'' both earned  
11 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, syndicated programs earned a total of 66 nominations,  
CBS had 47, ABC had 41, PBS had 34 and NBC had 28. The winners will 
be announced May 21 in New York City in a program telecast on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-luck Lucci has gritted her teeth through a losing  
streak that has often overshadowed the winners in her category. Her 
competition for best actress this year is Elizabeth Hubbard of ``As 
the World Turns,'' Kim Zimmer of ``Guiding Light,'' and Jeanne 
Cooper and Melody Thomas Scott, both of ``The Young and the 
Restless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best actor nominees were David Canary of ``All My Children,''  
Anthony Geary of ``General Hospital,'' Robert S. Woods of ``One 
Life to Live'' and Eric Braeden and Peter Bergman, both of ``The 
Young and the Restless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey, after winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime  
achievement award, took herself out of the running for best talk 
show host. O'Donnell, who shared this award with Winfrey in 1998, 
will compete with Leeza Gibbons, Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee 
Gifford, Roseanne and the cast of ABC's ``The View.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was given the lifetime achievement award,''  
Winfrey said in an interview broadcast earlier this month. ``And 
after you've achieved it for a lifetime, what else is there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' was nominated in the category  
of outstanding talk show. Other nominees were ``Leeza,'' ``Live 
With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and ``The 
View.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey's show earned a total of seven nominations overall.  
</P>
<P>
	Steven Spielberg, whose more immediate concern may be the  
Academy Awards, may have to expand his trophy case. The children's 
shows he produces, ``Animaniacs'' and ``Pinky, Elmyra and the 
Brain,'' earned two nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners are selected by members of the National Academy of  
Television Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin A Campaign Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the largest food companies are banding  
together with the U.S. government to add vitamin A to the diets of 
developing countries, hoping to cut malnourished children's death 
rates as much as 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 250 million children in developing countries are  
vitamin A-deficient. That puts them at risk not only for blindness 
-- the nutrient is vital for eyesight -- but also for death, because 
vitamin A helps children survive infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the discovery of vitamin A's impact on child survival in  
the early 1990s, the U.S. Agency for International Development and 
charity groups have helped give vitamin A capsules to malnourished 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's hard to get yearly supplements to some of the world's  
poorest or strife-ridden countries. So USAID wants to get local 
foods fortified with vitamin A, just like the breakfast cereals and 
manyother foods that Americans eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Tuesday, in a luncheon ceremony being held by first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, about 15 companies are expected to sign 
onto a campaign to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win-win situation,'' said Harriet Babbitt, deputy  
administrator of USAID, which is spending $25 million a year on the 
vitamin. ``They can feel good about the products they sell ... and 
know they're doing some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, ``they do open doors'' that U.S. health workers sometimes  
can't, added Duff Gillespie, USAID's vitamin chief, in a telephone 
interview from South Africa, where international experts gathered 
this week to plan fortification efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can go to countries and say, 'We made a significant  
investment in your country and we think you should do something in 
the area of vitamin A,''' Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the first beneficiaries: Kosovo. All cooking oil shipped  
as part of U.S. humanitarian relief packages now must be fortified 
with vitamin A, Babbitt said. The first shipment, fortified by food 
and agriculture conglomerate Cargill Inc., heads to Kosovo by 
month's end, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next on the list: USAID is negotiating with Uganda to add  
vitamin A to that country's sugar. And a health committee in South 
Africa is investigating adding the nutrient to a grain that 
virtually all South Africans eat in either porridge or bread, 
Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines is considering wheat fortification, Babbitt  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier if we can get these things worked into flour  
and sugar, and used in the normal foods in the countries, rather 
than distributing supplements,'' said Dan Wright of BASF Corp., 
which will provide bulk vitamin A to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	USAID won't have a final list until next week, but the agency  
said participating companies, in addition to Cargill and BASF, 
would include Procter &AMP; Gamble, Monsanto and the British sugar 
company Tate &AMP; Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States and other developed nations, getting enough  
vitamin A is easy: It's in meat, eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, 
leafy green vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	It's much harder to get enough in the developing world, where  
meatless diets and a lack of fortified foods are the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, doctors thought vitamin A was necessary mainly for  
good eyesight. Then Dr. Alfred Sommer of Johns Hopkins University 
made the startling discovery that giving malnourished children a 
2-cent capsule of vitamin A twice a year can cut their premature 
death rate by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out that adequate vitamin A helps fend off infectious  
disease. Indeed, that's one reason why measles kills hundreds of 
thousands of malnourished people a year -- it depletes their bodies' 
meager stores of vitamin A, said Dr. Nils Daulaire of the Global 
Health Council, which hopes to increase business involvement in 
international health. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin A is a fairly unstable nutrient, so BASF is designing  
formulations that will work in different foods. When USAID launched 
a pilot project with Tate &AMP; Lyle to fortify sugar in Zambia, for 
instance, BASF prepared vitamin A that could withstand that 
country's heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will prove good for business as well as for health,  
Daulaire predicted. Tate &AMP; Lyle's sales increased 15 percent in 
Zambia during the pilot project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just kids who'll benefit. The nutrient cuts night  
blindness in pregnant women, a huge problem in developing 
countries. And USAID is preparing to study whether it also could 
cut pregnancy-related deaths in Indonesia, Ghana and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Senate Democrats End Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- As soon as boycotting Democrats returned  
to the Alabama Senate, another partisan shouting match erupted and 
work on the people's business once again ground to halt. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruckus so far has killed one-third of the legislative  
session in Alabama, and exasperated lawmakers decided Thursday to 
adjourn until March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court was to hear arguments today over whether  
Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom violated the Alabama Constitution 
when he gaveled through rules that returned Senate powers to his 
office that had been taken away by the Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom's quick gavel earlier this month inflamed a feud with  
Democrats, who boycotted the Senate until Thursday. But the howling 
started all over again as soon as they convened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully there will be serious negotiations to get back to a  
civil approach,'' said boycotting Sen. Jim Preuitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom wasn't optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even now they are plotting their next move,'' he said. ``Some  
say they will even try to impeach me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Constitution gives the lieutenant governor two duties:  
presiding over the Senate and voting in case of a tie. The Senate 
has traditionally let the lieutenant governor make committee 
appointments and decide which committee considers each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed Nov. 3, when Windom was elected Alabama's first  
Republican lieutenant governor this century and Democratic Lt. Gov. 
Don Siegelman was elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking office as governor, Siegelman pushed through rules  
that stripped the lieutenant governor's office of most of its 
powers. Windom grabbed them back with a voice vote when the 
Legislature's annual session opened March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen Democrats -- a majority in the Senate -- sued Windom and  
started boycotting. With the Legislature limited to 30 meeting days 
each year, the standoff wasted 10 days with no legislation being 
considered.

<HEADLINE> Four-Day Standoff in Wyoming Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAWLINS, Wyo. (AP) -- A four-day standoff ended Thursday night  
when a rescue squad smashed through a sliding glass door and 
tackled the father of four children he had held hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric DeMillard, 42, was armed with a pistol. Police tackled him  
as he ran down a hallway. They wrestled the gun away and no shots 
were fired, police Chief Tony Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the DeMillard's sons, 9 and 6, were being examined at a  
local hospital. They were feeling well enough to talk with officers 
soon after the ordeal ended, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeMillard had barged into his estranged wife's home Sunday night  
after the two had an argument, authorities said. Novetta DeMillard 
fled and called police. The two are separated and battling for 
custody of the children. 
</P>
<P>
	DeMillard freed an 8-year-old son Thursday afternoon and his  
2-year-old daughter on Wednesday after police assured him she would 
not be placed in a foster home.

<HEADLINE> HIV-Positive Scout Files Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- A human-rights complaint has been lodged  
against the Girl Scouts for initially denying membership to an 
HIV-positive 8-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legal Action Center of New York City filed it Wednesday on  
behalf of Quashawn Donovan with the state Division of Human Rights. 
Quashawn was rejected from seven troops in the Queensbury area last 
year because she has the virus that causes AIDS, according to her 
mother, Dianne Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the human rights division to require the Girl Scouts  
to educate all troop leaders, volunteers and staff that HIV cannot 
be transmitted through casual contact,'' said Legal Action Center 
lawyer Sally Friedman. ``We also want them to order the Girl Scouts 
to adopt stricter anti-discrimination policies that would hold 
people who violate them accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint also seeks unspecified damages to compensate  
Quashawn for the emotional distress she suffered when she was 
rejected by troop leaders, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	An administrative law judge will hear the complaint, which  
alleges violations of the state's human rights law. His decision 
would be put into effect by the state commissioner of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Kit Huggard, executive director of the Adirondack Girl Scout  
Council in this town about 45 miles north of Albany, declined to 
comment Wednesday on the complaint. She maintains, though, that the 
Girl Scouts do not discriminate against any child, including those 
with life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the complaint, the local council gave Mrs. Donovan  
an enthusiastic response when she first approached them in October 
looking for a troop for her daughter. But she said she was later 
rebuffed by troop leader after troop leader, who individually hold 
the power to decide who joins their troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Donovan said she believes leaders, who are volunteers, were  
afraid parents would pull their children from troops if Quashawn 
joined. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legal Action Center accused the local council with  
discrimination, and the national organization, Girl Scouts USA, 
with ``aiding and abetting'' that discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman said troop leaders don't face any consequences if they  
violate the organization's anti-discrimination policy.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Under Fire Over Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Dozens of dead sea turtles. A decomposing  
gray whale lying on the sand. And hundreds of fish asphyxiated by 
the tainted water around them. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists charge a salt plant on the Baja California  
Peninsula -- run by the Mexican government in a joint venture with 
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. -- killed the animals with discharges of 
brine. 
</P>
<P>
	Now President Ernesto Zedillo's government is under fire from  
local and U.S. environmental groups that claim it has failed to 
prosecute alleged environmental crimes by the salt company in which 
it owns a majority stake. 
</P>
<P>
	And the government's position is likely to come under even more  
scrutiny in June when the salt company, known by its initials as 
ESSA, submits a proposal to expand to another coastal lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a company that simply isn't supervised by any  
environmental authority in Mexico,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet 
and leading environmental activist. 
</P>
<P>
	A criminal complaint filed Wednesday by three environmental  
organizations in Mexico -- and endorsed by two U.S. groups -- accuses 
ESSA of causing widespread damage to a reserve that shelters gray 
whales and sea turtles on the Baja California Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes salt by evaporating seawater in salt flats  
near the ocean. Brine -- extremely salty water -- is a byproduct. 
Marine animals can be affected by sudden changes in the salinity of 
ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint marks the latest chapter in a five-year battle  
that pits the seawater-evaporation plant against environmentalists, 
a fight that has put the Mexican government in a touchy position. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the government is obligated to protect the reserve. But  
activists say the government has failed to pursue violations at the 
plant, even after they were reported by a government-appointed 
environmental prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely concerned by the attitude of the government  
and the Environment Secretariat,'' said Martha Delgado, head of the 
United Environmental Groups, one of the plaintiffs. ``These are 
very serious irregularities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Images of dead sea turtles and gray whales, taped by local  
fishermen and shown Wednesday to reporters, have become commonplace 
due to the Mexican government's lax enforcement of environmental 
laws, activists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the evidence included in Wednesday's complaint about sea  
turtle deaths was originally collected by a government-appointed 
federal prosecutor for environmental protection, but the agency has 
taken no action against ESSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Canto, a spokesman for the environmental protection  
prosecutor, denied any conflict of interest in the ESSA case and 
said authorities were still investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	In a press release, ESSA denied it had made any discharges, a  
claim that contradicts the government's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists contend authorities have failed to conduct  
a criminal investigation into the effects of ESSA's discharges, 
even though prosecutors are obliged to do so by law, and the 
alleged crimes are considered felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Alberto Perez, a Greenpeace representative, said the  
government's lack of action was an act of ``criminal negligence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two U.S. groups, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and  
the Natural Resources Defense Council, joined with 
Greenpeace-Mexico and dozens of Mexican environmental groups in 
presenting Wednesday's complaint to the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans by ESSA to build another, similar plant in a lagoon  
farther south on the peninsula have sparked greater concern by 
environmentalists. The lagoon is part of the El Vizcaino Biosphere 
Reserve, which was declared a U.N. World Heritage Site in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are concerned with the possible effects on the gray  
whale, which annually migrates from the Arctic waters of the Bering 
Sea to mate and give birth in the warm waters of the peninsula. 
Many dead whales have been found in the area recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fish that the whales eat are being killed by the  
discharges,'' Delgado said. ``The whales may simply be starving to 
death.''

<HEADLINE> Winter Goodwill Games May Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Winter Goodwill may get bigger.  
</P>
<P>
	While seven sports are on the schedule for the first Winter  
Goodwill Games next Feb. 17-20 in Lake Placid, N.Y., officials said 
Thursday that more could be added -- including some from outside the 
usual list. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in discussions to add some extreme sports events for  
entertainment value and also may add one or two more official 
events,'' Goodwill Games president Mike Plant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Sports announced the games will feature bobsled, figure  
skating, luge, skiing, ski jumping, snowboarding and short track 
speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice climbing, snow bicycling and super-modified shovel racing  
are a few of the extreme events that may be added to try and reach 
the younger male audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Placid, which hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics,  
beat out Lillehammer, Norway, for the Winter Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A major renovation project has already begun to rebuild the Lake  
Placid bobsled and luge tracks, which have fallen apart since the 
1980 Winter Olympics. The state has already contributed about 
$12.75 million for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bobsled and luge will be rebuilt and will be ready by  
February,'' New York Gov. George Pataki said. ``We have made it a 
priority. We have already committed state and federal funds to the 
project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said he expects about 50,000 fans to attend next year's  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous Summer Goodwill Games have been televised on TBS, but  
Turner's other network, TNT, will carry 16 hours of Winter Goodwill 
Games programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Future Summer and Winter Goodwill Games will be on TNT,  
beginning with the 2001 Summer Goodwill Games in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winter Goodwill Games will feature top professional and  
amateur athletes competing in a finals-only format for prize money. 
No dollar figure has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games are a great idea because they give amateur  
athletes a chance to showcase their sports,'' said former Olympic 
speedskating gold medalist Dan Jansen, who will work as a 
broadcaster for Turner during the games. ``Some of our sports are 
not the most popular, so it's a good opportunity for people to see 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodwill Games were the idea of media mogul Ted Turner, who  
began the event in 1986 in response to the Cold War boycotts of the 
1980 and 1984 Olympic Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Chortle Over Gore Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's claim that he is the  
father of the Internet drew amused protests Thursday from 
congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said that even under  
the time-honored tradition of politicians taking credit for 
everything, Gore's statement is an ``outrageous claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is widely credited for coining the term ``information  
superhighway,'' raised eyebrows with a pronouncement he made 
Tuesday during a CNN interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``During my service in the United States Congress, I took the  
initiative in creating the Internet,'' he said when asked to cite 
accomplishments that separate him from another Democratic 
presidential hopeful, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Apprised Thursday of the statement, Armey said: ``I just have to  
tell you that I cracked up this morning over his contention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the vice president created the Internet, then I created the  
interstate highway system,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Also tweaking Gore, the administration's point man on high-tech  
issues, was House Science Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., who issued a statement headlined, ``I had no idea!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice President Gore taking credit for creating the Internet  
certainly gives new meaning to the term 'March madness,''' 
Sensenbrenner said in a jab at his one-time Science Committee 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet, originally called ARPANET, dates to 1969, when the  
Defense Department began funding the project. Gore, then 21, was 
still eight years away from joining Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's spokesman, Chris Lehane, defended his  
boss's claim, saying Gore ``was the leader in Congress on the 
connections between data transmission and computing power, what we 
today call information technology. And those efforts helped to 
create the Internet that we know today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehane was gleeful over Armey's reference to the interstate  
highway system, noting that Al Gore Sr. -- during both his House and 
Senate tenures -- shepherded passage of legislation creating a 
national highway network. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, his father's leadership on the interstate highway  
system served as the model for the vice president's vision for a 
network of data highways,'' Lehane said. ``As for Congressman 
Armey, in his time in Congress, what he has created is division, 
divisiveness and partisan rancor but seemingly little else.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition launches $21 million campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fund-raising and voter turnout drive begun  
Thursday by the Christian Coalition is seeking monthly donations 
from church members throughout the country to help meet its $21 
million goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``21 Victory'' campaign is intended to recruit and train  
more than a million activists who, in turn, will encourage 
conservatives to vote in the 2000 elections. The campaign also will 
make the Christian Coalition's voter guide available on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Tate, the group's executive director, called the  
grassroots effort ``a combination of old-fashioned shoe leather and 
handbills, coupled with high-tech technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition President Pat Robertson said the drive, and the easier  
access of voter guides, is aimed at getting a record turnout among 
religious conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't some radical extreme; it's straight down the middle  
of what the American people would like to see,'' he said. ``All we 
want to do is facilitate their knowledge of the issues and 
facilitate their citizenship involvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-million letters were mailed this week to church  
members, asking each to donate about $20 a month for the next 21 
months, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans United for Separation of Church and State criticized  
the campaign as part of an ``annual publicity stunt that promises 
much, much more than (the group) can deliver.''

<HEADLINE> Bankers Trust Agrees To Pay $63.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bankers Trust Corp. settlement with federal and  
New York state authorities will not affect its planned merger with 
Deutsche Bank AG, both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust on Thursday agreed to pay a total of $63.5 million  
in fines to settle charges that it boosted its financial 
performance by unlawfully diverting millions of dollars from 
unclaimed customer accounts into its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea, entered by a bank lawyer before a federal judge,  
brought a speedy resolution to accusations that the bank made false 
entries in its books to conceal the true source of $19.1 million 
its employees diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust will pay a $60 million fine to federal authorities  
as well as a $3.5 million fine to the state of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In certain instances, these individuals acted contrary to the  
express legal advice of the bank's outside counsel,'' Bankers Trust 
lawyer David Daniel Brown IV told U.S. District Judge John G. 
Koeltl, reading from a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this group of employees included the senior manager  
and the controller of the business unit, the bank believes that a 
small number of ... employees were involved in the knowing 
falsification of the bank's records,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement that the bank  
initially minimized the extent of its officers' and employees' 
culpability. She said an investigation is still ongoing; Bankers 
Trust said it would continue to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged that, because of pressure to meet revenue  
and expense targets, the bank's officers and employees stole the 
money and used it to pad Bankers Trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's employees then allegedly doctored the books to cover  
up the theft. Most of the wrongdoing allegedly occurred in the 
bank's Client Processing Services division. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea agreement, the bank agreed to fully restore to  
customers and various states all the money that was improperly 
recorded as income or reserves from 1986 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the bank reported the false record-keeping in March  
1996, as soon as workers not involved in the wrongdoing discovered 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank then substantially changed the management of  
the departments involved in the scheme and overhauled policies and 
procedures so unclaimed property could no longer be put in the 
bank's own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Newman, chairman and CEO of Bankers Trust, said separately  
that the settlement should not have a significant affect on the 
bank's future business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it is appropriate to put this three-year-old matter  
behind us as we near our merger with Deutsche Bank,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolf E. Breuer, a spokesman for the board of managing directors  
for Deutsche Bank, said Bankers Trust has already informed the 
German bank about the issue. ``We commend Bankers Trust for its 
actions to address this problem, and we welcome their decision to 
settle this matter now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breuer said the merger should be approved by the second quarter  
of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Small-Time Samford Seeks Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Samford coach Jimmy Tillette didn't just  
take a page out of Princeton's playbook. He copied it cover to 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillette installed the entire Princeton system last year,  
complete with backdoor cuts, precision passing, 3-point gunning and 
a snail-paced tempo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We slavishly imitate what they do,'' said Tillette, who got  
the idea after having dinner with Tigers coaches at a tournament 
several years ago and watching hours of their game films. ``I 
thought this was something we seriously needed to do to start 
giving us the best chance to get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here is the first round of the NCAA tournament, where the  
14th-seeded Bulldogs, who hail from Birmingham, Ala. and cleverly 
bill themselves ``Southern-Fried Princeton,'' face third-seeded St. 
John's, one of the most athletic and explosive teams in the 
country, tonight in the South Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Samford, with an enrollment of 4,485, is making its first  
tournament appearance. The Bulldogs hope to emulate not just 
Princeton's style of play, but its penchant for being a postseason 
pest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just look like a bunch of normal students. Some people in  
the airport ask us if we are a high school team,'' said point guard 
Mario Lopez, who watched Princeton upset defending-champion UCLA in 
the 1996 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast between small-time Samford and the big-city bunch  
from St. John's is striking. The boisterous Johnnies joked and 
danced at Wednesday's practice. One player's cellular phone rang 
while he was taking questions from the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Samford, which hasn't played a team in this year's tournament  
field, quietly ran through its motion offense. One player brought 
along a video camera to record the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be the biggest challenge we've faced all year,''  
Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs, winners of 18 of their last 19 and the Trans  
America Athletic Conference, have some numbers on their side. Led 
by leading scorer Reed Rawlings and guard Will Daniel, they shoot 
an impressive 50 percent from the field and allow opponents only 
62.5 points per game. St. John's leads the Big East in scoring at 
79.4 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Samford also ranks second in the nation in 3-pointers made, with  
9.3 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't just get 3s, they get layups and 3s,'' said  
first-year St. John's coach Mike Jarvis, who insists he isn't 
looking ahead to a possible second-round matchup with George 
Washington, the school he coached last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, if there's a lucky seed to have as an underdog, it might  
be No. 14. Since 1986, No. 14 seeds have 11 victories over 
third-seeded teams in the first round, including four in the last 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Samford's players know what that kind of upset could do.  
``Hopefully up there it will become known as the Samford of the 
North,'' said Rawlings.

<HEADLINE> Wolfe Talks to Journalism Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The students took notes, asked questions and  
occasionally just stared. They clapped and lined up for autographs 
at the end of class, surely their first for which the lecturer wore 
a cream-colored suit and two-tone shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wolfe, popular novelist, influential journalist and proudly  
uninfluential dresser, was the guest speaker Wednesday night at a 
Columbia University journalism course on ``narrative writing,'' a 
subject he is known to have many opinions about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, he was inspiring,'' said one student, Shazia  
Ahmad. ``He's a role model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author of such best sellers as ``The Right Stuff,'' ``The  
Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ``A Man in Full'' used no notes as he 
spoke confidently about his writing and reporting style and about 
his years as a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing the education, and the joy, of research, Wolfe said  
he most enjoyed taking on subjects he knew nothing about. He 
remembered showing up at a race car event, dressed not unlike how 
he appeared before the class, and being looked at as if he were 
from another planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very early, I gave up the idea I was going to blend into  
anything,'' Wolfe said with a smile. ``I was just the man from 
Mars, a smile on my face, ignorant of what's going on, waiting to 
learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assigned reading for the class was Wolfe's 1989 essay,  
``Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,'' in which he called for a 
return to the broad, journalistic style of novels associated with 
Charles Dickens and Emile Zola. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe, whose own books are openly modeled on 19th century works,  
called the current state of American fiction ``pathetic'' and 
``anorexic'' and likened himself to a preacher of an unwanted 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got nothing but scorn for my missionary work and I still do  
to this day,'' said the author, whose essay was widely attacked as 
arrogant and narrow. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the students to form a ``theory of life,'' saying this  
was essential for narrative writing. Wolfe's own belief, which he 
applied to everyone from hunters to astronauts to bankers, was that 
life is a constant search for status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to the conclusion that at every moment we are sorting  
out ... our standing,'' he said. ``This is what I look for in every 
situation I'm reporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at one of the world's most prestigious journalism  
schools, Wolfe included himself in his theory. He admitted that a 
major reason for turning to fiction was because he worried about 
being seen as ``only'' a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to show that I could do this, too,'' explained Wolfe,  
whose first novel, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' came out in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign of status came from an institution he said he had never  
thought about. The author was recently elected to the elite 
American Academy of Arts and Letters, which includes such admirers 
of Wolfe's as the novelist and academy president Louis Auchincloss 
and such non-admirers as John Updike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite a nice honor,'' Wolfe said. ``Also, I figure maybe  
it'll help me get a platform for my missionary work in the realm of 
the American novel. ... I'll get a chance to bring it to the 
unannointed, to the heathens.''

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Prehistoric Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In what may be a warning for the next century, a new study  
suggests carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere fluctuated 
after the Ice Age, helping to warm the climate and trigger the 
spread of deserts. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say the findings -- which were based on an analysis of  
ice cores drilled from glaciers in Antarctica -- may indicate what 
global warming could do to the Earth in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is called a ``greenhouse gas''  
because it traps the sun's heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Levels of carbon dioxide fell and rose by small but persistent  
amounts between 11,000 and 1,000 years ago, according to the Swiss 
and American scientists who examined the ice cores and reported 
their findings in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	They also found that the fluctuations correlate with droughts  
and the spread of deserts in Africa and Asia during the prehistoric 
period known as Holocene. 
</P>
<P>
	These ancient carbon dioxide levels, while significant, were far  
lower than the rising concentrations in today's atmosphere that are 
blamed on industry and motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the findings raise questions about whether the  
Earth is headed for rapid and drastic climate changes in the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``The carbon dioxide changes over the last few thousand years  
have been tiny and slow compared to what humans are doing,'' said 
glaciologist Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University, who 
did not participate in the study. ``We are moving into uncharted 
waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the University of Bern in Switzerland and the  
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., examined 
400 samples drilled from the upper layers of the Taylor Dome 
glacier in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	From 11,000 to 8,000 years ago, carbon dioxide levels overall  
dipped by 8 parts per million, the scientists reported. During the 
next 7,000 years, carbon dioxide rose by 25 ppm. The increase 
probably came from carbon that was released as plants burned or 
deteriorated in a drying climate, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers reached their conclusions by analyzing different  
forms, or isotopes, of carbon dioxide in the layers of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings challenge the assumption that Earth's climate has  
been stable since the glaciers retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tended to view the last 10,000 years as being  
constant,'' said ice core expert James White of the University of 
Colorado. ``But carbon levels really haven't stabilized. Humans 
have continuity built into their thinking, and this study will 
shock people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Holocene's climate swings were a natural phenomenon. But  
during the past 200 years, the burning of coal, gasoline and other 
fossil fuels has added more than 80 ppm of carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere. The total amount is now above 370 ppm and is expected 
to double in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990s is the warmest decade on record. Many scientists fear  
that human activity is the driving force behind the warming. 
</P>
<P>
	White and other scientists said the group's analysis is  
plausible, but suspect it is too neat to be precisely accurate. It 
does not adequately reflect the complex interactions of oceans, 
forests and other ecological features in the carbon cycle, White 
said.

<HEADLINE> Education Bill Reaches Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's schools would get greater freedom  
in how they spend federal education money under a measure passed 
Thursday by the House. A Senate bill was also up for a vote, but 
without new money for hiring teachers that Democrats also had 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Senate bill, if passed, includes an amendment that  
would let states shift the money they are already slated to get for 
new teachers to special education instead, possibly affecting 
checks heading out this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have chosen the path of partisanship and  
division,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a telephone 
interview. She was out of town due to the death of her 
father-in-law. ``I really would question their sincerity to do 
something before an election, and then five months later they undo 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last fall's spending bill, Congress in a compromise approved  
$1.2 billion to help schools hire about 30,000 new teachers in the 
early grades. President Clinton wants a total of 100,000 new 
teachers hired over seven years, costing more than $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote on the Senate bill was expected later Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The House vote on the more limited bill, without money for  
special education or new teachers, was 330-90. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``ed-flex'' bill, the first education measure of  
this Congress, initially enjoyed strong bipartisan support but 
quickly became a battleground for each party's efforts to put its 
own mark on the nation's education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats wanted the measure to include Clinton's education  
proposals, chiefly more money for new teachers. But Republicans 
insisted those proposals should be raised later in the year and not 
bog down the ``ed-flex'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday broke a nearly weeklong deadlock over  
the issue, agreeing to consider amendments favored by Democrats, 
including money to pay for another year of the Clinton new-teacher 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But several key Democratic amendments failed Thursday. The  
Republican amendment that passed would allow states to shift 
new-teacher money instead to federal special education funding, 
which Republicans contend falls short of what the law allows. 
</P>
<P>
	States say the federal government, which dictates the rules  
states must follow on special education, provides only 7 percent to 
12 percent of the costs for those programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Republican majority voted down two Democratic  
amendments, and Democrats ran out of time in their attempts to 
offer more, including the new-teachers proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``ed-flex'' bill itself would let states and school  
districts apply federal money to programs that serve them best. For 
example, schools could use federal money meant for science and math 
teachers to boost reading instruction if that's what they need. 
</P>
<P>
	The ed-flex bill affects some of the rules governing the $15  
billion in annual federal education spending for kindergarten 
through high school. Laws already prohibit states from waiving 
rules regarding a school's safety, maintenance, students' civil 
rights and instruction of special education students. States often 
view these rules as the most expensive and time-consuming to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed two Republican amendments designed to require  
states to show better proof that they are meeting students' needs 
under their waivers even when ed-flex becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is S 280. The House bill is HR 800.

	LONDON (AP) -- Judi Dench looks up to Gwyneth Paltrow, her young  
co-star in the film ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Academy Award nominee for best-supporting actress, she was at  
such a height disadvantage during filming that she had to wear 
shoes with 5-inch soles to look Paltrow in the eye.

<P>
	The shoes quickly were nicknamed ``Tudor Spice,'' since Dench  
was playing Queen Elizabeth I and the footwear looked like 
something the Spice Girls might wear.

`No, I could see the Tudor Spice showing under your dress!'' Dench 
told interviewers during taping of ``Film Night, '' a television 
show that airs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't playing the part that was so difficult, it was  
trying to walk in those shoes with that huge, heavy costume on,''

<HEADLINE> Will Gumbel Return to Morning TV? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two years ago this week, CBS won an intense  
three-network bidding war for the services of former ``Today'' host 
Bryant Gumbel by agreeing to pay him nearly $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's virtually an invisible man.  
</P>
<P>
	His newsmagazine canceled, Gumbel hasn't appeared on the air for  
CBS since he was host of a news special in December. It's not clear 
when he'll appear on-screen again. CBS says it is discussing future 
projects with Gumbel, but won't disclose more. 
</P>
<P>
	To some at the network, the comeback path appears clear: a  
return to morning television as host of CBS's perpetually 
struggling ``This Morning,'' where Gumbel would compete against the 
morning institution where he reigned for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel's agent, Ed Hookstratten, said CBS officials have talked  
with Gumbel about being host of the morning show, but the idea is a 
long way from reality. Gumbel sent word through a spokeswoman that 
he didn't want to talk publicly about the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``He enjoyed his 15 years on `Today,''' Hookstratten said.  
``He's been away from it for a few years. He may be amenable to it, 
I don't know. But it hasn't gotten to the point of `Hey, Bryant, 
will you do it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing Gumbel to ``This Morning'' would allow CBS to take a  
serious run at ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for second place in 
morning TV, an increasingly lucrative time of day for networks. 
``Today'' is so far ahead that it's not a realistic target at this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' very briefly surged past ``Good Morning  
America'' in the ratings at the end of last year, but has settled 
back into third place since Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson were 
installed as hosts of the ABC show. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is talking about a range of changes to ``This Morning,'' now  
anchored by Mark McEwen and Jane Robelot, CBS News President Andrew 
Heyward said. ``We are pleased with its progress but are not 
satisfied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bryant and I are colleagues and friends and we talk all the  
time,'' Heyward said. ``Of course, the morning show is part of 
this. But there have been no offers, no negotiations, no demands. 
All of this is a work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good Morning America'' may actually pave the way for Gumbel's  
return. Luring Sawyer and Gibson to be hosts established the 
precedent of news stars returning to morning television, making it 
easier for CBS to approach Gumbel about this job. Sawyer worked for 
CBS's morning show in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be slightly strange for those of us who  
worked with him every day to be competing against him,'' said Jeff 
Zucker, executive producer of ``Today.'' ``On the other hand, I 
would certainly welcome it because more competition is always great 
and Bryant is certainly terrific at this. It would be strange but 
kind of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's far more complicated than adjusting a chair for him on  
the morning show set. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is considering an expensive real estate deal to build a  
street-front studio for ``This Morning'' off New York's Central 
Park, imitating the successful ``Today'' window at Rockefeller 
Plaza. Without it, many at CBS doubt Gumbel would want the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Morning'' would also probably have to change its unique  
format that turns over much of its first hour to its affiliates for 
local news. 
</P>
<P>
	The network gave away that time a few years ago to stave off a  
mutiny by affiliates angry at low ratings. Persuading these local 
stations to give the time back, or perhaps accept time in the 
second hour, would take delicate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	A key man in these discussions is Steve Friedman, executive at  
CBS's affiliate in New York City. Friedman's also a former 
executive producer of ``Today'' when Gumbel worked there. A 
decision on what to do about ``This Morning'' is expected before an 
important meeting of CBS affiliates in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people, including Zucker, claim any insider knowledge about  
what Gumbel will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a big decision to make,'' Zucker said.  
``Bryant's not going to be pushed into it no matter how much the 
media speculates or people talk about it. He'll do what's best for 
him, as he should. At the end of the day, he's also a very loyal 
company man and he'll do what he's asked to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after he was in huge demand, Gumbel, 50, is in a  
peculiar sort of limbo: making millions to bide his time. The 
talent that helped him rise from local sports reporting to the 
rarified air of network star -- particularly his ability to conduct 
a tough, live interview -- is in mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
	His status as highly-paid benchwarmer is a natural flashpoint  
for resentment, especially since he works for a network run by Mel 
Karmazin, an aggressive cost-cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	There appear to be few other options for Gumbel at CBS. The  
network has already renewed its three prime-time newsmagazines for 
next season, and he has worked for none of them. There's no room 
for Gumbel's ``Public Eye,'' which received lukewarm ratings and 
reviews before being canceled. Dan Rather isn't going anywhere, and 
Gumbel has said he isn't interested in anchoring the evening news, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel has been working with Dunbar Productions, his syndication  
company set up as part of his deal with CBS, although none of its 
projects has been revealed. He continues as host of ``Real Sports'' 
on HBO. And much of his time the past month has been spent running 
a charity golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	If he says no to the morning show, the next step will likely be  
negotiations to buy out his CBS contract.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Senate Democrats End Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Democrats in the state Senate ended a  
boycott Thursday that killed one-third of the legislative session 
but failed to resolve a partisan fight centered on Republican Lt. 
Gov. Steve Windom. 
</P>
<P>
	Shouting broke out as soon as all 35 senators convened for the  
first time this session. The bickering lasted about an hour, until 
the Democrat-dominated Senate agreed to adjourn until March 23 to 
quit wasting meeting days and to allow both sides to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully there will be serious negotiations to get back to a  
civil approach,'' said Democratic Sen. Jim Preuitt. 
</P>
<P>
	But Windom gave little hope of that happening. ``Even now they  
are plotting their next move,'' he said of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Constitution gives the lieutenant governor two duties:  
presiding over the Senate and voting in case of a tie. The Senate 
has traditionally let the lieutenant governor make committee 
appointments and decide which committee considers each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed Nov. 3, when Windom was elected Alabama's first  
Republican lieutenant governor this century and Democratic Lt. Gov. 
Don Siegelman was elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking office as governor, Siegelman pushed through rules  
on an 18-17 vote that stripped the lieutenant governor's office of 
most of its powers and gave them to Senate President Pro Tem Lowell 
Barron, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom grabbed back his powers with a voice vote when the  
Legislature's annual session opened March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen Democrats -- a majority in the Senate -- sued Windom and  
started boycotting. With the Legislature limited to 30 meeting days 
each year, the standoff wasted 10 days with no legislation being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Friday on  
a Democratic judge's ruling that Windom violated the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900 for First Time / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average surged above  
9,800 and 9,900 for the first time today, buoyed by a rally in oil 
stocks and more evidence that the U.S. economy is growth at a 
non-inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 153.19 at 9,926.03, adding to its 79-point record-setting gain 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also were rising, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index also hitting a new high and flirting with its 
first close ever above 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up 2 1/2 at  
85 3/4, and Exxon, which rose 2 3/8 at 75 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also fueling today's rally was new data showing the U.S. economy  
is growing without any inflationary threats. Since there are no 
signs that the economy is overheating, investors believe that the 
Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to boost interest 
rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department said today that  
first-time claims for unemployment checks remained under 300,000 
for the sixth consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 410.23 million 
shares, up from 352.44 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.46 to 1,297.30 and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 20.39 to 2,426.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.69 at 611.17, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.88 at 721.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Check Security at Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 80 of the nation's largest airports  
will undergo an extensive security review by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, as it cracks down on reported lapses in controlled 
access to secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA launched the six-week review after auditors in a survey  
of five airports found inadequate safeguards for keeping 
unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. Once federal officials 
have scrutinized security measures at the nation's 78 largest 
commercial airports, they will then look into smaller commercial 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it would be worthwhile to look at the issue of  
access to non-public areas of airports on a broader scale,'' FAA 
spokesman Eliot Brenner said Wednesday. The agency will also 
determine whether it needs to do ``red team testing'' -- such as 
sending undercover agents to try to penetrate security -- to ensure 
that identified problem areas have been addressed after the review. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at  
five major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations 
Committee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the 
auditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas 
and even board the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a high percentage of tests involving airport access  
controls, our successful penetration of secure areas almost always 
resulted in our boarding an aircraft,'' said Alexis Stefani, the 
Transportation Department's deputy assistant inspector general for 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani told lawmakers many of the problems found in a similar  
audit in 1993 still exist. For example, Stefani said, undercover 
personnel could enter through emergency exits and penetrate air 
cargo facilities by following airport personnel through access 
control points. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of individuals encountered by the agents failed to  
challenge them for unauthorized access and in some cases, airport 
law enforcement officials failed to respond to emergency door 
alarms. At two airports, undercover auditors bypassed passenger 
screening checkpoints and entered the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani attributed the ``human element'' as the primary weakness  
in keeping unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's inspection and testing of airport security also needs  
strengthening, Stefani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for  
security, while airports are responsible for controlling access to 
secured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and 
cargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been 
responsible for maintaining security equipment and systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to airports, Retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the  
FAA's associate administrator for civil aviation security, said 
unauthorized personnel sneaking past controlled access represents a 
serious security breech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowing intruders to piggyback through access doors, not  
challenging intruders on the ramp, and intruders being able to get 
aboard aircraft, combine to make a significant vulnerability,'' 
Flynn wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that ``redundant measures, such as guarding the  
individual aircraft,'' could be required if the problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported in its Wednesday editions that  
federal agents were able to get through security doors 46 times at 
four major airports, walk around on the tarmac and board 51 
airplanes unchallenged.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Foodborne Illnesses Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cases of foodborne illness caused by certain  
germs, including salmonella, declined sharply last year, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although E. coli cases increased, the Centers for Disease  
Control and Prevention said the decreases in some foodborne 
illnesses were attributable to changes in meat and poultry 
processing under a Department of Agriculture program implemented in 
January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of salmonella infections, which are rarely fatal but  
can cause food poisoning, decreased 14 percent over the last two 
years -- from 14.5 per 100,000 people in 1996 to 12.4 per 100,000 in 
1998, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates of campylobacteriosis, the most widespread cause of food  
poisoning, rose from 1996 to 1997 but then declined 14 percent last 
year, from 25.2 per 100,000 in '97 to 21.7. 
</P>
<P>
	And cases of cryptosporidium, a parasite spread through human or  
animal feces that can be fatal in people weakened by AIDS, cancer 
or old age, dropped 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines ``suggest that the stepped up prevention efforts of  
the USDA and the FDA may be working,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, 
head of the CDC. ``However, the reasons for these declines are not 
fully understood and more study is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After declining 15 percent from 1996 to 1997, E. coli 0157:H7  
infections increased 22 percent from 1997 to 1998. The reasons for 
the increase were unclear. E. coli infections have been linked to 
milk, drinking water, beef and lettuce, among other foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were based on preliminary data from the Foodborne  
Diseases Active Surveillance Network, which began collecting data 
on seven bacterial and two parasitic organisms in 1996 at seven 
sites located in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, 
Minnesota, New York and Oregon.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- Imagine coming grin-to-grin with a  
yellow shark off the coast of Brazil, then watching as it is gently 
forced to expel its stomach contents for tests that could save the 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	Or peering over the shoulder of world-renowned marine scientists  
at the moment they discover a sea sponge containing a compound for 
new medicine that could slow the development of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Friday, it will all be possible, and no scuba gear or  
shark repellent is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution is launching a new  
Web site -- www.at-sea.org -- that will post daily dispatches from 
its marine expeditions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cover ocean science adventures -- real frontier  
stuff,'' said Sean Kelley, Web master at Harbor Branch. ``People we 
run into in the lunch line just came back from 3,000 feet below the 
ocean. We want to get those stories out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first dispatches will come via e-mail from the research ship  
where Sam Gruber, a University of Miami scientist, is studying 
yellow sharks off the coast of Brazil. In addition to written 
reports, the daily updates will include video clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to give the public an up-close look at the  
expeditions was welcomed by Shirley Pomponi, director of Harbor 
Branch's division of biomedical marine research. Her work relies on 
funding through private and government grants. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera crew from At Sea will accompany Pomponi in August on  
a drug discovery mission in the Gulf of Mexico, the Florida Keys 
and the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sea also is planning to broadcast dispatches from a research  
buoy in the Bahamas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration plans to use the buoy to record the sound of rain on 
the ocean's surface and measure rainfall amounts in remote areas, 
said Mary Clark, director of the Harbor Branch media lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers at the facility about 150 miles north of Miami  
have long been known for their cutting-edge work. A submersible 
acrylic sphere developed there was used to help search for the 
remains of the space shuttle Challenger after it exploded off 
Florida's coast. The submersibles also allow researchers to troll 
the depths for undiscovered species.

<HEADLINE> Cracker Barrel 500 Not in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- NASCAR drivers, who have been playing to record  
crowds throughout the country in recent years, will see something 
unusual as they wind around the Atlanta Motor Speedway Sunday -- 
empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	With the forecast calling for temperatures in the 40s and  
possible rain, about 30,000 tickets remained unsold Thursday for 
the Cracker Barrel 500. Organizers hope to sell about 7,000 more 
tickets before Sunday's race at the 118,000-seat track. 
</P>
<P>
	The race, often held in chilly or damp weather, has never sold  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ahead of last year's pace, and if all goes well, we  
should have the best sales in the history of the event,'' Atlanta 
Motor Speedway president Ed Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has tried for years to move the event to a warmer time of  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's not alone. Demand for tickets to the Feb. 21  
Dura-Lube-Big Kmart 400 in Rockingham, N.C., nosedived when 
forecasters started talking about cold temperatures and snow. 
Attendance at the North Carolina Speedway, which seats about 
65,000, was estimated at 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two races of the year, held in warm-weather cities Las  
Vegas and Daytona, Fla., had sellout crowds of 130,000 and 185,000 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	But coming at the height of basketball season, shortly before  
spring break and right after the Daytona 500 puts the Cracker 
Barrel 500 at a disadvantage, track officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's race is the first of two annual NASCAR events at the  
Atlanta track. The other, scheduled in November, is the season 
finale NAPA 500, which is usually a sellout.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Suggests Rebel Cover-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A low-ranking rebel may be taking the  
fall for his superiors in the slaying of three Americans, the 
Colombian government suggested Thursday after the nation's largest 
rebel group took responsibility for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rebels' stunning confession Wednesday was taken as a  
sign of their desire for peace, the U.S. government insisted the 
guerrillas turn over the killers, and friends and relatives of the 
victims demanded to know why they were slain. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  
Colombia, or FARC, said Wednesday that a local squad leader had 
acted without his superior's knowledge or approval in abducting and 
executing Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, and Terence 
Freitas, 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had traveled to Colombia in February to help set up a  
school system for a local Indian group, the 8,000-member U'wa 
nation. Their bodies were found a week ago in a field just across 
the border in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	FARC commander Raul Reyes said the Americans were picked up  
after straying onto rebel-held territory ``without guerilla 
authorization.'' They were executed on orders of a 6-year veteran 
squad leader named Gildardo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gildardo may face the firing squad for his actions after a  
tribunal of rebel leaders considers the case, said Reyes, who 
pleaded for forgiveness and urged that the slayings not derail 
faltering efforts to negotiate an end to Colombia's 34-year 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian military leaders, however, challenged Reyes' account  
and said the highly hierarchical rebel group may be covering up the 
participation of higher-ranking commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said Thursday that military  
intelligence indicates the commander of the FARC's Eastern bloc 
ordered the killings. The man implicated is German Briceno, brother 
of the FARC's No. 2 leader, Jorge Briceno, Lloreda said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Thursday called the FARC response  
``woefully inadequate.'' Spokesman James Rubin said the rebels 
should hand over the guilty rebels to authorities and fully 
cooperate with the government's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	FARC leaders had recently sought improved relations with  
Washington, a factor that led many to speculate that the killings 
had been the work of a renegade unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members and friends of the activists also raised  
questions about the rebel's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still needs to be a lot more clarity and a full  
investigation and not just by the FARC,'' said Leslie Wirpsa, a 
former girlfriend of Freitas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, Freitas' mother said she would take no solace in  
the FARC executing her son's killer -- especially if there was any 
chance the rebel was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our family is not interested in revenge or any more  
bloodshed,'' Julie Freitas said in a telephone interview. ``We're 
interested in creating peace in the world and continuing our work 
with the indigenous culture (of the U'wa).''

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Ancient CO2 Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying gasses trapped in  
Antarctic ice over the last 250,000 years found that the Earth 
tended to warm up and later experience an increase in atmospheric 
carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps Institute of Oceanography researchers said a study of  
gas extracted from polar ice cores showed that carbon dioxide 
levels did not rise until hundreds of years after the Earth entered 
a period of warming after an ice age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that at these periods when the climate is  
transitioning from a glacial to an interglacial period, the 
atmospheric C02 concentrations lag behind the rise in temperature 
by about 600 years,'' said Martin Wahlen, a co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Atmospheric carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has been  
blamed by some scientists for a recent rise in global temperatures. 
The study by Wahlen suggests that the rise in CO2 earlier in the 
Earth's history followed a global warming trend instead of 
preceding the temperature change. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice cores studied were drilled from deep beneath the surface  
of ice covering Antarctica. The ice dated back thousands of years, 
and each level contained bubbles of carbon dioxide that were 
trapped from the atmosphere at the time the ice formed. Thus, gas 
content of the cores reflects the chemical mix of the atmosphere in 
those ancient times.

<P>
	The studies included three ice ages that started 18,000, 135,000  
and 240,000 years ago. Each ice age lasted about 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahlen said warming between the ice ages probably caused a  
global boom in plants. This created decaying organic matter that 
put out CO2, which is gradually concentrated in the atmosphere, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers To Reopen Au Pair Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Louise Woodward's lawyers said Thursday they want  
to review medical evidence in light of a new theory aired on ``60 
Minutes'' that young Matthew Eappen may have been strangled by 
someone, not shaken to death by the former au pair. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys said they don't know if the new theory is  
reliable, but they were glad that two doctors interviewed on the 
CBS program agreed 8-month-old Matthew did not die from shaken baby 
syndrome, as prosecutors contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The report stirred another wave of controversy over the case,  
with a group of more than 70 doctors criticizing the CBS report as 
``preposterous'' and the revelation that one of the two experts had 
been paid by defense lawyers. Martha Coakley, co-prosecutor on the 
case, has called the theory ``crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Harvey Silverglate said the defense team called  
the news conference Thursday to respond to the criticism and 
announce their decision to find how Matthew died. 
</P>
<P>
	He said they would have their own experts review the  
strangulation findings and then approach prosecutors to see if they 
could launch a joint investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miss Woodward has always taken the course that would vindicate  
her and prove her innocent,'' said Barry Scheck, another defense 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The former British au pair, who was caring for Matthew, was  
convicted in October 1997 of second-degree murder. The judge 
reduced her conviction to involuntary manslaughter and released her 
from prison. She returned home to England in June and is attending 
law school. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, she settled a civil wrongful death case with the  
baby's parents, Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``60 Minutes,'' Drs. Floyd Gilles, a neuropathologist, and  
Marvin Nelson, a radiologist, both affiliated with Children's 
Hospital in Los Angeles, offered the theory that Matthew had been 
strangled up to 48 hours before his hospitalization on Feb. 4, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense lawyers said they had not yet spoken at length with  
Gilles or Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	They acknowledged, however, that Nelson received $700 before the  
trial as a defense consultant. He wasn't called as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to CBS Tuesday, a group of pediatricians and  
forensic experts said the network and the two doctors owe the 
Eappens an apology. The group said the strangulation theory is not 
supported by medical literature. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our doctors have seen the evidence firsthand. These doctors,  
who wrote the letter, haven't,'' said ``60 Minutes'' spokesman 
Kevin Tedesco.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Fall in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds decreased by $2.87 billion to $864.89 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $2.18 billion to $712.51 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets decreased by $683.9 million to $152.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds increased by $2.04  
billion to $589.80 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets increased by $2.53 billion 
to $541.27 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds decreased by $496.6 
million to $48.53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.455 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.456 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.35 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.37 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield remained unchanged at 4.36 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.44 percent from 4.47  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.45 percent from 4.46 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds held  
steady at 61 days, the same as in the previous week, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.16 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
fell to 0.96 percent from 0.97 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield held steady  
at 4.14 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. Yields on 
1-year CDs rose to 4.37 percent from 4.33 percent as they also rose 
on 2 1/2-year CDs to 4.43 percent from 4.39 percent. Yields on 5-year 
CDs rose to 4.56 percent from 4.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Sign Ramon Martinez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- His workout was coming to a close and  
Ramon Martinez decided it was time to show Boston a little 
something extra. 
</P>
<P>
	``I let one go a little, but I know I can do better,'' Martinez  
said Thursday after agreeing to a minor league contract with the 
Boston Red Sox that reunites him with his younger brother, Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez, 30, gets a $1.5 million signing bonus and a  
$140,000 a month salary in the minors. But if he's added to the 
major league roster, which is expected, he gets a two-year contract 
with a team option for 2001, a deal that could bring him about $24 
million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who was 7-3 last year with Los Angeles before his  
season was cut short for rotator cuff surgery, came into the Red 
Sox clubhouse early Thursday, changed at his brother's locker and 
went out and threw 30 pitches off a bullpen mound in front of 
general manager Dan Duquette, assistant GM Mike Port and team 
physician Dr. Arthur Pappas. 
</P>
<P>
	On his final pitch, he unloaded a hard fastball before walking  
off with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming along on his rehab very nicely,'' Duquette said.  
``He had good life on his fastball. Good control. He had a little 
extra on the last one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even last year when Ramon was pitching with a problem in his  
shoulder, he was pitching with a lot of velocity,'' Duquette said. 
``We expect him to comeback with a full recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, who hopes to have Martinez in his  
rotation by midseason, also heard an excellent report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get to see him throw on the side,'' Williams said.  
``I had a lot of people tell me he threw the ball very well. I 
think that's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez played all 11 of his major league seasons with the  
Dodgers, and said he could have gone back. The chance to again play 
with his younger brother was most appealing. The two played 
together in parts of the 1992 and '93 seasons before Pedro was 
traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made an offer, but I didn't really want it,'' he said.  
``I'm glad to be with my brother again. I'd like to be here the 
rest of my career. The good thing about Pedro is he's very 
competitive and I'm also very competitive. He's going to have to 
help me with the scouting report. We're going to help each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was 123-77 with a 3.45 ERA for the Dodgers, winning 20  
games in 1990 and pitching a no-hitter against the Florida Marlins 
in 1995. He talked to 27-year-old Pedro, acquired by the Red Sox 
from Montreal in November 1997, before joining the club. But the 
choice was his alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ramon's a proven major-league pitcher,'' Duquette said. ``He  
brings excellent leadership ability to the Red Sox and we're 
looking forward to him making a contribution to this year's team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is expected to leave for his home in the Dominican  
Republic for 10 days before returning to Fort Myers on March 22, 
his 31st birthday. He's been throwing twice a week at about 
three-quarters of his normal speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's coming along very, very well,'' he said. ``I  
don't have exactly the date I'll be back. I don't have any question 
I'll be back and I'll be back 100 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Cavs Trade Potapenko for DeClercq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cavaliers acquired Andrew DeClercq and a  
first-round draft pick from Boston in a trade Thursday for Vitaly 
Potapenko, Cleveland team president Wayne Embry announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10, Ukrainian-born Potapenko has played in all 17  
Cleveland games this season, averaging 8.4 points and 5.5 rebounds 
per game. He was selected by Cleveland as the 12th pick overall in 
the 1996 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Potapenko, 23, who played for Wright State, has a career average  
of 6.7 points and 3.5 rebounds in 177 NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-10 DeClercq has averaged 5.4 points and 4.5 rebounds in 14  
games for Boston. He was drafted by Golden State in the second 
round, the 34th pick overall, in the 1995 draft, and was in his 
second year with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	DeClercq has a career average of 5 points and 4.2 rebounds in  
188 NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the trade, Cleveland also gets a first-round draft  
pick between now and 2001. The Cavs have the option of when to use 
the pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, Cleveland's pick cannot be among  
the top three this year. A pick in the following two years would be 
unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
	Potapenko had been used largely as a reserve forward-center  
until a season-ending injury to center Zydrunas Ilgauskas last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had been under a deadline to sign Potapenko to a new  
contract by Saturday or face losing him to free agency after the 
season.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House and Senate are nearing votes on  
bills designed to give schools more flexibility in spending federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate broke through six days of procedural jousting and  
agreed to vote today on both the bill and amendments demanded by 
Democrats to implement President Clinton's education proposals, 
including federal subsidies for hiring thousands of new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats have battled over whether the  
``ed-flex'' bill, which would loosen strings on certain federal 
dollars, should include plans to spend $1.2 billion to hire 100,000 
new teachers nationwide to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, senator leaders cut a deal to put the bill up  
for a vote, along with a handful of amendments that include the 
new-teacher plan. Republicans had opposed adding the plan to the 
ed-flex bill, originally thought to be an easy, bipartisan 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The House returns today, after a day of blocking Democrats'  
attempts to amend its version of the bill. Lawmakers there also 
promised to finish the bill today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., predicted the Senate  
bill would pass easily. ``We've reached a point where we are going 
to be able to finish this bill,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Clinton wasn't  
considering a veto -- at least not yet. ``We'll wait and see how it 
comes out in the Senate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since education's emergence as a popular issue of concern to  
voters, both parties have rushed to be the first to pass an 
education bill this session, leading to frustration on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The scramble is particularly keen in the Senate, where  
retirement announcements leave seats up for grabs in the 2000 
elections in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The slate of amendments in the Senate deal also allows  
Republicans to push their favored notion: more special education 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving more control to the state and local  
governments,'' said Joe Karpinski, spokesman for the Senate Health, 
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ``We're glad that it's 
coming up for a vote. We wanted to get the bill passed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A compromise in the House remains to be reached. The Democratic  
proposal for new money for teachers to reduce class sizes would 
only add money without fixing those problems, said Rep. Bill 
Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ed-flex measure, states and school districts could  
apply federal money to programs that serve them best, Republicans 
say. For example, states could allow schools to use money targeted 
for low-income students or for training math and science teachers 
on other programs that benefit the entire school. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats also support that idea, but insist that schools  
need more federal money to hire teachers to reduce class sizes. 
Last year, in a spending bill compromise, Congress approved $1 
billion for the states to use to hire new teachers. Clinton has 
said his plan to hire a total of 100,000 new teachers for the 
nation's schools would require $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the ed-flex bill passes, it would affect only a portion  
of rules governing the $15 billion in education spending for 
kindergarten through high school. By law, states cannot waive rules 
regarding a school's safety, maintenance or assurance of student 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The states also could not waive regulations under the federal  
special education law, which many states view as the most expensive 
and time-consuming to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill is HR 800; the Senate bill is S 280.

<HEADLINE> Sailors Refuse Anthrax Vaccinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Twenty-three sailors aboard the aircraft  
carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have been demoted, fined and given 
extra duty for refusing to take mandatory anthrax vaccinations, 
according to the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department has encountered resistance as it seeks to  
inoculate all 2.4 million active duty and reserve military members 
by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the Marines Corps has  
been particularly hard-hit, with more than two dozen Marines in 
Okinawa refusing the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccinations were ordered a year ago by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen for all military units sent to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, played down  
the extent of the problem today, saying ``less than one-tenth of 1 
percent'' of troops have refused so far to receive the series of 
shots among some 218,000 personnel already vaccinated against 
anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that Cohen, who has been vaccinated against anthrax as  
an example to the troops, didn't authorize the inoculations until 
he was assured they were safe. U.S. Army special forces have been 
receiving anthrax vaccinations since the 1970s, including annual 
boosters, Doubleday said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here are measures, medical measures  
which are designed to protect individuals in the U.S. military who 
may at some future time be put into a theater where anthrax is a 
threat,'' Doubleday said at a regular Pentagon briefing. ``And this 
series of vaccinations will enable service personnel to operate in 
that kind of an environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubleday confirmed that U.S. military personnel who refuse the  
anthrax shots face dismissal, usually through an administrative 
process, for refusing to follow an order. Whether they're honorably 
or dishonorably discharged depends on their service record, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, 38 Roosevelt sailors balked at the vaccinations,  
which began two weeks ago as the carrier prepared for a six-month 
deployment starting March 26. Some sailors later changed their 
minds, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, 50 to 100 service members are known to have  
resisted inoculation. In February, 11 California Air Force Reserve 
pilots chose to quit rather than take the anthrax vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Airman 1st Class Jeffrey Bettendorf, 25, chose an  
``other than honorable'' discharge to avoid a special 
court-martial. He said his research showed the vaccine is untested 
and unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy confirmed the Roosevelt situation Wednesday following  
an inquiry by The Virginian-Pilot, which received an anonymous 
e-mail message from a sailor who said sailors were concerned about 
potential side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was given nothing to explain what I was taking, so I did my  
own research and found disturbing reports,'' the sailor said. ``We 
are scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cmdr. Garry Rudolph, a Navy doctor who directs the occupational  
health and preventive medicine program at the Portsmouth Naval 
Medical Center, said the anthrax vaccine is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials confirmed last year that a sailor on the  
destroyer USS John S. McCain developed a temporary paralysis after 
being vaccinated. Officials said the sailor fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy contends it has provided sailors with information about  
the vaccine, answered their questions and offered counseling to 
those who initially refused. 
</P>
<P>
	The holdouts on the Roosevelt were charged with disobeying an  
order and punished with a reduction in pay, fines, restriction to 
the ship and extra duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy refused to identify any of those punished but said they  
may be given administrative discharges once the ship returns.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield, Lewis Rhetoric Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis sees Evander Holyfield as being at  
the top of a mountain he must be knocked off if Lewis is to make a 
lasting mark in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't place Lewis on such a high plateau.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox Lewis is just a bump in the road I have to get past,''  
Holyfield said. ``No (one) man can define my career. My career is 
built on all the things I've had to go through and all the people I 
had to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, uncharacteristically, has said he will knock out  
Lewis in the third round. The WBA-IBF champion said it's not a 
prediction, but the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	He will get a chance to put his fists where his mouth is when he  
and Lewis, the WBC champion, fight Saturday night for the 
undisputed heavyweight title before a sellout crowd of more than 
20,000 in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Holyfield win, he would join Muhammad Ali as the only  
three-time undisputed heavyweight champion. Even should the winner 
not be considered champion by several fringe sanctioning 
organizations, there would be no doubt he would be the world's 
premier heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, the 36-year-old Holyfield's place in boxing legend  
is secure. He was an undisputed cruiserweight champion who overcame 
charges he was a blown-up heavyweight. He also has beaten such 
marquee fighters as George Foreman, Larry Holmes and Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case, however, for the 33-year-old Lewis, who  
feels he hasn't gotten his due, especially from boxing media and 
fans in the United States, despite only one loss in 35 fights. His 
best performance, a one-round knockout over Andrew Golota Oct. 4, 
1997, was too short and too easy to satisfy his critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very important fight for me,'' Lewis said. ``It's a  
defining fight for me. I just want to showcase myself and prove to 
the world I'm the best fighter on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, feels Lewis needs to win  
impressively. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight is everything for him,'' Steward said. ``His whole  
career will be defined on that night. If he doesn't win and win 
aggressively, he'll never be a great fighter or even a good 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steward trained Oliver McCall when McCall knocked out Lewis in  
the second round Sept. 24, 1994, and he trained Holyfield when he 
outpointed Riddick Bowe Nov. 6. 1993. He has been with Lewis for 
his nine fights since the loss to McCall. Don Turner trains 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't think Steward's knowledge of him will help  
Lewis. ``He's not going to get in the ring,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward wasn't with Holyfield when he was stopped by Bowe in the  
eighth round Nov. 4, 1996. It was Holyfield's second loss in three 
fights against the 6-foot-5 Bowe, who weighed 235, 246 and 240 
pounds for those bouts. Holyfield's weights were 205, 217 and 213 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bowe is the most talented big guy I've fought,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lewis still has to prove his ability to Holyfield, he is  
as big as Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-5 Lewis weighed in officially Thursday at 246 pounds,  
three more than for his previous fight, for the 12-round 
pay-per-view bout expected to start between 11:15 p.m. and 11:3O 
p.m. EST. Holyfield weighed 215 pounds, two less than his last 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``With his size, I can't see anybody outboxing Lennox Lewis,''  
Steward said. ``So Evander Holyfield is going to have to work 
inside. It's very hard to put pressure on the big man. Lennox is 
not just tall, he's strong. There's a difference between being tall 
and being big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to get inside first,'' Lewis said. ``I don't think I'm  
going to allow him to get inside and do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis doesn't appear to be as good a technician as Bowe, but he  
might be stronger and he probably hits harder, especially with his 
right hand. He has 27 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has 26 knockout wins on his 36-3 record, and while he  
knocked out Buster Douglas with a single right, many of his wins 
inside the distance have resulted from attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is expected to come out firing because Lewis has had  
trouble in the early rounds. There was the second-round knockout by 
McCall, and he was in serious trouble in the first round against 
Shannon Briggs last March 28. Briggs' inexperience allowed Lewis to 
get off the hook and eventually stop Briggs in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people question Lewis' stamina, but Holyfield has said the  
fight won't last long enough for it to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A question asked of Holyfield will be, has he at age 36 suddenly  
become an old fighter? 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield is guaranteed $20 million, while Lewis' purse is $10  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be two other championship bouts on the card.  
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Vargas (15-0, 15 knockouts) of Oxnard, Calif., will  
defend the IBF junior middleweight title against Howard Clarke 
(26-10-2, eight knockouts) of England. 
</P>
<P>
	James Page (23-3, 18 knockouts) of Pittsburg, Calif., will  
defend the WBA welterweight title against Sam Garr (25-2, three 
knockouts) of Stone Mountain, Ga.

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield, Lewis Rhetoric Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis sees Evander Holyfield as being at  
the top of a mountain he must be knocked off if Lewis is to make a 
lasting mark in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't place Lewis on such a high plateau.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox Lewis is just a bump in the road I have to get past,''  
Holyfield said. ``No (one) man can define my career. My career is 
built on all the things I've had to go through and all the people I 
had to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, uncharacteristically, has said he will knock out  
Lewis in the third round. The WBA-IBF champion said it's not a 
prediction, but the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	He will get a chance to put his fists where his mouth is when he  
and Lewis, the WBC champion, fight Saturday night for the 
undisputed heavyweight title before a sellout crowd of more than 
20,000 in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Holyfield win, he would join Muhammad Ali as the only  
three-time undisputed heavyweight champion. Even should the winner 
not be considered champion by several fringe sanctioning 
organizations, there would be no doubt he would be the world's 
premier heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, the 36-year-old Holyfield's place in boxing legend  
is secure. He was an undisputed cruiserweight champion who overcame 
charges he was a blown-up heavyweight. He also has beaten such 
marquee fighters as George Foreman, Larry Holmes and Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case, however, for the 33-year-old Lewis, who  
feels he hasn't gotten his due, especially from boxing media and 
fans in the United States, despite only one loss in 35 fights. His 
best performance, a one-round knockout over Andrew Golota Oct. 4, 
1997, was too short and too easy to satisfy his critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very important fight for me,'' Lewis said. ``It's a  
defining fight for me. I just want to showcase myself and prove to 
the world I'm the best fighter on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, feels Lewis needs to win  
impressively. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fight is everything for him,'' Steward said. ``His whole  
career will be defined on that night. If he doesn't win and win 
aggressively, he'll never be a great fighter or even a good 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steward trained Oliver McCall when McCall knocked out Lewis in  
the second round Sept. 24, 1994, and he trained Holyfield when he 
outpointed Riddick Bowe Nov. 6. 1993. He has been with Lewis for 
his nine fights since the loss to McCall. Don Turner trains 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield doesn't think Steward's knowledge of him will help  
Lewis. ``He's not going to get in the ring,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward wasn't with Holyfield when he was stopped by Bowe in the  
eighth round Nov. 4, 1996. It was Holyfield's second loss in three 
fights against the 6-foot-5 Bowe, who weighed 235, 246 and 240 
pounds for those bouts. Holyfield's weights were 205, 217 and 213 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bowe is the most talented big guy I've fought,'' Holyfield  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lewis still has to prove his ability to Holyfield, he is  
as big as Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-5 Lewis weighed in officially Thursday at 246 pounds,  
three more than for his previous fight, for the 12-round 
pay-per-view bout expected to start between 11:15 p.m. and 11:3O 
p.m. EST. Holyfield weighed 215 pounds, two less than his last 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``With his size, I can't see anybody outboxing Lennox Lewis,''  
Steward said. ``So Evander Holyfield is going to have to work 
inside. It's very hard to put pressure on the big man. Lennox is 
not just tall, he's strong. There's a difference between being tall 
and being big.'' 
</P>

might be stronger and he probably hits harder, especially with his 
right hand. He has 27 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced for Strip Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANTON, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who allowed a male stripper to  
perform at her 15-year-old daughter's Halloween party was sentenced 
Thursday to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Carye McGrath, 39, also was ordered to apologize in writing to  
the parents of other party-goers, undergo psychological counseling, 
perform 240 hours of community service and pay a $350 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath's daughter hired the stripper, but it was the mother's  
responsibility to stop the party, Alameda County Judge Christine 
Moruzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're a good person,'' Moruzo told McGrath. ``You're  
not the person with the horns and tail that you've been made out to 
be, but you failed to stop things when they got out of hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of  
contributing to the delinquency of minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Schmitt, 29, the stripper at the Oct. 30 party, pleaded  
guilty to a felony charge of sexual battery and a misdemeanor count 
of engaging in an obscene live performance. He is scheduled to be 
sentenced March 17.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Firms Buys Montana Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHOTEAU, Mont. (AP) -- David Letterman, who grew up in the  
Midwest, and works in the Northeast, may be spending his leisure 
time in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	A company partially owned by Letterman has bought 2,700 acres at  
the Rocky Mountain Front, where the Rockies rear up abruptly from 
the plains about 70 miles west of Great Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The late-night talk-show host visited the area in May and  
expressed interest in buying some land, according to Thursday's 
edition of the Great Falls Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the management company declined to say who its clients  
are, the Montana Department of Natural Resource and Conservation 
confirmed Letterman is an owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is a combination of foothills, jack pine, rugged breaks  
and prairie, straddling the forks of Deep Creek near the Lewis and 
Clark National Forest. One of the nation's most pristine wildlife 
habitats, it's home to wolves, eagles, grizzly bears and cutthroat 
trout.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Guilty in Lover's Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- A minister who claimed that his  
church's secretary was accidentally shot while they used a gun 
during foreplay was convicted Thursday of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found the Rev. Harvey Crews innocent of second-degree  
murder, which could have sent him to prison for 40 years. The jury 
recommended he get the maximum -- 10 years -- for the manslaughter 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews, a 38-year-old married man, testified that he and Kathleen  
Eich, 43, his mistress of 2 1/2 years, had been drinking heavily and 
were preparing to have sex in his office at the Word of Faith 
Tabernacle last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews said the two were talking about trust, the subject of a  
conference he had just attended, when he pulled a pistol out of his 
desk drawer. Ms. Eich, standing behind him, took the hand that was 
holding the gun and put it between her legs, Crews testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews said that when he turned to pull back the gun, it went  
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors suggested that Crews and Ms. Eich had been arguing.

<HEADLINE>  Minnesota Suspends Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Unsmiling, trying to cheer on their teammates,  
four Minnesota players could only sit and watch Thursday as the 
scandal-plagued Gophers played Gonzaga in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than five hours before the tipoff, university president  
Mark Yudof suspended the players for the game because of 
allegations of academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he took the action against starters Kevin Clark and  
Miles Tarver, along with reserves Antoine Broxie and Jason 
Stanford, because ``there's obviously a great deal at stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team, clearly shaken by the scandal, quickly fell far behind  
the underdogs of Gonzaga, a small school across the Cascade 
mountains in Spokane, Wash. The crowd was vastly pro-Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspensions came one day after a story in the Saint Paul  
Pioneer and Press quoted a former university employee as saying she 
had done course work for at least 20 players in coach Clem Haskins' 
program, including four on the current squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said four former players confirmed the woman's  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' said former player Russ  
Archambault, a freshman on the 1997 Final Four team who left school 
before the following season. ``We used to make jokes about it. ... 
I would go over there some nights and get like four papers done. 
The coaches would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Minneapolis, Yudof said the reputation  
of the university, its program and Haskins are at stake as the 
school investigates. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof envisioned ``fairly Draconian sanctions coming out if this  
proves to be true. The seriousness cannot be overstated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the players nor Haskins, in his 13th season at  
Minnesota, would comment on the suspensions as he and the team 
arrived at Seattle's Key Arena for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins ``was deeply saddened by (the suspensions), but I think  
he understands the reasons why,'' men's athletic director Mark 
Dienhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins had no knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing, said  
McKinley Boston, who oversees both the men's and women's athletic 
departments as vice president for student development and 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The players -- in matching black and white warmups -- sat glumly  
at the end of the bench. The only times they got on the court was 
during timeouts, when they peered in from the edge of team huddles. 
</P>
<P>
	A few rows behind the bench, a few hundred fans, clad in  
Minnesota's maroon and gold, cheered their team. Some wouldn't talk 
to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Erban, an architect from Stillwater, Minn., who was among  
80 fans who took a flight from Minneapolis Wednesday night, said he 
has seen all 16 of the Gophers' NCAA tournament games since Haskins 
came to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel something of an air of sadness, not anger against  
anyone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Haskins sat quietly at the end of press row,  
watching the warmups. A few well-wishers, including referee Booker 
Turner, came up and said hello. 
</P>
<P>
	As if things weren't bad enough, reserve forward-center Kyle  
Sanden twisted an ankle in practice Wednesday and was on crutches. 
That left eight players available for the game. Freshman Dusty 
Rychart started in place of Tarver. Mitch Ohnstad, a sophomore, 
started for Clark. Rychart had started once before; Ohnstad had 
never started a college game. 
</P>
<P>
	The university conducted a 24-hour investigation before  
announcing the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Schoemann, the school's director of athletic compliance,  
spoke to the four players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen some evidence,'' Yudof said. ``I don't think we  
should characterize it beyond that. ... All we know is that the 
charges are certainly serious, and there seems to be enough 
evidence to support some of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said one reason the university took the action was that it  
could lose its share of NCAA tournament money if the players later 
were ruled ineligible. Deinhart, however, said that was not a 
significant factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dienhart would not say whether the players might be reinstated  
if Minnesota won its first game. However, he said the school did 
not consider asking the NCAA to reinstate the players because he 
did not have enough information to make a case. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota hired Haskins from Western Kentucky in 1986 after  
another scandal rocked the basketball program. Coach Jim Dutcher 
resigned after three players were accused of rape following a game 
at Wisconsin on Jan. 23, 1986. Jimmy Williams, a Dutcher assistant, 
coached the final 11 games of the season, and Haskins took over for 
the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
	A standout player at Western Kentucky, Haskins was the third  
pick overall in the 1967 NBA draft and played nine seasons in the 
pros with Chicago, Phoenix and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As a coach, he stressed integrity. He led his team to the Final  
Four two years ago and has 240 career victories with the Gophers, 
five short of the all-time school record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof called him ``a great coach who has served this institution  
ably for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no doubt that some tough days were ahead for him  
and the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too premature to be talking about what the  
consequences of this could be,'' Dienhart said.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin A Campaign Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the largest food companies are banding  
together with the U.S. government to add vitamin A to the diets of 
developing countries, hoping to cut malnourished children's death 
rates as much as 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 250 million children in developing countries are  
vitamin A-deficient. That puts them at risk not only for blindness 
-- the nutrient is vital for eyesight -- but also for death, because 
vitamin A helps children survive infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the discovery of vitamin A's impact on child survival in  
the early 1990s, the U.S. Agency for International Development and 
charity groups have helped give vitamin A capsules to malnourished 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's hard to get yearly supplements to some of the world's  
poorest or strife-ridden countries. So USAID wants to get local 
foods fortified with vitamin A, just like the breakfast cereals and 
manyother foods that Americans eat. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Tuesday, in a luncheon ceremony being held by first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, about 15 companies are expected to sign 
onto a campaign to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win-win situation,'' said Harriet Babbitt, deputy  
administrator of USAID, which is spending $25 million a year on the 
vitamin. ``They can feel good about the products they sell ... and 
know they're doing some good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, ``they do open doors'' that U.S. health workers sometimes  
can't, added Duff Gillespie, USAID's vitamin chief, in a telephone 
interview from South Africa, where international experts gathered 
this week to plan fortification efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can go to countries and say, 'We made a significant  
investment in your country and we think you should do something in 
the area of vitamin A,''' Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the first beneficiaries: Kosovo. All cooking oil shipped  
as part of U.S. humanitarian relief packages now must be fortified 
with vitamin A, Babbitt said. The first shipment, fortified by food 
and agriculture conglomerate Cargill Inc., heads to Kosovo by 
month's end, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next on the list: USAID is negotiating with Uganda to add  
vitamin A to that country's sugar. And a health committee in South 
Africa is investigating adding the nutrient to a grain that 
virtually all South Africans eat in either porridge or bread, 
Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines is considering wheat fortification, Babbitt  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier if we can get these things worked into flour  
and sugar, and used in the normal foods in the countries, rather 
than distributing supplements,'' said Dan Wright of BASF Corp., 
which will provide bulk vitamin A to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	USAID won't have a final list until next week, but the agency  
said participating companies, in addition to Cargill and BASF, 
would include Procter &AMP; Gamble, Monsanto and the British sugar 
company Tate &AMP; Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States and other developed nations, getting enough  
vitamin A is easy: It's in meat, eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, 
leafy green vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	It's much harder to get enough in the developing world, where  
meatless diets and a lack of fortified foods are the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, doctors thought vitamin A was necessary mainly for  
good eyesight. Then Dr. Alfred Sommer of Johns Hopkins University 
made the startling discovery that giving malnourished children a 
2-cent capsule of vitamin A twice a year can cut their premature 
death rate by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out that adequate vitamin A helps fend off infectious  
disease. Indeed, that's one reason why measles kills hundreds of 
thousands of malnourished people a year -- it depletes their bodies' 
meager stores of vitamin A, said Dr. Nils Daulaire of the Global 
Health Council, which hopes to increase business involvement in 
international health. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin A is a fairly unstable nutrient, so BASF is designing  
formulations that will work in different foods. When USAID launched 
a pilot project with Tate &AMP; Lyle to fortify sugar in Zambia, for 
instance, BASF prepared vitamin A that could withstand that 
country's heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will prove good for business as well as for health,  
Daulaire predicted. Tate &AMP; Lyle's sales increased 15 percent in 
Zambia during the pilot project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just kids who'll benefit. The nutrient cuts night  
blindness in pregnant women, a huge problem in developing 
countries. And USAID is preparing to study whether it also could 
cut pregnancy-related deaths in Indonesia, Ghana and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks Funds From Global Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new U.N. third-world economic development  
effort with multinational corporations is raising questions among 
organizations who wonder whether alleged human-rights and 
environmental abuses by some of the companies are being overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 16 corporations have already paid $50,000 as seed money  
for the initiative, which critics claim will allow companies an 
easy opportunity to use the highly valuable U.N. name to help build 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is considering creating a logo incorporating  
its name that corporate sponsors could use. That's a powerful tool 
in many underdeveloped countries, where the United Nations provides 
food, shelter and other basics of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the companies involved ``are so deeply mired in these  
human-rights and environmental problems that it's a bad choice to 
start with, if they're looking to set examples,'' said Joshua 
Karliner, executive director of the Transnational Resource &AMP; Action 
Center, one of the human-rights organizations that circulated an 
internal United Nations memo describing the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes Dow Chemical Corp., creator of the toxic  
defoliant Agent Orange. Dow failed to return phone calls Thursday 
for comment on the U.N. initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which is among the oil  
companies that a U.N. human rights envoy wants to investigate for 
alleged widespread environmental damage in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies involved have records in foreign countries that  
haven't come into question, such as the telecommunications giant 
AT&AMP;T, the Swedish cellular phone maker Ericsson, and the furniture 
maker Ikea of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Transnational charged that sponsoring companies could use the  
United Nations connection to forge critical local and government 
relationships that will make it easier for them to do future 
projects that won't be under the watchful eye of the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the United Nations Development Programme, the  
development arm of the United Nations, did not deny that the list 
includes some corporations with negative profiles. But they 
fiercely defended the program as a way for corporate bad-actors to 
redeem themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we like it or not, the global corporations are having  
a great impact on the development of poor countries,'' said Eimi 
Watanabe, a U.N. development policy official. ``Quite often, there 
have been negative consequences of those projects, and we are 
trying to turn it around into a positive impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new project was originally set to launch this June. It has  
been postponed until at least next spring, but could shape up to be 
much different from other U.N. endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	It will focus less on traditional, large-scale development, like  
dams, and more on education, health-care, helping people get access 
to telephones and computers, and making tiny loans to nascent 
businesses. Watanabe said plans are to start in Central and South 
America and parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan being considered, the projects will be at minimum  
jointly run by corporations and United Nations, and it is possible 
that the companies will be allowed to run the projects themselves, 
largely without U.N. interference. 
</P>
<P>
	Watanabe said corporate sponsors will have to comply with U.N.  
human-rights and environmental guidelines. ``It would be totally 
contradictory to our mandate... if we sell the U.N. name to 
projects that don't meet our standards,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations gets most of its money from governments,  
although U.N. Secretary General Khofi Annan has been engaged in a 
campaign to get corporations more involved with U.N. relief and 
development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign comes as the United Nations struggles to pay its  
debt while the United States, its biggest contributor, has refused 
to pay back dues because of political disagreements between the 
Congress and the Clinton Administration. The United States is $1.3 
billion in arrears, a sum that represents two-thirds of the United 
Nation's entire debt.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Church Gunman Kills Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- Two men rushed into a church office and  
warned the pastor that an acquaintance was heading toward a prayer 
meeting with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came too late.  
</P>
<P>
	Shon Miller, a homeless former welder, had gunned down his  
mother-in-law, Mildred Vessel, 53, at home a few blocks away 
Wednesday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, he walked into New St. John Fellowship Baptist  
Church. From the aisle he opened fire into the pews, killing his 
25-year-old estranged wife, Carla; their 2-year-old son, Shon Jr.; 
and another church member. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others were wounded before Miller ran off. He later was  
shot in the back during a standoff with police at a shed, leaving 
him paralyzed from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Thursday that Miller will be charged with murder and  
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safest place in world I always thought was a church and  
now that sanctuary has been broken,'' Police Chief Bill Landry 
said. ``We'll all be a long time getting over this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Tony Bacala of the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office said  
Miller had persuaded the two acquaintances to drive him to Mrs. 
Vessel's home because he wanted to pick something up. The men, 
whose names were not released, told investigators they did not know 
Miller had the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	When the three arrived at the house, Mrs. Vessel was pulling her  
van into her driveway. The men pulled in behind her. Then Miller 
got out and shot inside the van, the men told detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men backed the car out to the road to flee without  
Miller, but the car stalled, Bacala said. Miller ran to the car, 
got in and ordered them to drive him to the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men ``went into the church and tried to warn  
everybody,'' Bacala said. ``They were trying to intercede.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaniaro Jackson, 19, died soon after the shooting. Wounded were  
his sister Kinsey Jackson, 17, Donald Rideau, 16, Alesha Harvey, 
14, and Rebecca Delpit, 47. Miss Jackson and Rideau were treated at 
a hospital and released. Alesha and Ms. Delpit were in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and family members in this city of 7,000 people 50 miles  
west of New Orleans said Shon and Carla Miller had been married for 
about two years but had been separated for around half that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted her back and she didn't want to go back,'' said  
Timothy Vessel, one of Carla's brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said Carla left Shon after he beat her, but her  
troubles continued. Last July, the house trailer she had shared 
with him mysteriously burned while she was at work. 
</P>
<P>
	After she moved back with her family in a modest residential  
neighborhood, the tires on two family cars were slashed within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who is in his 20s, had spent time in jail for violating  
a restraining order keeping him away from his wife. He had been 
spending his nights sleeping on public benches in town.

<HEADLINE>  Minnesota Suspends Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Unsmiling, trying to cheer on their teammates,  
four Minnesota players could only sit and watch Thursday as the 
scandal-plagued Gophers played Gonzaga in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than five hours before the tipoff, university president  
Mark Yudof suspended the players for the game because of 
allegations of academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he took the action against starters Kevin Clark and  
Miles Tarver, along with reserves Antoine Broxie and Jason 
Stanford, because ``there's obviously a great deal at stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team, clearly shaken by the scandal, quickly fell far behind  
the underdogs of Gonzaga, a small school across the Cascade 
mountains in Spokane, Wash. The crowd was vastly pro-Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspensions came one day after a story in the Saint Paul  
Pioneer and Press quoted a former university employee as saying she 
had done course work for at least 20 players in coach Clem Haskins' 
program, including four on the current squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said four former players confirmed the woman's  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' said former player Russ  
Archambault, a freshman on the 1997 Final Four team who left school 
before the following season. ``We used to make jokes about it. ... 
I would go over there some nights and get like four papers done. 
The coaches would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Minneapolis, Yudof said the reputation  
of the university, its program and Haskins are at stake as the 
school investigates. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof envisioned ``fairly Draconian sanctions coming out if this  
proves to be true. The seriousness cannot be overstated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the players nor Haskins, in his 13th season at  
Minnesota, would comment on the suspensions as he and the team 
arrived at Seattle's Key Arena for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins ``was deeply saddened by (the suspensions), but I think  
he understands the reasons why,'' men's athletic director Mark 
Dienhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins had no knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing, said  
McKinley Boston, who oversees both the men's and women's athletic 
departments as vice president for student development and 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The players -- in matching black and white warmups -- sat glumly  
at the end of the bench. The only times they got on the court was 
during timeouts, when they peered in from the edge of team huddles. 
</P>
<P>
	A few rows behind the bench, a few hundred fans, clad in  
Minnesota's maroon and gold, cheered their team. Some wouldn't talk 
to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Erban, an architect from Stillwater, Minn., who was among  
80 fans who took a flight from Minneapolis Wednesday night, said he 
has seen all 16 of the Gophers' NCAA tournament games since Haskins 
came to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel something of an air of sadness, not anger against  
anyone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Haskins sat quietly at the end of press row,  
watching the warmups. A few well-wishers, including referee Booker 
Turner, came up and said hello. 
</P>
<P>
	As if things weren't bad enough, reserve forward-center Kyle  
Sanden twisted an ankle in practice Wednesday and was on crutches. 
That left eight players available for the game. Freshman Dusty 
Rychart started in place of Tarver. Mitch Ohnstad, a sophomore, 
started for Clark. Rychart had started once before; Ohnstad had 
never started a college game. 
</P>
<P>
	The university conducted a 24-hour investigation before  
announcing the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Schoemann, the school's director of athletic compliance,  
spoke to the four players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen some evidence,'' Yudof said. ``I don't think we  
should characterize it beyond that. ... All we know is that the 
charges are certainly serious, and there seems to be enough 
evidence to support some of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said one reason the university took the action was that it  
could lose its share of NCAA tournament money if the players later 
were ruled ineligible. Deinhart, however, said that was not a 
significant factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dienhart would not say whether the players might be reinstated  
if Minnesota won its first game. However, he said the school did 
not consider asking the NCAA to reinstate the players because he 
did not have enough information to make a case. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota hired Haskins from Western Kentucky in 1986 after  
another scandal rocked the basketball program. Coach Jim Dutcher 
resigned after three players were accused of rape following a game 
at Wisconsin on Jan. 23, 1986. Jimmy Williams, a Dutcher assistant, 
coached the final 11 games of the season, and Haskins took over for 
the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
	A standout player at Western Kentucky, Haskins was the third  
pick overall in the 1967 NBA draft and played nine seasons in the 
pros with Chicago, Phoenix and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As a coach, he stressed integrity. He led his team to the Final  
Four two years ago and has 240 career victories with the Gophers, 
five short of the all-time school record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof called him ``a great coach who has served this institution  
ably for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no doubt that some tough days were ahead for him  
and the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too premature to be talking about what the  
consequences of this could be,'' Dienhart said.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Bank Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee, breaking a  
deadlock over consumer privacy, on Thursday overwhelmingly approved 
legislation to lift Depression-era barriers between banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted 51-8 to adopt the complex measure and send it to  
the full House. The Clinton administration has expressed strong 
support for the bipartisan bill but has threatened to veto 
financial overhaul legislation pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have an excellent bill that will be signed into  
law,'' Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the committee's senior 
Democrat, said after the vote. ``We have a bill that brings us into 
the 21st century (and) protects and promotes consumer rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress tries again to overhaul the financial services laws  
and allow the three industries to get more deeply into each other's 
businesses, there have been fears about how customer information 
will be shared among affiliates of the big new companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Banking Committee spent three days laboring on a draft of  
the bill. As the drafting proceeded Thursday, lawmakers and aides 
worked feverishly behind the scenes on a consumer privacy measure 
to be attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the privacy measures proposed, authored by Reps. Jay  
Inslee, D-Wash., and Robert Weygand, D-R.I., would have required 
new financial conglomerates to give consumers the right to opt out 
of arrangements for sharing of all of their personal data with 
affiliated companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an ``opt-out'' is considered less stringent than an  
``opt-in,'' which requires a consumer's express written consent 
before personal data can be used by a financial institution or 
disclosed to others. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers voted, 52-6, to adopt a milder proposal by  
Committee Chairman Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa. It would restrict the 
sharing of customers' health information among affiliated companies 
but would allow their transaction data, such as checking account 
history, to be shared even if they made an opt-out request. Under 
current law, opt-out requests apply to a consumer's credit history 
but not to his or her transaction data. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal banking regulators also have pointed to consumers'  
growing fears about companies' enhanced ability to track, use and 
even sell personal financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the legislation would create serious privacy risks for Americans as 
banks, brokerages and insurers compiled profiles of customers' 
buying habits, hobbies -- even health information. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible scenario: A woman's husband has died, and she's  
received a check from his life insurance policy. The insurance 
company tips off an affiliated securities firm, and she starts 
getting phone calls from a broker trying to sell her the latest hot 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Or: A bank customer applies for a loan. The loan officer then  
checks with the bank's affiliated health insurance company and 
discovers that the customer has cancer. The loan is denied for that 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists for the three financial-services industries indicated  
earlier Thursday that adoption of Inslee's more stringent privacy 
measure could kill their support for the overall legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one of the key reasons the industries have been pushing  
financial overhaul legislation is that it would open numerous 
opportunities for them to market their services by using shared 
customer data. 
</P>
<P>
	A current example is the big effort by financial giant Citigroup  
to sell Citibank customers the investments and insurance offered by 
the bank's merger partner, Travelers Group. Over the next six 
months, New York-based Citibank plans to train and license up to 
3,000 of its branch employees in financial analysis and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, created by one of the biggest mergers in U.S.  
corporate history, got permission from the Federal Reserve to 
operate for several years -- so the company didn't have to wait for 
enactment of financial overhaul legislation before it combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Banking Committee's conciliatory mood shifted  
Wednesday, it overwhelmingly approved a compromise provision 
requiring ATM surcharges to be clearly disclosed at the automated 
teller machines. The 48-1 vote attached the surcharge measure to 
the financial overhaul legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The surcharges come on top of charges by customers' own banks  
for using a teller machine operated by another bank. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the panel rebuffed by a one-vote margin a proposal  
backed by the savings and loan industry to allow thrifts to 
continue to be acquired by commercial companies under the new 
financial legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, companies receiving new S&AMP;L charters from  
federal regulators have included agribusiness giant Archer Daniels 
Midland Co., long-distance telephone company Excel Communications 
Inc. and coffin manufacturer Hillenbrand Industries.

<HEADLINE> Ingram Micro Eliminating 1,400 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Ingram Micro Inc., one of the leading  
distributors of personal computers, plans to eliminate 1,400 jobs 
to combat tougher price competition and slack demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Market experts Ingram Micro, like other middleman PC  
distributors, has recently been squeezed by manufacturers' 
price-cutting and increasing direct sales to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a continuing trend,'' said Matt Sargent, an  
analyst with ZD Market Intelligence in La Jolla, Calif. 
Distribution and support firms like Intex and Inacom have been 
facing similar problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These companies are going to have to get away from selling  
boxes ... and focus more on services and become a partner with 
manufacturers,'' Sargent said. ``They're doing that already, but 
they need to focus more on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently approved of Ingram's plan, sending shares  
of Ingram up $1.12 1/2, or 6 percent, to $19.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	PC makers like Dell, the direct-distribution pioneer, and Compaq  
are selling more computers themselves, and they have been slashing 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram Micro officials played down the direct-sales trend,  
citing instead slow demand overseas, domestic price competition and 
concerns about potential year 2000 bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram Micro, with sales of $22 billion last year, expects to  
start seeing savings from the job cuts in the second quarter of 
1999. Chairman Jerre L. Stead said most of the job cuts would come 
in U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many near-term factors, including Year 2000 fears and  
continuing economic issues, are creating cautious buying trends in 
Europe, Latin America and Asia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, there is intense margin pressure, primarily in  
the United States, which is related directly to increased price 
competition and not related to changes in the way computers are 
brought to market,'' Stead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ingram Micro began redeploying employees and  
eliminating positions overseas through attrition, said spokeswoman 
Kathleen Janson. Those positions are included in the 1,400 jobs 
being eliminated, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram Micro is realigning its sales force and creating a  
merchandising operation that joins its purchasing, vendor sales and 
product marketing departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they expect net sales for the first  
quarter this year between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, an 
increase of 26 percent to 30 percent over last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was expected to be between $40 million and $45  
million, not including one-time costs involved in the reductions. 
That amounts to 27 cents to 30 cents a share, well below the 
average estimate of 42 cents predicted earlier in an analysts' 
survey by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As of September 1998, Ingram Micro had more than 14,000  
employees. The company and its subsidiaries operate in 31 countries 
and distribute more than 200,000 products.

<HEADLINE> Iditarod Leader Has Sled Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Front-running musher Doug Swingley has  
shown that he may have the fastest dogs in this year's Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday he showed he may also have the most luck.  
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., busted a sled runner late Wednesday  
on the 90-mile stretch of trail between the gold-era ghost towns of 
Ophir and Iditarod, the midpoint of the 1,100-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	Race marshal Mark Nordman told KNOM radio on Thursday that race  
judges had ruled that the sled was too badly damaged for Swingley 
to keep using it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second broken sled of the race for Swingley, and if  
it had to happen, it couldn't have happened at a better time. He 
was taking his mandatory 24-hour rest stop in Iditarod, which gave 
him plenty of time to line up a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	The replacement in this case was a sled damaged earlier in the  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley snapped a main stanchion Monday on rough trail heading  
into the Alaska Range. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a foot-long piece of willow and several hose clamps, he  
splinted the broken strut, figuring he only needed the sled to get 
to Takotna, where he had a spare waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	KNOM reported that Swingley supporters were trying to arrange a  
plane to reunite the musher with his first sled before 1 a.m. 
Friday Alaska time (5 a.m. EST), when his 24-hour rest finished. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the 52 mushers still competing had completed  
their 24-hour layovers, which has made the race order a little 
clearer. 
</P>
<P>
	With their teams well-rested in Takotna, five-time winner Rick  
Swenson, DeeDee Jonrowe and defending champ Jeff King all dashed 
through Ophir on Thursday morning on their way to Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Swingley, three-time Martin Buser and John Baker were  
taking their long layovers in Iditarod. Buser would be eligible to 
leave the checkpoint about an hour after Swingley. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen other mushers were on the 90-mile stretch of trail  
between Ophir and Iditarod. They include Bill Cotter, John Barron, 
Norwegian Harald Tunheim, Charlie Boulding, Mitch Seavey, Vern 
Halter and Linwood Fiedler.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blames Hospital For Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) -- A federal judge awarded  
nearly $566,000 to a staff sergeant who blamed his wife's death on 
bad advice from the base hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled Wednesday that  
Ehrling Bergquist Hospital staff should have told Ingrid Wright, 
35, to see a doctor when she awoke with a fever in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff Sgt. David Wright said he called the hospital because he  
was afraid his pregnant wife was miscarrying. The staff told him 
she probably had the flu and could be treated at home. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Wright had a relatively high risk of bacterial  
infection because she had had her spleen removed for an unrelated 
medical problem. Her condition deteriorated and she died at 
University Hospital in Omaha the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, health care providers cannot be held  
personally liable. The judge ordered the federal government to pay 
the award to Wright, who now lives in Ohio with his 7-year-old 
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Spokesman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr throughout the Monica Lewinsky drama, 
abruptly resigned Thursday after an internal review of a recent 
press leak prompted Starr to request a full Justice Department 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bakaly's attorney nor Starr's office would disclose the  
findings of the internal inquiry into the leak, but both made clear 
in prepared statements that it played a role in Bakaly's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having been provided with the preliminary results of the  
internal investigation, this office has referred the matter to the 
Department of Justice,'' Starr said in a statement. Starr said he 
accepted the resignation with ``regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly's lawyer, Howard Shapiro, said in a statement that his  
client would cooperate ``in every way'' with the Justice inquiry 
and said he was ``confident that he will be found not to have 
violated any statute, regulation or court order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that it was Mr. Bakaly's job as OIC spokesman to respond  
to media inquiries concerning the OIC's work, it is no surprise 
that he has been interviewed in connection with the inquiry being 
conducted by the Department of Justice,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly's resignation is to take effect June 1, but Starr placed  
him on paid administrative leave in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed that Starr  
referred the Bakaly matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not yet received the investigative materials in  
connection with the matter from the FBI agents assigned to the 
Office of Independent Counsel,'' Marlin said. ``When we receive it, 
we will determine how best to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a Jan. 31 article in The New York Times that  
reported that Starr had concluded that President Clinton could 
legally be indicted while still in office. The report came at a 
sensitive time for Starr because a federal judge was already 
investigating his office regarding allegations of leaks of grand 
jury material in the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the January news story, Starr had said he was  
``deeply troubled'' by the latest leak and ordered a review. 
Clinton's lawyer, meanwhile, complained to the judge overseeing the 
case that the report amounted to another illegal leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly did not immediately return a call to his home seeking  
comment Thursday. His lawyer was out of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shapiro said in the statement that his client joined Starr's  
staff ``during a high-profile phase of the OIC's investigation to 
communicate the OIC's work to the media and public. With that 
high-profile phase of the investigation of the OIC's work now 
largely completed, this is a logical time for Mr. Bakaly to make 
the transition back to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakaly, a bespectacled lawyer who also acted as spokesman for  
Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz's investigation of former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, was the official who announced 
from the steps of the Capitol that Starr had sent a referral to 
Congress alleging possible impeachable offenses late last summer.

<HEADLINE> Rams, Collins Agree To Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Free agent linebacker Todd Collins has agreed  
to terms on a four-year contract with the St. Louis Rams. He 
replaces linebacker Eric Hill, who was released by the Rams two 
hours after the team announced the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 28, is the fourth unrestricted free agent signed by the  
Rams since free agency began Feb. 12. Guard Adam Timmerman from 
Green Bay, quarterback Trent Green from Washington and safety Devin 
Bush of Atlanta signed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis also lost linebacker Roman Phifer, who signed a  
three-year, $8.9 million deal, which includes a $3.6 million 
signing bonus, with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has played six NFL seasons with the New England  
Patriots, the last five as a starter. He played in 76 regular 
season games with 53 starts and has played in six playoff games 
with five starts, including Super Bowl XXXI. 
</P>
<P>
	He started in 10 of his 12 games last year, finishing fifth on  
the team in tackles with 76. He made a season-high 10 tackles in 
three games, including the Patriots' 27-24 win over San Francisco 
that clinched New England's playoff berth.

 *Nine inmates break out of Oklahoma jail; five captured    	
</P>
<P>
	LAWTON, Okla. (AP) -- An inmate used a long barbecue fork to  
threaten a guard and freed eight other prisoners in a breakout at 
the Comanche County Jail early Thursday. Five of the nine inmates 
were captured within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates still on the run included a man awaiting trial on  
murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	A convicted murderer and another man facing murder charges were  
among those captured. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the escape. An officer was locked in a  
storage area where she had gone to get supplies for inmate 
breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmate who authorities said started the breakout, Anthony  
Goshay, 18, captured in an apartment building. He was in jail on 
cocaine charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said an inmate managed to get through a small window  
into a control room area of the jail and pushed buttons to open 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inmates were invited to leave, but many stayed.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those still at large was David Kemp, 29, who was charged  
with shooting to death his ex-wife and a man.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Seeks Cell Unit Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA proposed merging with its  
cellular phone subsidiary and expanding shareholder voting rights 
in an effort to thwart a takeover bid by Olivetti SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger with Telecom's 60 percent-owned subsidiary, Telecom  
Italia Mobile SpA, could drive up the price of what is already the 
largest takeover attempt in European telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti announced a $57.3 billion hostile bid for its larger  
rival last month. A merger with the cellular phone concern would 
create more Telecom shares and boost the price of the takeover by 
some $21.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom said today it will ask shareholders to approve the  
mobile phone merger by April 16, emphasizing the benefits to be 
gained from integrating its fixed phone services with the cellular 
unit's mobile network. 
</P>
<P>
	It proposes offering new shares of its stock for the remaining  
40 percent of the mobile phone company's shares in an exchange that 
will give the mobile phone company shareholders a 21.6 percent 
premium over the current value of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Telecom will buy back as much as 10 percent of its  
stock as soon as shareholders approve the program at the meeting 
expected in April. The buyback is aimed at boosting its share 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom critics have already argued, in anticipation of the  
mobile phone merger plan announced today, that the deal appeared 
aimed mainly at thwarting Olivetti and would add no real value for 
Telecom shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, with the help of four banks, is trying to obtain $24.5  
billion in financing for its bid. Some 20 banks have expressed 
interest in participating. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom and its banks are seeking to raise a $21.8 billion loan  
to help stave off Olivetti's attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Telecom's share conversion plan, investors holding  
ordinary and savings shares will receive a right, or warrant, to 
convert each of their shares. These warrants can be traded on the 
Milan stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom said that investors holding 50 savings shares could  
exchange them for 50 ordinary voting shares provided they have 171 
warrants. Telecom's aim is to upgrade savings shares, boosting the 
value of that class of stock, while also ensuring a cash premium 
for holders of ordinary shares. 
</P>
<P>
	By offering this conversion option, the company's board hopes to  
strengthen the loyalty of its shareholders and reduce the 
likelihood that they would accept a bid from Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom also said it planned to sell certain industrial and real  
estate businesses not considered part of its core operations. 
Telecom said earlier that it plans to sell real estate holdings 
worth as much as $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a step toward such a sell-off, Telecom said it would split up  
its engineering business Sirti SpA into two units, one for real 
estate and financial activities and the other for industrial 
operations. Telecom said it would fold all its real estate 
activities into the newly created property unit.

<HEADLINE> Staying Ahead of NCAA Guillotine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They were never exactly students.  
</P>
<P>
	They're no longer athletes.  
</P>
<P>
	The worrisome thing is what they probably won't be next: Young  
men with enough of a future to throw to the cat. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday morning, barely five hours before their team met  
Gonzaga in the NCAA tournament, officials at the University of 
Minnesota voluntarily declared four members of their own basketball 
team ineligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The final score -- Gonzaga 75, Minnesota 63 -- speaks volumes  
about how much the Gophers missed the four, especially starters 
Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver. It also tells you how solid the 
evidence must have been, since the school's rush to judgment came 
before the NCAA even had a chance to offer use of its in-house 
guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
	But university vice president McKinley Boston must have heard  
the blade being sharpened when he got up to speak at a news 
conference in Minneapolis. ``We would rather not risk the 
reputation of the university by playing an ineligible player at 
this time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations of academic fraud surfaced in the Saint Paul  
Pioneer Press, where a story quoted former university employee Jan 
Gangelhoff saying she did more than 400 pieces of course work for 
at least 20 players during a five-year period. Four former players 
confirmed her account. 
</P>
<P>
	As if that wasn't damning enough, former player Russ Archambault  
said, ``The coaches knew. Everybody knew. We used to make jokes 
about it. ... I would go over there some nights and get like four 
papers done. The coaches would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that seems funny now is the subject of one of the  
papers that Gangelhoff claimed she wrote and Tarver turned in: It 
was whether college athletes should be financially compensated by 
the schools they represent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not coincidentally, that very issue provides the foundation for  
a new basketball league that plans to be up and running by 
November. The brainchild of Babson College accounting professor 
Paul McMann, it's called the Collegiate Professional Basketball 
League and its business plan is stunningly simple. Each player in 
the CPBL gets a $5,000 signing bonus, a $9,000 annual salary, plus 
tuition, room and board at any college they attend for up to four 
years after they leave the league. 
</P>
<P>
	By paying kids as athletes in-season, McMann believes there is  
less temptation to take or make money under the table, which was at 
the root of the Northwestern point-shaving scandal that rocked last 
year's Final Four. And by letting them be full-time students the 
rest of the year (or not, if the kids choose), the pressure to 
cheat academically is lessened as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the CPBL makes it is anybody's guess. As the American  
Basketball League recent collapse reminds, gambling on the public's 
appetite for variations of the same handful of games is risky 
business. But if the NCAA lacks the good sense to fear the CPBL, it 
shouldn't be above stealing an idea whose time has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that the NCAA can't  
force member schools to use a minimum score on the Scholastic 
Assessment Test as the bottom-line measurement of whether incoming 
freshmen were eligible to play. Now that a new standard is 
necessary, anyway, why apply another bandage when radical surgery 
is what's required? 
</P>
<P>
	Pay the kids a stipend; the cost should be offset by savings  
realized from fewer NCAA investigations. Make the scholarships 
open-ended. Let some kids opt to be athletes only during the season 
and students only when their seasons are over, instead of neither. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the most recent count, 44 percent of men's Division  
I basketball players graduate. And those like the four ballplayers 
declared ineligible by Minnesota wind up with even fewer tools to 
begin building a future. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, a kid named Kevin Ross became the poster child in the  
campaign to tighten up academic standards for college athletes. He 
attended Creighton University on a basketball scholarship, but 
after four years, he was still reading at an elementary school 
level. Five years later, depressed and battling alcoholism, he 
started hurling furniture through the window of his hotel room down 
to the street below. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after that, with lots of tutoring and not a little  
counseling paid for by some of the people he had embarrassed, Ross 
was holding down a job as a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's that much better for others,'' he said at  
the time, ``because I still get letters from athletes around the 
country that would bring tears to your eyes.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Tops 9,900 but Ends at 9,897.44 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials shot within striking  
distance of 10,000 Thursday, breaking through both 9,800 and 9,900 
for the first time before giving up some of their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	A rebound in oil prices from 12-year lows, which has lifted oil  
stocks, and continued strength in the economy have been propelling 
the stock market to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average got as high as 9,935.46 in the  
afternoon, within 65 points of 10,000. It finished the day up 
124.60, or by 1.3 percent, at 9,897.44. That put it within 103 
points of the five-digit milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was above the heavy volume of Wednesday, when both the  
Dow and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed at new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 also extended its record-shattering gains Thursday,  
approaching 1,300. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index 
rose, but still was around 100 points below the record 2,510.09 it 
set Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's rose 11.29 to 1,298.13, and the Nasdaq  
rose 6.24 at 2,412.24 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,747 up and 1,257 down and 563 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 902.62 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
832.59 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.19 to 611.67 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.51 to 721.65 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.04 to 401.08.  
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up more  
than 1 , and Exxon, which rose about 1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest Dow gainer was soft-drink maker Coca-Cola, which  
rose more than 3 after an analyst from Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Securities raised his investment opinion of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor interest in the magical 10,000 mark for the Dow also  
seemed to be feeding on itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short term, at the margins, traders feel its inevitable  
that we will go to 10,000 and they are playing that dynamic to push 
the Dow higher,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for 
Legg Mason of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in years, the broad stock indicators were  
driven higher even without a surge in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more sectors that participate in a market advance is a  
sign the market looks very good,'' Cripps said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cripps cautioned that many small cap stocks are still  
struggling, as evidence by the Russell 2000 measure falling 0.56 to 
400.56 
</P>
<P>
	Helping today's rally was new retail sales data showing the U.S.  
economy is growing without any inflationary threats. Since there 
are no signs that the economy is overheating, investors believe 
that the Federal Reserve Board will have little reason to boost 
interest rates in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that retail sales-- which  
represent about a third of the nation's economic output -- rose 0.9 
percent gain last month to a seasonally adjusted $236.5 billion. 
That came on top of robust gains in January and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department said today that  
first-time claims for unemployment checks remained under 300,000 
for the sixth consecutive week for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.5 
percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pupils to Congress: Save Battlefields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elementary school students on a class trip  
pleaded with lawmakers Thursday for federal help in preserving two 
Revolutionary War sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-grader Kelly Gerson made the case for the Paoli  
Battlefield, a 40-acre tract in suburban Philadelphia where more 
than 50 Americans died in September 1777. It was the third major 
battle in the failed campaign to prevent British capture of 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shopping marts and homes on this land would destroy the whole  
entire historical presence of this important site,'' the 
11-year-old told the House Resources subcommittee on parks. 
</P>
<P>
	About three dozen students from suburban Philadelphia attended  
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Revolutionary War sites already have fallen to development,  
and preservationists want to save the Paoli Battlefield in 
particular because it is one of the few that has changed little in 
character over two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation before the subcommittee would authorize $2.5 million  
to buy the site in Malvern, Pa., and permanently keep it from 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $3 million would go to preserving a section of the nearby  
Brandywine Battlefield, where troops fought less than two weeks 
before Paoli. The bill also would approve a new museum for the 
Valley Forge national park. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee chairman, GOP Rep. James Hansen of Utah, said  
the panel likely would approve the bill next week. House passage 
could come by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Stevenson, associate director for cultural resources  
at the National Park Service, said the Clinton administration 
supports the bill but wants to make sure federal funds do not cover 
ongoing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Malvern Preparatory School, which has owned the Paoli site for  
75 years, wants to sell the property to expand its endowment. The 
school has given community groups until April to come up with $2.5 
million, with the option for a six-month extension for $100,000 
more. After that, developers will be allowed to bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Portions of the Brandywine Battlefield already have been  
developed, and the legislation seeks to preserve land that is part 
of the Meeting House Road Corridor, the site of the most intense 
conflict and casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	For both battlefields, private groups would be required to match  
the federal grants.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Jaime Aron, a newsman in the Dallas  
bureau of The Associated Press, has been promoted to correspondent 
in Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	His appointment was announced Thursday by Dallas Chief of Bureau  
John Lumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Aron succeeds Mike Cochran, who is retiring after an  
award-winning career of nearly 40 years with the AP in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Aron, 28, joined the AP in Houston, his hometown, in 1991 and  
worked in Austin before joining the Dallas staff in 1992. He is a 
graduate of the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran, 62, joined the AP in Dallas in 1960 and opened the Fort  
Worth bureau the next year. He covered the Kennedy assassination, 
space missions, political scandals, the Cullen Davis murder case 
and the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, among other stories. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Muskogee, Okla., Cochran grew up in the small West  
Texas town of Stamford and studied journalism at Hardin-Simmons 
University in Abilene and what is now the University of North Texas 
in Denton. He began his career as a sportswriter for newspapers in 
Denton and Abilene before joining the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran is the author of several books and the recipient of  
numerous journalism awards, including the Associated Press Managing 
Editors Top Performance Award for feature writing in 1987.
