<HEADLINE> Premier Ends Inspection of Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIZHOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng has urged people
in southwest China's Guizhou Province to build up their confidence
in developing local economy and strive for success by relying
on their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
The premier made an inspection tour of the poverty-stricken
province from July 18 to 20, accompanied by the secretary of the
provincial committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng visited rural households, a revolutionary educational
base and factories. He sent corcial regards to local people on
behalf of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the achievements the province has made over recent
years in various sectors and noted that the gaps are still
existing between Guizhou and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged the provincial authorities to give top
priority to developing agriculture and introduce farming
technologies which suit local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Citing the development of communications as the key to local
economic development, he said both the central government and
local authorities will work jointly to complete the construction
of some major highways and railway lines in Guizhou in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Attention should also be paid to exploiting tourism resources
in the province, for it has numerous natural scenic spots, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On his inspection tour, Li attached great importance to
poverty-relief work. He noted that the task is arduous, for there
are still six million people in the province who are in want and
need, most of them are concentrated in the mountainous and outlying
ethnic-minority areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on local authorities to make hard and
conscientious efforts and take concrete steps to eliminate poverty
and give due consideration to the development of cultural,
educational and scientific undertakings in the process.

Guizhou and urged local authorities to take prompt and special
measures to help them.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mediator Announces Progress on W.Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy James Baker today
announced positive results in talks between Morocco and its
Western Sahara foes, the Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to say that we have reached agreement with
respect to the bridging proposals that we submitted in Lisbon last
month," Baker, a former U.S. Secretary of State, told reporters
here after one-and-a-half-day of talks.
</P>
<P>
The secret proposals aim at breaking a long-standing deadlock
to resolve a dispute between Morocco and the Algerian-backed
Polisario, which wants to be an independent state, on the question
of who would be allowed to vote in a referendum on the future of
the desert region.
</P>
<P>
Morocco and Polisario fought a 16-year war over the Western
Sahara after Spain pulled out in 1976 and four-fifths of the
region is under Moroccan control.
</P>
<P>
Baker, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mediator, said he
was encouraged by the deal on identification, which he called a
very difficult issue.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. secretary of state, who will report to the
U.N. Security Council in New York on Monday, said the two sides,
along with observers, Algeria and Mauritania, had also agreed to
cooperate on the issue of refugees.
</P>
<P>
But he said the agreement did not necessarily mean a
breakthrough in the long-standing dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties have agreed to abide by the provisions of that
compromise proposal and if we are able -- if, that's a big if --
to reach agreement with respect to all of these other issues which
are in dispute... then we may have a chance to move this process
forward," Baker said.
</P>
<P>
Baker said a third round of talks would be held in late August
for further discussion of the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Most of World AIDS Cases in Sub-Saharan Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa
account for at least 75 percent of all the reported ones in the
world, said the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency today quoted WHO as saying that since
the discovery of the first case of AIDS in the early 1980s, there
have been approximately 4.5 million cases in the region which
represents 75 percent of the world estimate of 6 million cases.
</P>
<P>
It said in the region a lot of people still have
misconceptions about the disease and its mode of transmission
although the great majority of them have heard of AIDS/HIV.
</P>
<P>
In the sub-Saharan Africa sexual contact has been identified
as the major mode of transmission and this has been aggravated by
the wide practice of men having multiple sex partners.
</P>
<P>
The condom is still the second major method to prevent the
spread of AIDS/HIV in the region, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia and Zimbabwe, as a result of intensive social
marketing of the condom, 70 percent of men use condoms for the
double purpose of AIDS/HIV and unwanted pregnancy prevention.

<HEADLINE> Adams Condemns Report of IRA Ceasefire Time Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
today condemned media reports that a new truce by his Irish
Republican Army(IRA) allies might last only four months, saying
the British secret services sought to undermine peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
an outlawed guerrilla group which has launched military campaign
to end the British rule of Northern Ireland since 1968.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Tribune, published in Dublin, reported that the IRA
leadership had told its members that the ceasefire would last four
months and would be renewed only if the province's peace process
was seen to produce political benefits for Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
IRA announced a ceasefire on Saturday which took effect at
midday today. The truce, demanded by the government, would allow
Sinn Fein to gain a place in the all-party peace talks on the
future of the divided province.
</P>
<P>
Adams also called on Unionists politicians to lay aside their
doubts and join in negotiations to settle years of communal
division.
</P>
<P>
Politicians for the province's Protestant majority are deeply
suspicious of IRA's motives. They are infuriated that the truce
paves the way for Sinn Fein to enter settlement talks without any
guerrilla arms being handed over.
</P>
<P>
Unionist parties are threatening to walk out of current
multi-party talks, which exclude Sinn Fein, in protest at what
they say are weak Anglo-Irish plans for achieving a surrender of
guerrilla arms.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, head of the powerful Ulster Unionist Party, is
due to have hold talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair in London on
Monday to urge him to toughen demands for IRA disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Reopen Crossing Leading to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul reiterated today his government's determination to reopen
a crossing leading to an Israeli-occupied enclave in order to
"alleviate sufferings of residents" in the southern border
area.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese authorities have announced that the crossing
will be ready for passage for the first time in 11 years on
August 1, the Lebanese Army Day.
</P>
<P>
Dalloul was quoted by the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency as saying that the government "will not accept any of
Israeli conditions to open the Kfar Falous crossing" between the
south Lebanese port city of Saida and the occupied town of
Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Council of Ministers' decision on the
opening was aimed at "alleviating sufferings of residents in
Jezzine and facilitating the communication" from the border
strip to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz stressed today that it is an
obligation of the state to open the Kfar Falous crossing in
order to dismantle the blockade imposed by Israel around
Jezzine, 75 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut Airport upon his departure
for Austria, the foreign minister underlined that "the
government will do everything it can to support sons of Jezzine
in their perseverance in their area, in their homes and on their
land."
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, a beleaguered city of 35,000, just out from the
northern tip of the occupied border strip and is often
"inspected" by patrols of the 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia, which polices the enclave in concert with
1,000-strong Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Muslim guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, mounted two bombing attacks on SLA patrols on the southern
outskirts of the mainly Christian-populated town last month,
killing two militiamen and two civilians.
</P>
<P>
The rare assaults in the area provoked the city's residents
to stage protest demonstrations and demand Lebanese army
protections, prompting the government to declare it would reopen
the Kfar Kalous crossing, which has been closed since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Lahd, the Israeli-appointed commander of the SLA
militia, declared Thursday his agreement to let the crossing be
reopened.
</P>
<P>
The retired Lebanese army general's move came days after his
militiamen shelled Lebanese army units who had spent two weeks
removing mines and barricades on the road leading to Kfar
Falous.
</P>
<P>
Lahd said he would clear the sector of road under SLA control
but warned that he would immediately block the crossing and
bombard the area "without any prior warning" if the crossing was
used by resistance guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the Lebanese army not be deployed near Kfar
Falous, leaving the crossing and its vicinities as part of the
existing no-man's land between the occupied zone and the rest of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Maize Surplus Forecast in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique, which achieved maize
self-sufficiency for the first time after decades of domestic
production shortfalls is likely to have a surplus of close to
54,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) early warning
unit today said surplus was forecast in the major maize growing
northern provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Nampula and Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
''This reflects the significantly improved production
prospects brought about by increased plantings and better yields
helped by good rains and improved supply of seed and farming
tools,'' said the unit.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since independence in 1975, Mozambique
seems to have notched a rare success story in efforts to prop up
agricultural recovery, with locally produced maize expected to
reach an all-time high of 1.043 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 10 percent higher than last year's record
harvest of 947,000 tons, the unit said.

VIENNA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The average package price of seven
supervised oil products of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) last week picked up to 17.72 U.S. dollars per
barrel, OPEC secretariat's statistics showed today.
</P>
<P>
The average oil price was 17.58 dollars two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The average price in whole June was 17.37 dollars. The first
week of July saw a clear climb of the price to 17.92 dollars, but
it fell to 17.58 dollars in the following week.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC ministerial meeting in late June asked its member
states to strictly abide by their own daily quota, so as to
maintain the OPEC daily quota of 25.03 million barrels to
stabilize the world oil price. The stipulated OPEC oil price was

<HEADLINE> IRSP in Northern Ireland Rejects IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Socialist
Party (IRSP) today rejected a ceasefire proposed at the weekend by
the IRA, saying the truce would not help end British "occupation"
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the IRSP said that the truce, which will allow
the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein to participate in the peace
talks, would not help get Ireland united.
</P>
<P>
The IRSP is the political wing of a small but deadly
anti-British guerrilla group in Northern Ireland, the Irish
National Liberation Army (INLA), which broke away from the IRA in
1976.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has launched a military
campaign over the past 28 years to end the British rule of
Northern Ireland, called a ceasefire Saturday which took effect on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that the so-called peace process is little
more than a thinly veiled attempt at pacifying Nationalist demands
while neutralizing Republican resistance to the British occupation
of Ireland," the IRSP said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The INLA never declared a ceasefire in its war against
Britain. It claimed responsibility for several shooting attacks on
Northern Ireland security personnel during riots this month over
annually held Protestant Orange Order parades.

<HEADLINE> Arab Solidarity Conference Opens in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Conference of Arab Parties and
Non-governmental Organizations in Support of Arab Solidarity
opened here today in a bid to close Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
At the outset of the two-day conference, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak stressed that Egypt seeks together with other
Arab countries to restore Arab solidarity and boost cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt seeks to activate the role played by the Arab League
(AL) and its specialized organizations to become more capable of
facing up to new changes and expressing Arab aspirations for a
new era of cooperation within the framework of a just and overall
peace," he said in a speech read out on his behalf at the
inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, AL Secretary General Esmat-Abdul
Meguid underlined that the issue of Arab solidarity has been
given top priority at present.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, read out by the league's assistant secretary
general, Ahmed Bin Helmi, Meguid stressed the importance of
building Arab solidarity on "clear bases and joint interests."
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League made long strides for clearing Arab
atmospheres and ironing out differences," he said, adding that the
Cairo Arab Summit held in June last year opened a new stage for
joint actions.
</P>
<P>
He pinpointed the crying challenges facing the Arab states at
present as the deadlock in the Mideast peace process due to the
Israeli government's non-abidance by the peace principles and
intransigence on its settlement policy in the occupied Arab
territories as well as its attempts to Judaize Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of more than 50 parties and non-governmental
organizations attending the conference will discuss a number of
issues such as the Mideast peace process, economic integration,
the normalization of ties among some countries, and sanctions
imposed on some Arab states such as Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the Egyptian Committee for
Solidarity with Afro-Asian Peoples, will release Tuesday a
statement including its recommendations.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM's New Chief: We'll Do A Quick Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The new chief of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) Richard Butler said today that he and his
colleagues will complete their mission of disarming Iraq "as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, Butler, a former Australian
ambassador to the U.N., also said that his commission will not be
influenced by any government.
</P>
<P>
He said "In my definite view, that time (six years of getting
rid of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction) has been too long and
we must try to find a way to complete the job" because "the time
has come," said the new chief.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq since 1990 will not be
lifted before the UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Butler arrived here this morning on his first visit to Iraq
after he replaced Rolf Ekues as executive chairman of the UNSCOM
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He said he will endeavor to seek a solution of the current
crisis between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
His predecessor complained of non-cooperation from Iraq, while
Baghdad rejected the charge, described Ekues as a stooge of the
United States and held him responsible for the maintenance of the
international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution a month ago
threatening Iraq with further international sanctions within four
months should it fail to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Butler also promised to be objective and independent in his
mission, adding he viewed his job as a "scientific and technical
one and the whole mark should be objectivity."
</P>
<P>
"I will not make political statements here or any where else,"
said Butler, adding that UNSCOM is responsible for giving the
Security Council a "credible" report on the process of disarming
Iraq.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Optimistic About Trade in 2nd Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is cautiously
optimistic about the country's trade performance in the second
half of this year, as the turnaround in the global electronics
demand has begun and is likely to continue in the coming months,
the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It noted that non-oil domestic exports expanded by 4.4 percent
in the second quarter after contracting by 4.1 percent in the
first quarter. For the first half of 1997, the growth was 0.2
percent. Both electronics and non-electronics exports did well in
the second quarter, it said.
</P>
<P>
Electronics exports, which account for about 70 percent of
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, rose by 4.2 percent in the
second quarter, with the major electronics exports, such as disk
drives, integrated circuits and personal computers registering
double digit growth rates, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
Given the better performance in the second quarter, the TDB
said that the outlook for the second half of 1997 "is one of
cautious optimism", as the recovery in the global electronics
demand is expected to continue in the upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
However, competition in the industry is likely to intensify,
which would exert downward pressure on prices of key electronic
products, resulting in the squeeze on profit margins, the TDB
said.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Leads in Liberia's Preliminary Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 21 (Xinhua)- Preliminary votes from Liberia's
presidential elections released by the Independent Elections
Commission (IEC) in Monrovia today showed that Charles Taylor
from the National Patriotic Party (NPP) is in a comfortable lead
with a little over 66 percent votes.
</P>
<P>
According to Liberia radio monitored in the neighboring Sierra
Leone, it is now certain that Liberia's next president will be
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the election of Taylor will mean
there would not be a runoff with the other front-runner for the
presidency, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, leader of the Unity Party.
</P>
<P>
The official result, said the radio, will not be known until
Tuesday or early Wednesday but there is little possibility that
today's election predictions will change.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio, Taylor said, "I believe in god
and he has always been my protector". He described the civil
crisis in Liberia in which he played a major part during the past
seven years as "the making of god to punish the Liberian people
for their sins. "
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to lead Liberia and its people to higher
heights as my faith is always with god," he added.
</P>
<P>
Liberian officials in the election office said the
presidential winner will be sworn in six days from now at
programs marking the 150 years of the countrys' independence.
</P>
<P>
The election is regarded as the first genuine multi-party vote
in the country for at least some 100 years. For most of the
time, Liberian politicians have been dominated up to a proportion
of 19 to 5 by the only party in the country the whig.
</P>
<P>
During the reign of former President Samuel Doe, there was a
multi-party election, the result of which was not made public due
to charges of fraud.
</P>
<P>
The election in Liberia was watched with keen interest by
political leaders in the sub-region especially the junta regime
in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"A threat to peace in Liberia or in Sierra Leone can
destabilize either of these countries", a political observer here
noted.

MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today Russia will cut the size of the armed forces by 500,000
to 1.2 million by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev at the

officers.

<P>
Yeltsin said that the number of generals of the army would be
limited within 2,300, adding Russia will continue its efforts to
built a professional army through military reform.
</P>

He said Russia must create "a mobile army equipped with
advanced weaponry," denying that the army reduction would weaken
the country's defense ability.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the military reform is necessary so that the army
can increase its combat effectiveness.

LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia urged here today the
African Development Bank (ADB) to provide financial support for
its public service reform.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ronald Penza told visiting ADB President Omar
Kabbaj that his country's public service retrenchment program has
been implemented slowly because of insufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
The success of the retrenchment exercise is vital to the
economic growth and poverty reduction of Zambia, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the availability of funds, Penza said, the implementation
of the retrenchment exercise will be completed by next year.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that more reduction in his country's external
debt burdens is needed for Zambia's meaningful economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
The current external debt burden is still heavy and leaves the

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader: US Could not Hurt Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme leader Ali
Khamenei said here today that the United States could not hurt
Iran because attacking Iran would make Iran more united and not
attacking Iran would make Iran stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spiritual leader made the remarks while meeting
Jathliq Aram Keshishian, spiritual leader of the 4 million
Armenian Orthodox Christians living outside their homeland, the
state-run Tehran Radio reported. Keshishian arrived in Iran last
week.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the worst the United States could ever do
was to attack Iran.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't attack us, they lose, because we get stronger
every day. And if they do attack, they still lose, because our
nation will unite under an attack and we will win more support
around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that economic embargo was not an alternative for
Washington because the U.S. would stand the chance of losing its
allies.
</P>
<P>
"If it imposes economic sanctions on us, it would still be
against its interests, because our domestic activities would
increase and the U.S. would lose its allies, and may even lead to
manifestation of the internal contradiction in the American
regime," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei called the U.S. "the ultimate world tyrant" and held
the U.S. responsible for all the oppression in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever there is evil and oppression, wherever there is
imposed war against nations, wherever there is repression of the
righteous struggle of the nations, you can see U.S. involvement
there," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Khamenei is regarded by observers here as the
harshest attack on the United States since the presidential
election on May 23 in which moderate Mohammad Khatami won a
landslide victory by defeating Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. broke diplomatic ties on April 7, 1980, four
months after the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, the
capital of Iran, and taking of 62 U.S. hostages by radical
Islamic students.
</P>
<P>
Since then, relations between Iran and the United States have
remained hostile as Iran has opposed the U.S. efforts to broker
peace between Arabs and Israel in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The United States has accused Iran of backing anti-Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon and of backing anti-Arafat forces in
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington has changed its hostile tone toward Tehran
after the election of President-elect Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has
reiterated that the U.S. should show its desire for improving
ties with Iran by releasing Iran's assets frozen after the
hostage crisis.

left here today for Malaysia to attend a ceremony to admit the
country along with Laos into the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the grouping's 30th Annual Ministerial Meeting
this week, the state-run Radio Myanmar and TV Myanmar reported
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar became observer of the ASEAN in July 1996 at the 29th
Annual ASEAN Ministerial Meeting held in Jakarta after acceding to
the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia at the July

</P>
<P>
The ASEAN had planned to admit Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia
simultaneously at the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) this
week, expanding its membership to 10 nations.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was disrupted by factional fighting between the
forces of
Cambodian Co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Norodom Ranariddh on July
5 and
6. At a special foreign ministers meeting earlier this month, the
ASEAN
decided to postpone admitting Cambodia because of the fighting,
which
resulted in the ouster of First Prime Minister Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> EDS-repeat with correction in fifth Para. BC-hke -- Mongolia Gives Importance to Ties With China, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will give priority to
developing its relations with China and Russia, President Nachagyn
Bagabandy said today in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that developing relations with China and Russia has
been and will always be the primary principle of Mongolia's
foreign policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president praised China for its fast economic development,
and said China's role and reputation on the world stage have
increased day by day.
</P>
<P>
He said China has become an important force in maintaining
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world, and
Mongolia will "further develop its cooperative relationship with
China, which is beneficial to both sides."
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy, who was sworn in as Mongolia's new president on June
20, said that in recent years Mongolia has expanded its
cooperation with China, and the two countries have enhanced mutual
understanding and trust between them.
</P>
<P>
He added that the legal basis for developing the relationship
between the two nations has been further consolidated.
</P>
<P>
The official visit to Mongolia in April by Qiao Shi, chairman
of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, is
an important step toward a closer relationship and cooperation
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is willing to promote the good-neighborly ties of
cooperation with China in the spirits of equality and mutual
benefits and in accordance with international norms and a
friendship agreement signed in 1994, said the president.
</P>
<P>
"Mongolia pursues an open foreign policy of non-alignment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In developing foreign relations, he said, it is highly
important for Mongolia to create a sound outside environment,
overcome difficulties arising from the transformation of economic
structures, and to promote national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Bagabandy said he will give priority to
curbing inflation and stabilizing currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the prices and currency exchange rates are kept
stable, can the country ensure that more investments will flow in,
people's income will rise and people will enhance their confidence
in the future."
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy vowed to give particular attention to fighting
unemployment and poverty, which have become the most serious
problems of the country.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that by June, 64,200 Mongolians had
lost their jobs, but the actual number of unemployment had reached
200,000.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce poverty and unemployment, Mongolia has to
take macro-control measures to stabilize economic situation,
increase investment, revitalize national industry, agriculture and
animal husbandry, and fully support private productive activities,
commerce and trade, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Pursues Electronic Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- This port city in north China has
successfully put into operation an electronic network compatible
for cards issued by different banks.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year Tianjin has invested 30 million yuan in
linking the networking system of the major banks with that of the
local branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The local branches of the China Construction Bank and the
Agricultural Bank of China have already been linked electronically
to one another, and the other banks are expected to join the
network soon.
</P>
<P>
Once all the banks are linked up by the banking network,
holders of cards issued by any bank can pay into or withdraw from
deposits through any POS or ATM machine in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the card network is to be linked up with those of
Visa International and Mastercard.
</P>
<P>
Since the local branch of the Bank of China issued the first
credit card, the Great Wall Card, in Tianjin in 1985, at least
another four types of cards have been issued by the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, the
Agricultural Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that banks in Tianjin have issued a
total of 480,000 cards, including 380,000 credit cards and 100,000
ATM cards. Business transactions conducted with such cards reached
6.6 billion yuan-worth last year.

JAKARTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian

today.
</P>
<P>
Alatas made the remarks when briefing a press conference on his
recent separate meetings with Cambodian King Sihanouk in Beijing,
Prince Ranariddh in Bangkok and Hun Sen in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we asked when we met them was whether they
wanted ASEAN to help them resolve the conflict," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sihanouk and his son, Ranariddh, responded
positively to the offer, but Hun Sen rejected it.
</P>
<P>
"We must respect the involving parties' decisions. If Hun Sen
does not want ASEAN to assist, we will stop," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
However, Alatas said, ASEAN's decision to accept Cambodia as a
full member of the seven-member organization was still valid, but
the timetable would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia still enjoyed the observer status in the group and
therefore could participate in ASEAN's upcoming ministerial
meeting as an observer, Alatas explained.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he would report to the meeting, to be
held in Malaysia on July 23, the results of his talks with
Cambodian leaders.

SOFIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr has
signed a one-year contract with Bulgaria's Dimitar Penev, who was

Penev surprised the world by leading the Bulgaria side to the

Penev's contract with Bulgaria came to an end last year because

<HEADLINE> Preparations For World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings Go Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the 1997 World
Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings have
gone smoothly into the final stage, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority announced today.
</P>
<P>
The annual meetings, jointly of the Boards of Governors of the
World Bank and the IMF, are scheduled to be held between
September 23 and 25 this year in Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here today, James Lau, executive director
who oversees external affairs in the HKMA, said that the annual
meetings would attract some 14,000 participants from 180 countries
and regions all over the world. They will meet at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC) and its newly-built
Extension, the venue of the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"As the first major international event in Hong Kong after the
handover on July 1, 1997, the annual meetings will turn out to be
the focus of the world," said Lau, who chairs an organizing
committee responsible for coordination and planning of the local
logistical arrangements for the meetings.
</P>
<P>
The assembly will attract over 300 finance ministers and
central bank governors, around 4,000 government officials from 181
members of the World Bank and the IMF. In addition, 5,000 private
sector bankers and senior representatives from relevant
organizations will be present, as well as 2,000 local and overseas
journalists.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Hong Kong Special Administrative Government staff
will join forces with 700 in-coming World Bank and IMF staff to
take care of detailed arrangements for "the most prestigious
annual event in the international financial community."
</P>
<P>
Both founded in 1945, the World Bank and the IMF hold their
annual meetings once every three years outside their headquarters
in Washington, DC, USA.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank aims to promote economic development, improve
the quality of life and provide loans for developing countries,
while the IMF's objectives are to promote international monetary
cooperation, facilitate expansion of international trade and
promote exchange rate stability.
</P>
<P>
The staging of the event this year in Hong Kong shows that the
World Bank and the IMF have both cast their strong vote of
confidence in the ongoing stability and prosperity of Hong Kong
after July 1, 1997, and in Hong Kong's continuing success as a
leading international financial center, according to the HKMA
official.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that the annual meetings would enhance Hong Kong's
status as an international financial center and bring substantial
economic benefits to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A variety of local working groups have been set up to arrange
venue facilities, communications system, hotel accommodations,
transportation, security, airport reception, registration, social
events and cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
Lau said the organizing committee has coordinated with a
preparatory team led by the Ministry of Finance and joined by such
agencies as the People's Bank of China and the State Council's
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
An integral part of annual meetings is the program of seminars,
which will be held in the week before. This year's focus is on
Asia and the World: Capital, Competitiveness, and Community.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that about 3,000 major meetings, seminars, keynote
sessions and social events would be staged during the ten-day
period starting on September 16.
</P>
<P>
At the venue -- the HKCEC and its Extension, over 900 temporary
 offices will be set up, in addition to seven convention and
exhibition halls, two theaters and 56 meeting rooms. Advanced
technologies will be used, such as the bar-code system, which uses
 computers to spot forged or stolen badges so as to tighten
security.
</P>
<P>
According to the HKMA official, the expenditure for the event
would be well controlled within the budget of 485 million HK
dollars (62.5 million US dollars). The organizing committee has
secured 70 million HK dollars (nine million US dollars) of
sponsorship.

enterprises to cooperate with the central and western parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Medgyessy said Hungary and China share many opportunities in
trade and economy, and Hungary is ready to develop long-term
relations with China in this area.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary hopes to work with China to increase
information exchanges and strengthen mutual understanding, and
discuss the possibility of cooperation in energy, education,
aviation, finance and other sectors, as well as in the central and
western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his congratulations on the achievements China
has made in social and economic development and on Hong Kong's
smooth return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li thanked Medgyessy and said he hoped that Hungary could make
use of Hong Kong, which serves as a bridge between China and other
countries, to further develop trade and economic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, met with Medgyessy and his party.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian visitors arrived here July 19 at the invitation
of Li.

<HEADLINE> China Construction Bank Networks Credit Card System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank will
link up its credit card systems in five cities starting from
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The networked credit card system will start operation first in
Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
This means that any owner of the credit card issued by the
China Construction Bank, or the "Dragon Card," can make cash
withdrawals or get a checking account balance from the networked
Automated Teller Machines (ATM) in any of those cites.
</P>
<P>
And the link-up will shorten the time for cash withdrawal to
about eight seconds and that for checking an individual account
balance to about six seconds.
</P>
<P>
Instant settlement, faster authorization, and safety checking
will also be made possible since all the branch banks in the five
cities, as well as designated places that accept the Dragon Card,
including shops, will be hooked up to the network.
</P>
<P>
The bank also expects to connect the credit systems in another
26 cities to the network, and introduce new services to Dragon
Card users.
</P>
<P>
The number of Dragon Cards had expanded to 14.97 million by the
end of June, making it the second most-popular credit card in
China. The transaction volume for the cards totaled 159.8 billion
yuan for the first half of this year compared with the 157.4
billion last year. And 48,500 shopping centers currently accept
Dragon Cards.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Retail Sales Up in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's retail sales continued a
steady trend of growth, advancing 0.5 percent to 14 billion U.S.
dollars in May, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
May's retail sales were 7.6 percent higher compared with the same
month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Many consumers appeared to be parking a new car in the driveway of
their newly furnished homes," the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of big-ticket items drove up retail sales in May, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In May, sales by motor and recreational vehicle dealers were up 2.2
percent and furniture stores up 2.1 percent, which were the major
contributors to the month's growth.
</P>
<P>
"Continued low interest rates made the costs of financing purchases
attractive," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, improving sales by furniture stores may, in part, have
been spurred by the strong housing market, it added.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Keen on Trademark Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- It has become a common practice for
industrial and commercial enterprises in this city in east China's
Zhejiang province to promptly apply for trademark registration for
their new products.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has registered nearly 10,000 trademarks, the
most in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, with the rapid growth of the market
economy, more and more enterprises are standardizing their
economic operations in line with market economy laws, and have
come to know how to protect their legal rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The business people here have become increasingly aware of
trademark registration, for it can effectively avoid economic
disputes and protect their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
And a lot of old-style markets and stores have resorted to
trademark registration to protect their intangible assets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more and more industrial and commercial
enterprises in the city have started to register trademarks
abroad.
</P>
<P>
To date, Ningbo enterprises have registered a total of 226
trademarks in 56 countries and regions worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Let Market Determine Its Currency Value: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's foreign exchange
policy is to let the market forces determine the value of the
ringgit (local currency) based on the country's economic
fundamentals, Parliamentary Secretary of the Finance Ministry
Shafie Mohd Salleh said today.
</P>
<P>
He told the House of Representatives here today that the
Central Bank will only intervene in the foreign exchange market
when the ringgit depreciated drastically owing to intense currency
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government would ensure the central
bank's intervention would not be drastic because what was
happening now was only a temporary phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian currency's value began to depreciate when fixed
deposit fund managers recently involved in speculation of various
currencies in the region including the ringgit, he said during the
Question Time, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in a country like Malaysia which is
practicing open economy, the fluctuation of the ringgit was not
only influenced by the local economic fundamentals but also
developments in the regional and worldwide foreign exchange
markets.
</P>
<P>
Shafie said the currency depreciation in the region did not
involve the ringgit alone but also the Philippines' peso,
Thailand's baht and Indonesia's rupiah as well as the Singapore
dollar.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Good Fiscal Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese budget was closely
observed in the first half of this year with the fiscal revenue
outgrowing expenditure by nearly 8.8 percentage points, according
to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the national fiscal revenue,
excluding debt income, grew 29.9 percent on a yearly basis in the
first six months to more than 390.1 billion yuan in the first six
months, while fiscal spendings expanded 21.1 percent to 351.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The two amounts translated into a fiscal surplus of 38.8
billion yuan for the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a national conference on fiscal work, the MOF
minister Liu Zhongli on Sunday attributed the rapid revenue growth
to a number of "special factors."
</P>
<P>
The stamp duties on stock trading in the first six months were
considerably more than the same 1996 period, while tax rebates to
exporters decreased, he explained.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu pointed out that some problems still existed in
the first half, such as increasing tax payment delays by
enterprises and unbalanced fiscal revenue growth among different
areas.
</P>
<P>
In some places, fiscal spending expanded to such an extent that
it exceeded revenue increase, noted Liu, who is also
Director-General of the State Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
To solve those problems, Liu urged the fiscal departments at
all levels to beef up management and supervision of the fiscal
revenue and expenditure, in order to make sure that the central
budget deficit will fall below the planned amount, which is 57
billion yuan, four billion yuan less than the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on fiscal and taxation departments to
enhance tax collection, deal a harsh blow to tax evasion and
cheating, and stem unauthorized extension of tax delays and
exemptions.
</P>
<P>
He warned that no new policies for increasing fiscal spending
will be introduced. "Except for subsidies for disaster relief and
grain, no additional spendings should ever be arranged," Liu
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Concerns Over Escalating Hostilities in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Special
Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) today expressed its grave concern
over the escalating hostilities in Afghanistan in recent weeks
while calling for an immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the aerial bombing of civilian areas in Kabul
is "most regrettable and deplorable" and it "simply complicates
the already difficult search for peace in Afghanistan," the UNSMA
said in a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations earnestly appeals for the immediate halt of
this aerial bombing of the civilian targets and urges the warring
parties in Afghanistan to cease all forms of hostilities, and to
begin genuine negotiations for a lasting settlement," it said.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood
recaptured on Sunday morning the strategic Bargram airbase and
Charikar, capital of Parwan province, in a strong offensive
against the Islamic Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, several jets belonging to the opposition
forces bombed the Taliban controlled Kabul, killing eight
civilians and injuring many more.

<HEADLINE> Elsie Tu: English Lady Dedicated to HK Poor  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- When most Hong Kong residents
started to enjoy weekend on Saturday afternoon, Elsie Tu greeted
her most intense and arduous work in a week.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after a meager lunch of sandwich and cheese, the old
lady, who is already 84, returned to her office for something that
 she has been ceaselessly doing for more than 30 years -- having
interviews with people in trouble and trying to help them out.
</P>
<P>
From 1:30 to 5:30 p.m., she listened patiently to the wishes
and complaints of more than 50 people, examined their cases one by
one, and drafted five letters of application or petition to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Among her visitors were senior citizens walking on sticks, new
mothers carrying babies, young couples with little children, as
well as Filipino maids and Pakistanis. Some of them came a long
way from the "New Territories" and waited a long time to see her.
</P>
<P>
They were very different people, and asked for help in a
variety of things -- from housing to immigration, and from social
welfare to legal aid. But from their faces and eyes one could find
something in common: hearty respect for and firm belief in this
silver-haired English lady.
</P>
<P>
Children, no matter how old they are, could also enter Elsie's
office while their parents were beckoned in. Each of them got
several candies from Elsie's assistant to keep them quiet during
the interview.
</P>
<P>
Until her last client left, Elsie didn't take a single break
throughout the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have as many as 100 cases and had to work until ten
o'clock at night when we first started," she said. "This is not
too much work for us compared with that."
</P>
<P>
Though her eye sockets had turned red as a result of wearing
glasses and writing papers for too long, she was obviously in high
spirit.
</P>
<P>
Helping the Poor
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived in Hong Kong, there was no democracy, no
justice, no legal aid and no social welfare, nothing," recalled
Elsie, who came here in 1951. "And it was the underprivileged who
suffered most because they did not dare to speak out."
</P>
<P>
She started her efforts to "make amends for the injustices and
inequalities" in a hut area in Kai Tak New Village opposite the
international airport of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Along with others she helped people in need of medical
treatment for minor ailments, and began a school for those who
could not afford fees in other schools.
</P>
<P>
The school, now called Mu Kuang English School and with Elsie
as its supervisor, started from an old army tent and only 30
students. It has developed into one of the most successful private
secondary schools in Kowloon area, with a total of 1,500 students.
</P>
<P>
In early 1963, Elsie made a significant decision in her life --
to campaign for a seat on the Urban Council, the only government
body open to partial election then.
</P>
<P>
"It is most important for the people to have a reasonable way
of living, but sometimes you can't get it except through having
some democratic representation in the government," she talked
about her motives.
</P>
<P>
Even before she was elected into the council, people who
learned her name and ideas from the newspapers started to flock to
her for help, and she still clearly remembered the first major
case she handled.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very cold day, the coldest we had for 50 years," she
said. "A group of people from a large hut area in Jordan Valley
came to me because the government had sent men to smash out their
huts and left all of them, including old people and children, out
in the cold air."
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy to persuade the senseless bureaucrats in the
government, such as directors of the social welfare and housing
departments, to do anything for those people. With perseverance
and persistent efforts, however, Elsie finally made them agree to
move the people into a place where they could build a new hut.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very big fight and we won it," she said plainly,
adding that the first thing she did after winning the election was
to persuade the Urban Council to pass a policy requiring the
government never to leave any people homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
That case also marked the beginning of Elsie's efforts to
develop an efficient system to fight against what she called
"corruption and lack of care by the government under the colonial
system".
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday afternoon, she and her assistants, mostly
volunteers, met with people suffering from various social
problems, recorded their wishes and complaints, and then sought a
solution to their problems from the administration.
</P>
<P>
"Every time we finished the interview, we immediately typed a
letter and sent it to relevant departments, and we would write a
reminder in three weeks if there was no answer," said Elsie.
"Sometimes we had to send two or three reminders."
</P>
<P>
Though there were a lot of difficulties at the beginning, she
said, things have become much easier now, for most members of the
civil service now understand that she will continue to push them
for an answer, even if the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the government's efforts over the past two decades,
we have got rid of a lot of corruption and the government service
is much more responsible now than before," she added. "Our cases
are dealt with much more fairly."
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a million people have gone to Elsie for help since
she went onto the Urban Council in 1963. Some of them represented
groups of people that sometimes numbered more than 100.
</P>
<P>
"We help anyone who comes, no matter what colors or social
status they have," said Elsie. "We have probably helped more than
half of our visitors to find a solution to their problems."
</P>
<P>
Allen Lau, who has served voluntarily as Elsie's part-time
assistant and interpreter for more than 30 years, said that Elsie
was one of the first two local legislators that pioneered in
meeting the public and listening to their problems.
</P>
<P>
Now many people, including District Board members, Urban
Councilors and Legislative Councilors, have followed suit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been working with Elsie for so long because I think she
really serves the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
A jobless old man, who went to Elsie after failing to get
government medical assistance to his badly ill wife, said to her:
"When I saw your name, I saw hope again."
</P>
<P>
Family Influence
</P>
<P>
Born to a worker's family in June 1913, Elsie grew up to
experience the great economic depression that hit the world in the
late 1920s, and saw a lot of unemployment, hunger and miseries
among the people around her.
</P>
<P>
"My father was a socialist. He always hoped that I would one
day become a member of the parliament and work for the rights of
the underprivileged," she said.
</P>
<P>
At first, however, she chose a different road by becoming a
missionary worker.
</P>
<P>
She sailed to China in late 1947 and never had the chance to
see again her beloved father, who died the next year. But the
marks of her father's thinking and expectation have never perished
on her mind.
</P>
<P>
She soon became very disappointed about the missionary work
because she found that religion couldn't solve problems.
</P>
<P>
"So I gave it up and continued what my father wanted me to do,
that is, to work for the people through the policies and political
means," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, it was Hong Kong, instead of Britain, that had become
her arena to turn her father's wishes into reality.
</P>
<P>
"Though I was wrongly interested in being a missionary, it has
also done good in a way because it brought me out to Hong Kong,
where I had been able to work against the injustices of the
colonial government here," said Elsie.

<HEADLINE> Elsie Tu: English Lady Dedicated to HK Poor (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following her entry into the Urban Council in 1963, she won
eight consecutive re-elections until 1995, and joined the
Legislative Council twice in 1988 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, she became a member of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), Hong Kong's transitional legislature after its
return to China on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Having interviews with the people is very useful to my
legislative work, for you must first find out the problems before
you can try to solve them through legislation," said Elsie.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Elsie married a Chinese -- Andrew Tu Hsueh Kwei, who
had been her co-worker ever since the founding of the "tent
school" in 1954.
</P>
<P>
"We have the same interests and the same careers, and he has
always been a strong support to my work," Elsie said of her
husband, who is also the founder of the Hong Kong Branch of the
Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local media, Andrew Tu gave a
definition to the "same interests" between him and Elsie -- to
promote education and work for the benefits of the community.
</P>
<P>
Social Recognition
</P>
<P>
On July 2, one day after the founding of the HKSAR, the SAR
government bestowed the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM), the highest
award in Hong Kong's new honor system, to people who had made
outstanding contributions to the local community. Elsie was the
only foreign national among the 12 recipients.
</P>
<P>
A brief citation released by the SAR government to all local
media introduced Elsie as the one who "has stood up for the
interests of grassroots members of the Hong Kong community for
several decades".
</P>
<P>
"I find it unbelievable that I was among the first twelve to
receive the GBM, especially as I'm not Chinese," Elsie said. "It
shows that the Chinese are still friendly to the British people
and do not discriminate on race, in spite of the colonial attitude
of some British officials such as the last governor (Chris
Patten)."
</P>
<P>
She also became the first foreigner to acquire the status of
HKSAR permanent resident, which, along with the medal-winning, was
described by the local media as "Madam Tu's double happiness".
</P>
<P>
Though it was during a five-day public holiday from June 28 to
July 2, the Department of Immigration of the HKSAR managed to
grant Elsie the right of abode on the early morning of July 1, so
as to ensure her eligibility to be sworn into the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Hung on the walls of Elsie's office at the Mu Kuang English
School are several silk banners and bronze plates, all carrying
words of gratitude from people she helped.
</P>
<P>
"Elsie has nearly one hundred of these things, and the office
will be too small to hang all of them out," one of her assistants
said.
</P>
<P>
But for Elsie, some smaller and plainer things appeared to be
more unforgettable and brought her greater joy than medals and
banners did.
</P>
<P>
Once when she took a taxi, the driver, a man in his 40s,
refused to take her fare. "Thank you very much," he said. "You
helped my mom when I was a kid."
</P>
<P>
When she went shopping, she often met store owners calling her
their friend and offering a cheaper price for whatever she bought.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest reward for me is on the faces of those people I
have helped," Elsie once told her friends.
</P>
<P>
Among millions of "thanks" she received over the past four
decades, she was most deeply touched by a Christmas card from a
teenage boy she had helped to save from prison.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, you're always so kind and considerate in whatever
you do," said the card. "The world will become prettier with more
people like you."
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I don't deserve such a high praise," said Elsie. "But
this is the goal we are striving after."

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo's Transfer Issue to be Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- FIFA on Tuesday will settle Ronaldo's
transfer dispute between Barcelona and Inter Milan at Zurich, it
was reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilan star will make soccer legal history if FIFA ratify
his move from Spanish side to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo has paid Barcelona four billion pesetas (27.6 million
U.S. dollars) to let him go as a free agent, which is based on his
contract with Barcelona on payment of a 28 million U.S. dollars
penalty.
</P>
<P>
However, Barcelona doesn't allow Ronaldo to move to a foreign
club. Inter Milan argues that once a player becomes a free agent
in his own country he is free to join a club in another country.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo expected to play for Inter Milan against English
champions Manchester United in a friendly next weekend.
</P>
<P>
After a couple of weeks dispute with Inter Milan, Barcelona
seemed to accept Ronaldo's leaving. The club has reportedly made a
13 million dollar bid for Brazilian side Flamengo's 23-year-old
Savio Bortolini Pimentel.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Gives Importance to Ties With China, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will give priority to
developing its relations with China and Russia, President Nachagyn
Bagabandy said today in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that developing relations with China and Russia has
been and will always be the primary principle of Mongolia's
foreign policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president praised China for its fast economic development,
and said China's role and reputation on the world stage have
increased day by day.
</P>
<P>
He said China has become an important force in maintaining
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world, and
Mongolia will "further develop its cooperative relationship with
China, which is beneficial to both sides."
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy, who was sworn in as Mongolia's new president Sunday,
said that in recent years Mongolia has expanded its cooperation
with China, and the two countries have enhanced mutual
understanding and trust between them.
</P>
<P>
He added that the legal basis for developing the relationship
between the two nations has been further consolidated.
</P>
<P>
The official visit to Mongolia in April by Qiao Shi, chairman
of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, is
an important step toward a closer relationship and cooperation
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is willing to promote the good-neighborly ties of
cooperation with China in the spirits of equality and mutual
benefits and in accordance with international norms and a
friendship agreement signed in 1994, said the president.
</P>
<P>
"Mongolia pursues an open foreign policy of non-alignment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In developing foreign relations, he said, it is highly
important for Mongolia to create a sound outside environment,
overcome difficulties arising from the transformation of economic
structures, and to promote national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Bagabandy said he will give priority to
curbing inflation and stabilizing currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the prices and currency exchange rates are kept
stable, can the country ensure that more investments will flow in,
people's income will rise and people will enhance their confidence
in the future."
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy vowed to give particular attention to fighting
unemployment and poverty, which have become the most serious
problems of the country.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that by June, 64,200 Mongolians had
lost their jobs, but the actual number of unemployment had reached
200,000.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce poverty and unemployment, Mongolia has to
take macro-control measures to stabilize economic situation,
increase investment, revitalize national industry, agriculture and
animal husbandry, and fully support private productive activities,
commerce and trade, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Achieving Economic Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines can achieve the 7-8
percent economic growth rate and the 6-6.5 inflation rate set by
the government for the year despite the peso's devaluation, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are well on track with our targets. It is too early for any
changes," Economic Development Secretary Cielito Habito said in a
mid-year economic review sponsored by the Philippine Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Habito expressed optimism that the country's economy would
perform better during the next quarters due to the recovery of
manufacturing sector and exports, the increase of real investments
and the better performance of the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross national product grew by 6.1 percent during
the first quarter of the year, showing signs of a slowdown when
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the inflation impact of the depreciation of the
peso would not be substantial because the exchange rate between
the peso and the U.S. dollar would not depreciate much.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists believed that the economy would slow
down this year and the inflation rate would reach at least 8.5
percent following the peso's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in Metro Manila showed that of the 17 kinds
of basic goods, prices of five commodities had increased while oil
prices and power rate are expected to rise later this month.
</P>
<P>
The peso has devalued by 10 percent since the Philippine
Central Bank announced the de facto devaluation of the currency on
July 11 after failing to fend it off speculative attacks.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Well Ahead in Liberian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Early results of Saturday's
Liberian presidential election shows that Charles Taylor, the
former warlord who started the civil war seven years ago, is well
ahead of other candidates in the race for presidency.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted electoral authority in Monrovia
as saying that of the almost half of the votes counted so far,
Taylor won about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the situation continues, Taylor will have the 51 percent
majority of votes needed for him to be the new Liberian
president, and a run-off election scheduled for August 2 will not
be needed.
</P>
<P>
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former senior official with the
United Nations and the only woman in the 13 candidates, is the
runner-up. But it is believed that she is lagging far behind
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The turnout of voters in Saturday's election is said to be
very massive, which is estimated to be about 80 percent of the
710,000 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 11,000 west African peace-keeping forces providing
security at every polling station, the election is said to be
very peaceful, smooth and in good order.
</P>
<P>
So far, international observers, including those from the
United Nations, the European Union as well as the neighbouring
west African countries have expressed their satisfaction over the
conduct of the election.
</P>
<P>
But some people cautioned that there is no celebration until
the final result is out and accepted by all the contenders.
</P>
<P>
General Sani Abacha, the Nigerian head of state and chairman
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which
has been playing a key role in the Liberian peace process, has
urged the Liberians to accept the verdict of the election.
</P>
<P>
A positive approach to the election result is the only way to
achieve reconciliation, reconstruction and rehabilitation of the
war-devastated Liberia, Abacha said in a goodwill message sent to
Liberian people on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's Gold Industry Faces up to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gold
industry, believed to be the biggest in the world, is facing
unprecedented difficulties following gold slump to below 320 U.S.
Dollars an ounce in world market early this month.
</P>
<P>
If the precious metal does not stabilize in the next 12
months, thousands of jobs will be lost on mines across the
country, local industrial sources warned over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
About 345,000 South Africans, most of them black, reportedly
depend on jobs in the gold industry for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
According to South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM), up to about 100,000 mine workers may lose their job to
keep the gold industry viable.
</P>
<P>
Currently, nine out of 38 gold mines in South Africa are
considered marginal, with seven actually making a loss, informed
sources said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa once had a prosperous period in the early 1970s
when its gold production amounted to more than 1,000 tons in
1970.
</P>
<P>
However, as time goes on, the glittering industry in the
country has begun fading as the annual gold production has
decreased remarkablely in recent years, even to 496 tons in 1996,
the lowest in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
South Africa holds an estimated 40 percent of the world's gold
reserves, but its labor-intensive deep-level mining is more
costly than the surface mining in the United States and
Australia, two gold giants in the world.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sources attributed the large scale gold drop to
the government's subsidy cut for the industry, aging equipment,
disputes between miners and mine owners and a sequence of mine
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Besides, South African mines do not operate for 90 days a year
-- due to a Sunday mining ban, holidays and shift arrangements,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The problems have apparently hindered the development of South
Africa's gold industry and directly resulted in huge losses in
gold mines. The depression has made the industrialists cut some
120,000 jobs in gold mining during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Local observers pointed out that further lay-offs could damage
confidence in the Government of National Unity led by President
Nelson Mandela, which has promised people jobs, housing and a
better life.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the gold industry and meet the challenge of gold
slump in global market, the NUM has just reached an accord with
the Chamber of Mines to increase the country's gold production
and to have mine workers better paid. The agreed aim is to
increase gold production by 90 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Chamber of Mines will increase
mineworkers' wages from 10 percent to 25 percent on condition
that productivity and production targets are met.
</P>
<P>
NUM Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe described the accord
as a "significant breakthrough", saying it would pave the way for
sustained growth in the gold mining industry.
</P>
<P>
NUM President James Motlatsi also noted that the agreement
would contribute to preserving the present level of employment in
the industry.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Repatriates 82,000 Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- About 82,000 illegal
immigrants have been sent back to their countries of origin,
mainly African states, in the past six months, according to South
African Home Affairs Department officials.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 ilegal immigrants are repatriated each week
and the figure could more than double within the next three
months, they said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest group of illegal immigrants are reportedly
Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
Of all detained illegal immigrants, 84.5 percent are from
Mozambique, 10.7 percent from Zimbabwe, 1.2 percent from Malawi,
3.4 percent from other African states and 0.2 percent from the
rest of the world, an official survey shows.
</P>
<P>
South African civil organizations claimed that there are an
estimated eight million illegal immigrants in the country.
</P>
<P>
South African Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has
warned that failure to curb the flood of illegal immigrants would
impoverish the country.
</P>
<P>
If all illegal aliens were removed, South Africa's
unemployment problem, one of the most serious in the country,
would be closer to a solution, he said.

HONG KONG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The civil service of Hong Kong
will maintain its high efficiency and teamwork spirit, and
contribute to Hong Kong's continued prosperity, said Lam
Woon-Kwong, Secretary for the Civil Service of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"Stability is key to prosperity and development, and the
stability of the civil service is the foundation of social
stability in Hong Kong," Lam was quoted as saying by today's local
media.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 180,000 members of the local civil service
were well prepared for the historic return of Hong Kong to China
on July 1, and have adapted quickly to their new role as employees
of the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that on July 3, the first work day for the
newly-established HKSAR government following a five-day public
holiday, all government departments maintained normal operation
and underwent no change except for their names.
</P>
<P>
While the existing civil service has no problem of confidence,
he said, there are also many people who want to join the
government service, with nearly 15,000 people taking part in the
latest examination for the recruitment of some 40 administrative
officers.

teamwork spirit, efficiency and quality of the civil servants
after Hong Kong's return to China.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Rate Declines to 12.8 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's overall month-on-month
inflation rate fell to 12.8 percent in June from 17.2 percent in
May, according to the latest issue of the Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
The monthly review by the Central Bank of Kenya attributed the
fall to improved weather conditions which have resulted in a rise
in food supply.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month inflation in food prices also declined to
13.2 percent in June compared with 17.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that the inflation rate would decline
further to reach the single digit range by early 1998 on the
account of increased output from agricultural related sectors in
1997.
</P>
<P>
It is critical to reach the objective, the bank noted, adding
government borrowing from the Central Bank of Kenya should be
kept on no more than 5 percent of the most recent audited
government gross recurrent revenue.
</P>
<P>
To confine inflation to single digit rate in the 1997/98
fiscal year, according to the Economic Review, the bank will
ensure that the expansion of money supply drop from 13.5 percent
in April to no more than 11 percent by June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Most Nigerians Under Poverty Line, UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Two out of five Nierians live below
the poverty line and one third of the country's population lack
health service, according to the 1996 Human Development Report of
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two-thirds of Nigerians do not have safe water and
sanitation and 47.5 percent are illiterate, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Nigeria ranks 141st out of 175
countries in consideration of their human development index which
measures a country's achievements in terms of life expectancy,
educational attainment and adjusted real income.
</P>
<P>
Chief Ernest Shonekan, ex-head of state, acknowledged that a
world survey in 1992 showed about 34 percent of Nigeria's
population were estimated to be poor.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has moved into one of the world's 50 poorest
countries with its per capita income dropping from 1,160 U.S.
dollars in 1980 to just 260 dollars in 1995, said Shonekan, the
current chairman of the Vision 2010 Committee in charge of
long-term socio-economic planning.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty has increased over the past few years in line with
the deterioration in the economic and social conditions of the
country," he admitted at the launching of the report in the
capital Abuja over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his committee has been undertaking "a
soul-searching" exercise to appraise Nigeria's current
circumstances so as to "chart a better future for it in the 21st
century and beyond".
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Planning Chief Ayo Ogunlade also said
there is an urgent need to deliberately pursue pragmatic policies
and strategies capable of accelerating growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"Given Nigeria's rich human and material resources and
potential, our great nation should not belong to the group of
countries with very low human development profile," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP report, according to the agency's resident
representative in Nigeria, Babashola Chinsman, is an attempt to
examine the specific causes of poverty in the country and to
advance corrective actions and proposals.
</P>
<P>
The six-point agenda of the report for action to eradicate
poverty in Nigeria includes compulsory education for all and
eradication of illiteracy, and universal access to safe water and
primary health care.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for increased opportunities of employment for
the masses and enhancing the share of women in economic and
social empowerment.

<HEADLINE> France to Tax Big Firms for 3.6 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The French government announced
today that it will draw in the remaining months of the year 22
billion francs (about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars) of profits from
big enterprises to cut the country's public deficit.
</P>
<P>
France's public deficit is expected to stand at 3.5-3.7 percent
of its gross domestic product by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The measure, described by former Finance Minister Jean Arthuis
as one of "crushing the nest egg," remained the only choice for
the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to meet
the three percent public deficit criteria set by the Maastricht
treaty to join the euro at the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The French government will also cut 10 billion francs (about
1.6 billion dollars) in public spending, including two billion
francs (about 320 million dollars) on military spending, announced
the Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after the Public Finance Audit
published its evaluation report on France's finance situation,
saying that the country will over-spend 32 billion francs (about
5.3 billion dollars) this year, if no measure was taken to cut
spending and raise state revenue.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises to be touched by the new profits tax include
those with more than 50 billion francs (about 8.3 billion dollars)
of transactions or with long term profits. Strauss-Kahn said that
the new tax will be 15 percent more than the original one.
</P>
<P>
The new measure is expected to be greatly resented by France's
entrepreneurs, who hate to see enterprises become the "milk cows"
of the state.

<HEADLINE> UAE Reports 15 Percent Rise in 1996 Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
boosted spending to a record high in 1996 as the government
increased allocations for subsidies, an official report showed
today.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure reached 19.6 billion U.S. dollars last
year, a more than 15 percent rise compared with 17 billion dollars
in 1995, said the latest report issued by the UAE Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Most of the spending increase that year went to allocations for
subsidies and government transfers abroad, which jumped to about
4.7 billion dollars from 2 billion dollars in the previous year,
the report showed.
</P>
<P>
New jobs and promotions boosted allocations for salaries to
civil servants from 3.2 billion dollars in 1995 to 3.4 billion
dollars in 1996, while spending on import of goods and services
rose slightly to around 4.657 billion dollars from nearly 4.655
billion dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report gave no specific figures on defense spending, which
was among the highest in the world as compared with its gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
But under an item classified as other expenditures, there was
an increase to 2.85 billion dollars in 1996 from 2.27 billion
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report showed development spending, involving allocations
for new ventures and projects under construction, declined to
around 2.77 billion dollars from 3.04 billion dollars in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Loans and grants were also cut to nearly 1.1 billion dollars in
1996 from 1.57 billion dollars in 1995, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high expenditure, the country's financial deficit
shrank to 4.85 billion dollars last year from 5.37 billion dollars
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly attributed to high revenues in 1996 resulting
from a growth in the country's oil and gas earning of 10.1 billion
dollars from around 8.7 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is among the world's top oil powers, producing nearly
2.16 million barrels per day. Crude and gas exports fetch it more
than 12 billion dollars annually but the income is shared on a 40
to 60 percent basis with foreign partners.

CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended

Rothschild foreign exchange trader Paul Macarounas said there

<HEADLINE> Top Unionist to Seek Reassurance from Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's powerful
pro-British Unionist party leader said today he would seek
reassurances from Prime Minister Tony Blair that the Irish
Republican Army would have to hand over or decommission some
weapons at the start of a substantial negotiation.
</P>
<P>
"Reassurances are very cheap. What counts is what is down in
black and white and what is going to happen," David Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), told local reporters
hours before he met Blair at Downing Street on the new ceasefire
of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The new truce, which took effect at noon Sunday, allows IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein to gain a place in the substantial talks
on Northern Ireland's future.
</P>
<P>
Such reassurances would "have to be underwritten by the Irish
government," a co-sponsor of the negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although UUP is strongly opposed to talks with Sinn Fein,
Trimble suggested that his party would not walk out of the Belfast
peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I said after I came out of Downing Street last Thursday that
we are not of a mind to walk out," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was Trimble's first public comment since the IRA declared a
ceasefire at the weekend in its 28-year war in a bid to earn Sinn
Fein a seat at peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also said the British government is showing duplicity
in handling the issue of how guerrillas should surrender their
arms.
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with duplicity from the Northern Ireland Office
on a massive scale," BBC radio quoted Trimble as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the IRA had called the truce because Sinn Fein had been
given to understand by Britain that it would not have to secure
the handover of any IRA arms during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"They (Sinn Fein) interpret it as a guarantee that they
don't have to carry out any decommissioning at all," Trimble
said.

Telecom shares dived 12 cents to 733 cents and were largely

<HEADLINE> Buoyant International Business Fuels Siemens' Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Siemens AG, Germany's largest
electronics and engineering group, today reported
more-than-expected growth in the first nine months of this fiscal
year, thanks exclusively to buoyant international business.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months from October 1, 1996 to September
30, 1997, worldwide orders of Siemens rose by 14 percent to 82.8
billion Duetch marks (about 46.3 billion U.S. dollars) and sales
rose by 10 percent to 71.2 billion marks (about 39.8 billion
dollars). Net income for the period was up three percent to 1.705
billion marks (about 953 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to an interim report released by Siemens on Monday,
the company's growth was generated exclusively by international
business, where orders rose by 23 percent to 55.6 billion marks
(about 31 billion dollars) and sales climbed 18 percent to 46.3
billion marks (about 25.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company's business in Germany, in contrast, edged off
slightly with domestic orders totaling 27.2 billion marks (about
15.2 billion dollars) and sales, 24.9 billion marks (about 13.9
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
International business now accounted for 67 percent of the
total business volume of Siemens, which is celebrating its 150
anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that while communications and
information segments continued to drive growth at Siemens, the
company's medical engineering and transportation systems units
were still in red due to the massive restructuring programs, and
the good earnings of the components segment lay below last year's
figures due to extreme price deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the company's traditional news conference in Berlin
on Monday, Siemens President Heinrich v. Pierer predicted that the
company's orders for the whole year would range from 106 to 108
billion marks (about 59.2 to 60.3 billion dollars), and sales
would hit 100 to 102 billion marks (about 55.9 to 57 billion
dollars), marking the first time they exceeded 100 billion marks
level.
</P>
<P>
On expectations for fiscal 1998, V. Pierer stated: "In contrast
to the current year, we expect a significant rise in net income,
one that will be notably higher than the growth in business
volume."

the situation in Raja Muda, Pikit, Cotabato province, before the
military pulls out from the place.
</P>
<P>
The national government would like to see that civil
authorities take over Raja Muda where there is still some
conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire agreement signed by the government and the MILF
last Friday takes effect today and so far no violation of the
ceasefire has been reported.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the MILF will monitor
the situation if there are any violations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Torres said that the government's anti-kidnapping
operation in central Mindanao will go on despite the ceasefire
because it is "simple enforcement of the law".

<HEADLINE> Top Unionist to Seek Reassurance from Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Reuter) -- Northern Ireland's powerful
pro-British Unionist party leader said today he would seek
reassurances from Prime Minister Tony Blair that the Irish
Republican Army would have to hand over or decommission some
weapons at the start of a substantial negotiation.
</P>
<P>
"Reassurances are very cheap. What counts is what is down in
black and white and what is going to happen," David Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), told local reporters
hours before he met Blair at Downing Street on the new ceasefire
of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The new truce, which took effect at noon Sunday, allows IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein to gain a place in the substantial talks
on Northern Ireland's future.
</P>
<P>
Such reassurances would "have to be underwritten by the Irish
government," a co-sponsor of the negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although UUP is strongly opposed to talks with Sinn Fein,
Trimble suggested that his party would not walk out of the
Belfast peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I said after I came out of Downing Street last Thursday that
we are not of a mind to walk out," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was Trimble's first public comment since the IRA
declared a ceasefire at the weekend in its 28-year war in a
bid to earn Sinn Fein a seat at peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also said the British government is showing duplicity
in handling the issue of how guerrillas should surrender their
arms.
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with duplicity from the Northern Ireland Office
on a massive scale," BBC radio quoted Trimble as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the IRA had called the truce because Sinn Fein had been
given to understand by Britain that it would not have to secure
the handover of any IRA arms during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"They (Sinn Fein) interpret it as a guarantee that they
don't have to carry out any decommissioning at all," Trimble
said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Increases in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade in June
increased by 5.3 percent on a three month moving average basis at
current prices, with the non-oil domestic exports expanding by 4.4
percent after a marginal growth rate of 0.8 percent a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today that on
a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports grew by 8.8 percent
following a decline of one percent in May and an increase of 5.9
percent in April this year.
</P>
<P>
"This was the highest monthly growth rate recorded since May
last year, though partly because June 1996 export figure was below
trend levels", the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
It said that re-exports continued to grow steadily by 7.5
percent on a monthly basis in June this year, due mainly to strong
growth in re-exports of electronic products. Non-oil imports rose
by 2.8 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
With the 4.4 percent expansion, non-oil domestic exports
increased to a level of 7.5 billion Singapore dollars, or about
5.2 billion US dollars, in June this year, as exports to the
European Union and Hong Kong recorded a double digit growth of
11.3 percent and 11.1 percent respectively, the TDB noted.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports grew by one percent in June, partly
because of higher shipments of high speed diesel oil to Hong Kong,
it said, adding that re-exports recorded an increase of 9.2
percent in June on a three month moving average basis, reaching a
level of 6.2 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.3 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In June, imports increased by 4.7 percent to 15.9 billion
Singapore dollars (about 10.97 billion US dollars). The TDB said
that the increases in imports were reflected in imports of
integrated circuits, computer parts and peripherals, disk drives,
and other electronic products.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will take note this morning of
the report by the audit on the public financial deficit of France
this year, which is expected to stand between 3.5 percent and 3.7
percent of the gross domestic product. The government will
announce a series of measures to reduce the deficit in order to
keep on the track toward the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
-- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said in a latest report that immigration does not pose as a
problem for economic recovery and employment. France, whose frontier
control is among the tightest in the world, did not see its
unemployment rate drop while the number of immigrants fell
considerably over the past few years. Britain, which saw massive
inflow of immigrants in recent years, experienced a resumption of
economic growth, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will raise benefit tax on big
enterprises while saving the families from the "euro tax" to be
imposed to meet the Maastricht treaty public deficit criteria of 3
percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The public deficit of
France this year is expected to be around 3.5 percent of the GDP,
or about 30 billion francs (5 billion U.S. dollars), according to
government sources.
</P>
<P>
-- Former Finance Minister Jean Arthuis has denounced the plan
by the Socialist government to raise tax on big enterprises to
reduce public deficit, saying that the Socialists arrived in power
only to "crush the nest egg." Julien Dray, leader of the splinter
Socialist Left party which joins the ruling coalition, also warned
that only asking enterprises to make contributions to the effort
to join the euro could be "dangerous."

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia Pulls out of World Athletics Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Olympic 5,000 meters
champion Wang Junxia has decided to pull out of the 6th World
Athletics Championships starting on August 1 in Athen even if the
IAAF might give her a wild card, an official from the Chinese
Athletics Association said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who won the 5,000 meters gold medal plus a silver for the
10,000 meters last year in Atlanta, was not included on the list
of the 27-member Chinese team which was formed today.
</P>
<P>
"She quit training after the Olympics and took part in no
competitions since last October. We heard that she was bothered by
a constant headache and some other private problems. Her coach
hopes she can come back next year," said Shang Xiutang, Secretary-
general of the CAA.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the 23-year-old world 10,000m record holder
still hates her former coach Ma Junren, who guided her to win the
world 10,000m gold medal at the 1993 World Championships in
Stuttgart. Ma, who helped Qu Yunxia, Liu Dong and Wang win three
golds in Stuttgart, still refuses to give Wang the car she earned
as a gift at the meet.
</P>
<P>
Without Wang, China's best hope for this year's championships
is to win a bronze medal. Huang Zhihong, former Olympic and world
women's shotput winner, Gao Hongmiao, last year's World Cup
women's 10 kilometers walk gold medalist and Ren Xiujuan, who
currently ranks world 9th with a 14.66m performance in the women's
triple jump, are China's medal hopefuls.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Sound Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The financial situation in this
economic center of China was generally good in the first half of
this year, the local branch of the central bank said in a report.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, bank loans increased appropriately,
government treasury bonds were issued smoothly and the level of
financial opening-up was raised, the Shanghai branch of the
People's Bank of China said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that bank deposits increased by 73.3 billion
yuan (about 8.8 billion US dollars) between January and June, 16.1
billion yuan more than during the same period of last year. Bank
loans rose 28.3 billion yuan in the six months, or 2.7 billion
yuan more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show the stock market capitalization in
the city reached 861.2 billion yuan by the end of June, a surge of
57.2 percent from the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Six of the nine overseas banks approved by the central bank to
deal in renminbi yuan on a trial basis in Shanghai's Pudong New
Area officially and successfully launched the new business in the
first six months, which has helped ease the overseas-funded
enterprises' shortage of yuan funds.

<HEADLINE> Senior Company Officials in Sichuan Dismissed for Mismanagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Four senior officials of a major
steel company in Sichuan Province in southwest China were
dismissed for their role in the company's hefty financial loss
during the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the Great Wall Special Steel Corp.,
including former Chairman Liu Lizhong, former General Manager Lu
Yuxing and Zhai Guangyao, former secretary of the company's
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, lost their jobs for
their mismanagement which the caused the company to lose 300
million yuan (about $37.5 million) in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government ordered the individuals be removed
from office. While making investigations in the company, Sichuan
Provincial Governor Song Baorui asked new company executives to
quicken the pace of the reform in reducing the number of redundant
workers and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The heavy deficit makes the company the biggest money-loser
among all state-run enterprises in Sichuan. It has been unable to
pay wages to its 28,000 employees since March.
</P>
<P>
The company, one of ten major special steel producers in
the country, incurred a deficit of 23.97 million yuan last year,
and the downward spiral continued through the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is considering giving preferential
treatment to the company to help get it back on its feet.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Uncover Bomb Factory in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces
have uncovered a bomb-making factory in Beit Sahur near
Bethlehem, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery came as part of a Palestinian investigation into
the death of an Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) activist, who
blew himself up while making a bomb last week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, 30 kilograms of TNT and Israeli army
uniforms were found in the factory. A number of explosives were
connected to timing devices.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police in Bethlehem said it was no doubt that the
discovery would help prevent further terrorist attacks against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The discovery also came under the backdrop of Israel's
increasing pressure on the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to
crack down on terrorism following the arrest of three Palestinian
policemen by Israeli forces last week.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the Palestinian policemen were attempting
to carry out a shooting attack against a Jewish settlement near
the West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli government took advantage of
the incident by accusing the Palestinian police of organizing
riots and terrorist attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli pressure, Palestinian police have arrested
four policemen, including Nablus police Assistant Commander Jihad
Massimi. But Israel further demanded the PNA to arrest Ghazi
Jabali, Commander of Palestinian police in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, who was charged for masterminding the planned attack.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian officials have shrugged off the Israeli
evidence concerning so-called Palestinian police involvement in
terrorism activities.

<HEADLINE> Zimbawe's Ex-Combatants Demand Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The meetings between Zimbabwe's
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)
politburo members and ex-combatants on Sunday throughout the
country's regional centers mostly turned nasty, the daily "The
Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
At all the meetings, ex-combatants accused the ruling party of
abandoning them and demanded that the lump sum payments from the
war victims' compensation fund be resumed without fail.
</P>
<P>
Three ministers addressing the Harare meeting had to be
whisked out of the ZANU-PF headquarters hall through the back
entrance when ex-combatants blocked the exits after invading the
stage where the ministers and other dignitaries were seated.
</P>
<P>
Politburo member and Minister of Defense Moven Mahachi,
Minister of Sport, Recreation and Culture Witness Mangwende and
Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Florence
Chitauro were occasionally shouted down and booed as they tried
to explain reasons for stopping the payments and what the
government and the ruling party had put in place instead.
</P>
<P>
At one point a female ex-combatant dumped her baby into
Chitauro's arms challenging her to feed the baby. She was later
persuaded to take back the child. By that time emotions were
running high, there was a danger of violence.
</P>
<P>
After ensuring that checks which have been held back would be
disbursed today, the three ministers were escorted out through
the back, leaving their cars behind.
</P>
<P>
The story was the same elsewhere in the country. The
ex-combatants, who met delegations headed by politburo members,
were angry and complained the same as their colleagues but kept
their emotions in check although at times they bubbled to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
"This shows a lack of trust between the government and
ex-combatants," said The Herald today in a commentary, adding
"Sometimes the ex-combatants even denounced the war veterans
board and demanded that its leadership be fired."
</P>
<P>
"The sooner a dignified closed-door meeting with the
leadership of the fighters is arranged, the better," concluded
the country's leading newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Booms in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in Shanghai,
China's major economic center, has been developing rapidly in
recent years, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that there were 62,000 private
businesses in Shanghai by the end of May, with the number of
employees reaching more than 657,000. The two figures were 26 and
nearly 13 times the numbers in 1991 respectively.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the statistics shows that the average registered
capital of the private businesses here is 596,000 yuan (about
71,000 US dollars), which was 14.4 times that of 1991 and about 20
percent more than the national average. The total registered
capital volume of the private enterprises surged to 32.1 billion
yuan last year from 290 million yuan in 1992. The output value of
the private sector reached 8.77 billion yuan in 1996, more than
twice the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector of Shanghai has embarked on a path for
sustained and rapid development and has contributed positively to
the city's economic development and social stability," said Gu
Shunren, deputy director-general of the Shanghai Municipal
Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He noted that private businesses in Shanghai turned in 1.2
billion yuan in taxes in 1996, about 4.2 percent of Shanghai's
local fiscal revenue. In some districts and counties, private
enterprises account for more than 30 percent of the revenue.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, whose payroll of 650,000 workers makes up
nearly 10 percent of Shanghai's labor force, has also absorbed
more than 100,000 displaced workers from the state-owned
enterprises. As private businesses are mainly located in the
outskirts, they have also created jobs for some 300,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that Shanghai will take further measures to support and
encourage the growth of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises can buy over, hold a stake in and lease
state-owned enterprises in order to participate in the reform and
restructuring of the state-owned sector, he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN: No Hasty Decision Over Aid to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today ASEAN will not make a hasty
decision on whether it should suspend aid to Cambodia in the wake
of the latest political crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
"If we need to assist them, why not?" he told reporters after
opening a three-day Second ASEAN Congress organized by the
Malaysian Institute of Strategic and International Studies
celebrating 30th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is also ASEAN Standing Committee Chairman, said
the 30-year-old regional grouping would have to consider carefully
whether it should suspend its aid to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, which presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, has been giving
aid to Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar in the form of training and
other technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he would wait for Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas to brief the ASEAN foreign ministers on the outcome of the
meetings with Cambodian head of state King Norodom Sihanouk, First
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, together with his counterparts, Prachuab Chaiyasan of
Thailand and Domingo Siazon of the Philippines, had been
dispatched by ASEAN as special envoys to meet the Cambodian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
On the timing of Cambodia's membership into ASEAN, Abdullah
said, "I have never given any dates." "Some decisions will be
taken in this regard" at the foreign ministers' meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision is still the vision of ASEAN 10," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his keynote address at the congress, Abdullah said
"unfortunately the recent events in Cambodia have forced us to
revise our plans and to defer the admission of Cambodia into the
grouping."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Holds SOM, ASC Meetings in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials
and Standing Committee members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) began their two-day separate meetings here
today to prepare for a ministerial conference scheduled to start
on July 24.
</P>
<P>
They will examine the issues, ranging from political and
security cooperation to economic development in member countries,
to be discussed by their foreign ministers at a two-day meeting,
ASEAN sources said.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda is the admission of new members Laos and
Myanmar on July 23, thus expanding ASEAN membership to include all
the countries in Southeast Asia except Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN had planned to admit all the three countries at the
30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) this week, to realize the
long-cherished dream of its founding fathers that the ASEAN would
one day embrace all nations of Southeast Asia in active
cooperation for regional peace, security and common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was disrupted by factional fighting between the
forces of Cambodian Co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Norodom
Ranariddh on July 5 and 6. At a special foreign ministers meeting
earlier this month, the ASEAN decided to defer Cambodia's
admission because of the fighting, which resulted in the ouster of
First Prime Minister Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the ASEAN to mediate an end to the fighting and
restoration of the coalition government in Cambodia have so far
failed to achieve any results as Hun Sen, who is now in control in
Phnom Penh, refused to accept any outside mediation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas,
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon and Thai Foreign
Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn will report to the ministerial
meeting on their talks with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk in
Beijing, Hun Sen in Phnom Penh and Ranariddh in Bangkok last week.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar are attending the Senior Officials Meeting
(SOM) for the first time, as observers, before their entry into
the regional grouping, which is at present formed by Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, Foreign Minister Ung Huot of Cambodia, which now
enjoys observer status in the ASEAN, is expected to attend the
ASEAN Regional Forum which will follow the ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN meetings come at a time when the organization is
celebrating its 30th founding anniversary and the failure to admit
Cambodia is widely seen as a damper on what otherwise would be a
nice ASEAN party.
</P>
<P>
But ASEAN officials seem to remain upbeat.
</P>
<P>
"The show will go on," ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC) Chairman
and host Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was
quoted by the local press as saying earlier. "The postponement of
Cambodia's pending membership does not make the AMM less
significant."

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China is wasting no time to
construct its national highway network, giving top priority to
building trunk roads which are playing an increasingly significant
role in the country's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of
Communications, by the end of 1996, the country had built 1.18
million km of highway, including over 19,000 km of standard
roadways and 3,400 km of expressways.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 97 percent of towns and townships and 81 percent of
villages in China have highway access.
</P>
<P>
Roads have become one of the most important transportation
routes in the country, handling 88.7 percent of the total
passenger transport and 91 percent of the total cargo shipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, highways account for 51.1 percent and 13.1 percent
of the entire circulation volume of passengers and goods.
</P>
<P>
In the late 80s, the ministry drafted an outline on building
national trunk-road networks, with a designated total length of
around 35,000 km set to link up Beijing, the Chinese capital city,
with all major cities, offering total roadway access to 600
million people.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China plans to complete two north-south cross-country
highways and two east-west cross-country roads as well as three
expressways which, respectively, start at Beijing and end at
Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province in the south, Shenyang City,
capital of Liaoning Province in the northeast, and Shanghai,
China's largest industrial city, in the east.
</P>
<P>
According to the official plan, the country will also build
more highways in poverty-stricken areas to make each
state-classified poor county an access to at least one road to
connect with the national trunks in a move to bolster the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, China will have 1.25 million km of
highways, of which 25,000 km will be high-grade roads, including
over 8,000 expressways.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the program, the bottleneck in the
eastern and coastal regions is expected to be eased, while in the
backward areas, mainly in the west and north, the traffic
conditions will also be improved.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the country's highway network will be extended to 1.35
million km, including 40,000 km of high-class roads.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Goods Market Brisk in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods market
remained brisk in the first half of this year, with supply
basically matching demand and price rises dropping.
</P>
<P>
Ding Junfa, spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Trade, told
a press conference today that the retail sales of consumer goods
reached 1.3 trillion yuan (157.38 billion US dollars) between
January and June, a year-on-year increase of 12.1 percent in real
terms. The sales of capital goods amounted to 1.69 trillion yuan,
a year-on-year rise of 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The commodity retail price rose by 1.8 percent, a drop of 5.3
percentage points from the hike in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The price for resident consumption increased by 4.1 percent, a
drop of 5.1 percentage points from the growth rate of the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of capital goods fell by 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of 609 key commodities shows that the supply and
demand of 545 of the commodities were in a near balance; the
supply of 32 goods fell short of demand, while the supply of other
32 varieties exceeded the needed amount.
</P>
<P>
"The commodity market continues to be a buyer's market," the
spokesman commented.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the proportion of food consumption
continued to fall in the overall expenditure and consumers have
become more choosy and more name-brand conscious.
</P>
<P>
The first half year also saw new progress in building
supermarkets, chain stores, warehouse markets and commodity
distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
Main problems in the commodity market include a large
stockpile of goods valued at three trillion yuan and unfair
competition conditions, Ding pointed out.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Situation Getting Worse in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- AIDS has taken its greatest toll
of victims in sub-Saharan Africa and Kenya has not escaped the
epidemic, according to a special report issued here today by East
African Standard.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Aids situation in Kenya had been
getting worse since the first identified case in 1984, with the
percentage of HIV positive people in the country's population
increasing from 3.5 percent in 1990 to 7.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that by the year 2000, 10 percent of 28
million of Kenya's population will be infected by the virus.
</P>
<P>
The true number of people suffering from Aids can only be
estimated but it is believed that more than 200,000 Kenyans have
developed full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in 1996, 111 Kenyans died of the disease
every day and more than 65,500 cases of AIDS had been reported to
the Ministry of Health since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the virus is enormous socially, economically and
demographically, consequently the HIV/AIDS crisis in the east
African country is far more than a health issue.
</P>
<P>
The special report said that the future development of the
country's economy was directly under threat as a result of the
spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Studies already suggest that an average of 4 percent of
profits are being lost by companies as more than one in seven of
Nairobi's workforce is presently HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that by the year 2000, Kenya's GDP will be
almost 15 percent less than it could have been without the HIV
virus.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the spread of HIV/AIDS, the public health
sector will bear an enormous burden with as much as 50 percent of
all public health expenditure spending on AIDS patients by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, 15 percent of hospital beds were occupied by AIDS
patients whereas the rate is currently estimated at 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> US-made Warship Goes on Auction Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- An old US-made warship will be
sold to the highest bidder tomorrow following a ruling by a local
court in China's largest metropolis Shanghai to auction off the
ship.
</P>
<P>
The landing ship will go on the auction block on the local ship
exchange because its owner, a Shenzhen company, is unable to pay a
Shanghai shipbuilder the cost of updating the ship into a yacht.
</P>
<P>
The ship was first given as a gift to the Kuomintang navy after
it was built in New York in 1942. It had been in the possession of
the People's Liberation Army since 1949, until it was
decommissioned two years ago. It was sold to the Shenzhen company
in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shanghai has entrusted a
local auction firm to handle the auction.

<HEADLINE> Huge BOC Loan to Major TV Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, the nation's
leading foreign exchange bank, has decided to extend 3.8 billion
yuan in loans to the Konka (Group) Co. Ltd., a state-owned major
TV set manufacturer in China.
</P>
<P>
The loans are the biggest the bank has ever extended to Chinese
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Konka, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, will use the
loans to expand its production capacity, increase its domestic and
overseas market shares, and establish its product as an
internationally recognized name brand.
</P>
<P>
The Konka group is a blue chip company listed on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange, and also one of 300 top enterprises enjoying
government support. It earned over five billion yuan from sales
last year.
</P>
<P>
The company produced 2.3 million color TV sets last year,
taking up 13 percent of the domestic market. It is expected to
turn out 3.5 million units this year, and five million by the end
of this century, when its earnings from sales will reach ten
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that more than 65 percent of the domestic
market of color TVs are China-made name brands, including
Changhong, Konka and TCL King.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Ministry of the Electronics Industry predicted
that the domestic sales of color TVs will grow about 20 percent to
20 million units this year.

<HEADLINE> Magurchhara Gas Well Fire Intensifies in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The gas-ignited fire intensified in
Magurchhara Gasfield in northern Bangladesh while the leakage of
gas through "hundreds of points" around the gas well has created
panic in the area, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fire situation deteriorated from Saturday morning during
the preparation work at the New Drilling Pad. A sudden heavy
pressure of gas was observed at the worksite and more new gas
leakage points have developed in the new areas.
</P>
<P>
Occidental Bangladesh Ltd., a United States company which has
been operating at the gas well since the gasfield fire erupted on
June 15, has stopped its work there and remove all men from the
worksite.
</P>
<P>
Occidental officials have also marked an one kilometer area as
"very risky", and warned the people of "serious consequences".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh Railway Saturday suspended all train
services running through the Magurchhara gas well area due to the
sudden intensification of the fire.
</P>
<P>
Drilling of the "relief well" which was scheduled to begin this
week to douse the fire will now be delayed further, said an
official of Occidental, adding that more experts from Singapore
and Canada would come to evaluate the present condition.
</P>
<P>
They are afraid if they proceed with the work, further gas
might come out suddenly from various points that may cause a
severe damage to wealth and life.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement Sunday that the people
should not be afraid of the measures being taken by the Occidental
for the sake of safety in the gasfield area.

<HEADLINE> Russia Drafts Framework for Enterprises Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Economic Ministry has
drafted an framework for enterprises reform in a bid to speed up
the nation's sluggish economic growth, the Interfax news agency
said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, enterprises should first make efforts to
attract investors both from home and abroad, protect the interests
of all shareholders, and divide clearly the responsibilities
between the owners and the managements.
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the Economic Ministry agreed that the slow
speed of reforms in the Russian enterprises is the main obstacle
to the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The specialists said that major problems with the enterprises
are inefficient management, lack of responsibility on the part of
leadership and lack of reliable financial information that are
helpful to their operations.
</P>
<P>
The framework, which has yet to be approved, also raised
concrete demands on enterprises, such as using international
standards to work their bank accounts. Enterprises that meet the
demands contained in the framework would be given priority in
winning government investment, they said.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the government, the specialists added, the
framework would serve as the basis for reform that would transform
unproductive old enterprises into companies fit for the conditions
of market economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
The specialists concluded that under the framework, financial
information in the non-credit-providing sectors should be open to
the public so as to ensure the transparency in the economic
activities of the enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Progress in Missile Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Outlook Magazine
published an article today of senior officers of the Second Artillery
Force (SAF) of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) discussing the
growth and major achievements of China's guided missile force over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The SAF was founded on July 1, 1966 with the approval of the
late Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, and entered a new
period of development in the 1990s. It has developed a
comprehensive training system for simulated missile launches and
exercises by missile troops, improved equipment, and operations
suited to modern warfare, said Yang Guoliang, commander of the SAF.
</P>
<P>
Its logistics departments have helped it keep abreast of arms
and equipment used in modern warfare, engineering, and military
research.
</P>
<P>
It has a strong contingent of military researchers, and
more than 70 percent of the SAF officers are college graduates.
</P>
<P>
The exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea in 1995 and 1996
were a comprehensive test of SAF's combat readiness, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed a limited number of strategic nuclear arms
for the sake of breaking the nuclear monopoly, opposing nuclear
blackmail, containing a possible nuclear attack, and creating a
peaceful environment for China's construction," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the Chinese people and the officers and men
of China's missile force welcome nuclear disarmament and are
opposed to the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear disarmament by the nuclear powers, he pointed out, was
merely a reduction in the number of out-moded models, while the
competition in developing a new generation of nuclear arms
continues.
</P>
<P>
The missile force will follow a road to a bright new world
under the leadership by the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the Central Military Commission headed by Jiang
Zemin, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> One in Three CDs Sold in Singapore Believed to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- About one in three music compact
discs (CDs) sold here in the first six months of this year was
pirated, making for the highest level of piracy in Singapore in
recent years, the Straits Times reported today, citing findings
from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
(IFPI).
</P>
<P>
The findings showed that pirated CD sales now have increased to
about 30 percent of the market, or about 13.8 million US dollars,
from 12 percent of the market, or about 4.6 million US dollars,
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Singapore's music industry is worth more than 69
million US dollars a year in retail sales of CDs and cassettes,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The IFPI, which represents the music industry worldwide, also
found that local pirates were not only copying but also producing
and releasing their own CD albums before the legitimate copyright
owners could do.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are four or five well-organized networks
involved in CD piracy in Singapore, and it believed that three or
four of the eight CD manufacturing plants here are involved in
producing pirated CDs.
</P>

Pirated CDs are sold through more than 100 make-shift stalls
set up outside housing estate shops, trade fairs, and in night and
weekend markets. They are also sold door-to-door in housing
estates, offices, factories, and at local food centers.
</P>
<P>
Last week, one of the biggest syndicates, believed to have
controlled half of the market, was put out of action in a police

<HEADLINE> Sprinters Offer Canada little Hope of World Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's national track and field
championships ended Sunday, showing little signs of glory at next
month's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
None of the competitors reached the world standards for their
events on the three-day meet.
</P>
<P>
Breaking the mold Sunday were Robert Esmie in the men's 200m in
20.78 seconds and Philomenia Marsh in the women's 200m in 23.56.
</P>
<P>
Running against headwinds, Esmie clocked just 0.67 seconds more
than the Canadian national record in his discipline.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200m, Marsh met no competition as she easily run
to her top honour.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gold hope for Canada in Athens, nevertheless, is
pinned on Donovan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
Although dissatisfied with his performance on Saturday with a
10.03-second victory in the 100m, Bailey gave the home crowds the
only hope that Canada might have a place among the major athletic
nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the men's 4x100 meters relay that Canada won in the
Atlanta Olympics, the country's another expectation of a credible
performance comes in the women's 1,500m as Leah Pells clocked in 4
minutes 07.26 seconds, followed by Robyn Meagher in 4:07.68.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian team for the World Championships is expected to be
announced on July 21st.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Continues Shuttle Diplomacy in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pakistani diplomat has
left today for Kandahar, a major city in southern Afghanistan, to
carry forward Pakistan's shuttle diplomacy for peace in
Afghanistan, a Foreign Office official said.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Iftikhar Murshed, additional foreign secretary, to
Kandahar, stronghold of Afghan Islamic Taliban militia, takes
place a few days after Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allaudin
Broujerdi's visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tehran and Islamabad agreed to use their
influence to induce the Taliban and the rival northern alliance to
sit together for a peaceful settlement to the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Murshed held talks with the leadership
of the northern alliance in Mazar-e-Sharif during which all
expressed willingness to enter into political dialogue for moving
towards the realization of peace in the strife-seized country.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif, has put forward
the idea of setting up a joint political commission for a
broad-based government in Afghanistan while the Taliban called for
the unconditional release of their senior officials including
foreign minister Mulla Muhammad Ghous as a confidence-building
measure for talks.

NEW DELHI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN) will
determine the quantity of oil to be imported by India from Iraq
under a barter deal to be supervised by the world body, the Times

</P>
<P>
Asked about the progress on the proposed crude import, Indian

oil from Iraq against exports of 1,000 tons of black tea to
Baghdad under an "oil-for-food" program.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Trade Fair in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Sri Lankan companies will
participate in a three-day trade and industrial fair in Yokohama,
Japan, this week organized by the National Chamber of Industries
in collaboration with the Japanese Yokohama Industrial
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the fair scheduled for July 22-24 is to
exhibit to potential buyers the high-quality exportable products
manufactured by Sri Lanka for a rapid expansion of trade to Japan,
according to Trade Ministry sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Among the items on display are leather goods, rubber goods,
fiber goods, tea, textiles, gems and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The fair is expected to attract potential investors by
informing them of the advantages of investing in Sri Lanka, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair was decided upon following the changing
attitudes of Japanese investors favorably towards Sri Lanka,
particularly in areas where the Sri Lankan participants are
engaged in, they added.
</P>
<P>
The value of Sri Lanka's imports from Japan in 1996 was 465.8
million U.S. dollars while Sri Lanka's exports to Japan stood at
238.5 million U.S. dollars, leaving the trade balance largely in
favor of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Poland Suffers Heavy Losses in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The severe flooding this summer,
preceded by the bitter cold last winter, is sure to bring down
Poland's agricultural produce this year, experts have said.
</P>
<P>
The traditionally farming nation in East Europe is expected to
lose about 1 million metric tons of grains in the year, experts
were quoted as saying by latest newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the output of rapeseed, which is an essential raw
material for the country's production of cooking oil, may be down
to the historic low due to an expected loss of 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The past cold winter killed 450,000 hectares of crops, and
recent floodings inundated 8,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate Poland will harvest 23.8-24.3 million tons of
grains this year, or about 1 million tons less than last year,
making it the second year in a row for lower grain output.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Poland lost 900,000 tons of grains.
</P>
<P>
In rapeseed production, half of the rape died early this year
in the coldness hitting the provinces of Opole, Walbrzych and
Wroclaw, which produce most of the country's rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated harvest of 300,000 tons of rapeseed this
year, Poland is likely to import 600,000 tons to meet the domestic
demands for cooking oil, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Currency of Taka Devalued Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi currency of taka has
been devalued by 45 poisha against the U.S. dollar with effect
from today, according to local banking sources.
</P>
<P>
With the fresh devaluation, the fourth in this calendar year,
the Bangladesh Bank's buying rate for one dollar from the banks is
now 44 taka instead of the earlier rate 43.55. The selling rate is
now 44.20 instead of 43.75 taka earlier.
</P>
<P>
An official of the central bank said that the dollar was going
strong in the last few weeks which demanded downward adjustment of
the taka.
</P>
<P>
He also said exports which had been declining in recent months
also needed a boost, calling for a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the market had been expecting a devaluation in the
wake of falling foreign exchange reserve, current account deficit
and fall in exports, said a market analyst.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of inflation
plunged to a 52-week low of 4.7 percent for the week ended July 5
from 5.9 percent in the previous week, The Times of India reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This sharp decline, which came as expected, was mainly because
the direct effect of last July's petroleum price hike on inflation
has been worn off.
</P>
<P>
The inflation during the corresponding week last year was above
the five percent mark at 5.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official wholesale price index (WPI) for "all commodities"
rose 0.2 percent to 325.0 during the week under review as against

<HEADLINE> Thai Tapioca Exports to EU to Drop Due to Pig Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Thai tapioca to the
European Union (EU) this year will be lower than last year as a
result of an epidemic which has killed more than five million pigs
in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is the largest EU tapioca pellet importer from
Thailand. Tapioca is imported for animal feed raw material.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's tapioca exports to the EU this year will fall short
of the 3.5 million ton target, compared to 4 million tons last
year, according to Boonchai Srichaiyongphanich, president of the
Thai Tapioca Trade Association.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the depreciation of the German currency has
automatically driven up the price of tapioca from Thailand, making
it more expensive than other cereals sold in the EU. Users have
shifted to buy cheaper raw materials such as maize and have
reduced purchases of the Thai product.
</P>
<P>
The lower demand for tapioca will add to the overall decline in
Thailand's exports for the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Boonchai said tapioca exports to the EU in the near future will
not recover if the government does not help cassava planters to
reduce production costs and increase productivity, adding that
export policy should be streamlined to reduce operating costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and New Zealand will hold
a forum on eco-tourism in Bangkok on Friday this week.
</P>
<P>
The forum is aimed at encouraging ideas and exchanging
practical experience and presenting ways in which some common
problems are overcome in eco-tourism and adventure operations.
</P>
<P>
Both Thailand and New Zealand face challenges in waste water
treatment, rubbish disposal in national parks, implementing and
maintaining safety standards in adventure tourism, and encouraging
new tourism products that are ecologically friendly.
</P>
<P>
In recently years, there has been a growing demand from
Thailand's traditional markets -- Europe and North America -- for
a genuine holiday experience that brings visitors closer to the
natural environment and local lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
While this demand is creating a growing market for eco and
adventure tourism products, it also brings about concern on the
increasing problems and preservation of tourism products for
future generations.

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Sustained high temperatures and
drought are devastating a large span of farm land in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The land already affected, according to press reports here
today, had amounted to hundreds of thousand of hectares by July 19.
</P>
<P>
The high temperatures and drought came together in June, and
continued into this month, which otherwise should have marked the
beginning of the rainy season in the country.
</P>
<P>
Recent days have seen temperatures hovering around 35 degrees
Celsius in some parts of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
While the maize on the crop land is in the ear and therefore
hungry for water, low water levels are recorded at rivers and
reservoirs due to excessive sunshine and little rainfall.
</P>
<P>
People across the country, which was hit by severe floodings in
the past two years, are answering to the government's calls to
mobilize against the drought, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants to See Strong, Resilient ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi here today called for a new and better
Southeast Asia by the year 2020 that is strong and resilient in
all fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"We must aim for a new and better Southeast Asia by the year
2020. It must be a Southeast Asia that is strong and resilient in
all the political, economic, social and security fundamentals. It
must be a Southeast Asia that has human welfare in all its
comprehensiveness at the heart of its concerns. It must be a
Southeast Asia that is able to share pride of place and work in
mutual respect and cooperation with all the major centers of power
in the world," he said when opening the Second ASEAN Congress
here.
</P>
<P>
The three-day congress is organized by the Institute of
Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) as part of ASEAN's 30th
anniversary which falls on August 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 government officials and experts from ASEAN members --
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam -- and from Laos and Cambodia, are participating in
the congress.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, Abdullah, who is also the ASEAN
Standing Committee Chairman, outlined five achievements of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) during its 30 years'
existence and five challenges in the immediate years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Among the achievements, he said the most important is the
restoration and enhancement of mutual understanding, confidence
and trust among the member-states to replace the climate of
suspicion and mistrust that prevailed among them.
</P>
<P>
The institution of norms of acceptable conduct and behavior
among its members as enshrined in the various ASEAN instruments is
ASEAN's another great achievement.
</P>
<P>
He counted ASEAN's ability to keep its region out of major
power conflict as another of its significant achievement.
</P>
<P>
The fourth accomplishment of ASEAN, he said, would be the
emphasis on comprehensive cooperation, in particular economic and
functional cooperation, as the bedrock of ASEAN collaboration.
</P>
<P>
He said the fifth achievement would be ASEAN's emergence as a
regional grouping of significant political consequence in the
larger international arena.
</P>
<P>
On challenges, Abdullah said the first and for the moment the
most urgent would be to realize the vision of all of Southeast
Asia united in common purpose under ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said one of the challenges ahead of ASEAN would be the
challenge of maintaining cohesion and preserving consensus as the
ASEAN membership is nearly doubled in the short span of just two
or three years.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's continued viability, empowerment and standing in the
international arena will also be very much a function of how
economically vibrant and healthy it continues to be as it expands.
Poor countries and groupings of the poor are neither heard nor
heeded. ASEAN's third challenge resides here, he said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth challenge, he said, would be the challenge of
"fostering a truly stable and peaceful Southeast Asia".
</P>
<P>
And he considered the fifth challenge as the most daunting yet
the most rewarding, that is, "the challenge of raising the quality
of our lives, materially as well as spiritually".
</P>
<P>
Abdullah called on all ASEAN members to strengthen peace and
stability within their borders, saying "this peace and stability
cannot be of the brittle variety enforced by the power of the
gun."
</P>
<P>
It must be a peace and stability that is sustainable and
durable, built on good governance, satisfaction of the people's
legitimate needs and fulfillment of their legitimate aspiration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We look to a Southeast Asia that has resolved all
territorial disputes and all border politics by the year 2020."

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Sugar Exports to Fall for Lack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sugar exports in the
1997/1998 production year are expected to decrease for lack of
rain.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar exports for 1997/1998 would be reduced to
3.5 million tons, from 4.2 million tons of this year (1996/ 1997).
In the previous year, the exports were 4.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged dry season will reduce Thailand's sugar output in
1997/1998 to between 4.7 and 4.9 million tons, against the 5.8
million ton target.
</P>
<P>
Of all the sugarcane plantations, only 15 percent are located
in irrigated areas, according to a state-run sugar company
official.
</P>
<P>
However, if there is sufficient rain in August and September,
Thailand can still maintain its position as the world's fourth
largest sugar exporter, after Brazil, the European union and
Australia, according to Surat Abhikleophan, marketing chief of the
Thai Cane and Sugar Corp.

<HEADLINE> PICC Looks to Expand Insurance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Co (Group)
of China is seeking to expand its business in the coming months to
maintain its lead in the domestic market, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Although the group controls more than 70 percent of the market,
its president Ma Yongwei said "we still want more."
</P>
<P>
Only through business expansion, he said, can the group enhance
its power and solve its problems.
</P>
<P>
He urged company officials to sharpen their sense of
competition and watch market fluctuations closely.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the company will develop new insurance products and
improve its quality of service to satisfy customers.
</P>
<P>
As the country's largest insurance underwriter, the group
enjoyed satisfactory performance in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The group's premium income by the end of last month rose 40
percent to hit 42.8 billion yuan (5.2 billion US dollars),
accounting for 56.3 percent of the group's annual targeted volume.
</P>
<P>
The premium income from property insurance rose 9.4 percent to
21 billion yuan while that from life insurance increased 107.5
percent to 18.14 billion yuan and reinsurance income amounted to
3.68 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The product structure of the group also improved as the premium
income from motor insurance, enterprise and family property
insurance took large proportion in the group's total property
insurance premium income.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that PICC Group will take effective measures in the
second half of this year to prevent and erase risks in its
business operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the group will strive to perfect its risk management
system, enhancing risk evaluation and improving its management on
compensation.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the group paid 16.7 billion
yuan in compensation to victims of air crashes, explosions, and
floods.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the group will also improve its management of insurance
agents who brought 4.1 billion yuan of income for the group in the
January-June period.
</P>
<P>
And the group's internal supervision system will be improved
and more attention will be paid to the auditing, added the PICC
president.

<HEADLINE> Railway Happy with Hefty Rise in Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's railway industry has
achieved a noteworthy growth in profit since a national
operational scheme to raise train speed was launched in April,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the growth was accompanied by a 6.2 percent
decrease in passenger flow in the past three months. During the
same period, the number of passenger trains decreased by 120
pairs, or 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1, train speed on three major lines -
Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Harbin - has been
increased to maximum of 140 kilometers per hour, and trains on
other lines to a maximum of 120 kilometers per hour, both up from
about 100 kilometers per hour. Ticket prices remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four direct express trains and "overnight trains" have
been opened, linking rail hubs within 1,000-1,500 kilometers of
one another, and many low-speed and short-distance trains have
been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, railway transport has been on a
steady rise. A sharp rise in passengers on direct express trains
and "overnight trains" is partly responsible for the growth in
profits.
</P>
<P>
The opening of 703 shuttle cargo trains, which had not existed
in China before, has also been highly welcomed, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Electronics Industry Rises in Output, Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China's electronics industry
scored a 20.9 percent increase in production during the first six
months of this year, with its value-added output hitting a record
3.2 billion US dollars, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Liu Jianfeng, vice-minister of Electronics
Industry as saying that industry profits also racked up a parallel
development, totalling 536 million US dollars during January-June,
up 21.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted strong market demand has sparked electronics
factories to gear up production. He warned duplication of the same
electronic projects has also become rampant nationwide, especially
in TV and video compact disc (VCD) manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months the ministry will use administrative
means to rein in the development of new projects in an attempt to
avoid "blind expansion" of the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to strengthen its manufacturing technology
appraisal for new projects. It will also strictly control issuing
production licences to factories which apply for electronics
production.
</P>
<P>
Factories were urged to seek survival through branching into
international markets, and stop suicide behavior as slashing their
retail prices, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Ankara Upset at Being Left Out of EU Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has recently lashed out at
the European Commission's decision to prepare for EU membership
for five Central and Eastern European countries and Cyprus but not
to include Turkey on the list of potential members, it was learned
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities reportedly condemned Cyprus's inclusion
on the first wave list, stressing that the island state's
membership before a solution to the partition issue is found "out
of the question."
</P>
<P>
Bulent Ecevit, Turkey's deputy prime minister, even went so far
as to threaten that should this come to pass, Turkey would embark
on a process of "partial integration" with the Turkish-speaking
northern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In the Agenda 2000 document on future EU enlargements, the
Commission confined itself to pointing out that Turkey is still
eligible as a candidate but its current political situation allows
no plans for the time being to alter the negative opinion the
Commission gave on its 1989 bid for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, described the decision by
the EU's executive body as negative and held out hope that the EU
Council of Ministers would "correct" the decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that EU membership would continue to be a high-priority
concern for Turkey, according to a spokesman for the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
However, in the section on Turkey in its Agenda 2000 document,
the Commission says that the start up of the EU-Turkey Customs
Union, on December 31 of 1995, was a "major step forward in
relations between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is advised by the Commission to improve its tax
collection system, restructure and privatize public companies,
reform its social security system and rethink its public
expenditure.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
recently given the go-ahead for a Finnish company to market
throughout the EU a test kit containing a genetically-modified
micro-organism, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The test kit, which was notified by dairy group Valio Oy, will
allow rapid detection of antibiotic residues in milk.
</P>
<P>
The labels on each test kit will clearly indicate that they
contain a genetically-modified organism, streptococcus
thermophilus T102.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's decision follows a favorable opinion by
qualified majority from the Regulatory Committee set up under an
EU directive on deliberate release into the environment of
genetically-modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
The marketing authorization for the test kit to be issued by
the relevant Finnish regulatory body will allow the product to be
used in dairy laboratories and milk-collecting vehicles in order
to detect any antibiotic residues in milk as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Nations Slash Australia Over Secret Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Pacific nations criticized
Australia for a scathing report about them, the Solomon Islands'
government said today.
</P>
<P>
The Solomons received some of the worst criticism in the
report.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Solomons is facing economic collapse and
that one senior political figure there had a reputation for
corrupt dealings and was known in local business circles as "Mr
Ten Per Cent".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Solomons Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni said
while some of the criticisms may be valid, Australia should have
addressed them through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
"They should say 'look, we know things aren't going well. It
doesn't look good, can we help'," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The confidential report was prepared jointly by Australia's
Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a
briefing for Treasurer Peter Costello for a summit of economic
ministers from the 16-member South Pacific Forum a week ago in
Cairns, North Queensland of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The document was left on a table in a public area at the
meeting, where it was obtained by the Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
The report also severely criticized New Zealand, Nauru and Cook
Islands.
</P>
<P>
Nauruan President Kinza Clodumar said on Saturday that he
regretted that Australian ministers were being "so badly and
inaccurately advised by their officials".
</P>
<P>
Cook Islands' Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry, dismissed as vain
and boastful in the briefing paper, said that it was unfair and
untrue to claim his country as being mismanaged.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who was
described by the paper as an opportunist, has downplayed the report
as merely the opinion of an ignorant bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has moved quickly
into damage control. In a television appearance on Saturday night,
Downer said that the report "did not represent government policy".
</P>
<P>
Australia's Acting Opposition Leader Gareth Evans has asked
Australia to apologize for the report.

<HEADLINE> Court Adjourns Libel Case Against Mubarak's Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A court in the Egyptian capital of
Cairo today agreed to adjourn until Sunday the hearings into a
libel suit filed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's sons
against a Saudi magazine.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the request of the defense attorneys,
the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Three Egyptians and three Saudis, including the magazine
owner, were charged on July 12 with the publication of a
slanderous story about the two plaintiffs, Alaa and Gamal Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The six face sentences of a maximum of three years in prison
each, and a fine for "defamation and attacking (Mubarak) family
honor."
</P>
<P>
The defendants had admitted wrongdoings and said they only
meant to promote the nascent magazine.
</P>
<P>
Ashraq Al Awsat daily, part of the Saudi publishing group of
the same name, advertised on May 27 for its sister weekly Al
Jadida containing an article implicating Mubarak's sons in
illegal business dealings.
</P>
<P>
Only Sayed Abdel-Atti, author of the article, lives in Egypt
while the others are in London, Britain, and Saudi Arabia and
will be tried in absentia, prosecution sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's sons sued the London-based daily for publishing
"lying articles and allegations about transactions, commissions
and illusionary monopolies with a premeditated aim of inflicting
severe harm and slander" on Egypt's first family.
</P>
<P>
The advertised article never appeared, and two of the weekly's
editors were sacked.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
supreme commander of the armed forces, has issued an order to
increase the salaries of recruits by 15 percent as of July 1, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh time Mubarak issued an order to raise the
salaries of recruits.
</P>
<P>
The MENA, when announcing the news, said the Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces is "keen to provide a decent life for the
fighting soldier during the period of his compulsory service in
the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
"It also reflects the interest of the supreme commander in the
social state and services provided for recruits and their
families," it said.
</P>
<P>
A combined system of voluntary and compulsory military services
is applied in Egypt, a country boasting 500,000-strong armed
forces. Compulsory servicemen on a three-year stint get paid
300-450 Egyptian pounds (88.2-132.4 U.S. dollars) currently per
month.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Minerals Output Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe recorded a decline in its
output levels of most base minerals from major mines during the
first quarter of this year compared to the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Finhold's Economic Review today attributed the decline to slow
recovery in commodity prices on international markets as a result
of the over-supply, accompanied by depressed demand.
</P>
<P>
The minerals are gold, coal, chrome-ore, low-carbon
ferrochrome, high-carbon ferrochrome and ferrosilicon.
</P>
<P>
The continued increase in production costs also resulted in
gradual scaling down of operations at some small, high cost and
low output mines, with some groups selling off the loss-making
ones and concentrating on large mines, Finhold said.
</P>
<P>
Gold output from major mines continued to decline during the
first five months of this year, recording a total of 9,812
kilograms valued at 111 million U.S. Dollars compared to 114
million Dollars during the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Coal output fell by 8.6 percent to 1.2 million tons in the
first quarter of this year, copper declined 23.8 percent, chrome
dropped slightly by 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, growth was registered in the production of nickel,
asbestos and iron-ore.

<HEADLINE> Report on S. Leone Soldiers Surrendering to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The military junta of Sierra
Leone today denied that 485 soldiers and rebel RUF fighters have
surrendered to ECOMOG bases in the capital as reported by a
newspaper "Tablet" here.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the soldiers gave themselves up
after last weekend's clashes in Jui, 17 miles east of the capital
between Sierra Leone's soldiers and Nigerian troops.
</P>
<P>
The junta's statement broadcast over the state radio said,
"the entire armed forces and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
continue to demonstrate their loyalty to the (military)
government."
</P>
<P>
It described the newspaper's claim as "a blatant act of
propaganda and the work of unpatriotic persons parading as
journalists to create panic and fear in the minds of the people".
</P>
<P>
The statement observed that the newspaper "is unregistered and
operating contrary to the rules and regulation governing
newspaper registration" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement broadcast over a clandestine
pro-democracy radio said today that "some patriotic rebel
fighters and Sierra Leone soldiers are being prevented from
surrendering to ECOMOG bases by hard-core junta and RUF members."
</P>
<P>
Ousted President Tejan Kabbah said last week over the same
radio that soldiers should defect to the ECOMOG bases if they
don't want to be branded as mutineers.
</P>
<P>
According to the clandestine radio, "soldiers who wanted to
defect are threatened with death and told they will be killed by
ECOMOG troops if they give themselves up to the ECOMOG."

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Officials Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy met here today with senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil
Shaath to discuss confidence-building measures to narrow the
differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour meeting was held under the auspices of the
European Union (EU) peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos, who has
been working hard to break the deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli's accusation of Palestinian police's involvement in
anti-Israeli extremism dominated today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Israeli security forces arrested three Palestinian
policemen, who were charged with attempting to carry out a
shooting attack against a Jewish settlement near the West Bank
city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Levy presented Israel's evidence on the alleged Palestinian
police's involvement in the attempted shooting, and demanded the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to take actions instead of
words to uproot Palestinian militant activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Levy said Israel
would be ready to reciprocate by advancing the peace process on
the following proposals: implementing the peace agreements by the
PNA by undertaking to prevent violence, incitement and extremism
against Israel; removing factors which undermine the Israel's
security such as the latest incident of police involvement; and
proceeding towards the final-status talks and even perhaps
speeding up the process.
</P>
<P>
Levy added he was pleased with the response from Shaath, who
promised that the PNA would take actions to prevent militant
actions.
</P>
<P>
But Shaath pointed out that the evidence was not conclusive
in Israel's allegation about Palestinian police's involvement in
anti-Israeli moves. He said no pretext should be used to derail
the efforts by both sides to break the peace impasse and create
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the PNA wanted to move ahead the final-status
talks, but it also wanted the Israeli government to make
concessions on settlement activities and refrain from taking
unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiator added that, under the Egyptian
initiative, the two sides were working closely to try to create
mutual confidence-building measures, such as opening safe
passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, releasing
Palestinian detainees, and continuing the building of a Gaza
airport and seaport.
</P>
<P>
"These are measures that we can hopefully do (for) the expected
security coordination and (that we) attempt to break the impasse
(so) that we can go back to the main problems that have created
this crisis," Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos voiced optimism about the prospect of advancing the
peace process as the two sides began narrowing their differences
on the issues of security cooperation, improving Palestinian
economy and other confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the result of Moratinos' intensive
efforts to arrange a meeting between Levy and PNA President
Yasser Arafat Tuesday in Brussels of Belgium during the EU
foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Levy is already scheduled to attend the gathering, where
Arafat has yet announced his intention to make the trip. If Levy
and Arafat meet, this will be their second meeting sponsored by
the EU since the first one in Malta on April 15 at the
European-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers' Conference.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he would be happy to meet Arafat if the latter
decided to go. He also appealed to the Arab world to cease what
he called "a diplomatic war" against Israel and to change the
climate into one of peace among the Arab public.
</P>
<P>
The Levy-Shaath meeting was held amid rumors that the United
States intended to launch a new round of diplomatic offensive to
break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Vows to Wipe out Man-eating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
today vowed to continue fighting hand in hand with Mkuranga
district residents in Coast region in an effort to wipe out
man-eating lions to save the people from further killings.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia Meghji told
Mkuranga residents at separate meetings with Mbezi and Mkuranga
villagers when she went to console relatives of the deceased
killed by the beasts, that the government has sent enough
ammunition and rangers to combat the lions.
</P>
<P>
She thanked the leaders in the community for sending scouts to
take part in the operation. Six scouts armed with guns and
powerful light have camped at Mbezi village to help search for
the beasts, she added.
</P>
<P>
The man-eater lions have claimed 17 lives of people, injured
11, and villagers have managed to kill 18 lions since February
this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged government assistance of 50,000 Tanzania
Shillings (about 83 U.S. Dollars) to relatives of the deceased on
every member of the family killed, and the money would be
channeled through Mkuranga district commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Zakia Meghji also expressed condolences sent to them by
President Benjamin Mkapa and Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye to
the family members who had their relatives eaten by the beasts.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, a score of lions invaded Mkuranga
districts at the end of last year from Seleous Game Reserve in
search of water and have settled down in the district.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali today
expressed their strong desire to strengthen the Palestine-Jordan
ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after their talks in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, the two leaders said that their
discussions focused primarily on further developing economic
cooperation between the two sides, according to a report of JMCC,
a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came at a time when relations between Jordan and
Israel remain further cooled off. The signing of a memorandum of
understanding on the joint Jordanian-Israeli airport project at
Aqaba, which was scheduled for today, has been delayed, reported
the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Transport Minister, Yitzhak Levy, was due to have
met with his Jordanian counterpart to sign the document in
the Red Sea port city today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, an Israeli civil aviation delegation will hold
further talks with the Jordanians in Aqaba Tuesday. The dispute
reportedly rests primarily with security-related issues.
</P>
<P>
It appears that Israel is far from being happy over the
Jordanian handling of the Naharayim case. A military court
sentenced the Jordanian soldier who killed seven Israeli girls to
life in prison, short of a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, Ahmed Daqamsa, 26, was charged with the
premeditated murder of the girls, who were shot to death during an
outing in Naharayim on the Jordan River.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP), the biggest black Opposition party in South Africa, has
claimed it is destined to lead the struggle for economic
prosperity and emancipation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The claim was made at an IFP's annual general conference,
which ended in Ulundi, Kwazulu Natal Province, today after three
days of deliberation, which saw the election of Zakhele Khumalo
as the party's new general secretary.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the IFP leaders said South Africa needs a
strong, principled and honest government which plans to move
speedily toward prosperity. Only the IFP's contribution could
provide this, it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The conference said South Africa has achieved political
freedom but not true liberation and democracy, which would be
scored when the majority enjoy a dignified life free from need
and want.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling party (African National Congress) is paralyzed by
indecision, ambivalence and lack of vision and is jeopardizing
the goals of the struggle.
</P>
<P>
"Only the IFP, with its political, economic and social vision
of federalism, pluralism, market economy and family values, is
destined to lead the struggle for economic prosperity and
emancipation," the party noted.
</P>
<P>
Sources closed to the meeting said the IFP leaders were trying
to focus on restructuring the party to prepare for the 1999
general elections.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political preparation, the sources said, the
IFP was making efforts to raise money for the participation of
the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Joe Matthews, Deputy Safety and Security Minister and IFP
National Council member, said the IFP would need almost 100
million Rand (22 million U.S. Dollars) to fund its election
campaign.

NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- With flags hoisted at half-mast, a
memorial service was held here today to mark the 23rd anniversary
of the Turkish occupation of part of Cyprus since 1974.

The memorial service was led this morning by the Primate of
the Church of Cyprus Archbishop Chrysostomos in memory of all who
lost their lives during the invasion.
</P>
<P>
The service was attended by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides,

July 20, 1974, and seized the northern third of the island
following a coup five days earlier, engineered by the military
junta ruling Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any solution to the Cyprus problem should not
allow repetition of what happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the service, Cypriot Minister of Finance
Christodoulos Christodoulou stressed the need for unity among
Greek Cypriots and cooperation with the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people of Cyprus to look to the future
with optimism.
</P>

Meanwhile, various activities were organized today to condemn
the Turkish invasion and continuing occupation of part of the
island.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro ended his official visit to Saudi Arabia today,
during which he held talks with Saudi leaders on regional
issues as well as bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro, accompanied by a high-level delegation, arrived in
Saudi Arabia Saturday on a two-day state visit, the first by an
Italian president in 23 years, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in Jeddah, Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz
and Scalfaro discussed means of boosting economic, trade and
investment cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Italian embassy sources in Saudi Arabia as
saying that the two countries have agreed to hold wide range
talks in the future on issues discussed by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Italy signed last September a cooperation and
investment protection agreement which also bans dual taxation.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Italy in 1995
amounted to 3.2 billion U.S. dollars with 747 million dollars in
Saudi favor, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also been linked by a security pact
since December 1995, which calls for joint cooperation in
combating organized crimes, drugs and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Scalfaro and King Fahd
expressed fear that collapse of the peace process would threaten
the region's security, stability and peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro underlined his country and the European Union's
interest in reactivating the peace process, saying that
Israeli settlements in the occupied lands were illegal and
created an obstacle to the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro and King Fahd also discussed the situation in the
Gulf area, stressing the necessity of Iraq's implementation of
U.N. resolutions relevant to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
They expressed content for the renewal of oil-for-food
agreement between Iraq and the U.N., which allows Iraq to export
2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food
and medicines for the Iraqi people hit hard by U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated that lifting the sanctions on Iraq
depended on its compliance with the U.N. resolutions.

construction of a new national theater there.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Atte, general manager of the current national theater in
the former capital Lagos, said here today a proposal has already
been presented to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
A plot, covering an area of 22,629 hectares or 226,289 square
meters, has been given for the new national theater, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the one in Lagos, the proposed theater in Abuja is
locally designed to blend with the rocky hills of Zuma and Aso
Rocks, both famous tourist attractions in Abuja and its environs,
and to take the shape of a military beret cap, the general
manager said.
</P>
<P>
The current national theater was designed by Bulgaria and
looks like a military/police cap. The single-building complex is
one of the most modern structure in this economic center of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proposed theater is to be in four buildings for
easy administration and maintenance and will be much smaller.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the design has also taken into consideration the
peculiarities of th country's various cultural domains and
special requirements.
</P>
<P>
The multi-functional theater will also be used for
conferences, musical concerts, drama, dances, meetings, fashion
and film shows, beauty pageants, exhibitions, important national
and international events, as well as other social and cultural
activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Turkish PM Rebuffs CIA Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Turkish Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller categorically rejected today the accusations that she had
been working as an agent for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by her True Path Party (DYP),
which said that it was unreasonable and illogical attempting to
defame the reputation of Ciller, also current DYP chairman, adding
the accusations aimed to serve some politicians' personal
interests.
</P>
<P>
Workers' Party Chairman Dogu Perincek initially accused Ciller
of working for the CIA against Turkey, and then the general staff
of the Turkish Armed Forces ordered a probe into the alleged case
last week.
</P>
<P>
The DYP statement also criticized Turkey's media organizations
for helping fuel the accusations, saying they were taking a
revenge on Ciller, who served as Turkey's first woman prime
minister from 1993-96.
</P>
<P>
She was also deputy prime minister and foreign minister in the
coalition government of Necmettin Erbakan which resigned in June
18.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that a deputy from the ruling
Motherland Party (ANAP) had earlier filed an spy case against
Ciller in a U.S. court in order to clarify what is termed as her
U.S. citizenship and assets issues in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
After the U.S. court, however, refused to accept and hear the
case, the ANAP deputy claimed that Washington was "protecting
Ciller."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicolas Burns reportedly
denied earlier that the U.S. intelligence hired Ciller to work
against the national interests of Turkey, describing such
accusations as "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
Since the resignation of Erbakan's government, there have been
rumors here that the new government led by Mesut Yilmaz will
launch a judicial offensive against the well-known woman
politician.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has long been accused of involvement in corruption
scandals, and her husband, a businessman, was said to have links
with mafia activities.
</P>
<P>
The military and opposition parties are greatly dissatisfied
with Ciller because her cooperation with the Welfare Party (RP)
led by Erbakan, who was vehmently attacked for the rapid growth
of fundamentalist tendency in Turkey during his nearly one-year
term of office.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Marks 23rd Anniversary of Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- With flags hoisted at half-mast, a
memorial service was held here today to mark the 23rd anniversary
of the Turkish occupation of part of Cyprus since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The memorial service was led this morning by the Primate of
the Church of Cyprus Archbishop Chrysostomos in memory of all who
lost their lives during the invasion.
</P>
<P>
The service was attended by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides,
other government officials, and political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the memorial service, Clerides
said that today is a day of remembrance of those who gave their
lives for the freedom of the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops landed on this eastern Mediterranean island on
July 20, 1974, and seized the northern third of the island
following a coup five days earlier, engineered by the military
junta ruling Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any solution to the Cyprus problem should not
allow repetition of what happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the service, Cypriot Minister of Finance
Christodoulos Christodoulou stressed the need for unity among
Greek Cypriots and cooperation with the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people of Cyprus to look to the future
with optimism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who as
Turkish premier in 1974 ordered the invasion of the island, said
today that Turkey would speed up its partial intergration
process with northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in the northern sector of Nicosia to
celebrate the 23th anniversary of the landing on the island of
Cyprus of the Turkish troops, Ecevit said that Turkey made the
decision in order to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey would continue its political, economic
and military support for the Turkish Cypriots living in the
north of the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also complained that the
international community had long ignored the Turkish Cypriots,
stressing that no peace and stability could be achieved unless
Turkish Cypriots' freedom and rights were respected.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus island was divided into northern and southern
parts after the Turkish troops landed on it in 1974 in a
bid to smash a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been making efforts for years in
an effort to make peace between the Greek and Turkish
communities, but no concrete results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Outcome of Liberian Polls Yet to Come out: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Liberian politicians and electoral
authorities today gave no hint of the outcome of the crucial
</P>
<P>
Rather than announcing the expected first results, most radio
stations in the capital Monrovia played religious music, while
many Monrovians prepared to attend church services, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The two front-running parties contesting the polls, the
National Patriotic Party of former warlord Charles Taylor and the
Unity Party of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, preferred to remain
discreet when questioned about the probable outcome of the polls.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Electoral Commission (IECOM) said it would
deal firmly with anyone releasing results before its approval.
</P>
<P>
IECOM is not expected to announce the final results of the
polls contested by 13 parties before Wednesday, July 23.
</P>
<P>
The election on Saturday proceeded peacefully and orderly with
an exceptionally large turnout of voters, many of whom got up
before dawn to queue and cast their votes for the first time
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Among Liberia's estimated 2.6 million people, more than
710,000 were registered as voters.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are high that the election will lead to final peace in
Liberia after seven years of civil war that has devastated the
country and killed over 150,000 people, displacing many more
people.
</P>
<P>
The hefty turnout showed Liberians' overwhelming yearning for
demoractic transition and peace.
</P>
<P>
"This is the day everybody has been waiting for," a report
quoted Archbishop Michael Francis as saying in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
IECOM officials began counting as soon as polls ended at
around 4 p.m. local time on Saturday in the presence of party
agents, international observers and soldiers of the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
If no presidential candidate wins more than 50 percent of
votes cast on Saturday#,a second round of voting will be held on
August 2, to decide who will be the last winner as president.
</P>
<P>
Liberia celebrates its 150th birthday on July 26. Freed
American slaves founded it as Africa's first modern republic.
</P>
<P>
The election will also produce a parliament of 90 members,
including 26 senators and 64 representatives, whose seats will be
allocated by proportional representation.

<HEADLINE> EU Sends Formal Warning to Bonn on Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
recently decided to send a formal warning letter to the Bonn
government over subsidies paid out to a number of German coal
mining companies, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive body asked the German
authorities in the letter either to justify the aid payments,
which appear to be having a distortive effect on the EU market,
especially for anthracite, or to explain how they intend to remedy
the situation.
</P>
<P>
This is reportedly the first stage of the state aid inquiry
procedures provided by EU legislation.
</P>
<P>
If no satisfactory response is forthcoming from Bonn, the next
step would be a formal statement of the perceived infringements
noted by the Commission -- known as a reasoned opinion, after
which the EU executive may decide to take legal action before the
European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was triggered by a complaint forwarded to the
Commission in early June by Celtic Energy, an anthracite producer
from the UK's South Wales valley, alleging that subsidized German
anthracite was being "dumped" on the UK market.
</P>
<P>
Two German mining enterprises -- Preussag Anthrazit and Sophia
Jacoba -- have managed to capture around 25 percent of the UK's
400,000-ton-per-annum market for high-energy coal.
</P>
<P>
Celtic management claims that its German rivals are conducting
an "aggressive" campaign, selling below true cost price with the
help of national aid grants.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Restructuring Plan for Italian Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has recently authorized a
revamped Italian government plan to pump 275,000 billion Lire
(some 1.85 billion U.S. dollars) in state aid into ailing airline
Alitalia.
</P>
<P>
The injection, which will be delivered in three separate
instalments to be released in tandem with the fulfilment of strict
conditions, is reportedly part of a restructuring program approved
by the EU commissioners in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for an overall 10 percent reduction in the
Italian flag carrier's operations and a freeze on the fleet size
and will additionally require sell-offs of some of the company's
non-core business.
</P>
<P>
The accompanying cost-cutting and rationalization exercise will
also lead to the loss of over 1,200 jobs over the period from 1996
to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia is Europe's fifth largest airline in terms of
passengers per kilometer, after British Airways, Lufthansa, Air
France and KLM.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the company -- which is 87 percent-owned by Italian
state industrial holding company IRI -- turned over 7,830,000
million Lire (about 5,200 million dollars) worth of business with
a workforce of 17,390 and a fleet of 157 aircraft.
