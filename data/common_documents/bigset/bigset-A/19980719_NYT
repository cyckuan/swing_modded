   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; BLACK DOG OF FATE: A MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Balakian. Broadway, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author, an American poet of Armenian descent, describes his
awakening to his ethnicity and the suffering of his family and
ancestors at the hands of the Turkish government, which
exterminated more than a million Armenians in 1915. The result is a
``fascinating and affecting memoir ... written in sorrow and
anger,'' Lore Dickstein wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PUTTERMESSER PAPERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Cynthia Ozick. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Puttermesser is a New York Jew whose imaginary life is
richer than all the financial markets and political offices she
floats through in her mundane daily existence. In this painfully
comic novel, which was selected by the editors of the Book Review
as one of the best books of 1997, she creates a golem who gets her
elected mayor of New York City (with disastrous results), casts
herself as George Eliot and her new lover as Eliot's paramour and
winds up in heaven, where her best dreams and worst apprehensions
are realized. Last year our reviewer, Jack Miles, called this
``crazy delight'' the inspired work of ''a literary centaur, half
artist and half scholar.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO GOES FIRST? THE STORY OF SELF-EXPERIMENTATION IN MEDICINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lawrence K. Altman. University of California, $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   A physician and the medical correspondent for The New York Times
argues that self-experimentation in medicine has been extremely
common and valuable over the years and is also a vital measure of a
researcher's integrity. In 1987 in these pages, Fitzhugh Mullan
called this a ``fascinating and thoroughly original exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE MEMORY OF THE FOREST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles T. Powers. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A murder in a Polish village sets off an investigation that
sheds light on the brutalities of the recent communist era. But the
central mystery is the deeper past and the disappearance of the 80
percent of the village's prewar population who were Jews. ``This
superb novel ... is remarkable for the acuity of its moral vision
and the vivacity of its language,'' Ken Kalfus said here last year.

   &UR; NOT LIKE US: HOW EUROPEANS HAVE LOVED, HATED, AND TRANSFORMED
AMERICAN CULTURE SINCE WORLD WAR II &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Pells. Basic Books, $16.
</P>
<P>
   A historian contrasts the government-sponsored attempts to
persuade Europeans of the glories of the United States with the far
less predictable commercially driven encounters between ``them''
and ``us.'' What he uncovers is less the Americanization of world
culture than the globalization of culture, period. This is a
``skeptical, informative book,'' Alan Ryan said here in 1997.
 &UR; LONDON: A SOCIAL HISTORY &LR; , by Roy Porter (Harvard University,
$19.95), takes a Darwinian view of an elusive city, treating it as
both habitat and evolving organism. In 1995 our reviewer, John R.
Stilgoe, called this a ``stunningly successful look at London
between the Elizabeths.''

<P>
   &UR; PORTRAIT OF THE WALRUS BY A YOUNG ARTIST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Laurie Foos. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old Frances Fisk is a sculptor of aquatic animals
who grapples with her muse after her father's death, but what
really drives this novel are odd plot details like sharks and chain
saws that somehow make sense by the end. Last year in these pages,
Sally Eckhoff praised the author's ``bold and tuneful'' voice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T TELL THE GROWN-UPS: THE SUBVERSIVE POWER OF CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alison Lurie. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.
</P>
<P>
   These essays focus on the wicked, often hidden honesty of
classic folk tales and their challenge to conventional adult
values, as well as on the human creators of our favorite fantasies.
The result is a ``thoroughly absorbing collection'' by an
''unillusioned and cheerfully clearheaded guide,'' Rosellen Brown
said here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A DEATH IN CHINA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carl Hiaasen and Bill Montalbano. Black Lizard/Vintage Crime,
$12.
</P>
<P>
   Two newspaper reporters spin a yarn about an American professor
who stumbles onto an art-smuggling ring after the suspicious death
of a Chinese-American colleague. In 1984 in the Book Review,
Herbert Mitgang called this an ``imaginative thriller.'' The same
publisher has reissued an earlier collaboration,  &UR; POWDER BURN &LR; 
($12), in which an architect infiltrates the Miami drug scene after
he is marked for death for accidentally witnessing a murder. In
1982 in these pages, Newgate Callendar called this an ``expertly
plotted'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURPASSING THE LOVE OF MEN: ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE
BETWEEN WOMEN FROM THE RENAISSANCE TO THE PRESENT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lillian Faderman. Quill/Morrow, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author maintains that until recently women were usually free
to love one another, and that the male world tolerated or even
praised romantic friendship between women as pure and ennobling; it
was only in this century that such love was condemned. This is ``a
welcome and needed history,'' Carolyn G. Heilbrun wrote here in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONKEY BRIDGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lan Cao. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of this first novel tells how her Vietnamese family
was fractured by the war and how its members struggled to reinvent
themselves amid the mind-boggling possibilities and confusions of
their adopted American life. This is ``an impressive debut,''
Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times in 1997.

<P>
   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to a
three-part series moving this weekend on the new identity being
forged by America's immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike immigrants of the past, many of today's new Americans are
choosing to straddle two worlds. They may live in the United
States, but with cut-rate phone cards and frequent-flier miles,
with modems, fax machines and video cameras, they can participate
in life back home with an immediacy unimagined by any previous
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The three articles will move in two forms: full length as
published in The New York Times and in abridged versions of perhaps
half or less of the full length. They will move on Saturday, Sunday
and Monday in the ``a'' news file and are for publication beginning
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the series follows:
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-IDENTITY (Undated) _ For a New York City couple, many a
day can start in blaring traffic on the Grand Central Parkway in
Queens County and end on horseback in the verdant countryside of
their native Dominican Republic, cantering down to a river to feast
on rum and goat. They, like many modern immigrants, no longer
consign their homeland to the mist of memory or nostalgia. As the
world has grown smaller, the immigrant experience has become one of
remaining connected, economically, culturally, politically. Such a
fluid exchange between the homeland and the new land, which
inevitably alters both places, has unsettled many Americans, and
this unease underlies the current debates about immigration,
multiculturalism and bilingualism. By Deborah Sontag and Celia W.
Dugger. (6,400 words.)
</P>
<P>
   (For use Sunday, July 19, and thereafter.)
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-TRADITION (Undated) _ In modern immigrant families, where
the bindings between here and there are stronger than ever before,
children almost inevitably find themselves pushed and pulled
between the culture and values of their parents and those of the
larger American society. Such ambiguities are perhaps never more
acute than when a decision about marriage is at hand. But what
emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's traditional Indian
wedding, arranged by his parents, is the way many of these children
search for and find solace and grounding in their connections to
the world back home. By Celia W. Dugger. (5,000 words.)
</P>
<P>
   (For use Monday, July 20, and thereafter.)
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Undated) _ Almost every migration story is
the psychodrama of a family, its aspirations and frustrations, its
separations and reunions, its traditions and compromises. For some
Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, as for the Cruz family of
Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a town, a global village
in the most literal sense. By Deborah Sontag. (6,100 words.)
</P>
<P>
   (For use Tuesday, July 21, and thereafter.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABRIDGED VERSION SLUGS &LR;  (With word count):
</P>
<P>
   ABR-IMMIG-IDENTITY (2,400 words)
</P>
<P>
   ABR-IMMIG-TRADITION (2,100 words)
</P>
<P>
   ABR-IMMIG-GLOBALVILAGE (2,800 words)

   Photos and graphics to accompany the articles are being made
available free to clients and non-clients of the NYT News Service
graphics and photo desk.

   (NYT101) UNDATED _ IMMIG-IDENTITY-1 _ Stella and Fernando Mateo
on a flight between their homeland, the Dominican Republic, and
their home in New York. Fernando has been shuttling between the two
cities his entire life. ``I believe people like us have the best of
two worlds,'' he says. ``We have two countries, two homes.''
(Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT102) NEW YORK _ IMMIG-IDENTITY-2 _ Hamid Ali, a cab driver,
talks with his sister, Shamim Kusar, who lives in Islamabad,
Pakistan, from a New York City videophone parlor. He had not seen
her in four years. ``I will tell everyone in town that I saw my
brother on TV,'' Ms. Kusar giggled. ``They won't believe me. We are
simple people.'' (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT103) NEW YORK _ IMMIG-IDENTITY-3 _ Eric Beckford, a Jamaican
immigrant, packing a barrel of food and clothing to send to his
parents back home. Barrel-shipping companies, taking advantage of
low prices for staples in America, are part of an entrepreneurial
subculture that taps immigrants' ties to their homelands. Beckford,
as well as his four siblings who live in New York, frequently send
staples to Jamaica because American prices are relatively low.

<P>
   (NYT105) UNDATED _ IMMIG-IDENTITY-4 _ Fernando Mateo at his
company's headquarters in Manhattan, right, and in Bani, Dominican
Republic, at the home of Jose Antonio Ortiz Sanchez, who had just
received money from his son in the United States. Mateo, who owns a
money-transfer company, commutes frequently between New York and
Santo Domingo. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (NYT106) JAIPUR, India _ IMMIG-TRADITION-1 _ Vinit Sethi, whose
mother found his wife in Jaipur, India, is teased by his friends
before the ceremony. ``I always knew I'd probably end up getting
married to someone who wasn't very American, because I'm not myself
in some ways,'' he says. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT107) JAIPUR, India _ IMMIG-TRADITION-2 _ Vinit Sethi rides
to his wedding ceremony with his Indian-born bride on horseback.
The path is illuminated by green fluorescent lights. Sethi, 24, is
marrying a woman of his mother's choosing. ``I had an incredible
feeling that this was the right thing to do,'' Sethi says. (Edward
Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT108) NEW YORK _ IMMIG-TRADITION-3 _ Vinit Sethi explains
baseball to his new wife, Anshu Jain, at a recent New York Yankees
game. Sethi, a 24-year-old investment banker born and reared in New
York, has urged his wife to become a more independent, modern woman
_ to go back to college, wear jeans and to do what would have been
unthinkable to her only a year ago: call her husband by his first
name. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT109) NEW YORK _ IMMIG-TRADITION-5 _ Anjali Rawat in her dorm
room at Barnard. Miss Rawat, whose marriage has been arranged, has
given up finishing her education and her dream of becoming a
television news announcer and will, instead, follow her husband to
London or India. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT110) JAIPUR, India _ IMMIG-TRADITION-4 _ Anjali Rawat sits
with her future husband during a visit to India. While Miss Rawat,
a Barnard College freshman, had always known that she would ``be
arranged,'' she was shocked that it had happened soon. ``I wish it
didn't have to be this way, but I can't really do anything about
it.'' (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT111) CHINANTLA, Mexico _ IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE-1 _ Zoela Cruz,
a former New York factory worker, listening to an accordion player
at her home in Chinantla, Mexico. Her maid, Cristo Rey, watches
from the kitchen. Mrs. Cruz, who spent decades folding fabric in a
Brooklyn sweatshop, retired to Chinantla and opened a small store
from which she dispenses rice and advice. (Angel Franco/New York
Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT112) CHINANTLA, Mexico _ IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE-2 _ Elizabeth
Cruz preparing her son, Christian de Jesus, for his baptism.
Helping her is her sister Monica, brother-in-law Claudio, and his
daughter, Samantha. Elizabeth, a bilingual education teacher, who
lives with her husband in New York, brought her son to Chinantla to
fulfill a promise she made to herself. (Jim Estrin/New York Times
Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT113) CHINANTLA, Mexico _ IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE-3 _ Melissa
Cruz, near right, and her mother, Zoela in a procession for Padre
Jesus. The procession is an all-night devotional. When not in
Mexico, Melissa, 26, is a nurse St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
Manhattan. (Jim Estrin/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT114) NEW YORK _ IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE-4 _ Antonia Cruz and her
daughter, Samantha, outside their building in Brooklyn. Antonia,
who infuriated her parents by dropping out of high school when she
got engaged, lives with her sisters and her own family in the same
small apartment in which the girls were raised. (Jim Estrin/New

door, a man of technical and artistic turn. He said he and his
computer would transmit a copy to my friends on the coast. He
brought a copy of the map over after I had gone to bed. It is

   USAFRICA-TRADE-3rdLEDE _ WASHINGTON _ With an appealing name,
the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act'' seems to break new, and
positive ground. Proponents say it shifts the U.S. relationship
with Africa from aid to trade. But the Africa trade bill before
Congress, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Philip M. Crane, R-Ill., has

Americans among them, have been growing. (Abulhassan, Cox News

vote to join an independent labor union _ defying the traditional
government-controlled labor movement. With some American labor
activists backing them up, the workers are trying to use NAFTA to
impose sanctions on Han Young for alleged attempts to destroy the
independent union. (Ferriss, Cox News Service) MOVED.

<P>
   w/MXENVIR _ MEXICO-ENVIRONMENT _ MEXICO CITY, Mexico _ When
NAFTA was passed, Mexico and the United States agreed banks would
be established to finance environmental projects along the polluted

mismanaged and have failed to live up to expectations. A hard look
at what the banks have done and haven't done. (Ferriss, Cox News

   MEXICO-TURTLES _ XCACEL, Mexico _ She struggles ashore in
darkness, illuminated only by a milky spray of stars in the
Caribbean sky. The sole sounds on the beach are the splash of
waves, the wind and the steady crunching of flippers scooping sand.
Half an hour later, the massive sea turtle begins to deposit more
than a hundred pearly-white eggs inside a nest. Today, biologists
camp on this beach _ called Xcacel and considered one of most
important turtle nesting grounds in the Caribbean _ to protect the
endangered turtles and their eggs from poachers. (Ferriss, Cox News

is crossing the radar screens of pollsters, civics experts and

In the great public square of American democracy, the voting public

<P>
   DROUGHT _ The South's long dry spell has been a killer in Texas
and has had a regionwide impact on crops, especially cotton and
corn. The drought also has fostered some odd politics. Farmers in
south Alabama, for instance, may not have to pay the full price of
experimental cotton if they can get an official declaration of
disaster. An analysis of the present and future situatiion.

   DROUGHT-FLORIDA _ Floods in winter. Fire in summer. What next

</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-LOUISIANA _ While much of the rest of the South seems
likely to recover soon from the drought, Louisiana may not. Feeling
the heat from drought-plagued neighbor Texas, Louisiana continues
to suffer major crop damage and ecology upsets: Houses are sinking
in New Orleans and gators are swimming out of game preserves into
the Gulf. (Rochell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   UNDERGROUND-ATLANTA _ After struggling for nearly a decade, the
owners of Underground Atlanta are putting the much-touted downtown
redevelopment up for sale. Envisioned as a model for urban
public-private redevelopment, the festival marketplace never caught
on and now tenants and sales are dropping fast. (Turner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TOMATO-MURDER _ LUDOWICI, Ga. _ Thurman Martin's death,
authorities say, was a family affair. They say the retired
trucker's grandson, Billy Crowder, and son-in-law, Joseph John
Stanton, crept into his bedroom and shot him in his sleep with a
.22-caliber rifle. His daughter and granddaughter cleaned up after
them. Crowder's sister, Katie, pleaded guilty to hindering the
apprehension of a criminal. A friend of Crowder was convicted and
sent to prison for life for helping bury the old man and plant
tomatos over him. Crowder and Stanton are on trial this week for
murder in one of the most bizarre of South Georgia killings.

   FARMING-GENETICS (Dallikon, Switzerland) _ Throughout the world
last year more than 30 million acres of commercial farmland were
planted with genetically modified seeds _ ten times as much as the
year before. But not one of those acres was in the 15 countries of
the European Union. By Michael Specter.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POLITICS (Tokyo) _ As Americans yearn for a forceful new
prime minister to emerge in Japan and take charge of the economy,
it is worth remembering that Ieyasu Tokugawa, the
``barbarian-subduing shogun'' who lived four centuries ago, was
arguably the last really strong and dynamic leader to reshape
Japan. Since then, Japan has had good rulers and bad rulers; but
only rarely has it had a strong leader. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-FIGHTING (Orahovac, Yugoslavia) _ In what could the
beginning of a significant new phase of the fighting in the Serbian
province of Kosovo, ethnic Albanian separatists said on Sunday that
they have taken Orahovac, their first city, and that they will use
their newly acquired weapons to keep it. By Mike O'Connor.

   ARGENTINA-POLITICS (Tucuman) _ Antonio Domingo Bussi, the
barrel-chested, cigar-chomping Governor of this tiny northwestern

   IMMIG-TRADITION (Undated) _ In modern immigrant families, where
the bindings between here and there are stronger than ever before,
children almost inevitably find themselves pushed and pulled
between the culture and values of their parents and those of the
larger American society. Such ambiguities are perhaps never more
acute than when a decision about marriage is at hand. But what
emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's traditional Indian
wedding, arranged by his parents, is the way many of these children
search for and find solace and grounding in their connections to
the world back home. By Celia W. Dugger. (5,000 words.) An abridged
version, slugged ABR-IMMIG-TRADITION (2,100 words), will be moved
at the same time. In addition, photos and graphics to accompany the
article are being made available free to clients and non-clients of
the NYT News Service graphics and photo desk.
</P>
<P>
   TEENSMOKERS-COURT (Plantation, Fla.) _ Once a month for a couple
of hours, Judge Steven G. Shutter of Broward County clears his
courtroom of lawyers and defendants to make room for restless
teen-agers and their inconvenienced parents for what is known as
Teen Smoking Court. It is a new weapon in Florida's fight against
teen-age smoking, combining combines education, health warnings and
parental nagging with the weight of the law. The Teen Smoking Court
is part of a large-scale campaign against underage smoking that the
state is financing with $200 million of the $11.3-billion
settlement it reached with tobacco companies last year after suing
to recover Medicaid payments for smoking-related illnesses. By
Mireya Navarro.

<P>
   BUDGET-POLITICS (Washington) _ Republicans in Congress appear
headed toward a showdown with President Clinton over tax and
spending bills for next year, as the two sides battle over issues
like education and seek political advantage heading into the fall's
congressional elections. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSEDEBATES-FINANCE (Washington) _ Call it the capital's
rendition of ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' the sometimes discordant
strains of the campaign finance debate that is relegated to the
post prime-time hours of the House's summer agenda. The vistors'
galleries are empty. The reporters and television crews that cram
the Capitol in daylight have all but dispersed. But like
nightwandering vampires, a small coven of lawmakers arises in full
majesty to take the floor for a debate that often does come close
to drawing blood. They only come out at night, and they are
scheduled to resume debate after the sun sets on Monday. By Alison
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   HMO-PATIENTRIGHTS (Washington) _ The struggle over patients'
rights legislation has scrambled old alliances and created some
extraordinary new ones. It is throwing together doctors, trial
lawyers and consumers and pitting them against insurers and managed
care companies, who in many cases are fighting each other over how
much regulation they can take. By Peter Kilborn.

</P>
<P>
   CONCERTS-CORPORATE (Los Angeles) _ Over the past year and a
half, the rock and pop concert business has quietly been going
through the biggest transformation in its history. The business,
the last stronghold of independence in a rapidly consolidating
entertainment industry, had long been a world of self-made and
often ruthless local moguls. But with the sudden entry onto the
scene of a deep-pocketed, publicly traded company called SFX
Entertainment, the business has begun to go the way of the movie
and recording industries, and is fast becoming consolidated under
the aegis of a sprawling corporate conglomerate. By Neil Strauss
and James Sterngold.

   ALCOHOLISM-DRUG (Undated) _ A French company may bring a new
drug, already widely available in Europe, to the United States in
2000 that would help alcoholics remain abstinent after they
complete detoxification. But it has already generated a heated
controversy in the health-care community over whether it should be
used at all. On the one side, are specialists who argue that
alcoholics and other addicts should be treated by counseling alone.
On the other, are doctors who insist that prescription drugs are
crucial tools in rehabilitating them.
</P>
<P>
   ADVERTISING-AD-COL (Undated) _ Advertising about advertising. It
has been a popular trend for some time, but is now getting bigger
and bigger. Even in public service ads (the crying Indian), ads now
reference earlier ads because of the belief consumers are so savvy
about advertising as an adjunct to popular culture. Some ads spoof
ads for other products, while some spoof their competitors. A look
at whether this is good marketing, or just lazy mining of the past
for no good result. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-STOCKS (Undated) _ After years of being coddled by
cradle-to-grave social security systems, Europeans are being urged
by financially strapped governments to take a larger hand in
planning their financial futures, and the result is a stock market
boom. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-CONUNDRUM (Undated) _ Sometimes it seems like
Microsoft is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't. While
reviewers complain that Windows 98 lacks significant new features,
the Justice Department and 20 states accuse the company of
including in the operating system features that should be separate
programs. It is this conundrum that makes the lawsuits and
questions about Microsoft's monopoly so challenging from both legal

 &HT;    CAR BOMB ATTEMPT RAISES MIDEAST TENSION AS PEACE TALKS RESTART
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A failed car-bomb attempt in the height of rush hour
Sunday served as a pointed reminder of Israel's security risks,
even as negotiators restarted talks in the deadlocked peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said a Palestinian man was badly burned as he
tried to ignite 160 gallons of explosive liquids in a van on the
main downtown street at about 8:30 a.m., the start of the Israeli
work week.
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty police officer reportedly noticed smoke in the van,
which had non-matching license plates. Police told The Associated
Press that the injured man was an activist in Hamas, a Palestinian
group opposed to the existence of Israel and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted bombing, which police said could have caused
extensive damage and injuries, came nearly a year after a bombing
in a Jerusalem produce market killed 16 Israelis and derailed an
attempt then to restart the Oslo process. The Oslo accords are
based on Israel turning over occupied land in return for
Palestinians' peaceful acceptance of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The incident may have been an attempt by Hamas to derail
Sunday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to reporters a
few hours after the attempt, saying that it showed why he must hold
Palestinians to their commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have our concerns,'' Netanyahu said. ``You can
understand why we insist that the Palestinians carry out their
responsibilities, first of all with fighting terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai met in
Tel Aviv with Mahmoud Abbas, the top aide to Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and one of the architects of the peace process begun
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was urged by U.S. officials who are trying to end a
17-month freeze in the peace process. The two sides agreed to meet
again this week, but both had entered the meetings with
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have accepted the basis of a U.S. plan to break the
deadlock, which would have Israel turn over another 13 percent of
the land it has occupied in the West Bank since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Such a turnover would leave about 40 percent of the West Bank in
full or partial control of the Palestinians and open the way for
long-delayed negotiations of the final, most difficult issues in
the peace process, such as the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians said they saw little reason in meeting until
Israel agreed to the plan, because the 13 percent was already much
lower than they had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli leaders said they were eager to meet, but
have for months resisted U.S. pressure to turn over the land. They
maintain that the Palestinians have not worked hard enough to
combat extremists such as Hamas in the areas they now control.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock has raised warnings from leaders on both sides that
fighting could break out between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu repeated Sunday that he would be willing to meet
directly with Arafat. But Arafat has said that the Israelis should
first accept the U.S. proposal.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CONCEPT DU JOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Synergy _ that notorious buzzword of the '80s routinely invoked
to sanctify hundreds of ultimately failed mergers and acquisitions
_ is back in heavy rotation.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is being called into play by the media industry.
With the cable televisionary Geraldine Laybourne departing Walt
Disney Co. to start her own television and Internet studio, and
with the magazine mogul Tina Brown leaving the resolutely
mono-media New Yorker to do a print-film-television start-up for
Miramax Films, ``synergy'' has become the media world's
high-concept du jour.
</P>
<P>
   Boiled down, what the term describes is parking old content in a
new garage: If you liked the movie, then you'll love the TV show,
the book, the magazine piece, the video game, the soundtrack, the
action figures, the desk accessories and _ au courant! _ the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years ago, when interactive digital media were first
appearing, old-line media executives had another name for this.
They called it ``repurposing.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it ever a bust. The overwhelming number of failures
(among the most notable a CD-ROM of Life magazine covers) gave the
concept a black eye and made it hard for a budding interactive
entertainment industry to find any buyers for its own inventive
gestalt.
</P>
<P>
   That gestalt _ call it the New Synergy _ is all that the digital
world has come to represent: interactive and decentralized and
networked right down to its DNA. New Synergists believe that what
traditional companies try to pass off as ``synergy'' will continue
to fail until they embrace digital, interactive media and its
emerging role in pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Martinez, the chairman of a San Francisco-based interactive
production company, Postlinear Entertainment, is a New Synergy
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   In what he dubs the ``postlinear world,'' an entertainment
property starts simply as a very loose story structure, ``populated
only with characters and ambient conflicts.'' From those loose
elements, Martinez said, you can create films, games, comic books,
whatever you like.
</P>
<P>
   But because media companies now want to control all the options
for any project _ or ``chew all the flavor out of the gum,'' in
Martinez's words _ the only way for independent producers like
Postlinear to succeed is by the flukiest, most unpredictable of
phenomena, a crossover hit.
</P>
<P>
   These are rare indeed; the most successful is Carmen Sandiego,
the dashing international thief whose career as a star of
television and books was begun in a Broderbund Software video game.
More recent is Lara Croft, the vastly endowed cyber-Barbie star of
a popular video game, Tomb Raider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lara's Book,'' by Kip Ward and Douglas Coupland, author of
``Generation X,'' was published this month. Paramount Pictures will
release a Tomb Raider movie in 1999, and the ``Lara Croft Come
Alive'' CD is already on shelves in France. Croft worship has
spawned more than 2,000 Web sites in many languages, including The
Croft Times (http://www.cubeit.com/ctimes/).
</P>
<P>
   Amid today's Internet boom, with industries left and right
making the global network the core of their businesses, many New
Synergists are amazed that traditional media companies continue to
treat the Net as some ancillary distribution medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not care about the Internet?'' Martinez said.
``The Internet is becoming a superset of all other media. At some
point, interactive media producers are going to have to create
flat-out digital labels as the first medium and move them into
things like film and TV _ not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``other way around'' problem has plagued other notable New
Synergists, as well. Allee Willis and Prudence Fenton, two of the
most innovative artists in the interactive world, have just come
off a bad trip of more than five years trying to sell their
cutting-edge Willisville interactive media project to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Highly acknowledged artists in many genres _ including
songwriting, animation, film and television production _ they
developed an entertainment environment that defined New Synergy.
Willisville _ a ``cul-de-sac on the information superhighway''
populated with bizarre and charming characters _ was to have its
richest presence on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Willisville was built for fluid, continuing connections to and
from television, shopping, e-mail, creativity tools and more. But
in the days when they were shopping the project, the reaction was
always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was really excited to see it,'' Ms. Willis said.
``We'd go through elaborate conversations before we took these
meetings and say, `We are in complete opposition to the way
entertainment is being developed for the Web. We don't think the
idea is to have a TV show and go online and buy a T-shirt and be
able to chat with the actors.' And everyone would say, `Of course,
we believe in a totally radical approach; we're the place for
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she added, ``their eyes would cross as soon as we'd start
talking about it, and they'd start talking about doing these stupid
`Web-isodes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lammers, chief executive of the children's entertainment
company Headbone Interactive, was luckier than Ms. Willis. She will
take Headbone's popular ``Elroy'' video game character to the TV
screen this fall. But it took years to sell television executives
on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating part of dealing with traditional media
companies is they've got a huge business and infrastructure to
support, so they limit the creative risk they're willing to take,''
Ms. Lammers said. ``You can cross over from TV to the Web, but the
most original material, the brain surgery stuff, is going on in the
new media because that's the hard part.''

   IMMIG-TRADITION (Undated) _ In modern immigrant families, where
the bindings between here and there are stronger than ever before,
children almost inevitably find themselves pushed and pulled
between the culture and values of their parents and those of the
larger American society. Such ambiguities are perhaps never more
acute than when a decision about marriage is at hand. But what
emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's traditional Indian
wedding, arranged by his parents, is the way many of these children
search for and find solace and grounding in their connections to
the world back home. By Celia W. Dugger. (5,000 words.)

   TEENSMOKERS-COURT (Plantation, Fla.) _ Once a month for a couple
of hours, Judge Steven Shutter of Broward County clears his
courtroom of lawyers and defendants to make room for restless
teen-agers and their inconvenienced parents for what is known as
Teen Smoking Court. It is a new weapon in Florida's fight against
teen-age smoking, combining combines education, health warnings and
parental nagging with the weight of the law. The Teen Smoking Court
is part of a large-scale campaign against underage smoking that the
state is financing with $200 million of the $11.3 billion
settlement it reached with tobacco companies last year after suing
to recover Medicaid payments for smoking-related illnesses. By

   HOUSEDEBATES-FINANCE (Washington) _ Call it the capital's
rendition of ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' the sometimes discordant
strains of the campaign finance debate that is relegated to the
post prime-time hours of the House's summer agenda. The vistors'
galleries are empty. The reporters and television crews that cram
the Capitol in daylight have all but dispersed. But like

THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM VS. THE OPERATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif.)  (js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask 10 computer scientists to state which features define an
operating system, and you will probably get 10 different answers.
Ask what those features will be four years from now, and the
responses will range from some vague variation on current systems
to visions of vast, potent networks that empower individual
computers with a sort of communal energy.
</P>
<P>
   Asking such questions is not an academic exercise. The nature of
the operating system, the master program that breathes life into
computer hardware, is at the heart of the Justice Department's
lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp. of antitrust violations. And yet,
just last week, Sun Microsystems Inc. announced a product called
Jini that is designed to negate the need for Microsoft's Windows
and other operating systems used today.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sun's approach catches on, whether Microsoft can prevail
in both the marketplace and the courtroom or whether software takes
some other, unexpected evolutionary leap, it is clear that the
technology is now moving too fast for anyone to predict the future
of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus of the government's suit is Microsoft's inclusion
in Windows of its Internet Explorer browser for navigating the
World Wide Web, to the detriment of its rival in the browser
market, Netscape Communications Corp. But there is also concern
about Microsoft's linking of the opening screen in Windows to
Internet sites and services that are owned either by Microsoft or
by companies that pay Microsoft fees for this blue-chip real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Microsoft won a victory on the first issue when a
federal appeals court panel, ruling in an older government suit,
said that Microsoft could bundle a program with Windows if the
bundling provided a benefit to users.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the judicial system versus the operating system is a
mismatch. One of the slipperiest challenges facing government
lawyers is that no one, jurist or engineer, can say with any
certainty which features belong in an operating system and which do
not. At the same time, the government learned a hard lesson in its
13-year antitrust case against IBM Corp. in the 1970s and early
1980s. Even then, the gears of the digital revolution were turning
faster than the wheels of justice. The government eventually
abandoned its case, acknowledging that whatever their original
merits, the charges had become ``technologically irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were days of relatively slow development for computer
technology. In contrast, Sun's announcement of Jini suggests that
the current pace of change could leave the legal system performing
surgery on a beast that evolves from one species to another on the
operating table.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a concept known as distributed computing, Jini
redefines the computer, its peripherals and sundry other gadgets as
a community of devices functioning together within a dynamic
network as a single virtual machine. Microsoft is known to be
developing a similar concept that it calls Millennium. Before
distributed computing can make operating systems like Microsoft's
Windows, Apple's Macintosh OS and the various flavors of Unix
obsolete, however, wireless networks will have to evolve to a
quality and price that makes connectivity ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to take several years. For the time being, the
only link between a processor and everything else that goes inside
and outside the box we think of as a computer is the operating
system. And the question of which functions belong within the
master program and which belong in independent applications
software is a matter of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is there is no clear line to draw,'' said Patrick
Bridges, a doctoral student in computer science at the University
of Arizona who runs a Web site about operating systems. Some, he
said, stick to very basic functions while others are more
all-encompassing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Windows is of the all-encompassing variety. Its ancestor, the
original MS-DOS used in the first IBM PC in 1981, was basic. It did
little more than control the keyboard, monitor and floppy-disk
drives. Indeed, DOS is an acronym for disk operating system. It
could be stored on a single 360,000-byte floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   As hardware evolved, Microsoft added support for hard-disk
drives, CD-ROMs, audio, video, networking, type fonts, fax modems,
Internet browsing and a host of other new technologies, usually at
no additional cost to the consumer. Windows 98, which went on sale
in June, contains 13 million lines of code and requires up to 295
million bytes to store.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that inflation can be laid to the evolution of the
operating system from an inward to an outward orientation. Where
DOS was manipulated by typing arcane commands on an almost empty
screen, Windows, like the Macintosh and other graphical operating
systems, now controls almost every aspect of a user's experience
with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulating the user's very perception of what a computer is
and does has become key to Microsoft _ and alarming to competitors
and the Justice Department's antitrust division _ because for more
than 90 percent of the people who buy computers today, Windows is
the gateway to an explosion of electronic commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that integrating the Internet into Windows
benefits users and that at any rate, it has the right to innovate.
Indeed, as each new version of the operating system has been
introduced, Microsoft has come under fire from the trade press and
consumers for its failure to incorporate one or another feature.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Microsoft says, is becoming such a fundamental
part of computer use that access to it should be part of the
operating system, just as other types of networking already are.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department and Microsoft's critics say that
Windows has an insatiable appetite for functions and features that
used to be provided by separate programs and other companies. The
result, they argue, is a stifling of innovation and competition.
</P>
<P>
   From a traditional computer science point of view, the issue
seems simple: The operating system is software that is basic to
running the computer and is needed by virtually all users; an
application is software that performs a particular function and is
needed by only some users _ for example, a program simulating air
flow over a wing, an accounting program or a spreadsheet or
word-processing program.
</P>
<P>
   The two types of software have a symbiotic relationship. Without
an operating system (and, indeed, the earliest computers in the
1950s did not have them), each program would have to include its
own instructions for such mundane tasks as finding a spot on the
disk to store information. Some early MS-DOS word processing
programs had to contain instructions for connecting to many types
of printers. Today that responsibility falls to the operating
system. The operating system frees programmers who develop
applications from having to reinvent the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Operating systems began to be more concerned with the user
experience when Apple executives discovered the work of researchers
at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1980s.
Apple first imitated Xerox's ``graphical user interface,'' which
allows the machine to be controlled using windows, a mouse and
pop-down menus, on its ill-fated Lisa. But with the introduction of
the Macintosh in 1984, the graphical interface became the future
direction of standard for personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that it is always an integral part of the
operating system; it can also be a sort of digital facade, or
shell. For example, users of Unix, an operating system used in
engineering workstations and bigger machines, have a choice of
several user interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Windows was also a shell bolted onto MS-DOS, and
there were several other windowing shells from which to choose.
With the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft fully integrated the
graphical interface with the underlying operating system, so that
today it is impossible to distinguish between the user's experience
and the machine's function.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case with the Macintosh from the beginning,
Windows takes responsibility for the basic look and feel of the
application programs that run on it. Without this kind of
standardization, users would have to spend a much longer time
learning how to operate each program. Microsoft argues that as
technology evolves, once-specialized functions become essential and
should be part of the operating system. While this can kill the
market for some kinds of software, it also makes the development of
other kinds faster and easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when we add services to the operating system
and somebody has to shift their business as a consequence,'' Brad
Chase, marketing vice president for Windows at Microsoft, said.
``But it's trivial compared to the opportunity it's created for the
industry and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some competitors say this process is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you focus on the things Microsoft's not doing there's
plenty of opportunity,'' said Enrique Salem, chief technical
officer for the Symantec Corp., which provides software that
extends the functionality of the operating system. Many of the
improvements Symantec sold for Windows 3.1 were incorporated by
Microsoft into Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   And even Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has made a
career challenging attacking Microsoft, said the emphasis on
keeping something out of the operating system is ``in many ways the
weakest part of the government's case.'' Rather, Reback said, the
government should promote competition by breaking up the software
giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in a position to decide what goes in or
out'' of an operating system, he said. ``The market should do it.''

<P>
   Faced with opposition from the technology industry and other
companies, accounting rule makers have stepped away from a proposal
that had threatened to end certain lucrative employee stock plans.
</P>
<P>
   The rules relate to stock purchase plans in which employees can
buy company stock at a discount of more than 15 percent. While tax
laws limit the discount to 15 percent, many companies give their
employees a better deal by applying the discount to the market
price at either the beginning or the end of a certain period,
whichever price is lower. New York Times Co. has one of these plans
as do many technology companies, including Intel Corp. and National
Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed this spring
that if companies wanted to give employees what is effectively more
than a 15 percent discount from the market price on the date the
stock was purchased, they would have to treat the discount as an
expense. Such an expense, in turn, would cut into earnings. To
avoid that expense, many companies were expected to limit their
stock programs.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the board decided that companies could still
apply the 15 percent discount to the price at the beginning of the
period, which under the law is when the company is considered to
have granted an employee an option to purchase stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for employees and for employee ownership,''
said Karen Frey, communications director at the American
Electronics Association, a trade association of technology
companies. The association, located in Silicon Valley, had sent a
letter to the accounting board in June, calling the proposed
changes ``unnecessary'' and ``confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's proposal had been drawing controversy because it was
aimed at stock plans that under federal law must benefit all
employees. In 1994, the accounting board had backed away from a
similar proposal that would have made it more costly for companies
to grant stock options _ a perk that most companies give only to
top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be feeling a little bit of the political heat,''
said Tim Sparks, a lawyer at the Silicon Valley law firm of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosetti and an expert on employee compensation
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said it was still not clear what effect the rules would
have on companies' stock purchase programs. For example, it is
unclear whether companies would be able to apply the discount to
the price at the end of the period if the market price falls. And
if companies cannot use that lower price, it is not clear whether
employees would be able to take their money out of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A steep drop in the company's stock price could result in
employees being forced to pay more for their stock than they could
buy it on the market, if the discount can only be applied to the
price at the period's start.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board's decisions are still tentative. The board
plans to issue a draft of the new rules early next year. The public
will then have about 90 days to comment on the rules before the
board makes a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Miller, who manages the stock plans at National
Semiconductor in Santa Clara, Calif., said company officials had
worried that fewer employees would participate in their stock
program if they were forced to limit the discount to 15 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the midst of all the hoopla over Tina Brown's
decision to leave The New Yorker and link up with Harvey Weinstein
at Miramax, one aspect of the media deal was largely overlooked:
that Ronald Galotti, the brash publisher of Vogue who helped make
the magazine a blockbuster success over the last several years, was
defecting from Conde Nast Publications to join Ms. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Galotti has been one of Conde Nast's
heaviest hitters, a hard-driving publisher who raked in the ad
pages at the company's most glamorous magazine and helped bolster
its reputation as the bible of the fashion business. His departure
is therefore no routine matter and could seem to signify another
chink in the armor at a time when the publishing company looks
somewhat vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Fortune magazine published a scathing
article asserting that Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications,
has been ``a woeful underperformer'' financially and that Steven
Florio, the company's president and chief executive, has
exaggerated the company's business successes and lied about details
in his personal life. Florio and his supporters have dismissed the
article as inaccurate and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company's chairman, S.I. Newhouse Jr., was caught off
guard by losing Ms. Brown. And there have been reports about other
wandering eyes at the company, namely two of Galotti's closest
friends _ Richard Beckman, who has succeeded Galotti at Vogue, and
Thomas Florio, Steven Florio's younger brother, who was moved out
as publisher of The New Yorker in May and returned to his former
post as publisher of Conde Nast Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named as Galotti's replacement at Vogue, Beckman
met with Jann Wenner about the position of group publisher at
Wenner Media, which publishes Rolling Stone, Us and Men's Journal.
And Thomas Florio has had several conversations with David Pecker,
president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines,
about opportunities at his company, which publishes Elle and
Mirabella.
</P>
<P>
   According to one publishing executive, Thomas Florio sought out
Pecker soon after an article appeared in The Wall Street Journal
earlier this year in which Steven Florio announced that Conde Nast
would be folding The New Yorker into its operations and implied
that big brother was taking control. Thomas Florio did not return
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether all of this makes Steven Florio nervous, the chief
executive said no. ``I'm sure that every good person here gets
phone calls,'' he said. ``Is it my job to continually challenge
them? Of course it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Galotti said he did not decide to leave because of any
discontent with the company; it had to do with getting a better
offer. As part owner of the media company backed by Miramax,
Galotti will run whatever magazine he and Ms. Brown decide to start
_ although many have raised questions about whether the venture to
create synergy between a magazine, books, television and movies is
just a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti, 48, has long been a larger-than-life, occasionally
controversial character at Conde Nast. He was dismissed as
publisher of Vanity Fair in 1993 after clashing with Bernard Leser,
the former president of the company, although the official line was
that he resigned. He has been accused of throwing chairs, something
Galotti said never happened. He kicked an office refrigerator,
according to one account. Last year, Spy magazine called him a
``vulgarian,'' among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also known as the consummate salesman, which is what
counts most at Conde Nast. He delivered thicker and thicker fall
issues of Vogue to the point where the number of ads was promoted
in pounds rather than pages, which rose to nearly 2,800 at the end
of last year, up from 2,400 the year Galotti started. His
slick-haired, perpetually tan, power-suited, back-slapping persona
went over well with ad executives. It also earned him some
notoriety: He was the basis for the character Big in Candace
Bushnell's popular ``Sex in the City'' column in The New York
Observer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, people have often described Galotti as a prime example
of the Steven Florio school of pit bull publishers: brash,
hard-driving, with just the right dose of charm.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman is also described as a Steven Florio protege and is
proud to describe himself that way. Beckman credits Florio with
giving him his first big break at the company _ as an ad salesman
in the London office of The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Florio _ who was publisher of The New Yorker at the
time _ brought Beckman back to New York and made him ad manager of
The New Yorker, then ad director of Conde Nast Traveler, then
publisher of GQ, where Beckman took ad pages to about 2,000 from
1,400.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Beckman's defection would have been a real blow.
But just as rumors about Beckman's being wooed by Wenner Media were
percolating, Conde Nast was able to counter with a plum: Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Conde Nast replaced Beckman at GQ with Jack
Laschever, a corporate vice president at American Express
Publishing, where he served as group publisher for Departures, Your
Company and Sky Guide since 1997. Beckman said he never intended to
leave, though he said he did meet with Wenner.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thomas Florio, he still would seem to have every reason
to send his resume around. Yes, he may have survived the fallout
from leaving The New Yorker without having made it profitable _
although the magazine's losses did decline during his six-year
tenure _ and, yes, he is earning considerably more money with a
package worth about $800,000, up from the $600,000 he earned at The
New Yorker, according to one magazine executive. But he has yet to
get out from under the upstaging presence of his brother, who moved
him from The New Yorker _ with the blessing of Newhouse _ though
Thomas Florio has said it was he who wanted a change.
</P>
<P>
   One magazine executive said Thomas Florio had also met with
Wenner, who declined to comment, in addition to talking to Pecker.
Asked about his brother's meeting with Pecker, Steven Florio said:
``I don't know that to be true. I've asked Tom about it, and he's
pledged his loyalty and hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time earlier this year, when things were first heating up
at The New Yorker, it seemed that the loyalties of Galotti and
Beckman might be divided over whom to side with. But interestingly,
all of these men appear to have emerged good friends. Beckman said
both Florios and Galotti would be present at his wedding in the
fall. And Steven Florio said he was unconcerned about any threat to
company loyalty. ``Ron is the first publisher in five years that
resigned,'' he said. ``He's the only one I've ever lost.''

COMPANY TARGETING JUNK E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A company with perhaps the most ambitious
commercial attempt yet to combat junk e-mail plans to announce on
Monday that it has begun distributing a test version of its system,
which is intended to intercept unwanted messages as they travel
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The system has been designed by Bright Light Technologies Inc.,
a well-financed start-up company based here, which has already won
contracts with four major Internet service providers: AT&AMP;T
Worldnet, Earthlink Networks, Concentric Networks and USA.net.
</P>
<P>
   Junk e-mail, often known as spam, is seen as a growing problem
by the nation's Internet service providers because of the burden it
places on computer disks, network capacity and the staff time of
network operators. At some networks the volume of spam, which
consists of commercial solicitations ranging from get-rich-quick
schemes to pointers to pornographic sites on the World Wide Web,
sometimes exceeds 50 percent of all electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   But spam is also reviled by many Internet users as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most commercial solicitations are viewed as an unwanted
nuisance,'' said Don Schutt, vice president of consumer advocacy at
Concentric Networks Inc., a network services company based in
Cupertino, Calif. ``But when parents see that their children are
receiving unwanted pornographic messages, they go ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bright Light's founder, Sunil Paul, said that his
inspiration for the company came when his wife expressed shock at
receiving an unsolicited pornographic message.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a solution to the problem of spam was a vital concern,
he said, because many businesses are now beginning to run on
electronic mail and cannot afford the clutter and distractions
posed by spam.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, a co-founder and former executive of Freeloader, an
Internet software company, as well as a former executive at America
Online, said his new company had raised $5.5 million in venture
capital backing from Accel Partners and individual investors who
include author and newsletter publisher Esther Dyson and Benjamin
Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also has a strategic alliance with Sendmail
Inc., which developed and supports the most widely used software
for routing e-mail over the Internet, has built a tracking system
that will detect spam sent to special decoy addresses established
for that purpose. All other copies of those messages can then be
blocked with a ``spam wall'' that will be installed on the
mail-server computers of Internet service providers and corporate
users.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light also has a technology alliance with Software.com, a
software developer focusing on electronic mail systems for large
Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other technology-based efforts to combat
spam, including special filtering features in the Sendmail server
and a blocking service maintained by a group of volunteers known as
the Black Hole List. But spam presents service providers with
thorny problems, including the problem of ``false positives'' _
mail blocked because it seems to be spam but actually is not.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this problem, the heart of the Bright Light system is a
monitoring center where human operators assess messages that have
been trapped by the decoy e-mail addresses. But Paul acknowledged
that even the most sophisticated filtering system will fail to stop
all spam, as spammers learn to adopt to the new countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem in combating spam is that the cost of sending
spam is remarkably low. Spammers can go into operation by
purchasing a piece of software that costs as little as several
hundred dollars and then purchasing lists of e-mail addresses that
are also inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bright Light system will permit network operators to let
users choose whether they want the spam filter on or off or set to
filter only certain categories of spam.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of the Bright Light system is scheduled to begin on
Monday, with an eye toward commercial operation by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said Bright Light will produce a spam index to help gather
better statistics on the actual network impact of junk e-mail. The
company also plans to post a spam ``calculator'' on its Web site
(www.brightlight.com), which will enable Internet users to compute
an economic cost of spam, based on the assumptions they enter.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have passed laws outlawing spam and there at
least six bills pending in Congress attempting to control junk
e-mail.

CONGRESS CHALLENGES STATE INTERNET FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Iowa, Ohio, N.D., N.M., S.D., Tenn., Wis.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taxes on Internet users' access to cyberspace may become a
contentious political issue this fall in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for controversy at the state level is congressional
legislation called the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which the House
passed unanimously last month. The Senate, after a hearing last
week by its Finance Committee, is expected to vote on the measure
soon. The legislation would effectively ban taxes on Internet
access, but it includes a grandfather clause that would allow eight
states with existing taxes to continue to impose them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. The legislatures of the eight states would
have to vote to re-enact their taxes, and governors would have to
sign the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some state and local government officials say that this
requirement is a back-door route to killing the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a grandfather clause; that's a dead man's clause,''
said Eugene Gavin, the commissioner of the Department of Revenue
Services in Connecticut, one of the eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shafroth, policy director for the National League of
Cities, said: ``All eight states have Republican governors, and for
seven it's election time this fall. And there is such incredible
terror these days when anyone accuses you of wanting to raise taxes
that at most two of these states will have the courage to re-enact
their existing tax law.'' In addition to Connecticut, the other
states are Iowa, Ohio, North Dakota, New Mexico, South Dakota,
Tennessee and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Shafroth and other critics of the bill say that its content is
being heavily influenced by the lobbying campaign dominated by
America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lobbying is 90 percent AOL,'' Shafroth said.
</P>
<P>
   Shafroth and Gavin said that because America Online had refused
to collect and turn over sales taxes on its subscriber fees, it was
eager to find some way to escape liabilities owed to the eight
states and to four others that will not try to re-enact access-fee
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Fishbein, an America Online lawyer working on the bill,
said that ``the grandfather clause is a compromise for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We favored no grandfather clause,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   America Online does not collect state and local taxes on
subscriber fees because it believes it is not obligated to, she
said, but it does collect such taxes in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The company's terms of service for subscribers explicitly stated
until recently that America Online would not pay any sales or use
taxes that might be due. Within the last month, however, the
company posted a change to those terms, which now advise
subscribers that ``you are responsible for all charges incurred,
including applicable taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fishbein would not comment on the potential tax liability
America Online would face if it were forced to pay these taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The size of America Online's potential liability, including
interest and penalties, could easily reverse the positive cash
flow, which came to less than $6 million, that the company reported
in its most recent annual financial statement. Connecticut alone
says it is owed $3 million through September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If America Online cannot find a way to block these tax bills, it
would be faced with either having to go back and bill customers,
who may not react warmly to having a separate charge added months
or years after they used the service, or paying the bill itself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Fishbein declined to comment on the effect that the
re-enactment provision of the federal legislation would have in
achieving America Online's goal of ending the Internet taxes in the
eight states. ``I'm a tax lawyer, not a political consultant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fishbein also said she was aware that there was a widely
held impression among opponents of the bill that America Online was
virtually alone in pressing to eliminate the access-fee taxes. That
impression exists, she said, because America Online is based in
Dulles, Va., a suburb of Washington, and is therefore highly
visible on Capitol Hill. She said that virtually every Internet
access provider was active in seeking a ban on the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin, the Connecticut tax official, said that America Online
was the only company that had fought his state's sales tax on
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state recently surveyed thousands of individuals and
businesses asking for ``areas of our tax system that are
troublesome for you, and not one person or business _ not one _
brought up taxing Internet access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is solely an AOL issue,'' he continued. ``Every other
major online provider, like Prodigy and Erols, is charging the 6
percent tax to the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut will collect $7 million this year, he said, and has
cut the tax to 4 percent from 6 percent, with annual reductions
until it is phased out on June 30, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL says our tax is unfair, but if anything, other businesses
should say we are being unfair to them because they pay the full 6
percent and AOL and other Internet access providers only have to
pay 4 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online has filed a lawsuit in state court to block
collection of the $3 million the state sought through September
1996.
</P>
<P>
   All eight states that would have to re-enact their Internet
taxes have legislative races this fall, and all but North Dakota
have gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors
Association, said that governors gave in to the provision
reluctantly in negotiations over the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good practice for the federal government to tell the
states they have to re-enact a law if they want to keep it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Tax Freedom Act is seen by cyberspace industries as
critical to the growth of electronic commerce. These companies say
that having to comply with the sales tax rules of 30,000 local
governments would overwhelm them and lead to multiple taxes on some
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you are an AOL subscriber in Connecticut and you took your
laptop on a trip and accessed the Internet from your hotel room,''
Ms. Fishbein said in a hypothetical example. ``That access would be
subject to the Texas sales tax on information services.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the tax issues raised by Internet access and commerce
were never contemplated when most sales tax laws were adopted in
the Great Depression or even in Connecticut's law, which was
adopted in 1975 primarily as a way to tax the purchase of data put
online by companies and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., a co-sponsor of the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, said at the Senate hearing last week that the Internet
``should be a global, tariff-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said talk that taxes could smother
an infant electronic commerce industry was absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet companies are not struggling to come up with
capital,'' he said, adding that the proposed act would bias tax
policy in favor of electronic commerce.

U.S. ON-LINE BROKERS EYE EUROPEAN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Calif., Neb.)  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Alan English has an addiction, and he's not ashamed to
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I log on every day, sometimes from the office, in the morning
and in the evening,'' English, a 51-year old computer consultant,
said like a boy taken with a new toy. ``Some days I don't trade;
some days I trade four or five times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the cost of a trade and the spread on
shares can be quite significant,'' English said, still hooked a
year and a half after he began shopping for stocks over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   English is one of a growing number of Europeans with online
investment fever. After years of relying on elaborate social
security systems, Europeans are being urged by their governments to
take a greater hand in planning their financial futures. The result
is a stock market boom. And as surfing the World Wide Web gains
popularity, more and more Europeans are logging on to shop for
financial products, retrieving detailed financial information and
buying and selling shares.
</P>
<P>
   True, compared with the United States, where about 20 percent of
all stock trades are now entered over the Internet, the movement is
in its infancy. But as the trend gathers force, U.S. Internet
brokers have begun moving into Britain and are increasingly setting
eyes on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrival poses a challenge for the few and fledgling
European online trading companies _ whose ambitions are for the
moment limited to individual national markets, in contrast to the
global strivings of their U.S. competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, experts expect the arrival of the Americans to accelerate
big changes in the securities business that are already under way
as Europe forges itself into a single market.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the trend more apparent than here in Britain. In
April, Charles Schwab started an online trading service, and in
June, the E-Trade Group, based in Palo Alto, Calif., announced a
joint venture with a British partner, as well as licensing
agreements in Germany. Other Internet brokers, like Ameritrade and
DLJ Direct, part of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, are studying
moves to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. brokers, under competitive pressure at home that is
reducing profit margins, are being drawn to the lucrative potential
of Europe, where the idea of a discount broker is still novel, said
Stephen Eckett, author of ``Investing Online,'' a leading guide to
Internet investment.
</P>
<P>
   Eckett said that fees at full-service brokers in Britain for the
purchase of $10,000 of stock in a British company would amount to
about $120, while the going commission for acquiring over the World
Wide Web the equivalent amount of U.S. depository receipts,
securities distributed in the United States based on the same
foreign stock, could be as low as $9.
</P>
<P>
   Though Europeans can already use U.S. online brokers to buy
shares in the United States, the Americans do not actively promote
this business for fear of rankling European securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, at the start, the U.S. online brokers operating in Europe,
like Schwab, are offering their customers the chance to trade only
on individual national exchanges. The long-range goal, however, is
to gradually expand the system into a truly global marketplace
where investors in any country will be able to trade shares freely
across national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. online brokers, despite their aggressive plans, will
not have it easy. Computer penetration of European households lags
behind that in the United States, and those that do have computers
often do not use the Web _ in part because many Internet programs
are in English, rather than other European languages.
</P>
<P>
   But price is a factor, too, as the cost of Internet access in
Europe averages about $85 for 20 hours _ about four times that in
the United States _ according to a recent study of electronic
commerce by the business information group Phillips Tarifica.
</P>
<P>
   While European Internet use still lags behind that in the United
States, it is expected to burgeon in the next several years. In
Britain, for example, more than 12 million people, or about 20
percent of the population, are expected to be using the Internet by
2001, sharply higher than the 5.5 million at the end of 1997,
according to the market analysts IDC Research. That compares with a
projection of 40 percent in the United States by 2001.

   On a recent trip here, English, who lives in the northern city
of Sheffield, met with dozens of amateur Internet traders _ ranging
in age from the 20s to the 70s _ to forge plans for Web investor
clubs throughout Britain and to gain readers and contributors to a
weekly magazine that he and fellow private investors post on the
Web (www.angelfire.com/al/bbbugle).
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, unlike the United States, banks provide both banking
and full brokerage services. As a result, many people turn to their
banks or the banks' brokerage affiliates to trade securities.
</P>
<P>
   For European banks and brokers, the results of the U.S. invasion
will be to accelerate the spread of electronic financial services
that is already well under way, and presumably to bring prices
down. In Finland, 420,000 customers of Merita Bank, more than a
quarter of its client base, bank on line, including trading stocks
by computer. In Sweden, SE Banken operates a thriving online
banking and brokerage business, and one of the largest brokers, DT
Securities, lets customers trade on the fully electronic Stockholm
exchange through an online subsidiary called Nord Net.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, banks including Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank
operate all-electronic banks, and the main activity is stock
brokerage. In France, Groupe Wargny, whose brokerage arm is 19
percent owned by Dresdner, has established a strong presence with
its Telebourse online trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the European single currency, which is to gradually
replace national currencies beginning on Jan. 1, 1999, is expected
to foster the spread of stock trading across national borders. For
instance, the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and London recently
announced they would merge and invited other European exchanges to
join.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they have set up overseas operations, most U.S.
online brokers already have European customers. Michael Anderson,
president of Ameritrade, based in Omaha, Neb., which is studying
expansion into Europe, said that ``something under 1 percent'' of
Ameritrade's customers are overseas, notably investors in countries
like Britain and France who are mainly interested in acquiring
shares in U.S. companies. Ameritrade, he said, like other online
brokers that accept such business, requires customers to have U.S.
tax identification and have cash on deposit in their accounts
before they can trade.
</P>
<P>
   To build a European business, the U.S. brokers are applying
formulas that often correspond to those that worked at home.
Schwab, for example, built a beachhead in Britain, first by
acquiring Sharelink Investment Services, one of the largest British
discount brokers, in 1995 and earlier this year introducing online
brokerage services like it has in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwab also offers full-service brokerage services, and an
interactive phone system like its Telebroker service in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Schwab wants to encourage customers in Britain and the
United States to trade across the Atlantic, by enabling them to buy
and sell shares on both countries' stock exchanges _ which requires
payment, clearing arrangements and regulatory approval in New York
and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have the Web architecture,'' said Guy Knight, the
spokesman for Charles Schwab Europe, ``we will have the capacity to
release that across Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. companies, like E-Trade, are signing up local
partners, and licensing their systems to spread the risks. This
spring, E-Trade announced a joint venture in Britain and licensing
deals for Germany and Central Europe. Those moves followed the
start of operations in Canada and Australia, and go hand in hand
with expansion into Asian countries like Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving parallel on a number of markets,'' said Judy
Balint, E-Trade's head of global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Such aggressive expansion has European stock market regulators
off balance. With most brokers still aiming for customers in their
individual countries, regulatory systems have yet to be tested.
E-Trade began advertising its services in Britain even before
forming a joint venture there, but was whistled back by British
stock exchange regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Although most U.S. online brokers accept European customers for
trades on United States exchanges, they refrain from actively
advertising for such business so as to avoid rankling European
regulators, who worry about their inability to protect investors
who trade outside their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, differences between European governments and
Washington on how to protect consumer privacy have led to a clash
over computer browsing technologies that threatens to slow the
evolution of the Internet into a global supermarket for electronic
commerce, including securities trading. Web browser software like
the Netscape Navigator and the Microsoft Internet Explorer, which
are among the most commonly used in Europe, do not comply with
European privacy guidelines. They are seen as too easily enabling
businesses to collect information about Web surfers without their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, European banks and brokers are not waiting for
governments to protect their business. In Britain, Barclays PLC,
one of the largest banks with 2,500 branches throughout the
country, will be the first to fight off the competition when it
introduces its online brokerage service in September, complete with
financial information and a real-time share trading service.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Bungey, head of research and development at Barclays
Stockbrokers, said the system would quote prices to customers, who
would then have 15 seconds to respond. Barclays will let customers
trade shares in about 2,000 companies on the London Stock Exchange
and the Alternative Investment Market, a small-company market. In
the future, he said, Barclays wants to enable its customers to
trade electronically on U. S. markets, like Nasdaq, though clearing
and settlement problems remain to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Urquhart Stewart, the director of corporate development
at Barclays Stockbrokers, said brand loyalty could give domestic
European brokers a leg up on U.S. competition. ``We control 15 to
20 percent of the British market'' for stock trading, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the example of the insurance industry, which was shaken
in recent years when retailers like supermarkets began selling
insurance policies, only to see customers return en masse to
name-brand insurers like Prudential. ``Name brands are important to
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, some U.S. players have already dropped out of the
European game. Earlier this year, Fidelity Investments announced it
was shutting down its online discount brokerage business in London,
after computer problems drew criticism from London securities
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, too, U.S. online brokers may be squeezed by the
very revolution they have helped start. Investing Online's Eckett
predicts a ``major collapse'' of commission fees. He said that in
the United States, commissions on Internet trades had dipped as low
as $5 a transaction since Web trading began about four years ago.
``The same will happen in Europe,'' he predicted, as consumers surf
the Internet in search of cheaper financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some experts are betting that the change in European
investors' habits will ultimately play into the hands of the U.S.
online brokers and their global investing approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days in Britain, said Julian Costley, chief executive
of Electronic Share Information Ltd., the financial information
company that E-Trade chose for its British partner, ``the idea of
the stockbroker was slightly feared and respected.''
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted that Europeans would increasingly come to
regard stockbrokers the same way they do bank tellers _ as
irrelevant holdovers from an earlier, pre-electronic era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now longer queues at the ATM than inside at the
teller,'' he said, ``and hundreds of thousands of investors are out
there, playing into the hands of stateless companies, global
companies, with no brand baggage.''

INTERNET BROADCASTING: RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a piece of twine and run it between two empty dog food cans
and you have a sound transmission system with the approximate
quality of many audio broadcasts over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the stage of Carnegie Hall with 10 million $100 bills and
you would see the amount of money that investors have poured into
Broadcast.com Inc., a company devoted to putting radio and
television programs on the Internet. Investors are apparently
willing to overlook the current technical limitations of Internet
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the first day of trading after Broadcast.com's
initial public stock offering, the company's shares opened at $68,
nearly four times higher than its $18 offering price. That was the
biggest initial jump in the history of stock offerings in the
United States. The shares shot up to as high as $74 before closing
at $62.75. At that price, Broadcast.com has a total market value of
$1.06 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1995 by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban,
who began by putting the broadcasts of a Dallas radio station onto
the Internet through a computer in a friend's bedroom. Cuban, 39,
had run a computer consulting firm and a technology investment
fund. Wagner, 37, is a lawyer and a certified public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Cuban's share of the company stock is worth more than
$350 million. Wagner's stake exceeds $200 million. Broadcast.com
executives were unavailable for comment because the company is in
its government-mandated quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com, which is based in Dallas and recently changed its
name from Audionet, now offers transmissions of 345 radio stations,
flickery images from 17 television stations, games from 350 sports
teams and other talk and music programs.
</P>
<P>
   In return for helping broadcast stations extend their reach,
Broadcast.com receives some on-air commercial time slots to sell to
advertisers. It also can sell audio advertising that Internet
listeners hear before joining the program of their choice. The
company also sells on-screen ads that the audience members can view
while they are listening.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com also has a second business, broadcasting corporate
presentations, like meetings for analysts, over the Internet,
offering a lower cost alternative to telephone and video conference
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the company say that as the technology for Internet
broadcasting improves, Broadcast.com is in a prime position to
capitalize on a medium that could be far more compelling than the
text-based Internet is today.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts point out that the risk in its plans are at least
as great as the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the company is small, and spending nearly twice
as much money as it is taking in. In 1997, it lost $6.5 million on
revenue of $6.9 million. And the company's prospectus filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission says it expects the losses
to continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, there appears to be little the company can do to
defend against competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can do what they're doing,'' said David Simons,
managing director of Digital Video Investments, a research service.
``Net investors are impervious to the notion of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both ESPN Sportzone and CBS Sportsline have their own
Internet broadcasting service that competes with Broadcast.com's
sports services. And Broadcast.com has exclusive Internet rights to
only some of its programming. Other programs can be carried by its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com does have some programs that it will probably not
have to fight to keep, though. It runs a site called
www.policescanner.com, for example, which transmits the emergency
service radio broadcasts from New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. Not
only is that programming free _ it is supposed to sound like it is
coming in on two dog-food cans and twine.

 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinit Sethi, a New Yorker born and bred, was wired from days of
celebration in Jaipur, India, when he mounted a small white horse
to ride toward his bride. Dressed up like a Rajput prince, he
nervously adjusted his golden turban and the strands of plump
emeralds that hung around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   His wedding procession, led by a lumbering elephant, fairly
floated through the horn-honking, smoke-belching downtown traffic
like some royal fantasy, trailing a band of his Ivy League buddies,
merry revelers in Western suits. Sethi, a 24-year-old investment
banker who loved night clubbing, brought up the rear, his horse
prancing past mesmerized beggar children. All were bathed in the
fluorescent glow of green lights held aloft by small men in
flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   His bride, a shy, hazel-eyed beauty of 20 named Anshu Jain, was
waiting poolside at the Sheraton Rajputana. They had never kissed
or held hands. She came from a family in which no woman had ever
been allowed to call her husband by his given name. ``For a wife,
your husband is God,'' she explained. ``And you don't call God by
his first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Theirs might seem an unlikely union, this arranged marriage
between the cosmopolitan American son of Indian immigrants and a
sheltered Indian woman who had never set foot in America. Sethi's
friends from the University of Pennsylvania had warned him that he
should not consent to the match his mother had found for him in
India just because it was expected of him. And he worried he was
being ``flaky'' to agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   For Sethi, though, the marriage wasn't the inevitability it had
been for his immigrant parents. It was his own choice. And yet in
making that choice, he was casting his lot with a traditional way
of life, one that would bind him more closely to his own parents
and to India itself, and sustain that tie into yet another
generation of American children _ his own.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing to marry a woman of his mother's choosing, he
managed to be both quite American and quite Indian all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings with the concept,'' he said. ``I didn't
necessarily think I would go through with it. But my reservations
got pushed to the side when I met her. I had an incredible feeling
that this was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In modern immigrant families _ where the bindings between new
land and homeland are stronger than ever before _ the children
almost inevitably find themselves pushed and pulled between the
culture and values of their parents and those of the larger
American society.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambiguities are perhaps never more acute than when a
decision about marriage _ the arc of one's life _ is at hand. But
what emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's wedding is the
way many of these children search for, and find solace and
grounding in, their connections to the world back home.
</P>
<P>
   Sethi grew up in a tightly knit community of Indian gemstone
merchants who, over three decades, have carved out a sizable niche
in the historically Orthodox Jewish world of the diamond district
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they scattered to upscale apartment buildings in the
city and homes in predominantly white suburbs, these Indian
families banded together in their business and social lives. They
vacationed together in the Poconos. The sons skied together. The
daughters took Indian classical dance together. And they still
unite in Jaipur for events like the Sethi wedding.
</P>
<P>
   They have held onto their socially conservative culture, fending
off the onslaught of Americanization, by constant use of those
totems of modernity _ telephone, fax, e-mail message and jet plane.
</P>
<P>
   The fathers go back and forth most often, carrying satchels of
gems folded up in tidy paper packets, each flight a thread
stitching their lives here and there together. But the wives and
children also go to India every year for weddings, family visits
and religious pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their wealth and their business ties to India, these
families are among the immigrants, Indian and otherwise, most
intensely connected to their homelands. But their experience is
common to immigrants from all over the world who have taken
advantage of skills and contacts developed in America and back home
to build businesses and transoceanic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the gemstone traders are held together by what they
describe as a shared Indian idea of family, one that sees
American-style individualism as a form of egoism that has fostered
premarital sex, disrespect, divorce and other social ills.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking back not just to India, but to a remembered
India.
</P>
<P>
   ``India has changed tremendously, especially in the big
cities,'' said Jyoti Pandya, one of the gemstone traders. ``All the
young ones there are trying to catch up with the West. Our
children, we teach them the values of 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And the heart of that teaching is a customary observance of
hierarchies, with the child giving deference to the parent, the
daughter-in-law to the mother-in-law, the wife to the husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies have to admit that the husband is more powerful,''
explained Haridas Kotahwala, a leading trader in the circle that
also includes the Sethis. ``It is better to surrender than to have
all these arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the parents still consider themselves Indians, their
children have grown up attending American schools, going to
American movies, watching American television. Striving and
ambitious, they often chafe at their parents' expectations. Just as
often, they say they value the comfort and security of their
affectionate, protective families.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Christmas holidays, many of them traveled to the city
of Jaipur in northwest India for the Sethi wedding. Several, like
Pandya's daughter, Komal, a Columbia University freshman, watched
the wedding with more than academic interest. They are entering
their marriageable years _ and choosing arranged marriages with
open eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American girl dates a guy and she doesn't know much about
him _ how he was brought up, his moral standards,'' Miss Pandya
said. ``I trust my parents to look for someone who will give me the
life I've been brought up to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dissonance between her American and Indian identities
emerged as she talked about her place in such a marriage. In one
breath, she said, ``I would never set aside family for career.''
And in the next, she said, ``I don't want my husband to be my
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she looked confused: ``I'm like, oh yeah, I'm going to have
my own identity and I'm going to be a demure wife. It is
contradictory and hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how these young Indian-Americans will seek to harmonize
these clashing values remains to be seen. What is clear is that
they feel little pressure to shed their ethnicity like some
unwanted skin. ``It's like P.C. that if my mom wants to be an
Indian and wear a sari, it's OK,'' said Kotahwala's niece, Shweta,
a 19-year-old international business major at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be sorting out just who they are on their own
terms. Sethi, back in New York, is struggling to establish himself
and his wife as a couple apart, within the close embrace of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   After honeymooning in the old royal city of Udaipur _ and Disney
World _ they have settled into a one-bedroom New York City
apartment, in a traditional Indian family arrangement, across the
hall from his parents. But Sethi has also undertaken to expose his
bride to the Americana he loves. He has inflicted his old
``Seinfeld'' videotapes on her and taken her to Macy's, a Yankees
game and the Great American Scream Machine at Six Flags.
</P>
<P>
   And he has urged her to become a more independent, modern woman
_ to go back to college, to wear jeans, to do what would have been
unthinkable to her only a year ago: call her husband by his first
name.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Mother: Finding a Match For a Fine Catch
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Sethi is a guardian of family traditions, a woman who has
given her life to her husband and two sons. As her boys grew up,
she devotedly hand rolled the roti for their lunches, pushed them
to study hard, instilled in them the family's religious values. She
never once hired a baby sitter, not even for an evening. And as
Vinit, the older son, came of age, her matchmaking instincts kicked
in.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sethi knew he was a fine catch. At New York City's
hypercompetitive Stuyvesant High School, he had excelled
academically, but never dated. At Penn, where he graduated summa
cum laude, he dated occasionally, but never had a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He took a job straight out of college with Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.,
the white-shoe investment bank, and promptly moved in across the
hall from his parents. Many nights he dined on his mother's cooking
in the room where he had slept on a Murphy bed as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Vinit was 23 that Mrs. Sethi told him it was time to
stop ``goofing around'' and marry. If he wanted to pick his own
wife in the American way, she told him, that was fine _ as long as
the girl was a strict vegetarian. If the newlyweds planned to live
across the hall, ``I would have to get along with her and she would
have to get along with me, emotionwise, foodwise and livingwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinit told his mother he had no marriage plans. He had not yet
decided between a match of his parents' making and one of his own.
Either way, though, ``I always knew I'd probably end up getting
married to someone who wasn't very American, because I'm not myself
in some ways,'' he said. ``There's a certain level of individualism
in American relationships I don't agree with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Sethi quickly went into action. ``I had an agenda,'' she
said. ``I began spreading the word with friends and family in
Bombay and Jaipur.'' She planned a trip to India, but Vinit,
immersed in his job and in no hurry to wed, refused to go.
</P>
<P>
   The news that she was looking for a bride spread like wildfire.
She received a package from a family friend in Dallas about a
relative in India, Anshu Jain. It included Miss Jain's ``bio
data,'' a kind of resume for arranged-marriage prospects (Age: 19;
Height: 5 feet 5 inches; Complexion: Fair), and an unprepossessing
photo of an unsmiling young woman in a stiff pose, one arm crossed
over the other. Mrs. Sethi set the envelope aside, barely giving it
a thought.
</P>
<P>
   Some months later, in January 1997, she set out for India. In
Jaipur _ where her father once had an emerald-cutting factory _ she
met several nice young women from good families. Then, while she
was in Bombay visiting her husband's family, Miss Jain, her father
and two uncles came to call.
</P>
<P>
   The willowy, soft-spoken Miss Jain walked in looking nothing
like the gawky young woman in the photo. She quickly won over
Vinit's grandmother, uncle, aunt, assorted cousins _ and, most
important, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anshu had a softness,'' Mrs. Sethi recalled. ``She was very
down to earth, very simple, very humble. It just clicked.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Sethi returned to New York, she and her son met for
coffee at Dean &AMP; DeLuca near Rockefeller Center. She described the
young women she had met, ranking the top four and their respective
virtues. Always, Miss Jain headed the list. Her background was
quite compatible with the Sethis'. She, too, was from a
conservative family that followed Jainism _ a religion of
nonviolence and vegetarianism, honesty and frugality. Her father
ran a rental car company and an elastic factory.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, Vinit flew to Hyderabad to meet her. His
college friends teased him mercilessly. At a party before he left,
one of them brought out a cake topped with a plastic married couple
and the words, ``Happy 17th Birthday,'' suggesting he was going to
be married off to a teen-ager. ``I was a little spooked by the
whole situation,'' he acknowledged. But he told himself he could
always refuse the match.
</P>
<P>
   The first day he and Anshu met, they spoke about hobbies,
school, siblings. He was charmed, but felt he needed to know her
better. But Miss Jain's family customarily allowed its daughters
only a brief pre-engagement glimpse of the men they were to wed; a
girl's reputation, essential to her marriageability, had to be
carefully guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknown to the rest of her family, her father decided to allow
another meeting. The next day, he sent one of his veteran drivers
to pick up Vinit. During hours of talk in the back of the car, she
told him of her bare-bones needs: ``A guy who's patient and who
doesn't smoke or eat tobacco.'' He, in turn, told her about his
more complex requirements: a woman with whom he connected
emotionally and who shared his commitment to family.
</P>
<P>
   He knew there was no chance for a third meeting. He had to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   He flew to Bombay the next day and waited to see if the spell
would lift. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He said yes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gem Trade: A Generation Heads for New York
</P>
<P>
   Haridas Kotahwala, dapper in a finely checked blazer and
pristine white shirt, strode through a warren of dusty alleyways in
Jaipur's Tripolia Bazaar, oblivious to the meandering sacred cows
and scrawny dogs, his briefcase swinging at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son in one of the 30 families that dominate the
Jaipur gem trade, the 59-year-old Kotahwala has lived in New York
for three decades. He had brought his wife and son to Jaipur for
the Sethi wedding, but on this sun-drenched day, he was on his way
to meet some gem brokers at the family's cutting and polishing
factory.

   Up a narrow, twisting flight of stairs, he emerged into a
courtyard surrounded by rooms filled with the soft clicking sound
of lapidaries at work. Soon he was sitting shoeless and
cross-legged on a white floor mat, as comfortable haggling for
sapphires and emeralds with the cell-phone-toting brokers as he was
a few months later politely selling those stones from a booth at a
trade show at the Javits Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jaipur has been the center of India's colored gemstone industry
since the 1700s. Today, the gem business is Jaipur's largest
employer and gems and jewelry India's second-largest source of
foreign exchange _ $5.6 billion a year _ after textiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian jewelry trade, and the men of Kotahwala's generation,
truly came of age in the late 1960s, thanks to the globalization of
the economy and changing American immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had excluded Indian immigrants in 1917. But while the
door was opened a crack in 1946, it was not until 1965, with the
passage of the Hart-Celler Immigration and Nationality Act, that
large numbers of Asian immigrants began arriving in America.
</P>
<P>
   This sea change came at a fortunate time for the gemstone
merchants. The demand for jewels in India had declined
precipitously with the demise of its many princely states after
independence from Britain in 1947. Several pioneering traders had
discovered New York as jewelry exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair.
The vast American consumer market beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   The Kotahwala matriarch, Shyama Devi Kotahwala, said she worried
that Haridas and his younger brother, Vinod, would be influenced by
``the spoiled culture of America.'' She fretted that they would
neglect her in her old age, that their children might marry outside
their merchant caste and Hindu religion, perhaps even to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with great trepidation, the families sent forth their
young men to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kotahwala arrived in 1968 and rented a $200-a-month studio
apartment in the diamond district, where he lived and worked. To
break into a trade dominated by European and American Jews, he went
door to door with a sample case, a confident, gossipy salesman
slowly building a clientele. The Sethis arrived in New York four
years later, after Shashi's father offered to help her carefully
chosen husband, Dilip Sethi, gain a foothold in the emerald
business.
</P>
<P>
   There were then only a few thousand Indians in New York. In
Manhattan, the traders say they found just two Indian restaurants
and one grocery, where the owner never let them squeeze the
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, New York's Indian population has swelled to 200,000, and
the gem merchants' trade group includes 230 companies. Some of the
more prominent clans, like the Kotahwalas, have become to families
what multinational corporations are to businesses _ entities that
transcend borders.
</P>
<P>
   The Kotahwala family straddles America and the Subcontinent,
with offices also in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, Bangkok and Hong
Kong. Haridas and Vinod Kotahwala are based in New York, in a
modern office in a sleek high-rise; for many years they lived
together, with their families, in Queens. The other two brothers,
in Jaipur, live with their mother, wives and children, in an aging
mansion, called a haveli, within the terra cotta-colored walls of
the old city.
</P>
<P>
   And the pattern will continue: Haridas Kotahwala has a son In
New York and another in Jaipur, and he recently set up a company
for them, Royal India U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Technology makes the Kotahwalas' way of life possible. The
brothers here and there live with ears glued to telephones as they
confer about deals. Their fax machines hum with orders. Their
mother talks to her sons in New York by phone every week. She flies
to America, and her sons and their families to Jaipur. Her hand in
the family, as the matriarch, is still strong.
</P>
<P>
   The family members move easily through the looking glass
dividing the two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-bedroom haveli, with its worn, aging couches in ascetic
common spaces, is in the raucous heart of the Tripolia Bazaar.
Outside, the streets are choked with bicycle rickshaws, motor
scooters and carts drawn by camels with flowers perched on their
noses and elaborate patterns shaved into their hides. Inside, Mrs.
Kotahwala makes the rules, deciding on the menus (no onion or
garlic), directing the servants.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the matriarch arrives for a few months with Vinod
and his wife, Shushma, who is 42, in their white stucco house in
Queens. There, the streets are orderly, the yew hedges manicured
and the only sounds in the house on a quiet afternoon are the
stately ticking of a grandfather clock and the tinkle of a teacup
on its saucer. The two younger children attend private school, and
on the advice of teachers, their mother has stopped speaking to
them in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the matriarch in town, the customs are those of the
Indian family. ``I wear traditional Indian saris in front of her,
no pants or Western clothes,'' said Shushma. ``I cook the way she
likes. It's an obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   In her religious observances, Shushma Kotahwala also follows the
way of her husband's family. She has set up a small shrine in a
window seat of her bedroom, with an incense burner and statuettes
of Krishna.
</P>
<P>
   In Jaipur for the Sethi wedding, Shushma and her daughter Shweta
journeyed to sacred places in and around Mathura, the birthplace of
Krishna. As they moved from a windowless temple, where the visage
of the family swami stared down from the saffron-colored wall, to
shops where her daughter bought gaudy prints of Krishna, to the
legendary mountain that Krishna held aloft on his finger, Shushma,
so serious before, became girlish, almost giddy.
</P>
<P>
   The trips to India come with many familial duties, but among the
streaming multitudes of worshipers bearing sweets and tins of milk
to pour on the black mountainside in offering to Krishna, she
seemed exalted, her faith refreshed and her spirit renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The Daughter: Starting the Search For a Suitable Man
</P>
<P>
   Shushma Kotahwala had more than one wedding on her mind on her
winter trip to Jaipur. The time had come to begin looking for a
husband for 19-year-old Shweta.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kotahwala herself had married at 20, after learning the
refined arts of embroidery, stitching, doll making, classical
Indian dance and English literature. Her arranged marriage, she
said, was her destiny _ and it brought her to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can change their destiny,'' she said. ``That's what I
believe and what most Indians believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter's destiny, Mrs. Kotahwala said, is likely to lie in
India, in an extended family with her husband and his relations _
and that means her youth is crucial. If a woman is 25 or 26, ``It
becomes hard to mold the girl into the family _ and you get
divorce,'' she said. ``If the girl is young, she can be molded and
it will unite the family. She won't have an independent way of
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman in her mid-20s may also have lost her physical charms:
``Maybe the boy can reject you because you don't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kotahwala passed out Shweta's bio data to close friends and
relatives, including her brother-in-law, Pramod Kotahwala, who
lives in Jaipur and so would continue the search when she returned
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kotahwala explained the practicalities of arranging a marriage.
In Shweta's case, he said, the goal is to find her a family from a
big city since she is accustomed to life in New York. Whether the
young man is from Bombay or Delhi, or even Singapore or Hong Kong,
matters little. ``Ultimately, these families are based in India,''
he said. ``The connection has to be started here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the young man should have prospects: ``We're looking for a
boy who's settled in a business, not a profession, taking his own
decisions, not necessarily earning much. I want to be able to smell
the growth in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shweta's wedding itself will be a costly multiday affair. He
estimated the expense at $200,000 to $300,000 _ for clothes, a sum
of money to take with her into the marriage, a set of jewels and
the celebration for 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Kotahwalas live simply in the Jaipur haveli, in part to save
for the weddings of the family's unmarried daughters and for the
jewels of future daughters-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The son's wife has to have the same jewels as the other
daughters-in-law,'' he said, ``or she will have a complex because
she is living in the joint family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shweta, who was born in India and has gone back and forth all
her life, says she welcomes an arranged marriage, even if it takes
her to Calcutta or Bombay. She also wants to finish college first,
which should take a year _ and her parents agree.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 13 years of her life, Shweta and her immediate
family lived in New York with her Uncle Haridas' family. She knows
life in a joint Indian family and the art of compromise that keeps
it operating smoothly. She enjoys living in a house where she is
never alone. While other children played Nintendo after school, she
was home squabbling endlessly with her cousin Vishal. ``He'd want
falafel,'' she said. ``I'd want pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian culture is deeply rooted in her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to walk away from it _ out of the house _ I can,''
she said. ``But I don't need to. I don't want to. I'm happy. That's
a part of who I am. That's my individuality.''

<P>
   The Wedding Day: American Rap And Indian Pop
</P>
<P>
   They came from New York and Houston, New Delhi and Jaipur, the
hundreds of people who poured into Jaipur's main auditorium on Dec.
25 for a gala evening of talent-show performances by the young
friends and family of the Sethis. The women wore their finest saris
in vivid hues of orange, pink and red. Their ear lobes, necks and
fingers glittered with emeralds, diamonds and rubies.
</P>
<P>
   Young men and women danced to Indian pop. Sethi's younger
brother, Vaibhav, a student at the University of Michigan, lip
synched to the rapper Notorious B.I.G., then performed a rap of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   It all started out way back in January,
</P>
<P>
   When Mom met Anshu and this story began.
</P>
<P>
   Mom thought, `Wow,'' she's perfect for my Beta.
</P>
<P>
   But Vinit said, ``No, not know, maybe lata.
</P>
<P>
   The brother wound up with a typically Indian wedding wish: ``Now
let the wedding proceed, let's have some fun. This little story's
over, now let's see a Sethi son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York girls'' _ Shweta Kotahwala, Komal Pandya and a
Barnard College freshman named Anjali Rawat _ swirled and undulated
across the stage to the beat of Indian movie tunes, singing along
in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Rawat was awaiting her own arranged marriage in Jaipur the
following year to a young man from a family of Indian
industrialists. They were engaged when she was 18, just after she
graduated from the Brearley School, one of New York City's prep
school hothouses for the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   While she had always known that she would ``be arranged,'' she
said she was shocked that it had happened so soon, and threw a few
tantrums. Eventually, though, she accepted it, and with
considerable sadness has given up finishing her education at
Barnard and her dream of becoming a television news announcer;
instead, she will follow her husband to London or India. ``I wish
it didn't have to be this way,'' she said, ``but I can't really do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinit and Anshu watched from the audience. Since their
engagement, they had come to know each other by talking for hours
by telephone, running up $500-a-month bills at 69 cents a minute.
Still, they seemed a bit awkward and frazzled later that evening as
they stood together, she in a long white dress, he in a suit. Their
hands never touched.
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon, the Sethi family and friends gathered
beneath a gaily colored tent for the wedding procession. Vinit
smiled broadly when his college friends clustered around him,
joshing him about the wealth of gemstones strung around his neck.
``He's the million dollar man,'' one said, to the laughter of all.
When they drifted away, Vinit remained on his horse, alone, his
expression frozen into a tight, distracted smile.
</P>
<P>
   At about 7 p.m., he reached his bride at the hotel. But only
after a five-hour reception around the pool did the marriage
ceremony itself actually begin _ at a time the astrologers had
designated as the most auspicious.
</P>
<P>
   The Newlyweds: A Couple Apart, Within the Family
</P>
<P>
   Since the wedding, Anshu Sethi and her mother-in-law have
settled into a easy rhythm in the long hours when their husbands
are away at work. Anshu pads back and forth across the hallway
between the two apartments, a sweet-tempered companion always happy
to bring a tray of masala tea and salty snacks to afternoon
visitors or to learn to cook the dishes her husband likes.
</P>
<P>
   Most evenings, she and Vinit, who now works at a hedge fund,
have dinner with his parents, then retire to the apartment his
mother redecorated in soft greens, with a small shrine in a kitchen
cabinet stocked with incense, a prayer scroll and a Jain painting.
When they go out, they seem like any other young couple newly in
love _ teasing, holding hands, sharing food from each other's
plates.
</P>
<P>
   Vinit's mother declares that she has found a new daughter in
Anshu. And she loves having her son and his wife so close by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Vinit,'' she said, ```Living with you is the
happiest thing that can happen to me in my life. But I'm not going
to blackmail you for your presence. It has to be your and Anshu's
decision.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anshu seems to have slipped easily into the life of her new
family. Which is not to say that there haven't been some
adjustments. The new Mrs. Sethi sometimes finds herself caught
between the different expectations of her mother-in-law and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the question of what she wears. Mrs.
Sethi has insisted that when Anshu is at home, she wear a salwar
kameez, a long flowing tunic over pants _ no jeans or Western
attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many friends in the building,'' the mother-in-law
explained. ``The Rawats and Jhalanis, those ladies all wear saris
and so do their daughters-in-law. Salwars are one step more casual
than saris.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinit has conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's law,'' he said. ``The jurisdiction of Shashi Sethi
decides Anshu will wear salwars in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his mother have also differed over Anshu's education. She
had already graduated from a college in India, but Vinit felt
strongly that she should begin earning an American degree soon
after the wedding. But his mother was cautious about moving the
young woman too far, too fast. In the spring, Mrs. Sethi still felt
she needed to accompany her daughter-in-law whenever she left the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinit has to take an interest in her growing up, expanding her
horizons,'' his mother said. ``I also don't want her to limit
herself just to the house. But right now, I'm not ready for her to
go alone in New York City. She seems like a foreigner, not because
of dress, but because there is a look of curiosity on her face that
makes her vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Anshu herself was torn. Her parents in Hyderabad had warned her,
she said, that the issue should not become ``an object of my
mother-in-law's discontent with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The push-and-pull of the joint family, though, has had a happy
outcome in this case. Anshu has applied to college for the fall.
She is now venturing out on her own to the placement tests and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mummyji supports it now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds plan to have children in a few years, and have
already decided they will speak Hindi to them. Like his parents
before them, Vinit and Anshu will fly often to India to see her
family and his, propelling their children into the back-and-forth
life that knits India and America together. &QL;

 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinit Sethi, a New Yorker born and bred, was wired from days of
celebration in Jaipur, India, when he mounted a small white horse
to ride toward his bride. Dressed up like a Rajput prince, he
nervously adjusted his golden turban and the strands of plump
emeralds that hung around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   His wedding procession, led by a lumbering elephant, fairly
floated through the horn-honking, smoke-belching downtown traffic
like some royal fantasy, trailing a band of his University of
Pennsylvania buddies, merry revelers in Western suits. Sethi, a
24-year-old investment banker who loved night clubbing, brought up
the rear, his horse prancing past mesmerized beggar children. All
were bathed in the fluorescent glow of green lights held aloft by
small men in flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   His bride, a shy, hazel-eyed beauty of 20 named Anshu Jain, was
waiting poolside at the Sheraton Rajputana. They had never kissed
or held hands. She came from a family in which no woman had ever
been allowed to call her husband by his given name. ``For a wife,
your husband is God,'' she explained. ``And you don't call God by
his first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Theirs might seem an unlikely union, this arranged marriage
between the cosmopolitan American son of Indian immigrants and a
sheltered Indian woman who had never set foot in America.
</P>
<P>
   For Sethi, though, the marriage was not the inevitability it had
been for his immigrant parents. It was his own choice. And yet in
making that choice, he was casting his lot with a traditional way
of life, one that would bind him more closely to his own parents
and to India itself, and sustain that tie into yet another
generation of American children _ his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed feelings with the concept,'' he said. ``I didn't
necessarily think I would go through with it. But my reservations
got pushed to the side when I met her. I had an incredible feeling
that this was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In modern immigrant families _ where the bindings between new
land and homeland are stronger than ever before _ the children
almost inevitably find themselves pushed and pulled between the
culture and values of their parents and those of the larger
American society.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambiguities are perhaps never more acute than when a
decision about marriage _ the arc of one's life _ is at hand. But
what emerges at defining moments like Vinit Sethi's wedding is the
way many of these children search for, and find solace and
grounding in, their connections to the world back home.
</P>
<P>
   Sethi grew up in a tightly knit community of Indian gemstone
merchants who, over three decades, have carved out a sizable niche
in the historically Orthodox Jewish world of the diamond district
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their wealth and their business ties to India, these
families are among the immigrants, Indian and otherwise, most
intensely connected to their homelands. But their experience is
common to immigrants from all over the world who have taken
advantage of skills and contacts developed in America and back home
to build businesses and transoceanic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the parents still consider themselves Indians, their
children have grown up attending American schools, going to
American movies, watching American television. Striving and
ambitious, they often chafe at their parents' expectations. Just as
often, however, they say they value the comfort and security of
their affectionate, protective families.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Christmas holidays, many of the gem merchants and their
families traveled to the city of Jaipur in northwest India for the
Sethi wedding. Several of the children, like Komal Pandya, a
Columbia University freshman, watched the wedding with more than
academic interest. They are entering their marriageable years _ and
choosing arranged marriages with open eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American girl dates a guy and she doesn't know much about
him _ how he was brought up, his moral standards,'' Miss Pandya
said. ``I trust my parents to look for someone who will give me the
life I've been brought up to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dissonance between her American and Indian identities
emerged as she talked about her place in such a marriage. In one
breath, she said, ``I would never set aside family for career.''
And in the next, she said, ``I don't want my husband to be my
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how these young Indian-Americans will seek to harmonize
these clashing values remains to be seen. What is clear is that
they feel little pressure to shed their ethnicity like some
unwanted skin.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother: Finding a Match For a Fine Catch
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Sethi is a guardian of family traditions, a woman who has
given her life to her husband and two sons. When the older son,
Vinit, was 23, Mrs. Sethi's matchmaking instincts kicked in and she
told him it was time to stop ``goofing around'' and marry. If he
wanted to pick his own wife in the American way, she told him, that
was fine _ as long as the girl was a strict vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   Vinit told his mother he had no marriage plans. He had not yet
decided between a match of his parents' making and one of his own.
Either way, though, ``I always knew I'd probably end up getting
married to someone who wasn't very American, because I'm not myself
in some ways,'' he said. ``There's a certain level of individualism
in American relationships I don't agree with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Sethi quickly went into action. ``I had an agenda,'' she
said. ``I began spreading the word with friends and family in
Bombay and Jaipur.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that she was looking for a bride spread like wildfire.
She received a package from a family friend in Dallas about a
relative in India, Anshu Jain. It included Miss Jain's ``bio
data,'' a kind of resume for arranged-marriage prospects (Age: 19;
Height: 5 feet 5 inches; Complexion: Fair), and an unprepossessing
photo of an unsmiling young woman in a stiff pose, one arm crossed
over the other. Mrs. Sethi set the envelope aside, barely giving it
a thought.
</P>
<P>
   Some months later, in January 1997, she set out for India. In
Jaipur _ where her father once had an emerald-cutting factory _ she
met several nice young women from good families. Then, while she
was in Bombay visiting her husband's family, Miss Jain, her father
and two uncles came to call.
</P>
<P>
   The willowy, soft-spoken Miss Jain walked in looking nothing
like the gawky young woman in the photo. She quickly won over
Vinit's grandmother, uncle, aunt, assorted cousins _ and, most
important, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anshu had a softness,'' Mrs. Sethi recalled. ``She was very
down to earth, very simple, very humble. It just clicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, Vinit flew to Hyderabad to meet her. ``I was
a little spooked by the whole situation,'' he acknowledged. But he
told himself he could always refuse the match.
</P>
<P>
   The first day he and Anshu met, they spoke about hobbies,
school, siblings. He was charmed, but felt he needed to know her
better. But Miss Jain's family customarily allowed its daughters
only a brief pre-engagement glimpse of the men they were to wed; a
girl's reputation, essential to her marriageability, had to be
carefully guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknown to the rest of her family, her father decided to allow
another meeting. The next day, he sent one of his drivers to pick
up Vinit. During hours of talk in the back of the car, she told him
of her bare-bones needs: ``A guy who's patient and who doesn't
smoke or eat tobacco.'' He, in turn, told her about his more
complex requirements: a woman with whom he connected emotionally
and who shared his commitment to family.
</P>
<P>
   He knew there was no chance for a third meeting. He had to
decide.

   The Wedding Day: American Rap And Indian Pop
</P>
<P>
   They came from New York and Houston, New Delhi and Jaipur, the
hundreds of people who poured into Jaipur's main auditorium on Dec.
25 for a gala evening of talent-show performances by the young
friends and family of the Sethis. The women wore their finest saris
in vivid hues of orange, pink and red. Their ear lobes, necks and
fingers glittered with emeralds, diamonds and rubies.
</P>
<P>
   Young men and women danced to Indian pop. Sethi's younger
brother, Vaibhav, a student at the University of Michigan, lip
synched to the rapper Notorious B.I.G., then performed a rap of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Vaibhav wound up with a typically Indian wedding wish: ``Now let
the wedding proceed, let's have some fun. This little story's over,
now let's see a Sethi son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York girls'' _ Shweta Kotahwala, Komal Pandya and a
Barnard College freshman named Anjali Rawat _ swirled and undulated
across the stage to the beat of Indian movie tunes, singing along
in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Rawat was awaiting her own arranged marriage in Jaipur the
following year to a young man from a family of Indian
industrialists. They were engaged when she was 18, just after she
graduated from the Brearley School, one of Manhattan's prep school
hothouses for the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   While she had always known that she would ``be arranged,'' she
said she was shocked that it had happened so soon, and threw a few
tantrums. Eventually, though, she accepted it, and with
considerable sadness has given up finishing her education at
Barnard and her dream of becoming a television news announcer;
instead, she will follow her husband to London or India. ``I wish
it didn't have to be this way,'' she said, ``but I can't really do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinit and Anshu watched from the audience. Since their
engagement, they had come to know each other by talking for hours
by telephone, running up $500-a-month bills at 69 cents a minute.
Still, they seemed a bit awkward and frazzled later that evening as
they stood together, she in a long white dress, he in a suit. Their
hands never touched.
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon, the Sethi family and friends gathered
beneath a gaily colored tent for the wedding procession. Vinit
smiled broadly when his college friends clustered around him,
joshing him about the wealth of gemstones strung around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   At about 7 p.m., he reached his bride at the hotel. But only
after a five-hour reception around the pool did the marriage
ceremony itself actually begin _ at a time the astrologers had
designated as the most auspicious.
</P>
<P>
   The Newlyweds: A Couple Apart, Within the Family
</P>
<P>
   Since the wedding, Anshu Sethi and her mother-in-law have
settled into a easy rhythm in the long hours when their husbands
are away at work. Most evenings, she and Vinit, who now works at a
hedge fund, have dinner with his parents, then retire to the
apartment across the hall, which his mother had redecorated in soft
greens, with a small shrine in a kitchen cabinet stocked with
incense and a prayer scroll. When they go out, they seem like any
other young couple newly in love _ teasing, holding hands, sharing
food from each other's plates.
</P>
<P>
   Vinit's mother declares that she has found a new daughter in
Anshu. And she loves having her son and his wife so close by.
</P>
<P>
   Anshu seems to have slipped easily into the life of her new
family. Which is not to say that there have not been some
adjustments. The new Mrs. Sethi sometimes finds herself caught
between the different expectations of her mother-in-law and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the question of what she wears. Mrs.
Sethi has insisted that when Anshu is at home, she wear a salwar
kameez, a long flowing tunic over pants that is one step more
casual than a sari _ no jeans or Western attire.
</P>
<P>
   Vinit has conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He and his mother have also differed over Anshu's education. She
had already graduated from a college in India, but Vinit felt
strongly that she should begin earning an American degree soon
after the wedding. But his mother was cautious about moving the
young woman too far, too fast. In the spring, Mrs. Sethi still felt
she needed to accompany her daughter-in-law whenever she left the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The push-and-pull of the joint family, though, has had a happy
outcome. Anshu has applied to college for the fall. She is now
venturing out on her own to the placement tests and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mummyji supports it now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds plan to have children in a few years, and have
already decided they will speak Hindi to them. Like his parents
before them, Vinit and Anshu will fly often to India to see her
family and his, propelling their children into the back-and-forth
life that knits India and America together.

UNZIPPIN' MY DOODAH: EXASPERATINGLY UNEVEN MUSICAL SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For political satirists, 1998 is turning out to be a
very good year. Washington hasn't produced such an irresistible
array of lampoonable personages since Gary Hart posed with Donna
Rice next to a boat called ``Monkey Business.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is where the Capitol Steps come in. The gang of
singing gunslingers from Washington is back in New York with a
(mostly) new comedy revue, ``Unzippin' My Doodah,'' that is
front-loaded with jabs at the newest members of the ``usual
suspects'' club _ Monica and Linda and Kenneth _ as well as at such
venerable targets as Bill and Hillary and Boris and Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the juiciest takeoffs and songs in this
exasperatingly uneven, 90-minute show have nothing to do with any
of the above. A Monica Lewinsky number, sung by Elaina Newport
(``Why are there so many/ Songs about bimbos?'') and another
spoofing the woman who taped her _ ``That's 'cause the Linda Is a
Tripp,'' sung to ``The Lady Is a Tramp'' _ pack all the wallop of a
powder puff. They don't snap with the crispness of the group's
assaults on less obvious subjects, like the clothier Sy Syms,
overaggressive telemarketers and the entry of India and Pakistan
into the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   What? You don't find underground atomic bomb tests funny? That's
exactly why the troupe's pairing of silly songs on the subject, to
the tunes of ``Lydia, the Tattooed Lady'' (``India, oh India ...
.'') and ``Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' (``Pakistani Bang Bang''),
makes you laugh: It's a topic that comes at you completely under
the radar, and one that doesn't yet feel overmilked.
</P>
<P>
   The show's loony opening number, ``Circle of Lies,'' is another
unexpected success. It does double duty as a parody of the
animal-parade opening of the Broadway version of ``The Lion King''
and as a sendup of the jungle on the Potomac. In the staging by
Mark Waldrop, though, you detect a strong whiff of ``Forbidden
Broadway,'' Gerard Alessandrini's long-running Broadway parody
revue.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Unzippin' My Doodah'' could take another lesson or
two from Mr. Alessandrini, because most of the Capitol Steps show
is not up to the tickling level of the opening or nuclear-test
numbers. Much more typically, a song begins as a sharp notion and
rapidly fizzles out, as when a certain New York senator is parodied
in ``He's delightful, he's de-lovely, he's D'Amato.'' The group
fails to develop its own idea of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato as the star
of a Cole Porter musical, and the number falls flat. (It's amazing
how often this pattern is repeated; the audience expresses its
frustration with a peculiarly energyless kind of applause.)
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the 14-person troupe rotate into the cast at
each performance. On a recent evening, the players were Ms.
Newport, Bill Strauss, Dolores King, Mike Tilford and Jamie
Zemarel, all of whom are pleasant if unexciting. Perfectly
painless, in fact. Like their show.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusted to 58 miles per hour at Chicago's Midway airport at
daybreak on Sunday as a cluster of thunderstorms blew through the
city. A similar group of thunderstorms, marking the leading edge of
sultry air, will likely buffet the central Appalachians in the
predawn hours on Monday before dissipating in the Middle Atlantic
states. The leftover clouds may keep afternoon readings from
reaching much above 90 degrees in parts of Virginia, Maryland and
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure in Quebec will direct a weak cold front eastward
from the St. Lawrence Valley. Humid air streaming into the
Northeast will be lifted by the approaching front triggering
thunderstorms in the northern Appalachians. One or two storms may
reach the coast late in the day. Offshore winds will allow the
hotter air to reach most of the beaches of the Northeast despite
only partial hazy sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   A new disturbance, which came onshore in British Columbia on
Sunday, will strengthen as it crosses the prairies of southern
Canada. Its circulation will draw torrid air into the northern
Plains with record maximums possible. As hot air moves into the
western Great Lakes, a few storms will erupt.
</P>
<P>
   A ribbon of very humid air stretching through the Ohio Valley
will be the focus of scattered thunderstorms. Afternoon
thundershowers will develop along the Southeast and Gulf coasts as
well as in the southern Rockies and the mountains of southern
California. The hot weather in the interior Northwest will be
tempered, but more record highs are anticipated in the central
Rockies and California's Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: The Heat Crest
</P>
<P>
   The towns of Ely, Nev., Rawlins, Wyo., and Milford, Utah, each
established new all-time maximums on Saturday with readings of 101,
99 and 107 respectively. Another dozen new daily records also
occurred on Sunday. Despite the extreme heat during the daylight
hours, most sections saw readings fall into the 60s and upper 50s
at night. The arid climate of the Great Basin allows for 40 degree
day-to-night variations, even during a record heat wave. As the
heat moves east this week, it will combine with humid air to
produce oppressive conditions from the Plains to the Atlantic
seaboard.

   Proposal to Curb Discounts on Stock Plans Is Dropped
</P>
<P>
   Faced with opposition from the technology industry and other
companies, accounting rule makers have stepped away from a proposal
that had threatened to end certain lucrative employee-stock plans.
The rules relate to stock-purchase plans in which employees can buy
company stock at a discount of more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board had proposed that if
companies wanted to give employees what is effectively more than a
15 percent discount, they would have to treat the discount as an
expense. To avoid that expense, many companies were expected to
limit their stock programs. But the board has decided to drop the
proposal.

   Henry Holt's Chief Is Leaving

   Michael Naumann, the mercurial and blunt-spoken chief executive
of Henry Holt &AMP; Co., will leave the literary publishing house that
he has headed for two years to pursue a chance to become Germany's

maverick fashion, Naumann, 56, revealed his plans early on Friday
afternoon, when most publishers had retreated for long summer
weekends.

   Test of `Spam' Buster to Begin

   Assessing the Latest Hot IPO
</P>
<P>
   Investors are apparently willing to overlook the current
technical limitations of Internet broadcasting. On Friday, shares
of Broadcast.com had the biggest first-day gain ever for the
initial public offering of an American stock, leaving one of the
founders, Mark Cuban, with a paper stake worth more than $350
million. Fans say the company will be well positioned as the
technology for Internet broadcasting improves. But some analysts
say the risk is at least as great as the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Debate Over Internet Access Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Taxing Internet users' access to cyberspace may become a
contentious political issue this fall in eight states if Congress
passes the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The legislation would
effectively ban taxes on Internet access, but it includes a
grandfather clause that would allow eight states to continue
imposing an existing tax.

   Galotti Leaves a Void at Vogue
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla over Tina Brown's decision to leave The New

magazine a success over the last several years, was defecting from
Conde Nast to join Ms. Brown.

`TITAN': FLUENT, COMPELLING ROCKEFELLER BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   What may well be this summer's ideal book for vacation reading
is not a novel but a biography that has many of the best attributes
of a novel, Ron Chernow's ``Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller
Sr.'' Its narrative is wonderfully fluent and irresistibly
compelling. It is filled with outsize characters involved in
actions of great magnitude, as Aristotle might have said.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is a great mystery, which is how one person could
have contained two such contradictory characters as John D.
Rockefeller Sr. did: on the one hand, the rapacious robber baron
who destroyed everything that stood in the path of making both
Standard Oil the ultimate industrial monopoly and himself the
world's richest man; on the other hand, the infinitely good-hearted
philanthropist who loved to make gifts of dimes and universities.
</P>
<P>
   How ``Titan'' addresses this mystery is perhaps its most
fascinating aspect. As Chernow (``The House of Morgan,'' ``The
Warburgs'') explains in his foreword, the deeper he dug into the
rich trove of material only partly tapped by the many previous
biographers of Rockefeller, the more he discovered that it was not
absolutely necessary to view Rockefeller as being either a devil or
an angel. Yet, he writes, ``like many moguls of the Gilded Age,
Rockefeller was either glorified by partisan biographers, who could
see no wrong, or vilified by vitriolic critics, who could see no
right.'' He adds, ``This one-sidedness has been especially harmful
in the case of Rockefeller, who was such an implausible blend of
sin and sanctity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernow's approach to these contradictions in Rockefeller is to
record both views in all their extremes and then attempt to resolve
them. The key for him lies in Rockefeller's deep and abiding
involvement in evangelical Baptism, which committed him to good
works, obviously enough, but also justified his accumulation of
wealth as a sign God's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with this view is that presented in such simple
terms it makes Rockefeller's Bible thumping look like what Chernow
calls ``a cunning facade for the corporate pirate.'' So he takes
the further step of examining both the good and the bad sides of
Rockefeller more closely.
</P>
<P>
   The good had much more dimension to it, he concludes, than the
act of giving away millions implied. This can be seen in
Rockefeller's behavior outside of business, where he conducted
himself unostentatiously (unlike other 19th-century moguls) and
where he was apparently a quite lovable husband and father. It can
be seen in Chernow's portrait of the last four decades of
Rockefeller's nearly 10-decade life, when he lived in retirement,
seemed to grow mentally younger and more playful and, by mastering
the art of public relations, transformed himself into America's
most famous codger.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be seen in his approach to philanthropy, where he
sought above all not to publicize his generosity but to find the
most effective ways that his millions could benefit humanity. In
fact, to judge from Chernow's account, Rockefeller put almost as
much genius into giving his fortune away as he did into acquiring
it.
</P>
<P>
   And the bad was really not quite so bad, Chernow tries to show.
First, as he argues at length, Rockefeller's most eloquent critics,
Henry Demarest Lloyd and Ida Tarbell, exaggerated the record and
got many things wrong. Second, Rockefeller erred in thinking that
silence was the best answer to his critics and in not defending
himself against their attacks. Third, because his retirement from
Standard Oil in the mid-1890s was not made public, he was blamed
for the excesses of his overcombative successor, John D. Archbold.
Fourth, Standard Oil's pursuit of monopoly was done as much to
stabilize the market for oil products as it was to put the
competition out of business. And finally, in an age defined by
muckraking journalism, Rockefeller's sins were bound to be thrown
into too bold relief.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all Chernow excuses his subject's excesses, he also
makes it clear that Rockefeller, despite his tendency to sidestep
blame, was both aware of and often responsible for many things that
Standard Oil did wrong. And while ``Titan'' goes light on
psychobiography, it leaves the distinct impression that to the
extent that Rockefeller was exceeding God's command in storing up
his wealth, he was acting out of a complicated rage against his
pathologically ne'er-do-well father, who far too early in his son's
life undertook to victimize him financially.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernow is impressively successful in reconciling
Rockefeller's contradictions _ as well as in showing how they
played themselves out in his children and grandchildren _ something
of the mystery remains. One would have liked to get a clearer sense
of how Rockefeller operated financially. For instance, at the
turning point in his early career when he successfully outbid his
former partners, the Clark brothers, for ownership of his first
refinery, one would have liked to learn how he got the financial
backing for his bid and what it meant to him and his backers when
the price far exceeded his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rockefeller is vividly present in these pages with all
the uncanny power that enabled him to build his great empire while
still a young man. You can feel the force of his mind and will, the
ferocious calculation that helped to shape an entire industrial
age.
</P>
<P>
   As Chernow writes in a typical passage: ``Beyond the size of his
stake, Rockefeller also possessed an unlikely charisma. He never
backslapped, roughhoused or skylarked with his colleagues, and his
statesmanlike calm evoked feelings of awe. As one reporter said in
1905, `No man, however unimpressionable he may be, can stand in the
presence of Mr. Rockefeller without feeling the repressed power of
the man.' He seemed to possess oracular powers. As Archbold
conceded, `Rockefeller always sees a little further than the rest
of us _ and then he sees around the corner.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's a character, in short, worthy of an epic novel. Which is
why ``Titan'' is a book to take to the beach.

FAST TRACK TO ANXIETY IN TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Goldstein's business is public relations and
television his medium, but when he encounters a reporter it is
usually only as a face on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a press secretary in the Bush administration, he had
direct contact with television reporters instead of remote control
glimpses. Now, with the growth of news magazine shows, he said,
they rarely call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time I was on a broadcast and my mother asked
me, `What's the reporter like?' And I said, `Mother, I never really
met the reporter,''' said Goldstein, now a spokesman for the trade
group of the Insurance Information Institute in New York who has
observed that ``you have the `faces' and you have the producers who
are doing all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolving roles of television correspondents and producers
have come under an uncommon level of scrutiny with CNN's &UR;  &LR; decision
to retract a report that the U.S. military used nerve gas during
the war in Vietnam. The report was broadcast on the premier of a
news magazine show, ``Newsstand,'' a joint venture with Time
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent dismissals of two CNN producers and the awkward
claim by the correspondent involved, Peter Arnett, that he was a
``face'' with minimal participation in the sensitive project has
rattled many television producers who argue that accomplished
correspondents preside over stories like tough editors, although
they concede such involvement varies.
</P>
<P>
   The territory of television producers is a changing, highly
competitive world, with prime-time news programs like CBS' ``60
Minutes'' and NBC's &UR;  &LR; ``Dateline NBC'' making up half of the
country's top 10 shows during the doldrums of July and summer
reruns. Earlier last week, CBS announced that it would expand ``60
Minutes'' into a second edition, underscoring the importance of
prime-time news magazines as a reliable profit center for networks.
</P>
<P>
   The general expansion of prime-time news magazine shows has
created new opportunity for producers, but raised some concerns
among them that the competitive environment has increased their
responsibilities and intensified potential journalistic hazards _
from accelerating the careers of less experienced producers to
raising the volume of news stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that very many correspondents just come in and read
scripts _ I think that's most uncommon,'' said Tom Bettag, the
executive producer of ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``There are many more
dangers now in a much more pressured budget environment where the
news divisions are expected to make larger profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of news magazine programs, he said, ``is making
everybody work faster,'' adding: ``There isn't enough talent.
Everybody is ratcheting up the speed with which they work and
that's totally wrong. There are times that people are saying this
is an inefficient use of resources and that's perfectly
appropriate. There are other times when you can work too fast and
make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But other producers see benefits in the competition and see no
decline in quality, arguing, for example, that with enhanced
technology like satellite transmissions, it is easier to work
quickly. ``Competition sometimes makes it harder to do a job, but
that in no way means you can be any less diligent in terms of
checking out a story,'' said an ABC producer, Bret Marcus, who is
leaving the network for CNBC to take charge of Geraldo Rivera's
coming news show.
</P>
<P>
   Producers are the journalists who track down impossible facts
with the cunning of hunters _ booking the camera crew, searching
for sources, finding the location, writing the script, editing the
material _ and all for salaries that are usually 10 times less than
what correspondents make.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many times when producers write 95 percent of what
is read, but it's not as if it's not done in consultation with the
reporter,'' said one veteran network producer. ``But in order for
the star system to function _ where you have news magazines
becoming vehicles for high-priced talent _ you need them on the
air. It's a star system, which requires that correspondents get
maximum air time, and by doing that it assigns more stories than
they can possibly report in full.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the standard career path of a producer is a
journalism school graduate who starts as a $20,000-a-year desk or
production assistant for one of the networks, answering telephones
and scanning wire reports, and then, with on-the-job training,
rises through various ranks to a producer earning from $70,000 to
$275,000 a year. In some ways it is an insecure profession, since
most producers work on multiyear contracts with benefits, and in
some cases travel from 30 to 80 percent of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And, as producers colorfully describe it, their relationships
with the more visible correspondents are usually symbiotic
connections _ the bonds of a boxer and a manager, the earned trust
of a married couple, the spiritual connection between a composer
and a lyricist. The correspondent, according to producers, is
expected to challenge material and to play, in some respects, the
role of a demanding editor, who is checking facts and questioning
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producer and the correspondent are a team,'' said Neal
Shapiro, the executive producer of ``Dateline NBC,'' a news
magazine that is expanding to five nights a week of programming in
August and employs 75 producers and 19 correspondents. ``The
producers do a lot of the initial reporting and they may gather a
lot of the material, but the two of them collaborate and the
correspondents have to do the interviews that are vital to the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the CNN episode, Shapiro said he met with
the Dateline staff to urge them to be more vigilant and careful,
but he added that Arnett's detached relationship with his CNN
producers could not exist under his program's news-gathering
system.
</P>
<P>
   But other producers are less confident that the industry's
built-in safeguards provide sufficient checks and balances against
mistakes in a fast and fiercely competitive situation, in which a
higher volume of stories are being produced; some said that a
similar episode could happen anywhere.

 UNDATED: happen anywhere. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Go by the arithmetic,'' said Martin Koughan, an Emmy-winning
free-lance producer in Sonoma, Calif., who spent much of his career
working on network television and CNN's investigative unit. ``Now
there's five times as much news on the air and there's much more
pressure on the correspondents and much more reliance on the
producers.''
</P>
<P>
   Koughan, 49, said that many of his contemporaries were part of a
flight of network veterans who had pulled out of the industry
because of misgivings about the commercialization of news to seek
occupations as free-lancers, university teachers and even a dairy
farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest reason why I left is that quality has gone
down,'' he said, ``Everyone is trying to figure out what people
want to see and then feed it to them. If the only thing that you're
trying to do is titillate, then the point of a story is not even
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, a former network producer and now the executive
director of the Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group that
studies ethics and public service, divides the television
industry's producers into two culturally distinct categories, those
who cover breaking stories for the nightly news whose reporting
workloads usually equal the correspondents', and those who are
developing longer feature stories for the news magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the news magazine mode, where the correspondent is handling
25 stories a year and the producer is handling about five, the
editorial load is more substantially handled by the producer and
the correspondent finds himself or herself less and less engaged in
each piece,'' he said. ``So the burden ends up being on the
correspondent to fight the impulse to be on autopilot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some producers are worrying that the expansion
of news programming is speeding along the careers of younger
producers who have learned more about production techniques than
conventional journalistic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get a lot of young assistant producers who are really
smart and really want to learn and just pick it up along the way,''
said a senior producer with ABC, who added, though, that, ``I don't
see enough of a degree of skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   At ``60 Minutes,'' the dean of news magazine programming,
several producers said that show and ABC's ``Nightline'' maintained
newsrooms where producers and correspondents devised their own
story ideas and maintained close working relationships, in contrast
with Arnett's description of his detached relationship with his
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is one of earned trust and you're in this
together,'' but there's always a tension because the correspondent
knows that the producer has the most information, said David
Gelber, an executive producer at CBS News.

 &HT;    With brains in high gear, puzzlers try to stump each other

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National Puzzlers' League met for its annual
convention in Atlanta this weekend _ and not a bartender in town
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really drink or go out much when we get together,''
explained Barbara Selfridge, 39, at the group's Team Puzzle
Extravaganza Saturday night in a ballroom of the Terrace Garden
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit around and solve more puzzles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some group. Some puzzles: Crosswords, acrostics, spoonergrams,
heteronyms, transposals, enigmatic rebuses, transdeletions,
reversed linkades ... .
</P>
<P>
   If this is all about having fun with English, will somebody
please speak it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get the hang of it,'' admits Will Shortz,
program director of the convention and the man with perhaps the
single most sadistic job in America: New York Times crossword
puzzle editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps to have the right bent,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the group _ which has met at least once
annually since 1883 _ has tried to lure Average Joe into its league
of word games so difficult even some of the 106 cognoscenti in
attendance were resorting to pocket computers Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cheating to use Franklin, is it?'' asked Jinny Jones
of Bethesda, Md., trying to crack clues to the most elaborate
puzzle of the three-day convention, something called ``Dissertation
Dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Selfridge, pulling out her Franklin crossword
calculator, which takes combinations of letters and, with the press
of a button, spits outs words.
</P>
<P>
   Stumping the group was a nine-letter combination that describes
a prize you could win at a fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Brass ring? Nope. Teddy Bear? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   An hour into the competition, Selfridge's group of word sleuths,
working clues that included captions from Far Side cartoons, were
still scratching their noggins.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the NPL _ composed mostly of mathematicians, computer
programmers, crossword puzzle makers and writers _ concede that
they're an odd lot.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention nobody uses his or her name. Instead, they
wear badges bearing ``noms'' _ pseudonyms _ so you end up hearing
the following snippets of conversation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mehitabel, have you seen Lunch Boy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. He's with Xeipon.''
</P>
<P>
   One member explains that the pseudonyms make everyone feel
equal. Xeipon's real name is Ed Pegg. He's 34, a computer
programmer from Colorado Springs, Colo., and the author of a puzzle
that conventioneers wrestled during Saturday afternoon's ``pencil
and paper'' competition.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle was a ``transposal.'' Solvers had to find a word of
14 letters (answer: reconstructing), which, when rearranged into
two 7-letter words, had a similar meaning (answer: cutting corners)
and made sense of an incredibly cryptic story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the base word with a computer,'' Pegg enthusiastically
explained later. ``And it just popped in my mind. That's something
to try!''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyna Huret, 45, of Yardley, Penn., has attended the
convention for nine years. She's a puzzle editor for an online
publication. The gathering, she says, ``gives me a chance to be
with people of like mind, exercise my brain, and humble me.''
</P>
<P>
   John McNeill, 54, joined NPL in 1984. He's one the group's most
honored members. He won the U.S. Open Crossword championship in
1983. It takes McNeill ``15-20 minutes'' to complete the New York
Times Sunday crossword.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a special kind of brain to do that, doesn't it, John?
</P>
<P>
   ``Special?'' he says. ``No, I don't think that's the right word.
I'd say weird or twisted.''
</P>
<P>
   How to join: Send $13 check to National Puzzlers' League, Joseph
J. Adamski, 2507 Almar, Jenison, Mich. 49428. The $13 includes a

 &HT;    COLUMN: Memories get in way when I map directions
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some friends from the coast are paying their first
visit to Sweet Apple. They called the other day and suggested that
I fax them a map.
</P>
<P>
   I love to make maps, and I was all ready to sit down and turn
artist, until I remembered my son-in-law next door, a man of
technical and artistic turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever made a map for out here?'' I asked him. He said
he had, and, furthermore, he and his computer would transmit a copy
to my friends on the coast. It was too good an offer to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a copy of the map over after I had gone to bed,
leaving it on the kitchen table. It is spare, clean and concise.
The Department of Transportation would approve.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not my kind of map. I have a favorite approach to Sweet
Apple that may not be as direct, but that lifts my heart and
enlivens my spirit when I travel that way. He notes highway numbers
and traffic lights. I would put in pretty country churches and
graveyards.
</P>
<P>
   And, unfortunately, I put in memories. I would want to note that
that shopping center messed up the spot where the Hawkinses, of the
seed-and-feed store, lived. I loved their old yard and once climbed
their magnolia tree to get branches to decorate the cabin for my
husband Jack's nephew's wedding. I fell out of the tree (magnolia
is so brittle), landing in a patch of poison ivy, and scratched all
during the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Hawkinses' house was gone, the old cellar hole
was there, framed by all manner of flowers. Now a chicken
restaurant, a bank and a branch of Radio Shack occupy that ground.
The temptation to include what was, instead of what is, is my
failing as a map maker.
</P>
<P>
   My son-in-law left off graveyards. I count them irreplaceable
landmarks. I would try to work in the tombstones of Dessie and Lum
Crow, dear departed neighbors. Mr. Crow found a bargain in
tombstones and bought a handsome one well before it was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to see our tomb rock?'' he asked me one day. ``But you're
a long way from dying!'' I protested. He laughed. ``You never know
what your young'uns will do after you're dead,'' he joked. And he's
so right.
</P>
<P>
   That ``tomb rock'' is in Ebenezer Methodist Church cemetery.
There's another one I like to point out a bit down the road, beside
Union Primitive Baptist Church. Our good friends Quinton and Nellie
Johnson are buried there, and I never pass that way without a pang
of regret for their going. Quinton helped us shore up the cabin, a
slow-moving, amiable carpenter who was always accompanied by a
swirl of puppies and who was the source of many good stories. A map
to Sweet Apple is a barren document without Quinton.
</P>
<P>
   The big square white house where the Dangars lived is not there.
The space was usurped by a subdivision, but I remember well where
the barn stood, notable to my Jack and to our friend Doc Smellie
because it held all kinds of parts needed for work on a log cabin.
And somewhere near the bottom of the barrel, there was a bottle of
homemade brandy, which refreshed borrowers in their labors.
</P>
<P>
   No use to put on the map that the Denver Coxes lived up on that
hill, and Mrs. Cox made the best butter you ever put on a biscuit.
There's a vast white mansion in the place where Olivia and Clarence
Johnson lived in a cozy, hospitable tar-papered house.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that memories do not a map make. So I'll just go
along with my son-in-law's computerized effort, and to be safe,
I'll walk down the road to meet my friends.

   Braves Notebook
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Stinson
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask, John Schuerholz wants you to know there is no
bullpen contingency plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no Plan A or Plan B. It's just Plan Reality,'' the
Braves general manager said. ''I would bet every call that somebody
who is a rotisserie league general manager would be expected to
make, I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves decline to place a deadline on Mark Wohlers' return
to form, beyond the July 31 trading deadline. Schuerholz has
plumbed the market for closers but has a history of waiting until
the final hours the deadline. He dealt Mike Stanton an hour before
the deadline in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to offer (Wohlers) as much of an opportunity as
possible,'' Schuerholz said. ''At the same time, we're not going to
compromise and can't compromise and wouldn't compromise the
integrity of our approach to each game, which is to win. If Mark is
pitching well enough to come into situations to preserve wins,
he'll be given that opportunity. If he's not, he won't. A lot of
that is determined from work on the side, work in the bullpen, his
work in games.''
</P>
<P>
   But at what point does Wohlers have to prove his ability to
retain his old job?
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't do something before July 31, it's very unlikely to
me and to most people that we're going to be able to do anything of
any substantial nature to reorganize (the closer) situation,''
Schuerholz said. '' So the reality is that in two weeks, whatever
moves we make _ whether to support Mark in his role or to alter the
construct with respect to the closer especially _ is going to have
to be done prior to that.''
</P>
<P>
   False alarm
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz came straight out of his chair in the ninth inning
when, with one out, Milwaukee's Fernando Vina sent a line drive
right back at pitcher Kerry Ligtenberg, striking him on the right
hand. He was able to finish the inning, post-game X-rays were
negative and Ligtenberg said he expects to be available tonight.
But the Braves came that close to losing their closer. Had the ball
not hit him on the meatiest part of the hand, it might have been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a second, I thought it was going to hit me in the face,''
Lightenberg said. ''I didn't see it right away. The only thing you
can do is just stick your hand up. That's your first reaction. The
things is, I thought I could have thrown him out too but I couldn't
feel my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker sits again
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Tucker's slump stretching to 5-for-38 this month,
manager Bobby Cox gave his right fielder his second day off within
five games, granting Curtis Pride another start. That Pride had two
RBI and a home run hardly went unnoticed by management. This is
Tucker's deepest slump since he joined the Braves, his average down
to .258. His average last year never fell below .269 and that was
even after a .237 July.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been hitting so much, it might be too much,'' said
manager Bobby Cox. ''He's got to get back to one or two keys.''
</P>
<P>
   July has not been kind to Cox's left-handed platoon. Besides
Tucker, second baseman Keith Lockhart (who was also given the day
off against right-handed Jeff Juden) is in a 2-for-23 slide since
the All-Star break. Between them, Tucker and Lockhart are hitting
.165 (13-for-79) this month.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Harry Wendelstedt lasted into the eighth before
yielding to dehydration from the oppressive heat. He retired to the
umpires dressing room three batters into the eighth, when he was
replaced by Jerry Layne. . . . Andruw Jones' batting streak ended
at eight games. . . . John Rocker has a growing constituency. When
Cox went out to remove him after Rocker struck out Jeromy Burnitz
in the eighth, Cox was booed. . . . Walt Weiss, nursing a sore
right quadricep, led off the Braves first with one of the slowest
triples in memory, forced to jog on to third base when Jeromy
Burnitz lost his ball in the right field corner. ''I was kind of
hoping he'd pick the ball up,'' Weiss said. ''I didn't want to keep
running.''

 &HT;    O'Meara takes his breaks
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ They will be talking of it for years, the
finishing round of the 1998 British Open at Royal Birkdale. A
weekend of frontrunners from off the continent, featuring a
tenacious American faintly known in his own land, had been
embellished only by the rise of a fresh star off the amateur bush,
another Justin _ in this case, a 17-year-old Rose from Hampshire.
So what began as a field of 2,336 aspirants who paid a fee of 80
pound sterling for the chance, boiled down to two, and then to one,
the champion, Mark O'Meara of Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the middle 36 holes, Brian Watts, the 32-year-old
Oklahoman whose tournament office is Japan, held the lead, and even
into the gloaming of Sunday he still had a piece of it. It was
shared with O'Meara, the Masters champion, who never wins the easy
way. He never led the Masters until his final putt. Here, he had to
go four extra holes to beat Watts and win a bookend major to go
with the green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara took the lead with a birdie on the par-5 17th hole, then
Watts matched that, but it was a bunker shot from greenside on the
18th that sent the championship into overtime. ''That bunker shot
on the 72nd hole was as great as any shot I've ever seen,'' even
O'Meara was moved to say. From an awkward stance and everything on
the line, Watts' blast wound up eight inches from the cup. It was a
classic clutch shot, necessary to keep the championship alive. The
marvel of the last two days was that Watts' perfectly honed swing
never bent under the strain of such a pursuit of glory.
</P>
<P>
   The weather calmed after a morning rain. The wind lowered, and
generally the improved conditions were reflected in the scores. For
instance, Justin Leonard, the defending champion who had suffered
through a round of 82 Saturday, recovered with a 69 and was joyful.
''Now I don't feel so bad as a defending champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The move of the day, though, and the creator of mass excitement
was none other than Tiger Woods, who had led the first day, then
shot himself in the foot with a round of 77 Saturday. He was one
under par on the front nine, then turned on the juice and birdied
three of the last four holes. But there was a wall of players in
front of him, consisting of:
</P>
<P>
   Watts _ they still can't believe he's for real over here, and
British papers have done a job of ignoring him, even after leading
two rounds. Canadian? American? Japanese? What a strange career.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk _ the guy with the swing not yet approved by Good
Housekeeping, or David Leadbetter. Poor fellow, he couldn't make a
putt and hung in around two over par until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik _ the eccentric Swede with the upturn capbill,
volcanic dust in his diet, and runnerup the past two years at
Turnberry and Troon.
</P>
<P>
   And, O'Meara _ very nice but uninspiring personality, round
face, body contours of an insurance salesman, 41-year-old
latter-day copy of Bill Casper. And who would become the oldest
player to win two majors championships the same year.
</P>
<P>
   His Orlando neighbor Woods, however, kept shooting at him. With
eight holes to play, the 22-year-old had four strokes to make up.
He got three off them, chipping in on the 17th hole and sinking a
cross-country putt on the 18th. He could only sit and wait, and
when O'Meara and Watts closed him out, he took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finishing third is not something to be upset about,'' he said.
''My goal was to hit 14 fairways and 18 greens. It didn't work out
that way. I had to scramble a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club's sensible playoff style, the
matter is resolved before moonrise. Four holes between the
combatants, then sudden death only if the issued isn't resolved by
then. O'Meara took the advantage on the 15th hole with a birdie to
Watts' par, and in the end, that was the margin. They matched pars
on the 16th and 17th, but Watts put his approach in another
greenside bunker at 18 again, and this time there was no miracle
left in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, I've moved up a notch,'' Watts said, a striking
fellow with a manner you had to like. ''If you'd told me a week ago
that I'd be in a playoff in the greatest championship in the world,
I wouldn't have believed you. I'm proud of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara was in the final pairing in The Open last played here in
1991, tied with Ian Baker-Finch for the lead. The Australian blew
him out with a final round of 66, including a 29 on th frontside.
''Later, I dropped into his home to congratulate him again, and he
invited me to have a sip out of the claret jug,'' O'Meara said. ''I
knew then I wanted one of these for my own, and now I have it. It
is an incredible feeling to have won two majors in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Twilight was falling. Victory was a balm to the nerves frayed by
four days of warfare on the most demanding of courses where The
Open is contested. You think back now to an incident that could
have been calamitous, when a tee shot was lost Saturday afternoon.
After a search of legal length, O'Meara was headed back to hit a
second tee shot when the ball was found. By the time O'Meara could
return to the spot, some nervy spectator had pocketed the ball.
O'Meara was allowed a drop, and after further review by officials,
no penalty was assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Of such, said the champion, are the breaks of golf.

 &HT;    NBAF weathers problems, wraps first decade
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Atlanta's major public arts festivals weather difficult
transition phases, the actual presence of the National Black Arts
Festival is a statement. This year's 10th anniversary event _ the
biennenial NBAF's fifth season overall _ often felt more like a
consolidation of festivals past than a leap forward toward the
millennium. And yet, there's nothing else like it anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which concluded its 10-day run Sunday, lived up to
its theme of ``Art Beyond Borders,'' linking artists from the
African diaspora whether they were a Nigerian Nobel Prize-winner or
a Southside Chicago saxophonist, whether they weaved baskets or
produced cutting-edge hip-hop videos. Major flaws persisted _
ticketing problems, scheduling glitches, information flow among
them. So did the major talent.
</P>
<P>
   Though an official attendance estimate was not available Sunday
_ the festival had been looking for 1.5 million people to buy
tickets for shows or visit one of the many artists' panels _ many
venues were consistently full. Sometimes, though, attendance varied
wildly. Star attractions _ such as poet Maya Angelou and vocalist
Abbey Lincoln _ played to packed, or close enough, houses. But the
same night Angelou read for 2,600 fans, festival regulars Olu Dara
and Dianne McIntyre drew less than 100 to their dance-theater
collaboration. Meanwhile, a fringe-minded program, the three-day
jazz festival ''(Re)soundings,'' drew an SRO audience of 250 to
Hill Auditorium that, an NBAF rarity, was predominantly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people that I've never had the opportunity to see
perform live,'' said Rob Cambre, a 29-year-old DJ from New Orleans,
about the jazz summit and its international roster. ``It's
aamazing...there are so many of them here in a three-day period.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad response for a festival starting its second decade.

 &HT;    'NewsRadio' to address death of Hartman
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The late Phil Hartman's character, Bill
McNeil, will be given a funeral on the season opener of
''NewsRadio'' Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The cast ''coudn't go back to work without a formal process on
the stage for dealing with the loss of Phil,'' NBC Entertanment
president Warren Littlefield said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phil was not just an ensemble character,'' Littlefield said.
''He was the dad on the set to a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield said ''NewsRadio'' executive producer Paul Simms is
working on the script, in which the cast will be told that McNeil
has died suddenly of a heart attack. Hartman was shot and killed by
his wife, who then committed suicide, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing this group, it will be entertaining, irreverent and
full of love,'' Littlefield said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lovitz, a friend of Hartman's since their days together on
''Saturday Night Live,'' will be introduced in the second episode
as a new character who will be taking McNeil's job as news anchor.
''He'll be filled with insecurities,'' Littlefield said, referring
to the character, not Lovitz.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to the Television Critics Association, Littlefield
also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Said that NBC is looking into ''partners and affiliations''
with other media companies, but it's too soon to tell if anything
will happen, let alone what will happen. There have been reports of
discussions with Barry Diller, head of USA Network, as well as
rumors of possible deals with Sony or Viacom. ''It seems today that
size does matter,'' he said. ''But a few years back we were in
discussions with Turner. Didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledged that ''Veronica's Closet,'' despite its key time
slot before ''ER'' on Thursdays, has not lived up to its potential.
He quoted Marta Kaufmann, one of the show's producers, as saying
''We have to do a better show. We let you down this year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Said that the decision to move ''Frasier'' to 9 p.m. Thursdays
this coming season basically came down to economics. ''Friends''
and ''Just Shoot Me'' were both strong finalists for what has
traditionally been the most-watched spot in prime time, but NBC
felt advertisers would pay the highest rates for ''Frasier'' in
that position.
</P>
<P>
   _ Announced a new prime-time animated show, ''Stressed Eric,''
that wil be given a summer tryout starting Aug. 12. The show
originally aired on the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   She thinks you're swell too, Garry
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Garry Shandling used the occasion of winning the
Television Critics Association award for best comedy for ''The
Larry Sanders Show'' to hit on ''Ally McBeal'' star Calista
Flockhart. Taking the podium, Shandling declared: '' 'Ally McBeal'
deserves this award. Calista Flockhart is the most talented
actress. You're single, right?'' he asked, looking at Flockhart in
the audience. Later, Flockhart went to the same podium to accept
the TCA award for Best New Program for ''Ally,'' and cooed to
Shandling, ''I want Garry to come up.'' After the awards ceremony,
Shandling and Flockhart went to the bar at the Ritz-Carlton
Pasadena (where the awards were held) to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Roone Arledge, chairman of ABC News and former head of ABC
Sports, was given the Career Achievement Award. ''As someone who
dealt with Howard Cosell and Sam Donaldson, I think I do richly
deserve this award,'' Arledge said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks accepted two awards for his HBO miniseries ''From the
Earth to the Moon:'' Best Movie or Miniseries and Program of the
Year. ''Homicide: Life on the Street'' won Best Drama for the third
straight year. It usually is not even nominated for an Emmy for
Best Drama, and executive producer Tom Fontana said of the Emmy
nominations (due out this week), ''As far as I'm concerned, the big
awards are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Also winning: David Hyde Pierce (''Frasier'') for Best
Individual in a Comedy, Andre Braugher (''Homicide'') for Best
Individual in a Drama; ''The American Experience'' for Best
News/Information Program, and ''Blue's Clues'' for Best Children's
Program.
</P>
<P>
   'Homicidal' explorations
</P>
<P>
   ''Homicide'' may have lost Braugher at the end of last season,
but it gets fresh blood when it returns Sept. 25. Michael Michelle
(''New York Undercover'') plays Det. Rene Sheppard, a former beauty
pageant queen turned homicide detective, and Giancarlo Esposito
(''Do the Right Thing'') will pay Mike Giardello, estranged son of
the show's Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto). Producer Fontana said
the confused bisexuality of Det. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) will continue
to be explored next season, even though ''the network (NBC) hates
it, the network wants it to go away.'' Not so, said Littlefield.
''What we did ask was how long are you going to keep this
ambiguous?''
</P>
<P>
   Sex, plugs, rock n' roll... .
</P>
<P>
   Scary thought for the day: Drew Carey and Mimi (Kathy Kinney),
his cosmetically challenged nemesis on ''The Drew Carey Show,''
will have sex this coming season. ''Well, they have a kind of
sex,'' Carey added, and then wouldn't divulge any more details
about that episode. Carey also says that he and his friends wil
form a rock band this year with him as lead singer, and they'll
cram an episode with guest-star rockers ''auditioning'' for the
band. Signed so far: former Guns N Roses guitarist Slash and singer
Lisa Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   Will it sell in Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman, the first half of ''Dharma and Greg,'' is sporting
alarmingly dyed platinum hair these days. She dyed it for the movie
she's currently filming, ''Town and Country,'' with Warren Beatty.
''I don't know if I'll keep it when we go back into production'' on
the TV show, she says. ''It may be a little extreme for Middle
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll practice in Fargo
</P>
<P>
   William Macy doubts that he'll return to ''ER.'' In one of this
past season's more memorable story lines, his character, Dr.
Morgenstern, had a kind of professional breakdown, botched a
surgery and resigned. Although it would be just like ''ER'' to
bring him back, he say he's heard nothing from producers and is
planning his movie career (which included the sleazebag husband in
''Fargo'') as if he won't do any more ''ER.''

 &HT;    Sights and sounds of the festival: a critics' notebook
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This much is certain: It's not every 10 days in
Atlanta when such a diverse, intensely focused and historic array
of musicians, poets, novelists, critics, filmmakers, dancers,
painters, photographers, actors, directors, political figures, and
deeply engaged audiences troupe through the city.
</P>
<P>
   Enough to make the National Black Arts Festival's
much-publicized struggles seem secondary to its triumphs. This
year, there were scary budget woes (as usual), scary infrastructure
woes (as usual), and an incoming artistic director, former NBAF
music curator and Emory University professor Dwight Andrews, who
had a lot of non-artistic tangles to tame.
</P>
<P>
   If the festival roster was often a ``greatest hits'' scenario,
reprising high points of previous gatherings, then it was
undeniably consistent. Programs that worked before worked again
(and difficulties that beset the fest continued to beset it). There
also, however, were promising introductions of new creative
concepts, which underscored the NBAF's mission to display ``Art
Beyond Borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The following notes, observations and comments are from the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution critics Steve Dollar, Sonia Murray and
Wendell Brock:
</P>
<P>
   _ Poet and literary titan Maya Angelou sold out Symphony Hall on
Thursday. ``There is no hiding place down here,'' she sang, opening
what would be a two-hour show of poetry, song, story-telling and
personal observations centered around that theme. ``That this arts
festival has remained here and remained vital says a lot of people
know there is no hiding place down here,'' Angelou noted. ``We have
to come out and come together and celebrate. Art, poetry, courtesy,
civility, grace, that's really how we've survived down here.'' (SM)
</P>
<P>
   _ Phyllis Yvonne Stickney's one-woman show may now be considered
a staple at the festival, but that does not render it any less
significant. Her searing take on the world left many in the
capacity crowd walking out of the show.The topics of her
``edu-tainment,'' as she calls it, ranged from the self-hatred
within the black community, to how important it is to be computer
savvy, to how some in Atlanta, ``the supposed black mecca'', are
oblivious to how racist the society is. ``My heart don't pump no
Kool-Aid,'' Stickney said. ``I ain't scared.'' (SM)
</P>
<P>
   _ Harry Allen's insightful ``Hip-Hop Music Video Giga-Film
Festival'' spent two hours Tuesday helping the capacity crowd
rethink rap video. ``If there is any problem that hip-hop, and as
an extension hip-hop video, has, it's coming up with a correct,
true and just depiction of black femininity,'' he said as he
introduced videos from the rigid Queen Latifah, an unabashedly
sexual Lil' Kim and Apache. It was a jarring presentation. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the more inspired segments of the festival,
``(Re)soundings'' illustrated with vigor and imagination how an
African-American creative form _ jazz improvisation _ has swept the
world. The three-evening event reflected a key period in NBAF
artistic director Dwight Andrews' own musical life, and his abiding
personal connections to visionaries such as Chicago-born trumpeter
Wadada Leo Smith and British saxophonist Evan Parker created
warmth.The music was a kaleidoscope, shifting through colors and
perspectives, always tilting. One set, by Chicago's DKV Trio with
tenor saxophonist Fred Anderson, was fervent and uplifting;
another, by a German trio that featured trombonist Conrad Bauer and
bassist Peter Kowald, became a thoroughly entertaining showcase for
drummer Gunter ``Baby'' Sommer, who makes percussion a nimble form
of performance art. Even the dry, more studiously ``avant-garde''
pieces got standing ovations, and the rare Southern appearances by
folks such as Parker and reedsman Roscoe Mitchell drew attendees
from across the region. (SD)
</P>
<P>
   _ Olu Dara strums his guitar, and Dianne McIntyre flutters about
as if her body is being plucked. The Urban Bush Women's
butt-shaking antics provoke audience members to stand and shout:
``Go, girls!''
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted art beyond boundaries, this was it. But if the
NBAF's three concert dance programs were meant to reflect the
diaspora _ with African, Caribbean, Latin and urban influences _
they did not succeed. Instead, what was on the program appeared to
be more a measure of who was available at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBAF audiences _ unlike the Atlanta populace at large _
are a faithful crowd. For an unadvertised Monday night performance
of ``Diverse Duets,'' the 900-seat Rialto was nearly two-thirds
full. Too bad that two of the pieces weren't quite ready to be
shown _ or that two of the ``duets'' turned out to be full-ensemble
performances.
</P>
<P>
   The NBAF should understand that really good artists are really
busy. If it wants to sign Garth Fagan, Bill T. Jones, Rennie Harris
or the Alvin Ailey American DanceTheater _ to import acts from
outside the country or commission new work _ it would do well to
plan ahead. Otherwise, it may find that its audience isn't as
forgiving, or as hungry, as it was this year. (WB)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Roots and Branches Folk Art and Vendors Market at Piedmont
Park, a daily affair that also featured live music, seemed lost to
much of its potential crowd. Africa Fete, a lively package tour
boasting some of the most entertaining names in African pop music,
attracted a few hundred listeners on the festival's first Sunday.
Withering heat and a rain delay were obvious discouragements, but
the outdoor events could have used a promotional boost equal to
some of the considerable talent booked. This aspect of the NBAF
needs rethinking. (SD)
</P>
<P>
   _ An expanded approach to late-night jam sessions, site of the
NBAF's popular social scene, was a cool notion. But late Saturday
an unexpectedly scaled back version of the fest-closing spectacle
``The Big Dance'' meant that instead of an African-American history
lesson in dance, there was ... a jam session. Or close enough.
``Everyone was waiting around for something to happen but nothing
happened,'' said George King, an Atlanta filmmaker and music
enthusiast. ``The last one (in 1996) was so good, I remember it
vividly.'' Still, King noted, ``Olu (Dara) was jamming and people
were dancing.'' (SD)

`RETOOLING' PROVIDES PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH WONDERS OF HEALTH
CARE 
</HEADLINE>
 _ COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ](begin itals)In a series of columns ending next Sunday, C.W.
Gusewelle tells of his recent ``retooling.'' He doesn't imagine his
personal medical adventures are of any special interest or
importance. But nearly everyone, as the years turn, requires an
occasional repair. And when the need arises, it's comforting to be
reminded what wonders U.S. health-care professionals can
deliver.(end itals)
</P>
<P>
   Old sins and misdemeanors have to be paid for.
</P>
<P>
   The thousand visits to the doughnut shop...the incomparable,
companionable weed (was there ever anyone, for Pete's sake, who
didn't (begin itals)know(end itals) tobacco was addictive?)...the
sausage gravy over biscuits, and the cream pies in country cafes...
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later they'll come back to haunt you. So the past week
was spent settling accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Actually it began last month in an offhand way, during an
otherwise uneventful medical exam. Our family physician also is a
friend. We have skied together and followed the growing up of one
another's children. He genuinely cares.
</P>
<P>
   And he's a careful man. During the course of the physical _
toward the last, as I recall _ he put his stethoscope to the side
of my neck.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent days I've mentioned this to any number of folks I
know, people who are mindful of their health. Very few could
remember a doctor ever listening in that area. To the chest and
back, yes, but not the neck.
</P>
<P>
   His brow furrowed just the least bit. He moved the instrument to
the other side, then back to the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you had any dizzy spells?'' he wanted to know. ``Any bad
headaches or trouble speaking? Or numbness or tingling in your
hands?''
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't. There'd been no symptoms whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I hear something there in the carotid I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   The carotid arteries, one on each side of the neck, are the
vessels through which the heart supplies oxygenated blood to the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get you in for a sonogram,'' he said. ``It's
called a Doppler, and they do it right downstairs here.''
</P>
<P>
   The next week I was on an examining table in a darkened room.
Sound impulses, bouncing off red corpuscles as they passed through
the artery, translated into images on a monitor. Meantime, in the
next room, a doctor was analyzing the pictures in greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   An hour the test took, or a bit longer. Then the doctor came in
to report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right side's clear,'' he said. ``But there's a problem on
the left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The left carotid is 80 to 99 percent blocked. It can be
corrected surgically, but until that's done you could be at serious
risk for a stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was dismaying for more reasons than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going with my family to Alaska the last half of August,''
I told him. ``Everything's set, and I don't want to cancel. I don't
have any symptoms. So is there any reason I can't deal with this in
September, after we get back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be lucky,'' he said. ``But if it were me, with
blockage like that, I wouldn't wait two months.''
</P>
<P>
   The test results were forwarded to my physician, who also
counseled against delay.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me the name and phone number of the surgeon he would
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call him right away, and get on his schedule. I'd say you
could have the operation and be fully recovered in time for the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since we're thinking about surgery, it would be a good
idea to check out your heart on the treadmill.'' He leafed through
my records. ``Your last stress test was, what, seven years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   So yet another referral was made, this one to a cardiology
group.
</P>
<P>
   And the treadmill was trod upon.
</P>
<P>
   A radioactive substance, thallium, was injected and computer
images rendered.
</P>
<P>
   From those, certain conclusions could be drawn. But those
conclusions would be in some degree subjective. Because medicine,
although it's a science, also remains very much an art.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing surely known was that 10 days later I would
report as an outpatient to St. Luke's Hospital for a
catheter-and-dye test to confirm the blockage of the carotid
artery.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on those results, what else might be done to me, and
when, remained to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   I felt hemmed round by a confounding array of uncertainties _ an
odd predicament for someone who'd walked into his doctor's office
the previous month imagining himself perfectly fit.

IN THE DEEP DARK BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ These are dark days for denim.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, deep, dense indigo is moving onto the mainstream fashion
charts. After almost two decades, stone and acid washes are being
nudged out of the spotlight. Ditto for the torn, hole-ridden jeans
and faded finishes that reflect years of wear and many tumbles in
the bleach cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The look began in Europe a few seasons ago. Influential designer
Helmet Lang set it on the runway about four years ago. Names such
as Gucci and Versace followed up to help give it the must-have
status.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, for one, have had very significant roles in the
development of the textiles, says Sarah Clancy, product manager in
new product development for the Lee Co. in Merriam, Kan. And the
look emerged early on the streets of Tokyo, London and Paris. A
European company called G Star was among the first to push it
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as the Gap and Levi Strauss have been taking it
mainstream for the spring season. And now fashion magazines feature
the darks in ads and editorials from the likes of Gucci, DKNY and
Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of some Versace pieces delivered to us in
error, we would not carry anything but dark,'' says Todd Dean, the
owner of Loma Vista Hardware in Kansas City, Mo., which carries
men's designer sportswear from Lang, Dolce &AMP; Gabanna and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely red hot,'' says David Wolfe, the fashion
director for Doneger Inc., a retail consulting service in New York.
``It's given new life to denim. In fact, we're calling it the
born-again denim.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the darker color has found such an audience in part
is that it is a fresh approach at a time when old faded denim is
widespread. ``It's another option, especially for the kids who live
in jeans,'' says Cassie Ederer, a spokeswoman for Levi Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the appeal is nostalgia. Among the young, to
whom the look is totally new, there is a quest for something real,
Clancy says. ``There is a real interest in an authentic heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend also was spawned by the increasing popularity in the
past decade of vintage blue jeans and the lucrative market for them
in the United States and around the world, says Levi's Ederer. ``We
just looked back to the original denim we were making 125 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The look was first adapted by the fashion-forward who started
wearing stiff _ what the industry calls raw or hard _ dark denim
that they wore, broke in to their own proportions and then washed.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two years ago, we started getting requests from
forward-trendy cities for the look of the original unwashed
denim,'' Ederer says.
</P>
<P>
   There are now a variety of options in dark denim finishes,
styles and textile weights. Some colors are more intense than
others, depending on the number of dips in the dye, Clancy says.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Lee Dungarees, for instance, with the raw finish in
the stiff-break-in-your-own denim or original straight leg in a
rinsed softer fabric. Choose from bib overalls in a rinse finish or
prance around in dark, stiffer wide legs. For fall 1999, Lee is
developing a dark denim with the look of the raw and feel of the
soft.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's current advertising campaign is headlined ``Hard Jeans''
and runs with captions such as ``You Break These in, You've Got
Something'' and ``You Want Something Soft, Call a Man.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the mainstream appeal now is that dark denim is a
more versatile look that can be dressed up and down with anything
from leather jackets and tank tops to blazers and beading. It
emerges at a time in which young people, especially, are seeking
ways to set themselves apart with their own individualistic style.
You can also pick from a broad array of Levi's dark styles
including jackets, hipsters, boot cuts, 501s and 569s.
</P>
<P>
   While it is targeted for now to the young teen and college set,
darker denim is definitely moving into the real fashion arena in
coming months. A few weeks ago at Saint-Tropez, where hot trends
are often nurtured, everyone was wearing it, Wolfe says.
</P>
<P>
   One style note, thanks to the influence of Helmet Lang: The hip
way to wear your denims is turned up into a wide cuff, another sign
of the old that looks new again.

PATENTS: FASTER FINS FOR DIVERS; SWIM GOGGLES WITH EAR PROTECTORS;
EXERCISING WHILE BABY-SITTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last big innovation in swimming fins _ those rubber
appendages that give scuba divers and snorkelers more leg power _
came in 1965, with the introduction of vents. The vents, by
allowing water to pass through the fin, reduced drag and made
kicking less laborious.
</P>
<P>
   Pete McCarthy, a 32-year-old scuba-diving entrepreneur, had not
even been born when the vented fins first appeared. But McCarthy
has just patented a new type of fin that he says will require a lot
less exertion on the part of divers.
</P>
<P>
   In anthropomorphic terms, McCarthy's fin resembles the tail of a
tuna more than the webbed foot of a duck. ``It's split into two
slender wings that are kind of V-shaped,'' McCarthy said. ``It acts
like a fish tail.''
</P>
<P>
   The fins rotate somewhat like the propeller blades on a boat, he
said. ``Only they don't go all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy _ who said he came up with the design through trial and
error after experimenting with about 200 handmade prototypes _ quit
his job as a software salesman in 1996 to work full time on his
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The fins allow a diver to go faster than he would wearing
conventional fins, McCarthy contends. Using an underwater
speedometer that he also invented, McCarthy said he had clocked
divers going about 30 percent faster with his fins.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a bit like claiming that a new car can go 150 miles
an hour. Impressive, but not particularly relevant if it is used
for commuting and running errands.
</P>
<P>
   A more meaningful measurement, said Jon Hardy, who runs a
scuba-products testing company called Scuba Lab on Catalina Island,
Calif., is the consumption of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, whom McCarthy paid to test his fins, said the split fins
did reduce divers' air consumption. ``The fins are from 20 to 40
percent more efficient than conventional fins,'' Hardy said.
McCarthy said divers wearing his fins just perform a small flutter
kick, rather than the big bent-knee kick that is most effective
with traditional fins. ``No knees at all,'' he said. ``You just
roll your ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   Apollo Sports, a Japanese company that distributes diving
equipment in the United States, has licensed McCarthy's patent and
will be coming out with its version of the split fin this summer.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, who has a company called Nature's Wing, in Newport
Beach, Calif., said he had also licensed patent 5,746,631 to other
companies that will be developing their own versions of the fin.
</P>
<P>
   Swim Goggles With Ear Protectors
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Marie DeAngelis' daughter is grown now. But she remembers
how difficult it can be to coax a child who is prone to ear
infections to put in earplugs before swimming.
</P>
<P>
   So she has invented a pair of goggles with built-in ear
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   The ear protectors are not inserted. Instead, they are
essentially wide bands made of a rubberized waterproof material
that molds tightly around the outside of the ears. The bands, which
attach at the back with a Velcro-type fastener, also serve to hold
the goggles in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeAngelis, an administrative assistant at a brokerage firm
in New York, said she was hoping to license her patent, No.
5,713,078.
</P>
<P>
   An Exercise in Baby-Sitting
</P>
<P>
   Since small children must constantly be supervised around the
pool, parents of young families often find it impossible to squeeze
in a few laps for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Metro and Naomi Fine, of Oakland, Calif., have come up
with a way for parents to watch their children while doing the
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   It is a flotation device that a child sits inside. The baby
float features a canopy to keep the sun out and a bar in front with
small toys attached.
</P>
<P>
   To use it as a kick board, a parent grasps it at one end. To use
it as an arm strengthener, the parent does the backstroke while
squeezing the sides of the chair between his or her thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Metro and Ms. Fine received patent No. 5,766,052.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 &UR; THE INTERN WHO BECAME AN ICON &LR;
<P>
   Waging a ``War Against Waifs,'' the public relations team
representing the woman's large-size store Lane Bryant concocted a
list of 12 women of achievement, ``accomplished, fashionable and
beautiful without fitting into the size-four stereotype,'' said the
draft of the press release. One of the star names on the list was
 &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , whose inclusion was questioned by the Washington
Post. ``When did alleged adultery and imperiling the presidency
become admirable?'' asked the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think rather than accomplishment, it has to do with
confidence,'' Lane Bryant's  &UR; Chris Hansen &LR;  said. ``One of the
things Lane Bryant is trying to do is enhance their self-esteem.''
Monica ``obviously thinks she's sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the list was officially issued, Lewinsky's name had
been deleted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CURRENT EVENTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - CNN's  &UR; Peter Arnett  &LR; received a mere slap on the wrist over
the ``Valley of Death'' documentary on American use of nerve gas,
but apparently recuperation was in order. A spy saw the newsman at
the Benbow Inn in Garberville last weekend, accompanied by a ``much
younger female'' who stalked out after a little tiff in the dining
room. When she returned, after most of the other guests had
finished dinner and left, said the spy, they appeared (very much)
to make up.
</P>
<P>
   - If the president's bodyguards can be forced to testify in the
Lewinsky case, asks  &UR; Sally Jarrett &LR; , isn't it time to remove the
``Secret'' from the ``Secret Service''?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Jack Nicholson &LR; , who had returned from Cuba and was on his
way to Scotland to play golf, told Daily Variety that in his
opinion,  &UR; Fidel Castro &LR;  is ``a genius. We spoke about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TANGIBLE EVIDENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  - In an Austin (Texas) American-Statesman story about
marketing to Christians,  &UR; Mark Pritchard &LR;  was dazzled to learn of
the availability of infants' bibs that read ``Perky Lil'
Presbyterian.'' And proving that sometimes the apple does fall far

IT'S NOT THE HEAT, IT'S THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Try to think of it as nature's moisturizer.
</P>
<P>
   When you step outside and _ WHAM! _ you feel that sudden, soggy
embrace that so epitomizes summertime in the lower Midwest, try to
think of the good it's doing you _ and it is doing you a little bit
of good.
</P>
<P>
   Because heaven knows, it feels gruesome indeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that the temperature reaches 90-plus degrees
here in the summer months; the relative humidity has to shoot up to
such heights as well.
</P>
<P>
   At 90 percent or 92 percent relative humidity, mornings of late
have been sufficiently sodden to run through a wringer washer. Even
our lowest daily humidity readings, which generally occur around
sunset, have rarely dropped below 70 percent, according to Jim
Allen, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Pleasant
Hill, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   And a temperature of 90 degrees with a humidity of 90 percent
makes it feel like 122 degrees. (See accompanying box.) Yikes!
</P>
<P>
   But hey, wet-blanket syndrome is nothing new around here in the
summertime. And there are specific reasons for that.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf of Mexico is one. When you're talking ocean air, you're
talking sog-gy. In fact, the Gulf Coast has some of the wettest air
in the United States, according to George Amis, a meteorologist for
the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   And here in the Midwest, most of our air supply comes from the
Gulf. Although it drops a bit of its moisture load on Alabama and
Texas and Arkansas on its way north, there's usually plenty left by
the time it sweeps over the plains.
</P>
<P>
   Heat is another factor. How much water the air can hold is a
function of temperature. Warmer air can hold more water than cooler
air.
</P>
<P>
   And why would that be? In two words, Brownian motion. Molecules
of water and other substances are always moving, and in higher
temperatures they move faster, said Curtis Hall, an instructor in
meteorology at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. The more they
move, the more likely water molecules are to escape from a river or
farm pond or glass of water into the surrounding atmosphere, making
the leap from a liquid to a gas.
</P>
<P>
   In cooler places, say, Portland, Ore., the summer air doesn't
generally heat up enough to get the molecules moving enough to turn
into large quantities of water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the relative humidity in comfortable places _ such as
the Pacific Northwest _ can be every bit as high as the relative
humidity in steamy regions. Halfway up the western front of the
Cascade Mountains in Washington state, you'll find perpetual cloud
cover and one of the most humid regions on Earth, according to
Allen. But people don't object nearly as much as they do in some
places with lower relative humidity readings.
</P>
<P>
   That's because relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the
amount of water vapor in the air to the amount of water vapor the
air is capable of holding. And in cooler places the air cannot hold
onto as much water. Therefore it doesn't take as much water in the
air to bring the relative humidity to 80 percent or 90 percent. But
although the ratio might be high, the total amount of water vapor
in the air is much lower than in a warmer place.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of water vapor is known as the dew point. This
is the temperature below which water in the air will condense,
turning into dew or fog or clouds. As the temperature increases,
the dew point often does the same. However, the dew point never
exceeds the temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with soggy air, from the standpoint of human
comfort, is that it interferes with our cooling system. We are a
species that mostly keeps from overheating by sweating. In theory,
sweating cools us because as the sweat beads up on our skin, the
atmosphere absorbs it, using heat from our bodies to turn the
liquid water into vapor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's humid, there's nowhere for the sweat to go,'' said
Jeffrey Potteiger, who directs the exercise physiology lab at the
University of Kansas in Lawrence. ``It can't evaporate. It doesn't
provide that cooling effect. Anytime you're doing any kind of work,
you're going to generate body heat. In a humid condition, you can't
dissipate that heat to the environment as easily. So we sweat more
and more, it runs off of us, it seems we're not getting any cooler,
and in fact, we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking lots of water is critical during hot, humid weather,
especially for people who are working or playing hard outside.
Because caffeine and alcohol are diuretics, it's wise to keep them
to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, spending time in an air-conditioned building
isn't a bad idea either.
</P>
<P>
   So relative humidity levels of 70, 80, 90 percent feel bad. And
they tend to make for bad hair days.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few people, a heavy load of water vapor can cause
annoying irritations, fungal infections such as athlete's foot and
jock itch. High humidity also can promote certain bacterial
infections, according to David Kaplan, a dermatologist in Overland
Park, Kan. People troubled by excema sometimes suffer flare-ups
during hot humid conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of us, according to Kaplan, a little humidity
is a good thing, keeps our skin hydrated. A little humidity, we
said.

 &UR; THE INTERN WHO BECAME AN ICON &LR;
<P>
   Waging a ``War Against Waifs,'' the public relations team
representing the woman's large-size store Lane Bryant concocted a
list of 12 women of achievement, ``accomplished, fashionable and
beautiful without fitting into the size-four stereotype,'' said the
draft of the press release. One of the star names on the list was
 &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , whose inclusion was questioned by the Washington
Post. ``When did alleged adultery and imperiling the presidency
become admirable?'' asked the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think rather than accomplishment, it has to do with
confidence,'' Lane Bryant's  &UR; Chris Hansen &LR;  said. ``One of the
things Lane Bryant is trying to do is enhance their self-esteem.''
Monica ``obviously thinks she's sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the list was officially issued, Lewinsky's name had
been deleted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CURRENT EVENTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - CNN's  &UR; Peter Arnett  &LR; received a mere slap on the wrist over
the ``Valley of Death'' documentary on American use of nerve gas,
but apparently recuperation was in order. A spy saw the newsman at
the Benbow Inn in Garberville last weekend, accompanied by a ``much
younger female'' who stalked out after a little tiff in the dining
room. When she returned, after most of the other guests had
finished dinner and left, said the spy, they appeared (very much)
to make up.
</P>
<P>
   - If the president's bodyguards can be forced to testify in the
Lewinsky case, asks  &UR; Sally Jarrett &LR; , isn't it time to remove the
``Secret'' from the ``Secret Service''?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Jack Nicholson &LR; , who had returned from Cuba and was on his
way to Scotland to play golf, told Daily Variety that in his
opinion,  &UR; Fidel Castro &LR;  is ``a genius. We spoke about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TANGIBLE EVIDENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  - In an Austin (Texas) American-Statesman story about
marketing to Christians,  &UR; Mark Pritchard &LR;  was dazzled to learn of
the availability of infants' bibs that read ``Perky Lil'
Presbyterian.'' And proving that sometimes the apple does fall far
from the tree,  &UR; Judy Wolf  &LR; was eating in a Sacramento cafe when she
saw a father wearing a T-shirt that said ``Jesus'' accompanied by
his son wearing a T-shirt that said ``Godzilla.''
</P>

   Earth to Girbaud
</P>
<P>
   When you wanted hip-hop denim in the early '90s, who was a good
bet to call? Girbaud.
</P>
<P>
   The Greensboro, N.C., based jeans maker was the center of a
young fashion-edgy cult among the young who considered the label
oh-so-cool. It was an easy fit. Before the company was part of the
VF Corp, in the 1970s, the Paris-based Girbauds were pioneers in
stone-washing denim. And they were part of the drive behind torn
and distressed denim in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion pundits know well that Marithe and Francois Girbaud
_ middle-aged, French intellectual, avant-gardists _ have long been
looking well beyond denim. Their quest is for modern clothes
appropriate to urban life in a new century.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny high-tech fabrics, protective armor, active stretch
textiles and clothes that leave arms free to move are their
priorities. They have introduced light laser-cut fabrics that leave
no need for traditional seams and hems.
</P>
<P>
   In their fall fashion show in New York last spring, they brought
you heat-fused fabrics and city street styling that blends day into
night and casual into active. They crossbred ski and skateboard
pants and put knee pouches into military pants. They provided ways
to travel light without bags and baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The key word here is pockets, deep cargo pockets (inset) and
roomy hidden satchels. And for those who have toted handbags over
sore shoulders or run through a storm with a bag bouncing against
the ribs, the idea not only fits the cargo fashion of the moment
but also offers comfort as an attainable dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Girbauds, along with Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, are
working on a new century. Maybe it's time to think about going
forward and not back.
</P>
<P>
   Deep pockets required
</P>
<P>
   About those pockets, anyone who has traipsed through a mall or
schoolyard recently knows cargo pants and shorts with deep leg
level pockets are the uniform with the young.
</P>
<P>
   What you may not know, the pants originated with the British
army in 1938 and were worn in the 1940s by American paratroopers
who packed ammunition in the side pockets, the Wall Street Journal
noted recently.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are not just for kids and club types who stuff their
pockets with beepers and credit cards. Moving into fall, the pants
are slated for hautier fashion ground. Ralph Lauren's suede
version, for instance, priced well over $2,000, makes deep pockets
more than a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cargo fashions are bringing in pocketfuls of cash,'' noted the
Journal, which predicted sales in cargo styles at $2.3 billion in
1998, as estimated by a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   For your own wallet, check out Army-Navy stores for the
originals.

KANSAS DOCTOR PERFORMING LATE-TERM ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Kansas' most well-known abortion doctor has begun
performing ``partial-birth'' abortions at his clinic in Wichita,
raising further questions about a new state law.
</P>
<P>
   George Tiller, owner of Women's Health Care Services, began
doing the late-term abortion procedure on fetuses with severe
abnormalities this month, said the clinic's administrative
director, Dena Vogler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are performing so-called partial-birth abortions as defined
by Kansas law,'' Vogler said Thursday. ``We have found a
satisfactory method so that we can legally do these procedures and
honor the desires of the women and families that require these
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogler said Tiller so far has performed ``a couple'' of the
abortions since the beginning of the month. Tiller, one of a
handful of doctors in the nation who perform late-term abortions,
now is thought to be the only doctor in Kansas performing
``partial-birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes said Tiller's actions circumvent the intent of the
law, which went into effect July 1. But Tiller's clinic _ which the
new law is directed at _ maintains that the new procedure is legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely not skirting the law,'' Vogler said. ``The
lawmakers wrote a bill which was difficult to interpret in many
respects, and we are playing the hand that has been dealt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law, passed in the final days of the legislative
session, prohibits late-term abortions unless the woman's life is
in danger or if the pregnancy would cause irreversible impairment
``of a major bodily function'' of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves signed the bill into law in April, but there
has been confusion ever since over what it really means. Some said
the law banned virtually all late-term abortions, with no
exceptions for severe fetal abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Graves, insisted that the ``major bodily
function'' clause meant either ``mental or physical'' bodily
function, which would allow women with severely deformed fetuses to
get post-viability abortions. ``Viability'' is defined in the law
as the point at which the fetus can survive indefinitely outside
the womb.
</P>
<P>
   While attention was focused on the viability section of the law,
another twist emerged: A separate section in the law banning
``partial-birth'' abortions contained a ``mental health''
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes were taken aback at the news about Tiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's simply proving the point that the pro-life people have
made for years: He's the Dr. Kevorkian of abortion,'' said Rep. Tim
Carmody, an Overland Park, Kan., Republican who helped write the
new law. ``He will push the envelope as far as he possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmody said that if Tiller had found a loophole, legislators
would address it next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently the definition we have is not strong enough to stop
it,'' he said. ``So it's just a matter of a few months until we get
a stronger partial-birth abortion ban on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Gittrich, director of Kansans for Life, said Graves is
partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows how much the governor prevented partial-birth
abortions, doesn't it?'' Gittrich said. ``Bill Graves worked on the
passage of a partial-birth ban that doesn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves' spokesman referred calls on the issue to the attorney
general's office. Mary Horsch, spokeswoman for Kansas Attorney
General Carla Stovall, expressed surprise at the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had not known about it, but we'll certainly take a look at
it to see what's going on,'' Horsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Vogler said that Tiller's ``partial-birth'' method is different
from the one used by other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing the procedure that the public normally
envisions when they hear about this term,'' she said. ``We are
providing full cranial anesthesia, which causes fetal death, and we
are in fact aspirating a portion of the cranial contents in order
to comply with the Kansas law.''
</P>
<P>
   In most states with bans on ``partial-birth'' abortion _ the
medical term is ``intact dilation and evacuation'' _ the procedure
is defined as one in which the fetus is partly extracted legs
first, then the base of the skull is punctured and the contents
drained so it can pass more easily through the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' new law, however, defines ``partial-birth'' abortion as
a procedure that ``includes the deliberate and intentional
evacuation of all or a part of the intracranial contents of a
viable fetus prior to removal of such otherwise intact fetus from
the body of the pregnant woman.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Tiller doesn't have to partly extract the fetus
before draining the contents of the skull. He can kill the fetus
and drain the skull in the womb, then induce the woman into labor
so she delivers a stillborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   The method varies only slightly from the late-term ``induction
method'' that Tiller has performed for years, in which he killed
the fetus by injecting its heart with a chemical, then induced the
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essentially the same procedure,'' Vogler said. ``We have
simply changed the location of the injection of the agent that
causes fetal demise, and we are also aspirating a portion of the
cranial contents in order to be doing what the law defines as a
partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not think the ``partial-birth'' procedure posed
any more risk to the patients than the previous late-term method
used by Tiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very little to go on, but we would not employ this
method if we didn't feel that it was a sound procedure that was
safe for our patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tiller has filed a lawsuit in the Kansas Supreme
Court challenging the new law. He did not, however, challenge the
``partial-birth'' abortion section.
</P>
<P>
   Vogler said she did not know whether Tiller would continue to
perform the procedures if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that question, because we have done so few of
these procedures.''

ANOTHER GIRAFFE DIES AT KC ZOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ For the second time in less than six months a
Masai giraffe has died of a mystery illness at the Kansas City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old female, named Jeanerry, collapsed about 3:45 p.m.
Wednesday. More than 100 visitors watched as officials attempted to
treat her below the boardwalk between the lion and rhino exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her legs absolutely went out from under her,'' said zoo
spokeswoman Denise Rendina. ``Her neck went limp.''
</P>
<P>
   The other giraffe stood still watching as the veterinary staff
administered an IV and oxygen. The animal got up once but collapsed
again. It was given a lethal injection about 6 p.m. Test results
are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Suedmeyer, zoo veterinarian, said he does not yet know
whether Jeanerry's ailment was the same one that killed her mother,
Damita, in January. That was a mystery syndrome that has afflicted
28 giraffes in North America in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said they are not concerned about contagion
spreading to other animals. Five other Masai giraffe remain at the
zoo, including Tsavo, a male offspring of Jeanerry. They are among
47 in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Zoo officials hope to meet in Tulsa, Okla., in
September with officials from other zoos holding Masai giraffe to
discuss importing more of the animals to increase genetic
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The death Wednesday was the most public of six apparently
unrelated deaths of high-profile animals at the zoo since December.
A lion had cancer, a gorilla had an aneurysm, a puma had muscle
spasms, and a snow leopard had cancer and a nervous-system problem.
</P>
<P>
   All but the gorilla were euthanized by the zoo's veterinary
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you got, Dr. Kevorkian out there?'' Ollie Gates,
chairman of the city's Board of Parks and Recreation Commissioners,
asked zoo Director Mark Wourms in jest this spring, referring to
the Michigan assisted-suicide advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of them has been because of an illness and not because of
any professional error,'' Rendina said of the deaths. ``Certainly
we are always concerned about the care of our animals. Regretfully,
death is part of what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service last
visited the zoo May 13 and found no problems directly affecting the
welfare of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors have not found any such problems in seven inspections
since August 1996. In June of that year, inspectors ordered repairs
to a pump that circulates water in the baboon area and to a door in
the rhino area.
</P>
<P>
   But clean inspection reports reflect conditions on the day they
are made and would not deter the federal agency _ part of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture _ from investigating further if officials
thought something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Jamie Ambrosi said the agency would look into the
deaths and decide whether a formal investigation is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But Conrad Schmitt, zoo curator, said, ``People need to
understand that this is not an exact science.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly learning new things about all the animals we
take care of. Animals, like people, are born and some of them get
old and die, and some die when they're young. Unlike with people,
we don't get a lot of money for research into unknown causes of
(animal) death.''

`SEVEN GATES OF JERUSALEM': BRAWN OVER BRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Krzysztof Penderecki's ``Seven Gates of Jerusalem''
at the Lincoln Center Festival on Friday night made us wonder about
bigness as a source of beauty and power. It is an immense piece,
not in length nor, I am afraid, in depth but in the almost
intimidating number of singers and orchestra players it directs
toward its listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Two choirs occupied the side balconies of Avery Fisher Hall and
a larger one the back of the stage. The New York Philharmonic not
only faced its audience in the customary position but also sent
squadrons of players to the back of the hall. Indeed, this was the
concert experience in the form of a siege. People even
contemplating escape soon realized that great waves of music had
sealed off every route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Gates of Jerusalem'' sets biblical fragments from
Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Daniel and commemorates that city's
3,000 years of history. It had its first performance in Jerusalem a
year and a half ago and tries hard, desperately hard, to impress us
with its import.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is overscale, lest our minds be allowed to wander.
Choruses boom from every side; brass choirs and claps of percussion
sound at both front and rear. Penderecki's fondness for ominous,
droning pedal points and portentous ostinato figures are manifest
in both the orchestra and voice parts. The sheer size of this piece
cannot help but make its effect, just as two sticks of dynamite
make a bigger hole than one, but how quickly the effect fades once
our ears stop ringing. ``Seven Gates of Jerusalem'' is theater
without drama. Its grandiloquent gestures seek to cover up an
underlying poverty of invention. The melodic lines fade in and out
of tonality and churchlike modality; their movement is incessantly
stepwise and often chromatic.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, Penderecki has sought to discover what a
halfway cultured yet excitement-seeking listener wishes a solemn
and religious piece to sound like and then has assiduously obliged.
We should be able to rejoice when a 20th-century composer cares so
deeply about his listeners, but there is a difference between
reaching into someone else's soul and winning favors through
flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Masur's conducting job was like that of a dispatcher at a
railroad yard: making sure that everyone got on the right track at
the right time and that collisions were avoided. Musicians
stationed far from one another always pose coordination problems,
and there were small ones here; television monitors seemed to help.
The Philadelphia Singers Chorale sang lustily. Christine Goerke's
soprano was the vivid presence in a quintet of soloists that
included Wendy Nielsen, Florence Quivar, Jon Villars and William
Stone. The truly valid moments of the evening came in Boris
Carmeli's richly passionate Hebrew declamations from Ezekiel.
</P>
<P>
   There is an entrepreneurial air to Penderecki's highly
successful composing career. He has a knack for large issues,
weighty subjects and timely events. The novelty of his early music
_ with its swimming textures and designed chaos __ was truly
exciting. But its novelty has worn off, leaving the composer to
pick fastidiously through a supermarket of received ideas. One
wishes they were more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It is rarely a good idea, nor is it very fair, to compare a new
piece with an established one, but at home, after Friday's
performance, I couldn't help thinking of another seven-part piece
equally solemn and religious. Haydn's ``Seven Last Words of
Christ'' for string quartet is barely audible next to the
thunderings of ``Seven Gates of Jerusalem,'' but its music is
freestanding: filled with invention, devoid of slick tricks and
calculated melodrama, appealing to the listener's highest
instincts. After writing this, I spent the rest of the weekend with
it.

THE BUZZ IS ON FOR BONDS. HERE'S WHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The emerging buzz on Wall Street is how the bond
market promises the next big investment bonanza as factors coalesce
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   These factors include continued low inflation, a federal budget
surplus, a stronger dollar, Japanese financial deregulation and the
launching of a single European currency to be known as the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Analyses from a variety of observers point to a scenario that
will unfold as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Rising concerns about the stock market being overvalued will
create more interest among U.S. investors for alternatives such as
bonds, particularly if inflation remains as well-behaved as most
economists expect. While this in and of itself would be a
substantial spur to bonds, there will be much more fueling demand.
This means as investors bid prices up, interest rates can be
expected to decline because they move inversely. Some are
predicting the 30-year bellwether Treasury bond yield will go well
below 5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The critical key will be a stronger dollar, particularly in
relation to the Japanese yen and the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   The next signal event during deregulation of Japan's financial
markets comes as 1999 dawns, when Japanese pension funds will be
freed to diversify portfolios. Pension fund investments have been
limited to Japanese bonds, which have painfully meager yields. Fund
managers will be looking for the higher yields available in
America, and Treasuries will be especially attractive as the
dollar's value continues to rise against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times analysis noted that Japanese pension funds are
sitting on $9 trillion and quoted one economic advisory firm's
estimate that as much as 15 percent of this total will be put into
play in the U.S. bond market next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the world, anticipation of the launching of
the euro has led German investors to conclude that their D-mark
holdings will be devalued because the mark is Europe's strongest
currency. The euro, it is reasoned, can't be brought to market at
the high end of Europe's currency value range. It would put
countries with currencies of less value at too much of a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   This has led Germans to hedge by moving into dollar-denominated
investments, which already has provided a lift for the Treasuries
market. As confusion mounts during the period of adjusting to the
euro currency, the hedging trend into dollar investments is
expected to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all this will be happening as the U.S. budget comes
into balance for the first time in nearly three decades. This means
the supply of Treasuries relative to demand will be less than has
been the case during the years when huge deficits had to be
financed with large issues of Treasury debt.
</P>
<P>
   This will tend not only to make Treasuries more dear than
otherwise would be the case, but to force investors to look beyond
governments for their credit market investment opportunities, which
bodes well for corporate bonds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the strengthening dollar will hurt stocks,
and this is certainly true for companies with earnings heavily
dependent on export trade as U.S. goods become more expensive for
foreign buyers. On the other hand, a bull market in bonds implies
low interest rates and low inflation, both of which imply good
things for the economy and corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the smart money's right, 1999 might be a lot better year
than most investors dared hope for.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KATONAH, N.Y. _ There are many opera conductors who bring more
podium experience and technical ability to the job than Will
Crutchfield, who led his first opera in 1991. But Crutchfield has a
special understanding of the bel canto opera repertory, which he
demonstrated again Saturday at the Caramoor Festival here,
presiding over an affecting performance of Donizetti's ``Lucrezia
Borgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast he had assembled and coached clearly benefited from his
knowledge of the style. The players of the splendid Orchestra of
St. Luke's responded sensitively. But it was Crutchfield's palpable
belief in this work as a compelling musical drama that made the
performance so satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   For many opera buffs, it's hard to distinguish ``Lucrezia
Borgia'' among the nearly 70 operas Donizetti churned out during
his 20 working years. For sure, there are formulaic aspects to the
score, and it takes a leap to accept Lucrezia as a sympathetic
heroine. In the face of ruthless rivalries among 16th-century
Italian aristocrats, Lucrezia has schemed her way through four
marriages, leaving a trail of poisoned victims behind.
</P>
<P>
   But, in opera, music often reveals a subtext that works on a
deeper level than the plot, and that is the case here. Seen another
way, the opera centers on a young man, Gennaro, who was abandoned
by his parents, raised by poor a fisherman, made his way as a
soldier of fortune and was under the mysterious protection of an
anonymous powerful family. As Crutchfield, a former music critic of
The New York Times, explains in his program notes, Gennaro is torn
between his circle of privileged friends _ especially his best
friend, Orsini _ who tempt him into ``decadent dissipation,'' and
his longing for his lost mother, who, it turns out, is Lucrezia.
So, musically, the opera becomes a battle between a dramatic
coloratura soprano, Lucrezia, and a hearty coloratura
mezzo-soprano, the trouser role of Orsini, over a young tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Crutchfield was sometimes so concerned with revealing the
lyrical flow and dignity of this music that his spacious shaping of
the long-lined arias lost rhythmic continuity. But it was better to
err on the side of elegance, for too often Donizetti's profusion of
bel canto melody can sound generic, and here it seemed inspired.
And Crutchfield brought a sense of compositional coherence to the
score overall, with its mix of arias, dramatic ensembles and
spirited crowd scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery soprano Lauren Flanigan, who has a devoted following,
had been scheduled to sing Lucrezia, and many in the sold-out house
had probably come expecting her. She had to withdraw, however,
because some performances in Japan detained her longer than
expected, and she said she had not adequately learned the role of
Lucrezia. Her replacement, Melanie Helton, sang with confidence.
She is an intelligent, expressive soprano who has an essentially
big-sized voice, yet sings soft, high phrases with care. Her sound
is sometimes grainy and hard-edged, but her performance was
involving.
</P>
<P>
   Tenor Bruce Fowler made a sweet-voiced, youthful Gennaro. And if
he seemed a bit fresh and malleable, it fit the character
perfectly. As Orsini, the remarkable mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux,
who scored a triumph last season at Caramoor in Rossini's ``Donna
del Lago'' was remarkable again. Her voice is vibrant, flexible and
interesting. She sings with technical ease and dramatic
incisiveness. Her scintillating and sensual performance of the
drinking song in the final scene made this music seem a clear model
for Eboli's ``Song of the Veil'' in Verdi's ``Don Carlo.'' The
stentorian bass Hao Jiang Tian as the Duke of Ferrara, Lucrezia's
husband, and tenor Steven Tharp as his agent, also did solid work.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor Venetian Theater has a popular new innovation:
supertitles, employing a digital screen system, much like those
road signs that flash advisories on the highways. But it was a good
solution for an outdoor theater. The grounds of the estate remain a
lovely place to enjoy a pre-performance picnic. But it is what
Crutchfield has to share with us about a misunderstood repertory
that has made the yearly ``Bel Canto at Caramoor'' opera an
essential contribution to a respected festival.

PLASTIC PEOPLE: ECHOES OF 1968 CZECHOSLOVAK ROCK AND STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Plastic People of the Universe, formed in 1968 in
Prague, are one of the few rock bands that can claim to have
changed history. The group's somberly propulsive music and
sardonic, surreal lyrics, along with its English name, were taken
as subversive provocations by the Czechoslovak government that was
installed after the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'70s, rock that had considered itself transgressive
in the West had been absorbed into the entertainment business. But
in Eastern Europe, unofficial artistic expression was seen as a
threat to order. When the members of the Plastic People were jailed
in 1976 for ``organized disturbance of the peace,'' Czech artists,
students and intellectuals formed a human-rights movement, Charter
77, that eventually helped to overturn the government. In 1989,
Charter 77's leader, Vaclav Havel, became the president of
independent Czechoslovakia. But in the meantime, the band broke up;
its core members formed Pulnoc (Midnight), which toured the United
States in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Plastic People reunited last year for the 20th anniversary
of Charter 77, and on Saturday night they performed at Irving Plaza
as part of the Intel New York Music Festival. The concert was a
benefit for Tamizdat, a nonprofit organization that makes
connections among artists in the United States, Western Europe and
the former Eastern bloc. And the music, though no longer considered
seditious, retains a good part of its dour intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The band reached back to its earliest repertory, when it was
enamored of the Velvet Underground and the Doors, groups that built
songs on steady, inexorable vamps. Its music is by its bassist,
Milan Hlavsa, and the songs center on repeating bass riffs that
crimp blues-based Western rock into dissonant minor keys that are
unmistakably Eastern European. Jan Brabec, on drums, made those
riffs pushy and explosive; he could settle into one brawny,
relentless beat or snap the music to attention with bursts of
syncopation.
</P>
<P>
   The music's late-'60s roots showed clearly, recapturing a time
when rudimentary rock opened up to exploratory, chaotic solos. When
Josef Janicek's plinking keyboards were in the foreground, the
music evoked the Doors; Jiri Kabes, on viola, linked the group to
both the Velvet Underground and to Eastern European fiddle
traditions. A younger guitarist, Joe Karafiat, has joined the
longtime Plastic People; he wailed above the riffs with psychedelic
squiggles, and occasionally added quick-scrubbing '70s funk chords.
Vratislav Brabanec, on alto saxophone, played scurrying, free-jazz
solos or joined in on the bass lines to make the group sound
something like early King Crimson.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavsa sang and intoned most of the lyrics, in Czech, with a
low, haunted growl that sometimes reached up to a bitter shout.
Brabanec announced song titles in English, among them
``Intoxication,'' ``Constipation,'' ``Elegy,'' ``Magic Nights,''
``Nobody'' and ``Little Canary,'' which he said was about the
canary dying. ``A very sad song,'' he said, with a droll
half-smile; the strife was over, but not forgotten.

 &HT;    First, the Masters; Now, the British for calm O'Meara
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ His 4-iron to the green on the final
playoff hole having just settled into two-putt range Sunday evening
at Royal Birkdale, Mark O'Meara turned to his caddie, Jerry
Higginbotham, and declared, ''I can't believe how calm I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's OK,'' said Higginbotham, ''cause I'm nervous enough for
both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   On a British Open Sunday jammed with enough dramatic moments to
fill a Royal &AMP; Ancient highlight reel, the 41-year-old O'Meara
calmly added another chapter to his amazing year, securing the
Claret Jug in a playoff over Brian Watts after both finished at
even-par 280. The Jug will assume a spot in the trophy case of
O'Meara's Orlando home, next to the hardware earned at Augusta
National two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, to match the glistening trophy there is silver in
the champion's hair. O'Meara became the oldest player in the modern
era to capture two majors in the same season (Jack Nicklaus was 40
in 1980, Ben Hogan 40 in 1953). O'Meara also is the first American
to win two majors in a season since Tom Watson took both the U.S.
Open and British Open in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''To win an event such as this is just an incredible feeling,''
O'Meara said. ''Let alone what happened at Augusta this year, and
now to win two major championships in one year, if I could put my
finger on it, I would have done it earlier in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham was the least surprised. He put down 100 pounds on
his man early in the week at 40-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy's been winning golf tournaments the last five years
pretty steadily,'' noted his ecstatic employee. ''This year he wins
two majors. Who knows? Now maybe he goes crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering her husband's methodical march at the Masters, where
he hung around patiently and then sprinted home with closing
birdies, Alicia O'Meara said, ''He had that same sort of relaxed
state this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone remaining relaxed Sunday deserve to win a major
championship One minute amateur Justin Rose, the British Boy
Wonder, was holing out from 45 yards out for birdie on the 72nd
hole, tying for fourth. The next minute, a fist-pumping Tiger Woods
was birdieing the final three holes for 66, placing third at 281,
to nearly secure a playoff spot against Watts and his Orlando
neighbor from Isleworth Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   And while O'Meara had the cash ($520,000) and the cup, Watts had
the shot of the tournament. Stuck with a downhill lie and one foot
out of the bunker near the 18th green, and needing a par to push
O'Meara to a four-hole playoff, Watts blasted the low shot to a
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, if you had told me I would have been in a playoff
at the Open Championship at the beginning of the week, I wouldn't
have believed you,'' said the 32-year-old Watts, who gave the Japan
Tour new credibility. ''I'm happy to be here, but also I'm
disappointed that I didn't win because I had the opportunity to do
it today.''
</P>
<P>
   After his closing 68 caught Watts at 70, O'Meara basically won
the playoff on the first extra hole, the 15th, sinking a 5-footer
for birdie as Watts lipped out from four feet. The British Open
format is an aggregate score for the four holes. O'Meara was
1-under, Watts 1-over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt it I went out there today (two shots behind Watts) and
played well and kept my composure, coming down the stretch,
hopefully I would have a shots,'' O'Meara said. ''That's all I
think you can ask for in the game of golf.''

 &HT;    Dolphins hope Avery can make the big plays
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ This isn't the first time someone gambled on John
Avery. When Avery was 5, an uncle took bets that his little nephew
could outrun all the older boys in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't give me a dime,'' Avery said at the practice
facility of the Miami Dolphins, for whom size is important as
training camp starts, and yet is not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' offense has been a small-time operation lately,
plodding down the field little by little. Last season, Dan Marino
did not complete a 30-yard pass in 10-of-16 starts. Karim
Abdul-Jabbar's longest rush was 22 yards. Miami has not returned a
punt for a touchdown since 1993, or a kickoff for a score since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Big plays? Big zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody to account for,'' said one NFL personnel director.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in April, Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson handed a large task
to a small man _ the 5-foot-9, 186-pound Avery, a halfback from
Mississippi who had runs of 97 and 74 yards last season, and a
kickoff return of 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's plenty big enough to do what we need him to do,'' said
new offensive coordinator Kippy Brown, who lobbied for Johnson to
take Avery with the 29th pick. ``It makes all the difference when,
in one play, a guy can take it all the way down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do things like Houdini,'' Avery said. ``Make them miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Pity he can't magically make himself bigger, so the doubters
would disappear. The perception is that small backs are not as
durable, that they cannot play every down, that they are doomed to
such limited duties as catching dump-off passes and returning
kicks. Johnson, upon taking Avery higher than most teams slotted
him, conceded he ``may be more than a specialty player.''
</P>
<P>
   Even teams that liked him as a second-round pick questioned if
he could handle the pounding as a ballcarrier. ``We thought he was
as quick and fast a player as there was in the draft,'' said
Cincinnati Bengals director of pro and college personnel Jim
Lippincott. Yet the Bengals, who start 230-pound Corey Dillon at
halfback, worked Avery out as a cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a player of that size to carry the load for 16 games would
be unusual,'' said Scott Studwell, the Minnesota Vikings player
personnel coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller backs go down too easy,'' Lippincott said. ``And
sometimes their legs go like hell, but they don't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 backs who ran for at least 1,000 yards last season,
nine are under 6-feet, including Detroit's Barry Sanders, who led
the league with 2,053 yards. Yet only Napoleon Kaufman is under 200
pounds. Warrick Dunn, at 180 pounds, rushed for 978 yards as a
Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were shocked about what kind of inside runner Dunn
was,'' said Terry Bradway, the Kansas City Chiefs director of
player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Avery will surprise skeptics, too. Little would surprise
those who coached him, or against him, in college. Ole Miss head
coach Tommy Tuberville, who tutored some burners as a University of
Miami assistant, calls him the quickest player he's coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great quicks,'' said Jeff Rouzie, linebackers coach at
Alabama, which was scorched for a touchdown return. ``You try to
gang tackle him as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior in Asheville, N.C., Avery rushed for
1,871 yards and 32 scores. He was headed for the University of
Tennessee until he failed an SAT test and spent two seasons at
Northwest (Miss.) Community College before moving to Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   In two years as a Rebel, he rushed for 1,650 yards on 247
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Avery must grow as a blocker and receiver. He could bench-press
385 pounds before dislocating his elbow, and Ole Miss coaches say
he was often too aggressive as a blocker. But many teams refrained
from blitzing the Rebels, fearing overpursuit would allow Avery to
bust a long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embarrasses people when they miss him,'' Studwell said.
``Every time he touches the ball, he's a threat to take it to the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery hasn't been asked to do much receiving _ 35 catches in two
Div.I seasons _ but that skill may determine his initial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put him in the slot, or split him out, then you
really have a weapon,'' Bradway said. ``Teams will be forced to put
an extra defensive back in the game, or cover him with a
linebacker, and that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery as Miami's feature back _ will that happen? Many around
the league don't think so, at least not yet, even if they
acknowledge that bigger backs aren't always more durable. Taller
backs certainly aren't. Buffalo's Thurman Thomas, at 5-foot-10, has
missed six games in 11 years. Minnesota's Robert Smith, at 6-feet,
has missed 28 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taller guys tend to run high, and present a bigger target,''
said Rich Snead, director of player personnel for the Tennessee
Oilers, who have the rare big back (Eddie George) with a little
wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big backs dish out punishment, but also absorb a lot,''
Studwell said. ``They wear out faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery, like Sanders, has learned to contort his body, avoiding
contact. The two games he missed at Ole Miss were after he hurt his
elbow, stretching for yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was going against the best in the SEC, and he didn't take
a solid hit,'' said Eddie Gran, running backs coach at Ole Miss.
``You don't get a perfect-form tackle on him. You're just grabbing
at his ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough to catch, as the fish were when he would go on excursions
with his grandfather. ``Not deep sea,'' Avery said. ``I was pretty
sure a marlin would drag me through the water.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Bears, and Lions, and Colts? Big ones?
</P>
<P>
   ``When fear sets in, it doesn't matter who is chasing you,''
Avery said. ``You just run. The lion wakes up every day knowing he
must outrun the fastest gazelle to eat and survive. The gazelle
knows he must outrun the fastest lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this little gazelle can wake up a snoozing offense.

 &HT;    Jones runs into 21st century
 &HT;    By Dani Davies
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sylvia Hatchell thinks of the hundreds of pre-game speeches
she has delivered in 23 years coaching basketball, there is one
moment that stands out.
</P>
<P>
   As she talked to her players before a game during North
Carolina's national championship run in 1994, her eyes met those of
freshman point guard Marion Jones ... and the coach became inspired
by the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at me with so much intensity in her eyes that she
was on the verge of tears, and we hadn't even played the game
yet,'' Hatchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, that intensity has propelled Jones to the edge
of a new conquest. She has emerged on the international track and
field scene as a phenomenon, a just-in-time miracle in a sport of
retiring stars.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackie Joyner-Kersee hangs up her spikes after next
weekend's U.S. Open, Jones will fall into position to be crowned
America's newest speed queen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some observers may have jumped the starting gun on
that coronation. Jones' coach, Trevor Graham, calls Jones ``one of
the greatest female athletes to ever walk on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, that's a swooshing sound you hear in Jones' jet
stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think that if the world doesn't know who Marion
Jones is now, it's only a matter of time before they do,'' said
Dave Mingey, the corporate communications manager for Nike, which
has signed Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 22, combines Joyner-Kersee's athleticism, Dan O'Brien's
charm, Carl Lewis' showmanship, and Wilma Rudolph's history-making
ability, giving track and field fans a hybrid of the best they've
seen.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, she will supplant world records in the
100 and 200 meters, and long jump and win five golds, including
relays, at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. When that's done, the WNBA
will Marion Jones won the 100 meters in 10.84 seconds in an
Austrian meet this month. Her 10.71 finish in China made her the
world's second-fastest woman after Florence Griffith Joyner, who
holds the record at 10.49.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who will face Joyner-Kersee in this week's Goodwill
Games, is pursuing her many goals with a Lewis-like attitude _ get
out of my way. She's used to critics and skeptics ... those who
questioned her decision to skip track and field for a basketball
scholarship, then leave North Carolina after her junior season to
chase world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I'm 50, there will be those people talking about
what I should and shouldn't do, but they don't pay my bills,'' she
said. ``To hell with everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 USA Track &AMP; Field News Female Athlete of the Year may
be confident, but she's also smart enough to pace her pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can run faster than a 10.49 (in the 100), faster
than a 21.34 (in the 200) and jump longer than 24-8 1/4 before my
career is over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patricia Rico, the president of USA Track &AMP; Field,
everyone is waiting to see whether Jones can follow through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human nature to want to see records made and records
broken,'' she said. ``We have in our midst one of the greatest
athletes of the future and maybe the greatest of our time, so why
not?''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving UNC last spring, Jones won the world and U.S.
100-meter titles. Then she stunned fans with a 10.71 finish in
Chengdu, China, becoming the world's second-fastest woman after
Florence Griffith Joyner. Last month, she became the first woman in
50 years to win three individual events at the national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner's 100 and 200 world records, which most athletes have
viewed with reverence for 10 years, suddenly seem vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Five gold medals in a single Olympics would be unprecedented.
Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis each won four in 1936 and '84,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Hatchell, when Jones sets a goal for herself
``you can pretty much write it in the books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As an athlete,'' Hatchell said, ``there are no flaws in Marion
Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   When UNC track coach Dennis Craddock first watched her run as a
10th-grader, he saw ``a woman among girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has that little thing inside her that you can't quite put
your finger on,'' Craddock said. ``It's a fierceness that comes out
in everything she does that makes her a great, great competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jones accepted the basketball scholarship to UNC, track
fans shook their heads. Why would the top sprinter in the nation
trade track for basketball? But when the Tar Heels won the title,
the debate quieted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the championship was kind of a see-I-told-you-so type
of thing for me,'' said Jones, who led ACC freshman in points (494)
and steals (111) that season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels beat Louisiana Tech 60-59 for the title on
Charlotte Smith's game-winning basket. Jones said it ``felt like
hours'' for the shot to fall. The journalism major said she still
can't find the words to describe the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a feeling that can never be matched,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games might come close.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones, after 1,716 career points, three ACC titles and one
national championship, passed up her senior season to dedicate
herself to track. UNC fans were confused and crushed and the WNBA
also was left behind _ the league gave Jones an oen invitation to
play that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   But even Hatchell knows Jones made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think track is Marion's future, at least for now,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is intent on achieving her goals on the track, but her
most important objectives go beyond the record books.
</P>
<P>
   She said the best thing about her life is that she's happy, and
that has less to do with sports than it does her health _ she broke
her left foot twice at UNC _ and ``her wonderful fiance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and C.J. Hunter, one of the world's elite shot-putters,
plan to marry in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't be inspired by her?'' Hunter said from the
couple's home in North Carolina. ``She won't stop until she's
happy.''

 &HT;    Pizza delivery more costly than you think
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Depending on how you slice it, pizza delivery
drivers pay a high price for the privilege of delivering those
pepperoni pies.
</P>
<P>
   Many young drivers hop in the their cars not thinking who would
foot the bill should they cause an accident while on a run.
</P>
<P>
   Many personal insurance carriers will deny the claim, most will
not renew the driver's insurance, and some may do all of the above,
say industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's Pizza has one of the most unforgiving policies in the
industry when it comes to delivery drivers. This stems in no small
part from the wave of multi-million dollar personal-injury lawsuits
the company settled in the early '90s, after its ``30-minutes or
free'' guarantee triggered a rash of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Like most in the industry, Domino's insurance policies cover
only damage and injury to the other party. If Domino's employees
caused the accident, they have to find some other means to repair
their own cars. They also have to look for other work. ``Our
drivers are fired when they're in accidents,'' said Ann Roth,
director of administration for Western Ohio Pizza Inc., the
franchisee that operates 51 Domino's stores in Ohio and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The company conducts quarterly driving-record checks. It fires
employees who receive three or more moving violations, on or off
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Like many pizza chains, Domino's carries a standard commercial
non-owned vehicle insurance policy. Unlike many other parlors and
chains, however, Domino's often relies on the personal policies of
its employees to settle claims.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's doesn't like to say that it carries commercial
liability insurance, even to its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost hate to let them know that we have insurance,'' Roth
conceded. ``That's not something we tell prospective employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for them to know about it until they get
into an accident, and then their insurance is responsible,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance carriers disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're an employee of a company making deliveries, it
would be logical that the company would cover that employee,'' said
Jim Horvath, a spokesman for Allstate Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to be up front with (delivery drivers),'' said Jan
Ward, director of insurance at the Automobile Club of America's
Dayton office. ``It's not worth it for a lot of these kids to be
working for them (Domino's).''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, the employees' insurance will cover that
accident. Because Domino's automatically fires the employee in an
at-fault accident, the company doesn't have to worry about a
recurring incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be a second time,'' Roth said. ``Our
policy is they carry their own insurance that's primary in any
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The strict policy has helped drive down the Ann Arbor, Mich.,
company's insurance costs by 25 percent over the last decade, Roth
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut Inc. also requires its drivers to carry personal auto
insurance and conducts driving-record inspections twice a year. But
the company relies on its own liability insurance when one of its
employees causes an accident and the employee isn't necessarily
fired automatically, said company spokesman Jay Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our insurance company takes care of it,'' he said. ``If we
thought the employees' insurance company would cover it, we
wouldn't need to carry liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies require policy holders to list their
occupations. But many times, young people who are covered in one
job subsequently take a delivery position and fail to tell their
insurance companies. Many parents also fall into this trap.
</P>
<P>
   One Domino's delivery man, who declined to have his name used,
said the job is worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if my insurance company knows I deliver for
Domino's,'' he said. ``But I had a friend whose insurance tripled
when he informed his company he'd be delivering.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, smaller pizza stores struggle whether to pay the high
premiums for commercial insurance, or risk the exposure by not
getting coverage at all. One Dayton pizza shop owner said he didn't
buy insurance for drivers when he first started 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small business owners say, `We don't have anything to lose,'
'' said the owner, who wished to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza drivers typically are 18-24 and put more miles on their
cars than most, too risky a demographic to be covered under a
personal policy. They can choose to get a commercial policy, which
boosts the premiums out of range for most.
</P>
<P>
   That's life in America, said Alan Rubin, president of Carnegie
Insurance Service Corp. in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Domino's has a responsibility to tell employees
(it has its own liability insurance),'' Rubin said. ``Hey, you
don't have to take the job.''

 &HT;    Ten top moments while staring at a square box
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are we talking greatest moments?
</P>
<P>
   Or are we talking greatest events?
</P>
<P>
   And what were the standards for evaluation when, in the July
11-17 issue of TV Guide, a list of the ``50 Greatest TV Sports
Moments of All Time'' was compiled?
</P>
<P>
   What was the most important factor in making a determination of
the worth of the moment/event? Did it have to be technically
innovative in terms of television itself? Or was its significance
based strictly on how compelling the moment/event was on its own?
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide concluded that Carlton Fisk's home run to win Game 6 of
the 1975 World Series for the Boston Red Sox in their Fenway Park
home ``remains the ultimate moment in TV sports.'' The summary of
the moment (not a game, in this particular case) suggests
television's role _ hey, it's TV Guide _ was of considerable
consequence in the selection process: ``NBC director Harry Coyle
kept the scoreboard camera on Fisk, creating one of the medium's
most famous reaction shots. As if in a trance, the catcher bounced
up and down near home plate, waving at the ball, willing it to stay
fair. And when the ball obeyed, caroming off the foul poul, (Fisk)
leaped into the air and began his trot around the bases ... ''
</P>
<P>
   That's very nice.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Bill Mazeroski's home run in Game 7 to win the
1960 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the New York
Yankees. Can't you see still the grainy black-and-white picture of
fans on the field as Mazeroski runs the bases? It didn't make the
list. And what about Kirk Gibson limping around the bases in Game 1
of the 1988 World Series after hitting a homer for the Los Angeles
Dodgers. It was 29th.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide wrote that its list was ``bound to spark debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to turn down an invitation ... here's one man's Top 10
events/moments in the history of televised sports:
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI (unlisted) _ No joke. It was 1968 when NBC cut away from
an NFL game _ a close one _ between the Oakland Raiders and New
York Jets to show a movie. Oakland scored two quick touchdowns and
won, and Heidi remains pro football's best friend to this day. Oh,
by the way, the Jets didn't lose again that season, and went on to
win Super Bowl III. Which brings us to ...
</P>
<P>
   SUPER BOWL III (unlisted) _ New York Jets quarterback/jetsetter
Joe Namath promised a victory over the substantially favored
Baltimore Colts, and his team delivered. This game in 1969 made
Super Bowls important. Good enough?
</P>
<P>
   REGGIE (No. 18) _ Forget about the single-shot heroics that won
a Series (Mazeroski and Toronto's Joe Carter) or a game (Gibson and
Fisk). The best power show in Series history was Reggie Jackson
cracking three on three successive pitches off three different
pitchers in 1977's Game 6 for the New York Yankees against the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   THE ICE BOWL (No. 3) _ Green Bay beat Dallas in a Lambeau Field
freezer with windchills registering minus-46 degrees. The Packers,
disdaining a field-goal attempt to tie and force a playoff
overtime, won on quarterback Bart Starr's sneak in the final
seconds. A game played in 1967 remains one of football's most
memorable in terms of man vs. elements.
</P>
<P>
   SOVIETS WIN (unlisted) _ In the gold medal game in Munich in
1972, officials afforded the Soviet Union basketball team three
chances in the final seconds to upset a U.S. team featuring the
country's best college players. It should never have been that
close, but this was the root of what has grown into a U.S.
obsession of sending a Dream Team (professionals) to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   SOVIETS LOSE (No. 23) _ If you watched, you probably remember
exactly where you were when the young U.S. Olympic hockey team
upset the powerful Soviet Union at Lake Placid in 1980. And you
probably remember the picture of U.S. goalie Jim Craig, wrapped in
an American flag, skating the rink looking for his father in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA-HOUSTON (No. 49) _ A crowd of 52,693 _ and this was 1968 _
assembled in the Astrodome to watch Houston hometown hero Elvin
Hayes and the Cougars beat UCLA's Lew Alcindor and college
basketball's muscleboy Bruins. If you're looking for the place
where college hoops began to nudge its way onto the main stage of
sports in America, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   JACK (No. 8) AND TIGER (No. 27) _ Jack Nicklaus was 46 years old
when he won his sixth Masters in 1986; Tiger Woods was 21 when he
won last year at Augusta. The symmetry of it all is just too
perfect to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   TWO MINUTES (unlisted); NINE MINUTES (No. 37) _ Secretariat by
31 lengths to seal horse racing's Triple Crown in the Belmont
Stakes in 1973; Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns in a 1985
three-round brawl for the middleweight title. As good as horse
racing and boxing can be.
</P>
<P>
   BORG-McENROE (No. 5) _ As good as tennis can be. In 1980,
McEnroe won a fourth-set tiebreak at 18-16 before Borg won the
fifth set at 8-6 to claim his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title.
This rivalry _ from Wimbledon's grass to any other court surface _
will endure as one of the best in the history of the sport for
sustained excellence and the combatants' disparate styles and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have your own list, though, right?
</P>

CULTURAL MODERNITY AND ITS GIFTS OF GRACE AND STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Culture Column) 
(js) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``This is a precious piece of Chinese culture,''
proclaimed the Shanghai cultural minister, Ma Bomin, of the opera
``The Peony Pavilion,'' before preventing it from traveling to the
Lincoln Center Festival. She accused the production of distorting
the 500-year-old work by displaying a skewed vision of China and
grafting on to it ``pornographic'' elements. The implication? That
it was sullied by an American perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Her fears are not solely those of a society unused to democratic
cultural exchange. Just a few weeks ago, in Canada, an
international meeting of culture ministers discussed ways of
protecting their own cultures from an onslaught of American
cultural commerce. A U.S. representative was pointedly not invited.
</P>
<P>
   This idea has even been raised within the United States, as one
minority culture after another has self-consciously staked claims
of cultural autonomy. When a prehistoric skeleton was discovered in
Washington State in 1996, scientific research was halted after an
Indian tribe claimed legal rights to what it called the ancestral
bones. Nearly every minority culture wants just such authority to
assert possession of its past and the right to judge itself in the
present.
</P>
<P>
   This new notion of ``cultural property'' will be the subject of
a conference next spring at the Columbia University School of
Journalism, in New York. Cultural property is more than objects
like the Elgin marbles that were taken from Athens to London, or
the Egyptian treasures found in every major world museum. Cultural
property is also intangible: a set of ideas, attitudes, styles. It
is what makes a culture seem distinct and autonomous. And it is
felt to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, so much cultural resentment is aimed
at the United States partly because U.S. pop culture has become the
dominant world culture, providing the only experiences shared by
both Bedouins in the Sinai and plastic surgeons in Rio. That fact
became an accusation _ and a very explicit one _ in 1982, when Jack
Lang, then the French culture minister, denounced U.S. ``cultural
imperialism'' with its attempts to ``grab consciousness, ways of
thinking, ways of living.'' The language may be more decorous
today, but the ideas are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really a helpful metaphor: treating cultural influence as
if it were imperialist conquest? Cultures are always permeable,
always evolving. Even warfare changes the cultures of both sides.
In 1830, Goethe wrote that, after battles, nations ``could not
return to their settled and independent life again without noticing
that they had learned many foreign ideas and ways, which they had
unconsciously adopted, and come to feel, here and there, previously
unrecognized spiritual and intellectual needs.''
</P>
<P>
   What previously happened through warfare now takes place through
travel and television. In fact, it might have nothing to do with
exploitation of cultural property.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural influence has become almost dizzying. One form of
African pop music, juju, arose out of the influence of U.S. pop,
developed a distinctive style, then returned to the United States
as an import. The Shanghai culture minister claimed a sacral
quality for ``The Peony Pavilion.'' But that had less to do with
its courtly Chinese origins than with 19th-century European
esthetics: ``This is about art,'' she said, ``and the debate should
remain about art.'' All this, just a little more than 30 years
after the Chinese Communists, importing a 19th-century political
ideology, demolished centuries of native artworks in the name of
progress. The web of cultural interaction has touched every
society, often in bizarre ways.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Goethe had it right. The spread of culture has been spurred not
just by war but by the awakening of needs: spiritual, intellectual
and even material. Cultural change does not fit the imperialist
model. In fact, imperialism is now being reinterpreted according to
cultural models. In one recent book, ``The Wealth and Poverty of
Nations'' (W.W. Norton ), the historian David Landes argues that
the military and economic dominance of the West in the last 500
years was due to crucial cultural achievements.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand years ago Europe was a cultural and military
backwater. Then came the separation of church and state, the
development of semi-autonomous cities, the invention of printing, a
tradition of rational investigation in philosophy and science and
the creation of such apparently trivial objects as eyeglasses and
the mechanical clock. These changes, some almost accidental,
affected military technology and navigational skills, creating
abilities that were nearly unique. Which is why the Incas (no
strangers to warfare) weren't able to march into Madrid to massacre
Spaniards, and why 18th-century Egyptians (no strangers to plunder)
never strip-mined the graves of Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why advances in science and medicine and notions of
human rights and liberty evolved in the West, eventually creating
something that has been called ``modernity.'' Modernity has been
powerful not just because of its association with earthly and
military power, but because it has awakened ``unrecognized needs''
for political freedom as well as material goods, while providing
the ability to satisfy some of them. Modernity does not recognize
cultural property or cultural difference; it claims a transcendent
vision. This is its threat as well as its promise.
</P>
<P>
   One reason we are said to live in a post-modern era is that the
claims of modernity are being challenged in worldwide culture wars.
Is there any vision of the world that is transcendent or universal?
Or has each culture built its own equally valid forms of authority?
Nationalism rages in the face of the modern. If, as modernity
asserts, we are all equal, then how are we all different? And what
will happen when such questions are tested in a united Europe, the
region where most of these ideas began their pilgrimages?
</P>
<P>
   The convulsive struggles, ranging from debates over
multiculturalism to confrontations over ``The Peony Pavilion,'' are
not the result of imperialism; imperialism was an anticipation of
these struggles. And now that American popular culture has become
dominant, it is at the center of the fight. It is vulgar in the
oldest sense: made for the broadest number of people. It has also
created entertainments in film and music that tap into popular
feelings about these very issues. These entertainments promise the
satisfaction of desire but warn of its fulfillment; they offer
paeans to both possession and dispossession, and provide visions of
both material plenty and material disaster. At once they celebrate
ethnic difference and cultivate shared experience. This is not
conquest. It is not theft of cultural property. It's modernity at
play.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The reports that emerged this week about NBC
talking with USA Networks Inc. about a possible joint venture
revived longstanding speculation that NBC's parent, General
Electric, is looking to pull out of the volatile and increasingly
problematic television network business.
</P>
<P>
   But senior executives associated with NBC and GE's management
strategy dismissed the notions that a deal with USA Networks was
ever close to happening or that GE and NBC would soon part.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening, said the executives, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, is the result of focus on a goal long articulated by
Robert Wright, NBC's president: finding an entertainment cable
channel that could provide a secondary revenue source for
programming owned by the network. USA Networks would be an ideal
partner, as would a cable channel owned by Viacom, like
Nickelodeon, or one owned by Time Warner, like TNT, both of whom
NBC has talked to.
</P>
<P>
   What made the USA rumor generate more heat, the executives said,
were two factors: the recent decision by Rupert Murdoch to sell 20
percent of his film, television and sports businesses in an initial
stock offering _ a move many investment bankers would like GE to
emulate with NBC _ and the prospect that NBC's profits, which
peaked last year at about $500 million, are certain to fall in the
coming season.
</P>
<P>
   One senior NBC executive said flatly that John Welch, the
chairman of GE, ``does not want to get rid of NBC'' but pointed out
that Wright, who pursues deals avidly, would continue to look for
an arrangement with the right company, preferably a Hollywood
studio with program production operations. But he added that GE
``would have to retain control for tax reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of control is why previous discussions have broken
down. ``Talks will continue to go on,'' the senior NBC executive
said. ``But I'd put the odds on something happening at one in
five.''
</P>
<P>
   And while NBC executives are aware that they face a downturn in
profits in the coming year, Wright has disputed predictions that
the drop will approach $250 million. The senior executive said NBC
had already instituted a series of cost-cutting measures _ quietly,
for example, imposing a freeze on most hiring.

   NETWORKS FIND OLD NEWS CAN BECOME NEW HITS
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Old news is apparently good news.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest trend in television news programming is something
network executives are calling ``repurposing.'' Specifically, it
means taking previously reported stories, adding some updated
material and perhaps a new title and putting them back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CBS announced its long-awaited second edition of ``60
Minutes,'' and one of its big elements will be updates of
``classic'' reports from the archives of the original edition.
</P>
<P>
   That came after ABC's announcement that it would repackage
reports from ``Nightline'' as a prime-time entity with some new
reporting. Accompanying those shows, ABC will create a program that
will take some past reports from its news magazines, ``20/20'' and
``Primetime Live,'' link them by theme, such as consumer or nature
stories, and give them an hour in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, CBS decided to use old editions of its ``48
Hours'' program under the title ``48 Hours Mysteries.'' That show
has been one of the biggest network success stories of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, the president of ABC News, said in an interview
here that as the networks looked to find ways to generate more
revenue, news was increasingly the logical place to go. Not only do
the networks own the shows, he noted but, ``There was a reason a
lot of big successful news pieces were done in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Nightline,'' Westin said Ted Koppel, the
anchor, had been looking for an outlet to showcase some of the
show's best work and had first thought of going to cable's A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we looked at it and said, `Why not do it for us?' I think
`Nightline' can do a lot more. They have such a backlog of great
material.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer is the ideal place to trot out these repackaged news
shows, Westin said, because of the alarmingly low ratings that
repeats of entertainment programs have been getting.

   FILM STUDIOS COUNTING MORE ON FOREIGN SALES
</P>
<P>
   In its first week, Warner Brothers' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' took in
$34 million at U.S. movie theaters. And if its performance matches
that of ``Lethal Weapon 3,'' it could generate $150 million
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   But it could take in even more overseas. ``Lethal Weapon 3''
made $175 million at foreign box offices when it opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. films, particularly hits, are doing more business abroad
than ever. Consider that ``Titanic,'' the joint production of
Viacom's Paramount Pictures and News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox, took
in $1.1 billion at foreign box offices. That is almost twice as
much as Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park,'' the second most
successful U.S. film overseas, which had $556 million in foreign
ticket sales in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ 20 years ago _ U.S. film companies received
just 40 percent of their ticket sales outside the United States.
Last year, for the first time, film studios made more from movie
theaters overseas than they did from those in the United States,
and with more and more countries adding screens, the lead will most
likely widen, film executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Just as U.S. companies raced to build movie theaters in Great
Britain about five years ago, they are starting to build in South
America and some European countries. And with the expansion of
cable and free television abroad, marketing movies has become
easier.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Warner Brothers can count more certainly on a
built-in market for ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' Over the last six years,
the studio has had plenty of time to build brand awareness as
``Lethal Weapon 3'' played on TV worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Does every American film benefit? Certainly not. The ``small''
American film still does not travel well, and comedy may be king at
home, but generally it is not a great export. Each country's humor
depends on the issues and idiosyncrasies of its own culture.

<P>
   COVERAGE OF COLUMNIST PROVOKES COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe's own coverage of Patricia Smith, the columnist
who resigned after acknowledging that she fabricated characters in
four columns, has provoked complaints by a group of 20 black women
that the coverage was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written to The Globe on July 1, the women, including
a civil rights lawyer and a professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, made it clear that they condoned neither
what they called ``Smith's misdeed'' nor the paper's decision to
seek her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But, citing pieces by the Globe columnists David Warsh and
Eileen McNamara on the case, a report by the paper's ombudsman,
Jack Thomas, and an editor's note about the investigation into Ms.
Smith's columns, the women wrote that they ``object strenuously to
the ugly, vindictive campaign the paper is now waging to obliterate
the columnist's otherwise stellar record of achievement as a
journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper's approach has not been worthy of a major civic
institution,'' Margaret A. Burnham, the civil rights lawyer who
helped draft the letter, said in an interview last week. ``They've
taken the approach that I, as an employment lawyer, see a lot: What
can we do to control the damage, to circle the wagons, to protect
the people on our staff?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the volume of the paper's coverage was unfair to
Ms. Smith, The Globe's editor, Matthew V. Storin, said, ``I don't
agree with that, although I understand that it looks that way to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the coverage, which included a report about the
withdrawal of a writing award given to Ms. Smith by the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, he added, ``We had certain
obligations to our readers and to the journalism profession to make
public both the follow-up research on her columns and the fact that
the ASNE writing award was being withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., is planning
to publish one more article on the matter Monday when the
ombudsman, Thomas, gives his accounting of the extent of Ms.
Smith's fabrications. The paper had earlier reported that it had
identified 52 columns, 28 of them published in 1995, that included
the names of people whose existence could not be immediately
verified.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1996, when Storin, suspecting earlier
fabrications, set down what he later called ``rules of the road''
for three Globe columnists _including Ms. Smith, Eileen McNamara
and Mike Barnicle _ Ms. Smith wrote 196 columns, Thomas said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In that group, he said, are 20 with unverified information,
including a total of 36 people whose existence could not be
authenticated. But, he said, there was no clear pattern to the
presumed fabrications, ``no persistent political agenda,'' as he
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith resigned after admitting to fabricating four
characters in recent columns. Her lawyer, John T. Williams, could
not be reached for comment.

IN ARGENTINA, RURAL TOWN WELCOMES SHELTER FROM WINDS OF CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCUMAN, Argentina _ Antonio Domingo Bussi, the barrel-chested,
cigar-chomping governor here in this tiny northwestern province,
has been getting a lot of bad press lately.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, government investigators discovered that
Bussi, a retired general, had a fat Swiss bank account that he
never disclosed on his tax returns. A court reprimanded him, and he
was suspended from office for several months. But he was not
impeached, thanks to rock-solid support in the provincial
legislature and his popularity among voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not legal problems, they are political problems,''
Bussi said in an interview. He called his enemies ``tricksters and
liars'' who could not fool the people of Tucuman.
</P>
<P>
   While Bussi, 72, is a national icon for a hated past of military
repression, he remains Tucuman's favorite politician. He is banned
by the state constitution from seeking re-election next year, but
his son, congressman Ricardo Bussi, is favored to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   The winds of change rushing through the big cities and most of
the provinces of Argentina somehow don't seem to reach Tucuman,
where churches are still filled on Sunday and everything stops for
the daily three-hour siesta.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only province in Argentina still led by a former
official of the military junta era of the 1970s and 1980s but it is
also one of the only places where the political left has influence.
</P>
<P>
   While labor and university activism has died down almost
everywhere else in the country, here in Tucuman students and union
members still throw debris at policemen in regular and near riotous
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Tucuman economics also follow their own rules. Just beginning to
emerge from virtual bankruptcy, the provincial government still
pays its employees with locally printed money, currency as
worthless as Monopoly bills as soon as it is taken across the
provincial borders.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization has swept Argentina as the government continues to
dismantle Gen. Juan Domingo Peron's statist legacy, but here
privatization has run into big problems with 80 percent of the
households refusing to pay the bills sent by the water utility
taken over by a French company three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bussi, whose party is called the Republican Force, was elected
three years ago on a platform in which he vowed to clean up the
mess left from a series of Peronist governors, and he has succeeded
in cutting the local government's deficit while improving many
services such as paving roads and providing street lighting. A new
lemon boom is lifting the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The propaganda against the military that has confused people
elsewhere in Argentina has not confused people in Tucuman because
the people here felt the horrors of the guerrilla war,'' he said,
adding, ``I am and always will be a military man.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Tucuman has certain aspects of Macondo,'' said Eduardo Gallo,
a sociologist at the University of Tucuman, referring to the
imaginary town in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel ``One Hundred
Years of Solitude,'' a place where people levitate and the skies
rain yellow blossoms. ``The place has its peculiarities..''
</P>
<P>
   This impoverished, tropical province of 1.3 million people looks
and feels far more like Central America than the rest of rural
Argentina, which is dominated by the sprawling plains of the pampas
and Patagonia. Here, orange trees line the avenues of this
provincial capital, bearing fruit as fat as melons and flowers that
envelop the city with a sweet fragrance all spring and summer.
Immense sugar cane fields flow to the very edge of the local
airport's landing strip. The province even has its own cuisine;
while meat pies known as empanadas elsewhere in Argentina contain
chopped meat, here it is shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Tucuman has always been a little bit different. Its sugar
economy created a particularly stratified and traditional society,
one in which the plantation barons controlled every aspect of the
lives of their peon workers and ran their own armies as recently as
100 years ago. Tucuman even briefly declared its independence as a
republic in the 1830s, and once waged war against a neighboring
province.
</P>
<P>
   Political turmoil climaxed in the 1970s, when a Cuban-inspired
guerrilla movement grew in the mountains and carried out bombing
campaigns in the towns and cities. The local military government at
the time, led by Bussi, put down the guerrillas, but the civilians
that took power in the 1980s were more efficient at stealing from
the local treasury than running the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bussi's current popularity probably stems from his tough stance
toward Compania de Aguas del Aconquija, the French water company,
as much as anything. He has condoned the public's widespread
refusal to pay its water bills, and from time to time has suggested
he might not pay either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an irrational cannibalism in Tucuman,'' said Jose
Manuel Garcia Gonzalez, vice president of the embattled water
company. Francois de Rochambeau, the general manager of the
company, said, ``Corruption has no obstacles here because the
people are not bothered by it. Why? Only a sociologist can say.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharply negative views of the two executives is
understandable given that their company is losing $2 million every
month and is seeking to either renegotiate the contract it signed
with a previous governor or leave the province altogether. Bussi
predicted that a resolution would come soon, but at the moment his
constituents were upset with the company because ``we're paying
higher water prices than in France, but with lower quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Such populism is music to the ears of many of Tucuman's
residents, including Daniel Palacios, 22, a worker at a local
strawberry farm. ``The people don't care about what Bussi did
before as long as he helps the people now,'' Palacios said. ``Tough
governors are good for keeping the peace.''

YELTSIN DECREES KEY ECONOMIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Stung by his Parliament's rejection of tax-and-spending
reforms widely seen as the only way out of Russia's fiscal
tailspin, President Boris Yeltsin did this past weekend what he had
long threatened: He decreed reforms on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He had little choice. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund
will meet to decide whether to lend Russia $5.6 billion to build up
the depleted reserves of its central bank. The money is regarded as
crucial to stabilizing the value of the ruble and calming panicky
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The money is part of a package of old and new international
loans that totals $22.6 billion. The fund has demanded that Russia
restructure its tax code, cut government spending and take several
other fiscal actions as a condition of getting the money.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Yeltsin signed measures that will quadruple
the tax on most land, allow precious-metals producers to export
their products directly and more tightly regulate alcohol
production and sales. He also vetoed two laws passed by Parliament,
involving profits and excise taxes, that would have lowered tax
revenues by billions of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the actions will make up about $7.7 billion of
the $12.6 billion or so in revenues lost because the Russian
Parliament has refused to enact parts of the government's fiscal
package, officials in Yeltsin's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has come in for some criticism that his refusal to abide
by Parliament's actions is dictatorial. Oddly enough, however, even
Communists in the Legislature who played a major role in torpedoing
parts of the fiscal package have praised his decision _ in part,
perhaps, because they fix responsibility for unpopular measures on
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has not made public the requirements it has set for
approval of the loan on Monday. On Sunday, Yeltsin's chief
negotiator with the IMF, Anatoly Chubais, said that the fund's
officials had taken Parliament's obstinacy hard, and that efforts
to convince them to proceed with the loans have been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But Western financial experts here and in London said Sunday
that it was highly unlikely that the first segment of the loan
package would be rejected at this late date, especially in light of
the fact that Yeltsin's government is committed to the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the loan would also cast a shadow over the planned
visit to Moscow this week by Vice President Al Gore. Last month
Yeltsin sent Parliament 25 proposals to revamp the government's
fiscal structure, but only 14 had been passed when Parliament
recessed on Friday; six were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, IMF officials said Sunday that they were still
reviewing the Parliament's actions and Yeltsin's decrees in an
effort to determine how close they came to fulfilling Russia's
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, the officials said, that the fund will trim back
the first installment of its payment to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important laws passed were measures rewriting the
tax code, regulating alcohol production and enacting a 5 percent
sales tax and a minimum tax for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday on the Russian television network NTV,
Chubais said the money would only buy time for Russia's government
to get its house in order. ``Only Russia's state power can solve
these problems _ nobody else,'' he said. ``We have bought time,
which can be wasted together with the money we have borrowed, or we
can use it to carry out the work we need to do.''

 &HT;    Secretary ready to end Georgia discrimination suit
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says he is ready to
seek closure to a $2.5 billion race discrimination suit filed by
hundreds of the nation's 18,000 black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has joined the House of Representatives in approving
legislation that removes the two-year statute of limitation in
federal discrimination cases. This measure clears a major hurdle
facing about 600 black farmers in 14 states seeking monetary
damages for proven acts of discrimination in lending and
foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   A conference committee is expected to act on the measure in the
next couple of weeks , and then it will go to President Clinton for
his signature.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's signature, Alexander Pires, the lead attorney for
the black farmers, says that he expects an estimated 2,500 black
farmers will be impacted immediately by the decision. Twenty-six
farmers from Georgia are involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USDA finally will be able to address these older cases,
seek closure, and where appropriate, properly resolve complaints of
individuals who have been discriminated against,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The provision included in the agriculture appropriations bill
will allow USDA to settle effectively very old discrimination cases
by waiving the statue of limitation in certain instances.
Individuals whose cases fall into this category should not be
punished for USDA's prior failure to investigate their claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of agriculture publicly acknowledges his
department has treated black farmers differently as a matter of
policy in granting farm loans and foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Race discrimination complaints from black farmers go back as far
as 1983, when then-President Ronald Regan dismantled the civil
rights section of the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the government to go on now and settle the suit. Their
defense was statute of limitation and you don't have that no more,
now let's settle it,'' said North Carolina farmer Tim Pigford, lead
plaintiff in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see that both the Democrats and Republicans are
comfortable in addressing a long-standing problem,'' said Pires.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich led an effort to remove the statute of
limitations provisions and the mantle was carried in the senate by
senators Charles Robb, D-Va., Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Georgia farmers are among those suing USDA.
Alvin Walker, 49, once a thriving Putnam County dairy farmer, hopes
that the decision to help black farmers is not too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might just get us out of their face, but I don't know if
it will stop what is going on in the USDA. Racism in that
department is to the bone and the justice system is not moving
against them,'' said Wallker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is in bankruptcy court trying to keep some of the 150
acres he has owned since 1989.

 &HT;    Smoltz's arm good enough for great stats
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Without even throwing his hardest stuff Sunday
afternoon, John Smoltz battled through 90-degree weather and brief
stints of boredom to notch his third straight win. Yet he swears
that his elbow, which has seen him bounce in and out of the
disabled list this season, has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming off the disabled list June 20, Smoltz is 4-1 in six
starts, with a 2.92 ERA. Overall, he's 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an amazing year, a great year for me,'' said Smoltz,
who started the season on the disabled list after arthroscopic
surgery on his elbow in December. ``I'm sneaking up on people
considering what I've been through. But this is still a
reconstruction period for me to get ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could change real quick for me. The last three or four
starts were tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last outing, a 4-2 victory over the New York Mets, Smoltz
threw a season-high 114 pitches. His pitch counts had gone over 100
pitches the last four starts. The National League leader in innings
pitched in 1997 showed no sign of wear Sunday, as he threw only 86
in the 11-6 laugher (opposing pitcher Jeff Juden threw 87 in three
innings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoltz was great,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``In a game
like that, there was no sense in leaving him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He had certainly made his point. Smoltz left the game leading
11-3 after the seventh inning. Before exiting, he retired the side
in order three times and sent six to the bench victims of the
strikeout. He also displayed great control, walking no one. Smoltz
lowered his ERA for the year to 2.53, despite giving up his first
homerun since June 26 to Jeromy Burnitz in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The offense provided plenty of rest for him, scoring in each
inning. Atlanta has provided a lot of run support for Smoltz this
season. In his 14 starts, the Braves have scored 72 runs, an
average of more than five a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat for a long time. Sometimes I felt like I needed a
few warm ups.'' said Smoltz, who helped his cause with a single in
the fifth. ``But I'll take it. This one was nice.''

CORE ISSUE: WHOSE APPLES TASTE BETTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind that the Mariners trail the Texas Rangers in the
American League West standings. There is a more significant issue.
</P>
<P>
   How would the Wenatchee Red Delicious fare in a head-to-head
match with Granny Smith from Texas?
</P>
<P>
   I hate to be the one to break the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Our apples aren't bad apples. But at this stage of the summer
they are T-ball rookies trying to compete against seasoned Texas
Leaguers. Thus the results from the International Apple Festival
are ordained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hold the International Apple Festival the last
weekend in July,'' explained Baxter Adams. ``We invite 24 different
countries to bring their apples to be judged against Texas
apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas never loses, possibly because they grow about the only
apples on the globe that mature the last week of July.
</P>
<P>
   A former petroleum geologist, Baxter is now skipper of the Love
Creek Ranch and apple orchards. When he retired from the oil
business, he bought some land in the Texas hill country, intending
to run a few cattle and live the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the land wouldn't even support a few cattle. This had been
a sheep and goat ranch and it had been grazed to the rock,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Then he met a horticulturist who wondered out loud whether Texas
hill country land might support dwarf apples developed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That was 15 years ago. Baxter took a gamble and there are now
350,000 apple trees within a 50-mile radius of Medina, Texas. There
are 200 residents in that community. The apple festival draws
20,000 visitors, prepared to sample ``the best apples in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Granny Smiths are 40 percent sweeter than Washington's,''
Baxter insists.
</P>
<P>
   We visited his ranch last spring. It looks more like a vineyard.
The dwarfs are tied to wire trellises and can be picked without the
aid of ladders.
</P>
<P>
   As good as his Granny Smiths may be, Baxter confided that the
best apple he has tasted is the Pink Lady from western Australia.
He is now growing Pink Ladies in Texas. But he has heard the rumors
from out of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows my mind,'' he admitted. ``With their short growing
season, I don't know how they can grow Pink Ladies in Yakima. But
they know a lot about apples.''
</P>
<P>
   They will be eating a lot of pie at Adam's Apples produce stand,
gift shop and restaurant outside Medina this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Yakima Valley residents are biding their time,
waiting for their apple crop to come in, when they'll be able to
produce desserts like apple cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime we can all enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   Alice's Blackberry Crisp
</P>
<P>
   4 cups fresh blackberries
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup oatmeal
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup firmly packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Spread blackberries in a 9-by-13-inch oven dish. Sprinkle with
lemon juice and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Combine remaining ingredients and spread over berries. Bake 30
to 35 minutes at 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or vanilla yogurt. Feeds four
to six.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene's Apple Cheesecake
</P>
<P>
   1 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cube butter
</P>
<P>
   2 large Golden Delicious apples
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar (divided)
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup currants
</P>
<P>
   18-ounce packet cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   Let the cream cheese come to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Combine in a bowl the flour and powdered sugar. With a pastry
blender cut in the butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal.
With your fingers (or those of a very close friend), press this
mixture over the bottom and sides of an 11-inch flan pan or a
9-inch regular pie pan. Halve, peel and core the Washington apples
and cut into quarter-inch slices. Arrange them in the pan,
overlapping slightly. Sprinkle with two tablespoons granulated
sugar and the currants.
</P>
<P>
   Next, plop the cream cheese into the bowl of an electric mixer.
Add three-quarters cup sugar, the lemon peel, lemon juice and the
eggs. Beat until smooth, then pour evenly over the apples.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cheesecake about 30 minutes in a 350-degree oven, or
until the cheese mixture is just set and very lightly browned
around the edges. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Serves eight.
</P>
<P>
   Texans at the Medina International Festival annually crown Miss
Apple Dumpling (ages 4 to 8) and Mrs. Apple Blossom (65 and older).
Marlene Johnson, a Washington resident who contributed this recipe,
is too old for the former award, too young for the latter. Those
Texas poker players really know how to stack the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Aha, but did you know the Washington Apple Commission annually
names a Granny Smith as its representative each year?
</P>
<P>
   After a nationwide search, the commission crowned Joan Phillips
as 1998 spokeswoman for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to second-guess the selection committee. But Mrs.
Phillips just happens to be a resident of Plano, Texas.

 &HT;    Turner an unstuffy Goodwill host
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ted Turner's little sports festival won't quite scale
Olympian heights, but he enjoys one advantage over Games more great
and glorious.
</P>
<P>
   He's way more cool than Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is not your father's patriarch. He plays the convivial
host of these Goodwill Games _ now in their fourth incarnation _
rather than overstuffed nabob who rules from untouchable heights.
</P>
<P>
   When a foreign radio correspondent thrusts a microphone in his
face and asks Turner to say a few words to the Russian people, he
takes that as a cue to frolic. A careful, official statement does
not follow.
</P>
<P>
   He seizes the mike and exclaims, ''Hey, we love you Russia, man!
How are things going over there? We love you over there. Hope you
have good luck at the Goodwill Games!''
</P>
<P>
   Big differences can be found in little phrases. ''Pretty
terrific,'' Turner blurted out on stage Saturday night during the
Goodwill opening celebration. ''Most exceptional,'' the other guy
used on Atlanta one summer night. Which one would you rather have
run your track meet?
</P>
<P>
   ''I can afford to be (more relaxed). I don't have as many people
to answer to,'' Turner says. ''Oh, I have some people to answer to
(since the Time-Warner deal), just not as many.''
</P>
<P>
   As he worked the room in a private, VIP party before the opening
celebration, Turner played official greeter, inquiring of each
person he met, ''You having a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Just like any time you throw a party, you're supposed to go
around making sure people are enjoying themselves. And there were a
lot of sponsors there,'' he said. Yes, there remains a business
aspect to his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and wife Jane Fonda began the Games out front, breathing
as much personality as they can into a project that otherwise has
lacked for one. It works, to see the Italian synchronized swimming
team ignoring the celebration on the stage while trying to get
pictures of the couple. Or the one fan in the VIP area who
persuaded Fonda to sign her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   These next two weeks are highly personal. Turner bought into the
Braves and the Hawks and, lately, the Thrashers. The Goodwill
Games, Turner invented, and he will defend them as blood kin.
</P>
<P>
   If that means perpetuating his claim that mere sport can change
the world, then so be it. ''I have an incredible sense of pride
because I know that they had a lot to do with easing up the
tensions that made the Cold War possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Goodwill Games) are at least as important to him as any
of his teams,'' said Terry McGuirk, chairman and CEO of Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc., who's been with Turner since 1972. ''He
still sees that there's a world mission to be done. And the other
side is it's an awful lot of good programming.''
</P>
<P>
   They seem to feed a need within Turner, obvious by the way he
has taken in the last two days. We cynics have tried to tell him
the Goodwill Games have outlived their original purpose of bringing
a boycott-crazy world together, and that they are but a
little-noticed money pit. He takes much glee in not listening.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know,'' Turner warns, ''we're still looking hard at the
possibility of Winter Goodwill Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's so full of pepper these days,'' said McGuirk. That's
saying much for a man known to be dangerously spicy.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was scheduled to leave for his Montana digs Sunday night,
returning to New York later in the week. Even the itinerary somehow
wound into a punchline. ''I'll watch it every evening. It gives me
a chance to see the production. I'm not hands-on that much. I put
my hands on a knife and fork three times a day. What else I put my
hands on, I can't talk about. No other women, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Before departing, he paid call on Sunday's U.S.-Puerto Rico
basketball game. 'Twas not a highly ceremonial visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss of Goodwill would chase down the guys shooting rolled
up T-shirts into the seats to fetch one for his 5-year-old
grandson, John. He would stand and dance during a musical
interlude. Midway through the first half, he leaned back to press
row and get a partial score on the Braves game back home.
</P>
<P>
   While he was there he'd shoot a couple unsolicited comments
toward his new friends in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great. Nobody thought these Games would happen. What
would the Olympics be worth if you could buy them? I tell you, this
is going to be a big franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ''You see where (IOC member) Dick Pound doesn't like us. He
said we were just a made-for-TV Olympics. Imagine that. He must
think we're competition. Isn't that what life's all about,
competition?''
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated that the first three Goodwill Games lost
$109 million. This one, too, is expected to bleed, only not as
much. Never have you seen a man more determined to get his money's
worth.
</P>

   Despite large law enforcement numbers, Rudolph still eludesBy
Jennifer Brett
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 state, local and federal agents continued the
search in the mountains of western North Carolina for Eric Robert
Rudolph Sunday, but the 31-year-old suspect in the fatal Jan. 29
bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic continued to elude his
trackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be here until the end,'' Southeast Bomb Task
Force spokeswoman Celeste Armstead said. ``We'll be here until Eric
Robert Rudolph is captured.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, cars and trucks carrying heavily armed
federal agents, search dogs and equipment rolled out of a search
command post and staging area at a mountain campground east of
Andrews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rotate people to keep them fresh,'' Armstead said. ``We're
not cutting back. We're not scaling back at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some people's assertions that they would help Rudolph or
keep his whereabouts secret if they spotted him, federal officials
say they are getting good cooperation from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead would not, however, say whether agents are any closer
to capturing Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Also, areas near the search site are swamped with reporters but
not too many thrill seekers, as there isn't much a vacationer's
camera could capture from outside the search perimeter, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are keeping outsiders far from the 30 square-mile area
where trackers, dogs, helicopters and sophisticated surveillance
equipment are hunting for Rudolph, who is also sought for
questioning about three Atlanta explosions at Centennial Olympic
Park during the 1996 Olympics, a gay nightclub and a Sandy Springs
abortion clinic.

   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ In what could be the beginning of a
significant new phase of the fighting in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian separatists said Sunday that they had taken
Orahovac, their first city, and that they would use their newly
acquired weapons to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces were counterattacking Sunday afternoon, but the
separatist forces seemed confident and kept up heavy firing against
what they said were the remaining four government positions in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the outcome of this battle, the separatists of
the Kosovo Liberation Army are once again showing that
international efforts to support ethnic Albanian political leaders
who want to end the conflict with negotiations may fail. The
politicians have little influence over the insurgents, who are
armed with artillery and surface-to-air missiles that they say are
smuggled in, and they increasingly believe that they can win
militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step taken to intensify the quality of the
war from warfare against rural areas to the stage of moving against
urban areas,'' said the ethnic Albanian commander of the attack,
who would give only his nom de guerre, Snake. He said the
insurgents' strategy was now to take over other cities and
eventually to capture the provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Tall columns of smoke twisted into the sky Sunday from Orahovac,
whose population is estimated at 20,000. Cannon fire came in
spurts. Serbian artillery rounds sent ethnic Albanian soldiers
toppling over one another for cover in houses and bunkers, but
Albanian officers said their forces were returning fire with their
own artillery.
</P>
<P>
   On hills at the edge of the city, where the houses overlook
patches of dark green and lime-colored crops, sniper bullets
whizzed and whined through short stalks of corn. Ethnic Albanian
civilians, who said their homes were being hit by Serbian shells,
were fleeing the city. They inched sideways, their backs hard
against building walls, then dodged across open spaces as they
tried to get out of the way of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Western military observers said that if the rebels have the
weapons they claim to have, they might well be able to keep control
of this city.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Kosovo is about 90 percent ethnic Albanians,
many of whom want an independent country. Serbia and Montenegro are
the only two republics remaining in Yugoslavia. Kosovo was once
semi-autonomous, but Serbia revoked that status in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, under pressure from Western governments, the Yugoslav
forces have reduced larger-scale attacks on rebel areas. Some
foreign officials have said the government forces behaved so
brutally against civilians that their actions encouraged people to
join or openly support the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, some foreign diplomats say Serbian reluctance to
order soldiers to retake territory is leading the rebels to assume
they have little to fear from government forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of calming things down and letting us figure out how
to get everyone to the negotiation table, what we've done is give
the Albanian fighters a feeling of euphoria,'' said a Western
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``This makes them
bolder, and it also makes other Albanians want to join them.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the insurgents began to grow early this year as many
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo said they had lost faith in the ability
of their political leaders to find a way to make the Serbian
government give them autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents have made surprising military advances. After six
months of fighting, they now contend that they control about 40
percent of the territory of Kosovo, although the figure is open to
dispute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an effort to shift the focus back to peaceful negotiations,
Western diplomats, led by the United States, have tried to foster
cooperation among the traditional Albanian political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But this has failed, say diplomats involved in the efforts, as
ethnic Albanian politicians quarreled over who would lead the
coalition the West is trying to create. The result, at least for
now, they say, is that the rebels have become even more attractive
to the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the team of ethnic Albanian political leaders who
are supposed to be discussing strategy for negotiations with the
Serbian government said team members bickered so much that they
could seldom agree on anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out, and there is no consensus.'' said the
politician, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said that
without negotiations, the rebels were ``the only way to gain
independence,'' adding, ``The politicians have lost contact with
the people and don't see how desperate they are for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The member of the negotiating team, along with many other ethnic
Albanians, said most of their political leaders look to Western
governments for support instead of listening to average people in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These so-called leaders think they can govern Kosovo by having
their picture taken with Bill Clinton,'' the politician said.
``Maybe that used to work, but it doesn't now. Now you have to go
the people. You have to see how they yearn for their own country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Malisevo, the first town up the twisting road from Orahovac,
many of the people were in rebel uniform Sunday. An American
105-millimeter recoilless rifle, bolted to the bed of a pickup
truck, was on its way to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the high walls that surround the clusters of homes where
extended families live in the traditional ethnic Albanian way,
people were receiving refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers sat on the red-and-black carpets with intricate
diamond and square patterns that spread across the floor of their
compound's communal room. They asked to remain anonymous because
another brother is a soldier in the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   His picture was on the wall. There were also fuzzy
black-and-white photographs and fading drawings of Albanian
national heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have President Rugova's picture,'' said the elder
brother, referring to Ibrahim Rugova, the political leader of
Kosovo Albanians and the man American diplomats say they hope can
lead negotiations to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother added: ``Rugova should have been here at
least once to see us. We have waited for him, and for the
democratic countries, but no one came. Now we are tired of
waiting.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advertising is often described as holding a mirror to
society. Now more than ever, the mirror is reflecting back images
of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising about advertising, once a marketing mainstay, is
again a popular trend along Madison Avenue. Consumers are being
bombarded by sophisticated television and radio commercials, print
ads, billboards and World Wide Web sites that are self-reflexively
devoted to advertising. These are ads that announce they're ads,
parody other ads, describe how agencies create ads, debate how
consumers react to ads _ and even caution against believing
advertising hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, cheeky commercials for the Sprite soft drink
marketed by Coca-Cola Co. assert: ``Image is nothing. Thirst is
everything. Obey your thirst.'' The ads mock ads for products,
including soft drinks _ as well as Coca-Cola's own decision to sign
the basketball star Grant Hill to endorse Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is: `Don't trust the endorser. Just drink what tastes
good,''' said C.J. Waldman, an art director at the Sprite agency,
Lowe &AMP; Partners-SMS in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of
Interpublic Group of companies. ``The message is more believable
when you take out the baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising about advertising is making a comeback for several
reasons, ranging from an emphasis on ads that entertain to a need
to appeal to younger consumers. Marketers hope that
self-deprecation will soften the hardness of sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``By saying you're not taking advertising seriously, it says by
extension that you're not taking yourself seriously either,'' said
Tom Kraemer, a copywriter at Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York, a
unit of Interpublic that has created ads about ads for the Burger
King fast-food chain owned by Diageo PLC.
</P>
<P>
   A recent commercial for the Burger King Chicken Crisp sandwich,
for example, spoofed the familiar series of spots for De Beers in
which shadowy couples celebrate diamond gifts. The tongue-in-cheek
spot, Kraemer said, treated the new menu item ``as if it were
comparable to a $5,000 diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ads about ads may seem novel, they're not new.
</P>
<P>
   Back in radio days, comedians like Jack Benny and Fred Allen
delivered commercials that were devoted to their reluctance to
deliver commercials. The trailer for the 1947 film ``Miracle on
34th Street'' was about the making of the trailer for ``Miracle on
34th Street.'' And in the 1950s and 1960s, such performers as
Arthur Godfrey, Ernie Kovacs, George Burns, Stan Freberg and Henry
Morgan frequently broke the fourth wall to offer wry sendups of
sponsors and ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the mirth, the goal is the same as for any
huckster's spiel: to promote a product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to try to create a bond between the advertiser and
the audience that declares `We're all in this together,' '' said
Larry Adelman, a critic of consumer culture who is co-director of
California Newsreel, a documentary center in San Francisco. ``But
we keep buying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hip, ironic way to co-opt a growing public backlash
against advertising's ubiquity,'' he added, ``and undercut any
impulse to think critically about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers may discover that ads about ads do not sneak under
the radar but rather remind consumers how inundated they are by
advertising _ and how much they dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising industry will suffer,'' warned Kalle Lasn,
editor of Adbusters, a publication of the Media Foundation in
Vancouver, British Columbia, that attacks consumerism, ``because
once you start to denigrate advertising, you keep cynicism
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like biting your own tail,'' he added. ``Eventually, you
bite off the tail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence in ads about ads may be traced to 1989, when
Energizer started running commercials in which a pink
battery-powered bunny kept ``going and going and going'' through
make-believe spots for products like coffee, nasal spray and soap.
There were 47 commercials through 1993 and then a brief reprise in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Current examples include a Levi's jeans campaign with a
self-aware attitude about fashion advertising, which proclaims
``Our models can beat up their models''; a Web site for Simple
Shoes Inc. offering an archive of ads carrying such headlines as
``I went through five years of art school and all you get is this
dumb ad''; ads for Miller Lite beer presented as the handiwork of
``Dick,'' an imaginary agency ``creative superstar''; ads for
Diesel apparel that lampoon marketing tactics like linking products
to social causes, and a campaign for Captain Morgan rum in which
the Seagram brand's pirate character parodies various ads and asks
on the Internet ``Is it me, or is this site trying to promote some
product?''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Shapiro, executive vice president for marketing at the
Seagram Americas unit of the Seagram Co. in New York, said: ``We
never set out to use advertising to sell, but the feedback we've
gotten from consumers is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-liked ads of all time were self-referential,
from the Bert and Harry Piel campaign for Piels beer, which
featured the voices of Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding, to the ``spicy
meatball'' spot for Alka-Seltzer, which showed an actor developing
heartburn during the shooting of a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, however, the approach faded as agencies played down
showy creative techniques in favor of playing up the features and
benefits of products.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's back, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that advertisers are taking their cues from a flood of
self-referential material in the popular culture: TV series about
TV series like ``Home Improvement'' and ``The Larry Sanders Show'';
movies about movies like ``The Player'' and ``Living in Oblivion,''
and journalists scrutinizing the performance of other journalists
in Brill's Content magazine (with other journalists then
scrutinizing the performance of Brill's Content). There was even a
novel, ``The Bestseller,'' about writing a best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
   Since imitation is often the sincerest form of advertising,
Madison Avenue has been inspired to turn its gaze inward and devote
a growing part of its output to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising has become institutionalized as a cultural
reference point,'' said Bill Westbrook, president of Fallon
McElligott in Minneapolis, the Miller Lite agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good or bad, advertising is pervasive,'' he added. ``If I do a
takeoff on an ad campaign, I have some degree of confidence a
significant number of people will know what I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Freeman, chairman and chief creative officer at the Cliff
Freeman &AMP; Partners unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC in New York,
labeled advertising ``the great unifier'' in a consumer culture
fragmented into niche markets and segmented media choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're with a bunch of strangers with nothing to say,''
said Freeman, who often produced humorous ads about ads for the
Little Caesars pizza chain, ``all you have to do is bring up
commercials and everyone has an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true for a special demographic group, 20-
and 30-somethings. Advertisers' ardor to appeal to those
free-spending but finicky consumers is a big reason why ads about
ads have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a target audience that is media savvy and cynical,'' said
Bob Kuperman, president and chief executive for the Americas at the
TBWA Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom Group, which created the Energizer
campaign for Ralston-Purina Co. ``You go to focus groups and they
talk in marketing terms; they say, `Before I discuss this, can I
see the creative brief?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know advertising,'' he added, and they ``distrust so much
of it, so you try to break down the barrier and get the
salesmanship out of it. The less you're selling obviously to this
group, the better off you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rooney, vice president for marketing at the Miller
Brewing Company unit of Philip Morris Cos. in Milwaukee, which
sells Miller Lite, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average 25-year-old has a thicker skin for traditional
marketing devices than the average 40-year-old,'' he said. ``So you
have to be a little more clever.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Lite campaign, Rooney said, ``people realize you're
having fun at your own expense, that you're showing some humility.
To a large extent, that has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney also raised another reason for the popularity of ads
about ads: a shift to entertaining ads that seek to develop
pleasing personalities for brands from ads that recite product
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the beer business talk less about the quality
characteristics of the product like `cold filtered,' `beechwood
aged' or `Tastes great. Less filling,' '' he said, ``because
consumers assume that.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``there needs to be something else about your brand that gets
people motivated,'' he added. ``The personality of the brand is
driving it more so than ever. If you're not as tied to making sure
you talk about the hops, that opens the door for a wider range of
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy has been extended beyond Lite's ads to Lite's
packaging. The brand now ``pokes fun at itself,'' Rooney said, with
such language as this from the sides of cans: ``This beer has your
name on it. Wait. It has our name on it. Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the appeal of ads about ads, pitfalls lurk.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that the trend may represent little more
than self-indulgent navel gazing, predicated on a misimpression
that consumers are fascinated by something about which they are
actually indifferent, or worse yet, antagonistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run the risk of no one understanding it except people in
the advertising industry,'' said Kuperman of TBWA Chiat/Day, who
decried ``the self-absorption of advertising about advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that problem, he added, the Energizer bunny campaign
parodied easily recognized genres (soft drink ads, celebrity
endorsements, late-night record offers) rather than specific spots.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dick character now plays only a minor role in the Lite
campaign. ``You don't want to do it for too long,'' Rooney said of
ads about ads, because otherwise ``you become a parody of
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a cheerleader contest Miller sponsored last fall was
promoted so self-reflexively that distributors complained customers
perceived it as a spoof of contests and refrained from entering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If advertising about advertising becomes too popular,''
Freeman of the Freeman agency said, ``it would no longer be
surprising. It would just become boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing a consumer can say is `I've seen that,' '' he
added. ``And advertising is so derivative; as soon as somebody hits
on something, everyone follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there have recently been instances when ads about ads
came out at the same time as other ads about the same ads. The De
Beers spoof for Burger King was running simultaneously with a spot
by a Miami agency, Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky, for another fast food
chain, Checkers, that also spoofed the diamond commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate, a really bizarre coincidence,'' said
Kraemer at Ammirati Puris, as well as ``a creative's worst
nightmare, because the idea of doing what we do is to come up with
something fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is the possibility that ads about ads _ by attempting
to parry critics who try to subvert advertising through advertising
_ will only spur them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making it harder for those like us to get back at
them,'' Lasn said, adding that when he saw a recent Diesel
campaign, which mocked ads for Benetton apparel, ``I thought, `They
finally snookered us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Lasn and other advocates of less commercialism may have
discovered a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're finding it increasingly hard to `outcool' them
because of this trend,'' he said, ``we're moving more into straight
information ads instead of parodies.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a recent foray against Philip Morris for selling
cigarettes avoided ad spoofs assaulting the Marlboro cowboy or the
Virginia Slims woman. Rather, an ad in Adbusters ``simply asked
people why they're buying food from a tobacco company,'' Lasn said,
referring to brands like Kraft and Minute Rice that are sold by
Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it worked,'' he added. ``People talked about it. I did a
lot of radio talk shows.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be something advertisers want to reflect on the next
time they see themselves in that mirror.

HOW ONE COMPANY IS TRANSFORMING LIVE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS and JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the past year and a half, the rock and pop
concert business has quietly gone through the biggest
transformation in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The business, the last stronghold of independence in a rapidly
consolidating entertainment industry, has long been a world of
self-made and often ruthless local moguls, many of whom have held
sway as music promoters since the days of Jimi Hendrix and Janis
Joplin. But with the sudden arrival of a deep-pocketed, publicly
traded company called SFX Entertainment, the business in the United
States has begun to go the way of the movie, television and
recording industries, and is fast becoming consolidated under the
aegis of a sprawling corporate conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Robert F.X. Sillerman, a New York-based
entrepreneur who controls SFX and made a fortune buying and selling
radio stations, began a $1 billion binge of acquisitions. He
snapped up a dozen of the country's largest regional music
promoters, giving him control of more than half the national
market, including concerts by acts ranging from the Eagles to the
Spice Girls. He further consolidated his power by buying
amphitheaters, tour-promotion rights, ticketing companies and
artist-management agencies. Though other companies, like Universal
Concerts, have taken steps toward centralizing and consolidating
the concert business, none have operated on this scale.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, SFX officials have said, is to revolutionize an
inefficient and fragmented business, making it significantly more
profitable. But many in the $1 billion-a-year industry feel
threatened by this outsider and doubt its long-term intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this big gorilla in the living room, and everyone's
wondering whether it's a friendly one or a dangerous one,'' said
Alex Kochan, president of Artists and Audience, a concert-booking
agency not owned by SFX.
</P>
<P>
   For concertgoers, the emergence of this corporate giant is
likely to affect where, when and under what circumstances concerts
around the country are presented. For example, SFX wants to shift
even more concerts into the summer and use a battery of
revenue-enhancement schemes. These include a greatly expanded role
for corporate advertisers at concerts and increasing tiered ticket
pricing, which means choice seats would cost more while less
desirable seats could cost less. (The average price of tickets is
estimated at $35 to $45.)
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has responded positively, counting on SFX to bring
efficiencies to the business. But critics, from competitors to
heads of companies bought by SFX, wonder whether the discipline of
Wall Street can be brought to an industry where a musician's
health, a wet summer, a fickle audience or a band's sudden creative
slump can wipe out a season. They question whether the focus on
quarterly earnings rather than artistic development will stifle
lesser-known bands.
</P>
<P>
   And they fear that the old ways of working _ in which a band
hires a booking agent to arrange shows either with in-house
promoters or with independent promoters who in turn deal with
concert halls in their regions _ will be eliminated, and that SFX's
unprecedented national reach will give it extraordinary leverage in
an already hard-edged business. This summer, concerns like these
have sparked a kind of civil war in the concert business.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the company is enormous. SFX controls concert halls
in 22 of the nation's top 50 markets, and has said it planned to
operate stages in all 50. Among those it controls in the New York
City area are the Jones Beach Marine Amphitheater on Long Island,
the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., and the Roseland
Ballroom and Irving Plaza in New York City. Sillerman said more
acquisitions would be announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   And music is only a part of its reach. This year, SFX spent
hundreds of millions of dollars buying one of the country's top
sports agencies, Falk Associates Management Enterprises (FAME),
which represents Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, and another
company, Pace Entertainment Corp., the top producer of touring
theatrical shows and a presenter of auto races and music. Last
year, according to SFX, 27 million people attended 9,600 events
arranged by the companies it has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is lightning in a bottle,'' Sillerman, 50, said in a
interview. He added, ``It's clear that because of what we're doing,
the playing field is not what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman has amassed $606 million in debt, a massive sum for
this business, and has yet to turn a net profit. He has also paid
large sums for his acquisitions. For instance, FAME, which had
roughly $11 million in revenues last year, cost $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company would soon reverse its losses and that
the bulk of future profits would not come from tickets but from
advertisers. As in radio and television commercials, SFX intends to
sell major advertisers access to neatly segmented, demographically
desirable concert audiences. The company has said there would be
far more corporate sponsorships of tours, the potential
introduction of luxury boxes at amphitheaters and a barrage of
advertising at events.
</P>
<P>
   This has already happened to some degree, even in non-SFX tours;
Sprint, for example, sponsored last year's Rolling Stones tour and
Citibank sponsored a recent Elton John tour. But SFX says it
intends to accelerate the trend, despite the fact that many rock
acts and audiences have prided themselves on antiestablishment
views.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent enthusiastic report on SFX, Goldman Sachs &AMP; Company
analysts stated: ``It is virtually impossible for an artist to tour
the United States without playing in an SFX venue. SFX has, in
essence, become the gatekeeper for outdoor music concerts.'' The
report estimated that SFX's revenues from sponsorship and
advertising alone would increase 50 percent, to $60 million next
year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investors have supported SFX even though a number of its
tours this summer have suffered from lackluster ticket sales. SFX
and its newly acquired businesses had revenues of $828 million in
the fiscal year that ended on March 31. After having to make $52.4
million in interest payments on its debt, SFX reported a net loss
of $30 million. Nevertheless, SFX stock, which traded in the mid
20s in early May, has soared since and closed last week at $55.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts said it was unclear whether companies would
meet SFX's expectations by pouring more into advertising at live
events, even though it would be easier to do under a centralized
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are attempting to do in this agglomeration of assets
is to have one-stop shopping,'' said Jay Coleman, founder and chief
executive of the Entertainment Marketing Company International, a
leader in bringing corporate sponsors to entertainment events. ``On
the surface, that makes sense. In practice, it's not an easy task.
First of all, there are a very limited number of advertisers who
will do music. And only a tiny handful of tours are of interest to
corporate advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting marketing idea,'' he added, ``but very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman said his acquisition of FAME could help him with this
problem. David Falk, founder and chairman of FAME, said companies
that wanted to sponsor his athletes could be urged to sponsor
concerts as well. ``This gives us more cachet and more muscle in
the market,'' he said. But he added: ``You have to be judicious
about how you use the muscle. You don't want to be heavy-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the concert business has long been seen as heavy-handed.
Traditionally, promoter tactics like screaming violent threats at
concert-hall owners and calling the fire department on rival clubs
were common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of astounded at the old-line acerbic nature of some
of the relationships,'' Sillerman said. ``It did keep us away from
the business for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Since SFX has grown, a number of rivals have privately accused
its promoters of strong-arming shows away from them. SFX promoters
have denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   One recent controversy involved the country singer Shania Twain.
Four people at different companies working on her tour, all of whom
spoke on condition of anonymity because of other business
relationships with SFX, said the following events unfolded:
Delsener/Slater Enterprises, an SFX-owned Manhattan promoter, tried
to coax Ms. Twain's management company to place her concert in an
amphitheater that SFX owns, the Meadows Music Theater in Hartford,
rather than a competing location, the Pepsi Arena in Albany. When
that bid failed and the Pepsi Arena booked the show for Aug. 17,
Delsener/Slater asked for a share in concert revenue as a
co-promoter. In the process, the account went, Delsener/Slater
threatened to divert all SFX-owned tours from the Albany arena if
it could not promote the concert. The loss of a concert or two can
mean a major dent in profits in a business in which most income is
derived from just a few popular bands.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, SFX was not given a piece of the show, and does not
appear to have carried through on the reported threats. Several
people who were involved in the negotiations said Ms. Twain's
manager, Jon Landau, who also manages Bruce Springsteen, stood by
them, which gave them more power to resist the pressure. Landau
refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Delsener/Slater denied using such threats, but
declined to be quoted further about the incident. Sillerman said he
was unaware of the accusations involving the Twain concert. ``It
wouldn't surprise me if that kind of stuff still goes on,''
Sillerman continued. ``But that's not my approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the size and power of the company has left industry
competitors wary. Two said they had been interviewed informally by
a Justice Department lawyer about SFX's effect on the industry. It
is not known what prompted these interviews and the department
would not comment on whether there was any inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman scoffed at the suggestion that the company had
violated any antitrust law and said he had heard nothing about
government activity.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics aren't sure SFX will be able to win over artists
and managers, who typically make deals with promoters only on a
per-show or, in a few cases, on a per-tour basis. With competition
between promoters, bands negotiate 75 to 90 percent of a concert's
profits for themselves, leaving the rest for the promoter. The more
hegemony SFX has, the more it can adjust this percentage in its
favor, cutting into band earnings. But bands may also benefit from
increased corporate advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists and their managers and agents are suspicious of any
one company having too much control,'' said John Scher, president
of Metropolitan Entertainment Group, a New York promoter and
Delsener/Slater's chief competitor. ``It seems like their whole
business model depends on everyone being willing to work for SFX,
and it's not clear they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists and their managers are beginning to be aware of SFX.
``Am I part of that?'' said the heavy-metal singer Ozzy Osbourne,
when asked about the company, which is involved in many of the
stops on this summer's Ozzfest tour. ``What's happening now is all
these big IBM-type companies are moving in and their people come
along to the door and tell you what you can and can't do. Forget
it. If that's the way it is, I'll do it on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SFX's critics have been at war with the company this
summer. Several major tours, including Celine Dion, Mariah Carey,
Eric Clapton and Van Halen, are being booked into mostly indoor
arenas not affiliated with SFX. It is no coincidence, several
people said, that all these acts are represented by Creative
Artists Agency, a giant talent agency whose music head, Tom Ross,
has been one of SFX's most fervent opponents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most tours that SFX has bought into have not been faring
well. The SFX acts of Michael Crawford, and the double bills of
Chicago and Hall &AMP; Oates, and Wynonna and Michael Bolton have
played to halls a quarter sold or less on some occasions, while the
Pretenders, the Horde tour and Stevie Nicks and Boz Scaggs, have
not fared much better. Other tours that SFX has a stake in have
been huge successes, including George Strait's country music
festival and the Spice Girls, despite the departure of Geri
Halliwell from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman said that while some concerts might not be as
profitable as hoped, overall ticket sales were strong, and new
advertising revenues were starting to come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early indications are we have underestimated'' profits,
Sillerman said. ``In the third quarter, we'll be able to announce
not a belief, but tangible proof that this works.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew little about the concert industry when he
acquired his first promoter, Delsener/Slater. But once he surveyed
the business, he said, he became convinced that it was fragmented
and ripe for consolidation, like the radio industry a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Sillerman made a financial killing when he sold SFX
Broadcasting, which he had formed from a group of small radio
stations across the country. The buyer was an investment company,
Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, and the price $2.1 billion. Some
analysts have predicted that with SFX Entertainment, Sillerman is,
once again, just building a business that he will turn around and
sell in a few years for a big profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do leopards change their spots? No,'' said Harry J. De Mott
3rd, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston who has followed
Sillerman's companies. ``It's a time in the economic cycle when
people are feeling good and they're willing to spend more money on
live entertainment. Bob is taking advantage of that, and I expect
that when he produces something of great value he could well sell
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman, who owns 15 percent of SFX, dismissed that notion.
</P>
<P>
   However long Sillerman remains in the concert business, his
arrival has shaken up the industry in a way it will probably never
recover from. While many are scared, others are surprised it took
so long. Some compare this moment in the evolution of the concert
business to the history of the record business, in which many small
labels have been bought and consolidated by multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the entertainment business as a whole,'' said
Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar, a concert-industry trade
magazine, ``the concert business was the last element that was
still run by these independent entrepreneurs. So maybe it was
inevitable.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ulysses,'' that sprawling, difficult, but uniquely
original masterpiece by James Joyce, has been voted the finest
English-language novel published this century by a jury of scholars
and writers.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ in which an immensely long account of a single day in
the lives of a group of Dubliners becomes a metaphor for the human
condition and the author experiments with language almost to the
point of unintelligibility _ heads the list of 100 novels drawn up
by the editorial board of Modern Library, which has been publishing
classic English literature at affordable prices since 1917 and is
now a division of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   The list is to be released on Friday at a workshop for young
publishers known as the Radcliffe Publishing Course at Radcliffe
College of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The board members are Christopher Cerf, Gore Vidal, Daniel J.
Boorstin, Shelby Foote, Vartan Gregorian, A.S. Byatt, Edmund
Morris, John Richardson, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and William
Styron. ``Ulysses'' was banned in the United States as obscene from
1920 to 1933, when the ban was lifted by U.S. District Judge John
M. Woolsey, who called the book ``a sincere and serious attempt to
devise a new literary method for the observation and description of
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulysses'' is followed in descending order by ``The Great
Gatsby,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald's magical tale of romance, mystery
and violence among rich Long Island socialites in the 1920s;
another work by Joyce, ``A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,''
his autobiographical account of a young man's intellectual
awakening''; ``Lolita,'' Vladimir Nabokov's tale of the aging
Humbert Humbert's doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze, and
``Brave New World,'' Aldous Huxley's satirical horror tale of a
civilization where humans are literally made to order.
</P>
<P>
   These five novels originally tied for first place, with each
winning the support of nine of the editorial board's 10 members. In
a second separate vote, the panel then placed them in their final
order.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Random House said they hoped that as the century
drew to a close their list would encourage public debate about the
greatest works of fiction of the last hundred years, thus both
increasing awareness of the Modern Library and stimulating sales of
the novels the group publishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to bring the Modern Library to public attention,''
Random House's president and editor in chief, Ann Godoff, said in
an interview. ``We want to grow the Modern Library and its stable
of classics''
</P>
<P>
   Random House was recently bought by the German Bertelsmann
group, already the owners of the American publishing house of
Bantam Doubleday Bell and now the largest commercial book publisher
in the world. Executives say the Bertelsmann group currently
publishes 59 of the 100 novels on the Modern Library list. And of
the Modern Library board members, all but Gregorian are published
by Random House or the Bertelsmann group.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Library plans to reissue at least 10 novels on the list
in paperback over the next eight months. These will include Samuel
Butler's autobiographical attack on Victorian morality, ``The Way
of All Flesh'' (No. 12); Joseph Conrad's tale of intrigue ``The
Secret Agent'' (No. 46); ``Zuleika Dobson,'' Max Beerbohm's comic
tale of a femme fatale at Oxford University (No. 59); ``The Call of
the Wild'' by Jack London (No. 88), and ``The Magnificent
Ambersons'' by Booth Tarkington (No. 100).
</P>
<P>
   Random House, which in 1934 published the first legal American
edition of ``Ulysses,'' will place promotional material in
bookstores that are offering novels from the Modern Library's list.
And the company is inviting readers to send in online suggestions
for an alternative list of great English-language fiction of this
century to www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, Random House also plans to expand the
size of the Modern Library's editorial board. It will then invite
the expanded board to make a list of the 100 best nonfiction books
published in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that has never been done before,'' Ms.
Godoff noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library's best-novels list includes 58 books by an
eclectic collection of American writers: William Faulkner's ``Sound
and the Fury'' (No. 6); Ernest Hemingway's ``Sun Also Rises'' (No.
45); the ``U.S.A.'' trilogy by John Dos Passos (No. 23) as well as
three works by Henry James _ ``The Wings of the Dove (No. 26),''
``The Ambassadors'' (No. 27) and ``The Golden Bowl'' (No. 32) _
although James lived much of his life in England and eventually
became a British citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But it also includes Joseph Heller's ``Catch-22''(No. 7), Henry
Miller's ``Tropic of Cancer''(No. 50) and Jack Kerouac's ``On the
Road''(No. 55), as well as Dashiell Hammett's ``Maltese Falcon''
(No. 56) and James M. Cain's ``Postman Always Rings Twice'' (No.
98).
</P>
<P>
   The 39 works by British writers include D.H. Lawrence's ``Sons
and Lovers'' (No. 9), ``The Rainbow'' (No. 48) and ``Women in
Love'' (No. 49); E.M. Forster's ``Passage to India''(No. 25) and
``Howards End'' (No. 38); George Orwell's ``1984'' (No. 13) and
``Animal Farm'' (No. 31) as well as novels by Evelyn Waugh, Graham
Greene and Anthony Powell. In addition to his two works in the top
five, Joyce's third well-known book, ``Finnegans Wake,'' also makes
the list, in 77th place.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from Joyce, the list contains no other works by
English-speaking writers from outside the United States and
Britain, although India, Australia and South Africa all have
flourishing literary traditions and have produced many
distinguished authors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only eight women make the list. They are led by
Virginia Woolf, whose ``To the Lighthouse'' is in 15th place,
followed in 17th by Carson McCullers' ``Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.''
Other women represented are Edith Wharton (twice), Willa Cather,
Muriel Spark, Elizabeth Bowen, Jean Rhys and Iris Murdoch.

</P>
<P>
   Several board members criticized the absence of writers from the
rest of the English-speaking world as well as the small number of
female authors selected.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the final list ``typically American,'' Ms. Byatt
regretted that the Australian Nobel Prize-winning novelist, Patrick
White, had not been chosen, and said there was ``definitely room
for more women.'' Like American author William Styron, she
regretted the absence of South African writer Doris Lessing and
American novelist Mary McCarthy. Styron said that he was surprised,
too, by the omission of Patrick White and that he wished the list
had included American writer Eudora Welty.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregorian, who heads Carnegie Corp., said he and several
other judges had felt they should choose only books that had been
in print a long time, thus showing that they ``have really stood
the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   All the judges who could be reached for comment said they
believed ``Ulysses'' deserved first place and considered ``The
Great Gatsby'' a worthy second. Ms. Byatt called ``Ulysses'' ``the
first truly modern novel, a real break with the past, like
Picasso.'' Styron said it was ``the watershed novel of the 20th
century from which all modernism flows.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore Vidal, the American novelist, called the top five ``about
right.'' But several of his colleagues on the board were unhappy
with the novels in third, fourth and fifth places.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Morris, an American historian, said he was ``pleased''
that ``Ulysses'' and ``Lolita'' had made the top five. But he
argued that ``A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' did not
deserve so high a slot because it is really ``a sketch for
`Ulysses.''' He also dismissed ``Brave New World'' as ``not
Huxley's greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Foote, also a historian, said that he accepted
``Ulysses'' and ``The Great Gatsby'' but that he had ``trouble with
the others'' in the top five slots. In his view, Lawrence's
``Rainbow'' and Faulkner's ``As I lay Dying'' would have been
better choices.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called the first three
choices ``sensible'' but said he would have preferred to see Henry
James' ``Wings of the Dove'' and E.M. Foster's ``Passage to India''
in fourth and fifth places. He also thought Evelyn Waugh's World
War II trilogy, ``Sword of Honor,'' would have been a better choice
than ``Brideshead Revisited'' (No. 80).
</P>
<P>
   Other editorial board members who participated in the voting but
could not be reached were Cerf, son of Bennett Cerf, who bought the
Modern Library and founded Random House, and Boorstin, a former
librarian of the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Harold M. Evans, currently editorial
director of U.S. News and World Report, said he had come up with
the plan to compile a list of the best 100 novels for the
millennium when he was president of Random House. But it was not
completed until after he had handed over the top job to Ms. Godoff
last November.

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Naumann, the mercurial and blunt-spoken chief
executive of Henry Holt &AMP; Co., will leave the literary publishing
house, which he has headed for two years, to pursue a chance to
become Germany's minister of culture for the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In his typical maverick fashion, Naumann, 56, revealed his plans
early on Friday afternoon, at a time when most publishers had
retreated for long summer weekends. Not even John Sargent _ who
manages the service companies for Verlagsgruppe Georg von
Holtzbrinck, the German conglomerate that owns Henry Holt _ knew
until he was told by a reporter that Naumann had made the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has long been driven very much by the politics and culture
of Germany,'' said Sargent, who is also chief executive of St.
Martin's Press, another Holtzbrinck company. ``Knowing Michael's
commitment, I think it's great for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Naumann raised the profile of Henry Holt with generous advances
for prominent authors like Salman Rushdie and with a blend of charm
and candor that sometimes rattled the publishing industry. He
boycotted the National Book Awards when the judges failed to
nominate a Holt book, ``Mason &AMP; Dixon'' by Thomas Pynchon, and he
canceled a contract with the best-selling author Gloria Naylor for
a manuscript he considered unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Holt, which does business of $45 million a year, is losing
money, according to Sargent. And there had been speculation that
Naumann would leave.
</P>
<P>
   But Naumann said that he had not been pressured to depart. ``I
had no intention of leaving,'' he said. ``I can honestly tell
you,'' he added, ``that the company is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sargent said that in the last four months, revenue and profits
had started to increase. Two titles have been on the New York Times
best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann, a German citizen who formerly headed Rowohlt Verlag,
which is owned by Holtzbrinck and is one of the largest publishing
companies in Germany, said he was approached last week by a member
of a search committee formed by the German Social Democrats to seek
someone to fill the new position of minister of culture if they win
in national elections in September. The party has a strong chance
of beating Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats are led by Gerhard Schroder, the governor
of Lower Saxony. Naumann said he had received a telephone call on
Thursday from Schroder, inviting him to become minister of culture
if the party won.
</P>
<P>
   Although he still had three years remaining on a five-year
contract with Henry Holt, Naumann said, he decided to leave to
pursue the cabinet opportunity to demonstrate his commitment to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a country which was savaged by its own history,''
Naumann said. ``And I belong to that generation born during the war
that had numerous questions and tried to redefine the course of our
country. So it sounds rather pathetic, but it's really true _ I've
started to really enjoy the democratic institutions in my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Naumann said he would remain at Henry Holt until a successor is
found, adding that if the Social Democrats do not gain power, he
would be likely to look for another publishing position. A few
months ago, one of Holtzbrinck's German newspapers approached
Naumann to become its publisher, but he rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in an article in Vanity Fair about
Holtzbrinck, Thomas McCormack, the former chief executive of St.
Martin's Press, was reported as suggesting that Naumann would
probably leave the company.

   ``It certainly fits into what I predicted,'' McCormack said on
Friday. ``I do know that he was very much on the skids here, and it
would have been a good face-saving pretext if an offer like this
heaved up, as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said that Naumann was ``very much over his head at
Henry Holt, but his head was such that he would take advice from
almost no one at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sargent, however, said that Naumann was striving to improve
Henry Holt and that progress was being made. ``It is a difficult
task to turn around a company like Holt from where it was to a
profitable level,'' he said.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Chicago Cubs
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight and Tuesday at 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV: Fox Sports South will broadcast both games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Denny Neagle (10-7,
3.17; 6-4, 3.98 lifetime vs. Cubs) vs. RHP Kevin Tapani (10-6,
4.84; 2-2, 4.67 lifetime vs. Braves). Tuesday, RHP Greg Maddux
(13-3, 1.57; 7-0, 1.51 vs. Cubs) vs. RHP Kerry Woods (8-5, 3.46;
0-0, 3.46 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 200-194 and
has not lost a season series to the Cubs since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves are 3-4 against the Cubs after being
swept in a three-game series at Wrigley Field May 29-31, Chicago
beating John Rocker, Kevin Millwood and Denny Neagle. The Braves
took three of four from the Cubs May 22-25, outscoring them 25-18.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs leaders: Avg.: Mark Grace (.325); HR _ Sammy Sosa (36); RBI
_ Sosa (89); SB _ Sosa (13). W _ Kevin Tapani (10); ERA _ Terry
Mulholland (3.10). Strikeouts _ Kerry Wood (156). Saves _ Rod Beck
(25).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Cubs, who lost five of their first nine out of the
All-Star break, are concluding a 12-game road trip, the club's
longest of the season. . . . With five regulars hitting .300 or
better and the 59 home runs between Sammy Sosa and Henry Rodriguez,
the Cubs get consistent run support, the 5.03 per-game average
ranking fourth in the league. But the club also leaves an average
7.1 men on base each game, fourth most in the league. . . . The
Cubs need all the run support they can find because their starters'
ERA is a ripe 4.43. Braves starters, by comparison, is 2.99. . .
Sosa ranks in the NL top 10 in eight offensive categories. He has
homered twice against Atlanta but both came within three at-bats
May 25 off Mike Cather and Kevin Millwood at Turner Field. . . .
Between Sosa (118 hits) and Mark Grace (117), Chicago has two
players chasing 200-hit seasons. The last Cub to reach 200 was Ryne
Sandberg in 1984. . . . Tapani is facing the Braves for the third
time this year, losing at Atlanta 9-5 in May 25 and defeating the
Braves 4-2 at Wrigley. He is unbeaten in his last four starts and
is coming off a 7-4 win in Pittsburgh last Tuesday. Despite his
record, he has given up 17 earned runs in his last three starts and
his ERA (4.84) is at its highest point in almost 13 weeks. . . . On
the DL: OF Brant Brown (separated left shoulder) and LHP Pedro
Valdes (strained left foot).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Entering Sunday night, Grace was hitting .341 with 43
RBI in his last 73 games. Tyler Houston is hitting .424 in his last
11 games. Since joining the Cubs July 6, Glenallen Hill is 7-for-20
with four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Jeff Blauser went into Sunday night's game with eight
hits in his last 42 at-bats (.190). Since being called up from
Class AAA Iowa June 26, Kevin Orie is hitting .189 (7-for-37).

 &HT;    Watts won't quickly be forgotten after inspired British
performance
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ The more pleasant news for Brian Watts:
With $329,000 earned for second place Sunday in the British Open,
that's enough money to gain fully exempt status on the PGA Tour
next year. Maybe with such an opportunity, he'll pull away from his
home base, the Japan Tour, where he has starred for six years and
and piled up enough yen to retire at 32.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe Watts will just tour the world, doing clinics
on bunker play under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless what transpired in the four-hole playoff at Royal
Birkdale, where Mark O'Meara prevailed to win his second major of
the year and his career, Watts' bunker shot at the 18th hole, the
72nd of the tournament, will be remembered as one of golf's
greatest pressure shots ever. With one foot out of the bunker and
peering down at a downhill lie, Watts would have impressed
observing Birkdale members and a worldwide television audience if
the ball had stopped six or eight feet from the hole. Instead,
Watts chopped down on the ball and stiffed it to tap-in range,
parring the hole, matching O'Meara at even-par 280 and heading to
the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to create something in my mind and I visualized a
good shot, and fortunately it came off almost perfect,'' Watts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Was the visualization detailed enough to included a ball
smacking into the flagstick and disappearing, giving Watts the
Claret Jug?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only that would have prevented what transpired over the next
hour. O'Meara's key shot of the final round evolved as the 4-iron
to three feet at the par-3 14th, creating his first lead. In the
playoff, O'Meara got his edge on the first extra hole, the par-5
15th, making birdie from five feet. Watts lipped out from four
feet, then self-destructed the chance for a recovery birdie at the
17th. He drove right into the hay, popped out with a wedge and was
lucky to make par.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I didn't hit the fairway on 17, that was pretty much a
one-stroke penalty,'' Watts said. ``I was able to advance it about
30 yards to where Mark's drive was and mine should have been. But
after I made par on 17, I still felt I had chance because I was
only a stroke back.''
</P>
<P>
   At 18, with the multitudes climmbing through the seaside
underbrush, Watts found a shallower greenside bunker and this time
blasted long. O'Meara, with a well-struck 4-iron to the green, won
with two putts. After running his first putt three feet by, causing
a groan from the crowd, O'Meara grinned, stroked it in and raised
his arms to the gray sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't feeling any more pressure than I was when I've done
well in Japan before,'' Watts said. ``I tried to hit my shots, go
through my routine. I tried to keep it as simple as I could and not
think about leading the British Open Championship.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, now wasn't the time for Watts to elaborate.
His disappointment with the present tended to dominate. That a
gentleman such as O'Meara had defeated him, offered a bit of
solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him after he won on the last hole, if it wasn't me,
I'm glad that he won,'' Watts said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLIKON, Switzerland _ Like his father and grandfather before
him, Kaspar Gunthardt is a man of the soil. He lives in the solid
old farmhouse where he was born and he has worked the rich earth
around it for most of his 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is a traditionalist who has nevertheless embraced the future.
Gunthardt owns a sophisticated cooling system for storing dairy
products. He recycles waste to fuel his farm, and cameras strapped
to beams in his barn are connected to the Internet, putting the
personal habits of his cattle on worldwide display
(http://naturaplan.coop.ch).
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to playing with the rules of nature Gunthardt
draws a line that he says he will never cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some sickness spreading across Europe right now,'' he
said, striding quickly through a 20-acre patch of organic potatoes
on his farm just south of Zurich. ``A bunch of people are trying to
get rich by telling us that nature isn't good enough and that we
will have to take genes out of a fish and put them in a strawberry
if we want to survive. They are changing the basic rules of life
and they want to try it all out on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they will get their way,'' he said, referring to the
failure of a recent national referendum here on curtailing genetic
engineering. ``It happened in America. But it won't happen on this
farm. Here we are going to live like God intended.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gunthardt seems inflexible on the issue he certainly has
company. From one end of Europe to the other consumers are in open
revolt over the prospect of a future in which nature has somehow
been altered by people holding test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the world last year more than 30 million acres of
commercial farmland were planted with genetically modified seeds _
10 times as much as the year before. But not one of those acres was
in the 15 countries of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles recently voiced a common sentiment when he
announced that no genetically altered food would ever pass his
lips. ``That takes mankind into realms that belong to God, and to
God alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate here about how _ and whether _ to unleash the most
powerful tools of modern biology says much about the cultural and
philosophical differences between pragmatic and risk-ready America,
where genetic technology that focuses on food has largely been
accepted, and the far more reticent people of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But it says more than that, because what happens to crops from
Bialystok to Bruges will have major consequences not just for
farmers, but also for industrial policy and for fields like
medicine, agriculture and pharmaceutical research.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans do make distinctions. They see genetic engineering in
the pursuit of better medicine as worth a few moral doubts, and
like many Americans they are profoundly unsettled about the
prospect of such research involving humans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet often the differences between research in plants and animals
are completely blurred by sensational events. The cloning of an
adult lamb in Scotland two years ago only deepened fears people
already had.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to explain the European conservatism, a
strong environmental movement rooted in the 19th-century philosophy
that nature is as wise as man, a fear of drastic change and the
unusually large number of small farms still run by families who are
reluctant to end practices that have been honed over centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history also plays a role, for in this part of the world
the uses of genetics have not always been benign. In almost any
discussion the dark but recent past also comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shadow of the Holocaust is dense and incredibly powerful
still,'' Arthur Caplan, the ethicist who is at the University of
Pennsylvania, said. ``It leaves Europe terrified about the abuse of
genetics. To them the potential to abuse genetics is no theory. It
is a historical fact.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the victory for researchers in Switzerland, the battle
for Europe continues to rage. Norway no longer accepts U.S. soybean
imports because more than one-third are genetically modified to
ward off pests. Austria and Luxembourg have totally banned
genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   In France _ where food is never just food _ the issue was
recently put before the nation by a ``citizens conference'' that
produced an ambiguous statement of ``cautious'' support for such
crops. In Britain vandalism has become so common at sites where
genetically modified crops are tested that the government is now
considering concealing their locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people who say they are defending nature simply harm the
countries they pretend to protect,'' said Daniel Vasella, president
and chief executive officer of Novartis AG, the pharmaceutical
giant that has energetically begun to move into food production.
``We have enough food in Europe. So that's not really an issue.
That lets them fight to keep everything forever the way it is now.
They move ahead by looking backward. It is so very egotistical.''
</P>
<P>
   All farmers try to grow crops that resist disease and last long
enough to arrive safely at the market. The task is obvious but not
simple. Officials at the United Nations World Food Program estimate
that up to 40 percent of the world's crops are destroyed as they
grow or before they leave the field. Attempts to find a way to
protect them have therefore been intense.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can now tell with precision which of 50,000 genes in
a plant governs a particular trait. If it is beneficial, they can
take that gene out of one species _ something that wards off a
common insect, for instance _ copy it and stick it into another
organism, to protect it. That organism, and its offspring, will
then have a genetic structure that lets them resist such pests.
</P>
<P>
   In a way that is nothing new. For centuries farmers have been
trying to breed crops to make sure that the biggest and best
survive.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than 500 years since people realized that
rennet from calves' stomachs turned milk into cheese. At the time
nobody knew why exactly. An enzyme called chymosin does the job.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless it was a use of biotechnology that prevails today
in modern form, an enzyme made through genetic engineering that has
replaced the rennet from calves' stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this `mad' science?'' asked Joseph Zak, who is paid by
the American Soybean Association to try to calm European fears
about how soy products are grown. ``It is just another step in the
history of agricultural technology. It falls in the same line as
when tractors replaced the horse. It's like when fertilizers came
into the picture and when we moved to breeding to make a better
product.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumers often see it as tampering with their food. And in
Europe, where regulatory bodies are not nearly as powerful or as
respected as the Food and Drug Administration is in the United
States, the fact of manipulation drives people crazy. In addition,
Mad Cow Disease, which exposed fundamental flaws in food-safety
regulation, reminded people that science is never infallible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure all this food is safe and that there might be some
promise to it,'' Lianne Wilier, 31, an accountant in Zurich, said.
``If it helps poor people somehow, I'm all for it. But I would
never feed something to my children that is not natural. It feels
wrong to me I guess because if we make a mistake on this level
there is no going back. Saying we were wrong isn't going to be good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous experience that shows the crops are safe to
grow and eat, fundamental questions do exist about the possible
uses of such technology. It is now simple, for example, to put the
taste of vanilla in almost any food by inserting the right gene
into that food. It seems harmless, and physically it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into this carefully,'' said Maria Zimmerman, who is
in charge of agricultural research for the sustainable development
department of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
``If we start making fake vanilla we will destroy the lives of
thousands of farmers in Madagascar,'' the African island-nation
that is home to most of the world's vanilla crop. ``We would ruin
the island's economy. So we aren't moving forward with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others would argue that farmers in Madagascar need to find new
crops to grow, and that could force them to do it. But it is a
difficult issue for Ms. Zimmerman, because her job is to push
genetically modified research toward its greatest goal, more _ and
more effective _ food at lower cost for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes one hectare,'' or two and a half acres, ``of land to
feed four people,'' she said. ``But as a result of population
growth, drought and the rise of a middle class that eats better
food and more food in many countries, that same amount of land is
going to have to feed six people in about 20 years. That means we
need 50 percent more food. And this technology can help. It must
help.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other researchers say biotechnology can provide more
nutritious rice, as well as cotton that requires less water to grow
and fewer pesticides. She wants to find genes that will preserve
crops, enrich their protein content and make them easier to grow.
All that, theoretically at least, is possible.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of varieties of genetically modified seeds _
corn, soybean, potatoes and cotton are examples _ that have been
planted in the United States. Many more are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans that have been modified to tolerate an herbicide have
revolutionized one of the world's most important crops. And, yes,
it is now possible to take a gene from certain fish, which permits
it to tolerate the extreme cold of the deep ocean, and insert it
into a strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't feel a little strange about all of this?'' asked
Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president of the Vatican Bioethics
Institute, which follows closely debates about genetic technology.
``It is a troubling aspect of a world that seems to be moving too
fast, one in which people often make terrible mistakes in the name
of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans are particularly aware of that problem,'' Sgreccia
said. ``Still, there are genes and there are genes. From the
Catholic point of view we are open to the use of genetic technology
in agriculture and with animals, as long as we don't do it with
man. We believe that man has a primacy on this planet and that as
long as he uses it wisely nature is here for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance Florianne Koechlin might seem an unlikely
advocate in the struggle to ban the use of genetically modified
organisms. She lives near Basel, the home of the Swiss
pharmaceutical industry, and she is a member of the Geigy family,
which started the company that has become part of Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koechlin said she was convinced that humans were racing to
put themselves in a position that they will ultimately regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying genetic research should disappear,'' she said,
sitting in the bright kitchen of her unassuming suburban house.
``This pervades all areas of life on earth, food, seed, the cells
of human beings. I know that. But why can't we slow down and think
about it all?''
</P>
<P>
   That may no longer be possible, not even in Europe. Research and
development cycles shorten every year. International competition
demands swift action to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have eaten the apple and now we will have to live with the
knowledge it gives us,'' said Gian Reto Plattner, a professor of
physics at the University of Basel. He is also a Socialist member
of the Swiss Parliament who broke with his own party to oppose the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not do that lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this as a question of risks it's pretty clear
that these crops are safe,'' Plattner said. ``Explosions and fire
are far more dangerous, and we use them every day. But nobody is
looking at the use of genetics that way. This is a religious
discussion we are having. Many people feel nature is immutable.
This work tells them they are wrong, and then they are being told
to forget about their basic beliefs. It's really asking a lot.''

<P>
   The House Commerce Committee has resolved a key conflict over
legislation to protect intellectual property in the computer age,
approving a bill that would seek to ensure that new digital
prohibitions do not trample on the ``fair use'' doctrines of
traditional copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, intended to carry out two international
treaties on digital copyrights, had already passed the Senate and
been approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Commerce Committee struggled for the last month to
devise a compromise between the owners of copyrights _ primarily,
movie and record producers and software developers _ and schools
and libraries, which feared that they could lose the right to make
the same kind of limited-use copies of digital material as they
have been able to do with printed matter.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing factions struck a deal on Friday, and the Commerce
Committee sent the amended version to the House floor later in the
day. But before the full House can vote, lawmakers must reconcile
the bill with the earlier version approved by the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, called the WIPO Copyright Treaties
Implementation Act, was introduced nearly a year ago to carry out
agreements intended to protect music, movies and other intellectual
property from piracy. It proposed outlawing the devices used to
circumvent encryption, as well as the act of circumventing those
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers said that such a ban was needed to keep thieves from
using any loopholes as a license to make illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   But schools and libraries feared that such restrictions would
hinder their ability to make the kinds of ``fair use'' copies that
copyright law has traditionally allowed.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise amendment by Rep. Scott Klug, R-Wis., would defer
the circumvention matter for two years while the secretary of
commerce reviewed the problem. After two years, the
anti-circumvention rule would go into effect. But the amendment
would also give the secretary the right, every two years, to waive
the rule for any class of works where technological safeguards were
blocking users' lawful access to copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   Klug said the measure provided a good balance between the
sometimes conflicting interests of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes a long way to guarantee that in the new age in
which we have unlimited access to information that we make sure
that access doesn't come with a price,'' he said.

<P>
   Microsoft's Apple Stake Is Hardly Altruism
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft Corp. invested $150 million in Apple Computer
last August, the action was viewed as a kind of self-interested
donation. In the bargain, Apple agreed to drop a lingering patent
suit against Microsoft and also agreed to use Microsoft's Internet
Explorer as the standard browser on its Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   With Apple then in dire financial straits, Steve Jobs, the
company's co-founder and acting chief, said the appropriate
response from the Apple faithful was to ``treat Microsoft with a
little gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, the deal appears to have been a shrewd
investment for Microsoft in other respects. Apple's shares have
outperformed Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 5, 1997, the day before its deal with Apple was
announced, Microsoft shares have advanced 65 percent, after
adjusting for a 2-for-1 stock split in January. On Friday,
Microsoft stock closed at $117.9375.
</P>
<P>
   But over the same period, the Apple stock price has surged 87
percent, closing Friday at $36.875. Hardly a charity case for
Microsoft, whose $150 million investment is now worth $280.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jobs had been criticized for unloading all but one
of his Apple shares in the spring of 1997, only a few months after
he had sold his Next Software Inc. to Apple.

   Instead, most of Jobs' personal wealth is in Pixar Inc., the
animation studio that in partnership with Disney made ``Toy Story''
and whose next film, ``A Bug's Life,'' is scheduled to open in
theaters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Another astute investment, it seems. Pixar's stock price has
more than doubled since August 1997, closing at $48 on Friday.
Jobs' 68 percent stake in Pixar is now worth more than $1.4
billion. Certainly no charity case, either.

   40 Percent of Big Companies Face `Millennium Bug'
</P>
<P>
   The ``millennium bug'' _ the inability of some computers and
programs to deal with the transition to the next century _ has
already bitten 40 percent of the United States' biggest computer
users.
</P>
<P>
   That's the finding from the latest edition of a periodic survey
of how Fortune 500 companies are coping with computing's year 2000
challenge. Put simply, the problem is that many computers and
programs fail to recognize that the year 2000, often represented in
computer code by the digits 00, comes after the year 1999,
represented by 99.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Americans think of the year 2000 problem as an
event that will strike almost a year and half from now, the number
of computer programs with warranties, leases and other business
activities that involve schedules running into the next century
climbs each month and will soar early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini America, a New York-based consulting firm that has
been sponsoring the surveys by Rubin Systems Inc. since 1995, said
that the number of companies encountering year 2000 trouble jumped
sharply early this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 87 percent of the companies that had already
encountered problems had experienced at least one disruption in
normal computer processing.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of those with trouble had programs that made
financial miscalculations when confronted with year 2000 dates, and
some of the mistakes lost money for the companies. More than
one-third of the problems were in customer-service programs, and 44
percent had difficulties involving suppliers or distribution of
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``That supply-chain figure is low because people haven't really
started testing it yet,'' said James Woodward, senior vice
president and head of Cap Gemini's year 2000 consulting and
remedies group.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey also showed that the number of companies
focusing on contingency planning jumped to 72 percent from 3
percent in April. That, Cap Gemini said, reflected the growing
recognition that year 2000 complications are more common, harder to
locate and more expensive to fix and test than was originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America is finally dealing head on with the Year
2000,'' Woodward said.

   Microsoft Innovator To Venture Further Out
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neupert, the Microsoft executive responsible for some of
the company's most innovative, and risky, new media deals, has
picked a new career with at least as much risk: venture-capital
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, the 11-year Microsoft veteran will join
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the Silicon Valley investment
force behind At Home, Amazon.com and Excite, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft's vice president for news and publishing, Neupert
was instrumental in the formation of MSNBC, the company's
cable-television joint venture with General Electric, and played a
key role in creation of Microsoft's online magazine, Slate. Brook
Byers, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said the firm has known
Neupert for years and come to respect his understanding of ``tech
meets the consumer and media worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kleiner Perkins, he will focus on electronic commerce deals
and have the title ``CEO in residence,'' which appears to refer
more to his residence than Kleiner Perkins', since he will continue
to live and work in Seattle _ and not in San Francisco and Menlo
Park, Calif., where the firm has its offices.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner Perkins now has one other CEO in residence: Jerry Held,
who was previously head of software development at Oracle Corp.
Another person who held the title, Frank Fisher, left last month to
become the actual chief executive of a cardiology medical-device
venture in which Kleiner Perkins is an investor.

THERE'S JUST ONE MINOR PROBLEM HERE

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If I were Mark O'Meara, I'd be on the horn today
with all my legal advisers figuring out the best way to file some
kind of age- discrimination lawsuit right about now.
</P>
<P>
   It would definitely be a major lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Masters champ and newly crowned British Open winner
could be jettin' over from England right now, touch down at Riviera
by Thursday morning and go after his third major of '98 in what
would be a pursuit of a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   'Cept it doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a majority of all pro golf tournaments these days
seem to be called ``majors,'' O'Meara can't just go bouncing around
from the PGA to the Senior PGA events collecting grand slam loving
cups. The rule is, you gotta win four in your own weight division.
Or in this case, it's O'Meara's wait division.
</P>
<P>
   To play in this week's U.S. Senior Open, you've got to be 50
years old on or before Thursday, July 23. O'Meara is nine years
short.
</P>
<P>
   To play in last week's British Open, you could have been any
age. You saw that 17-year-old breathing down O'Meara's neck Sunday.
That hardly seems fair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jack Nicklaus, who played recently in the U.S. Open
and put on a run at the Masters, could have played last week at the
British but passed, in part, because he committed to this week's
U.S. Senior over at Palisades Park.
</P>
<P>
   But if Nicklaus wanted to, he could, in fact, play in eight
majors this year _ 12 if he changed his name to Meg and figured a
way to sneak in as a cross-dressing legend.
</P>
<P>
   If golf is supposed to be a game in which the lowest score wins,
well, maybe O'Meara has a case. Forty-one is closer to 50 than to
17, so what's the deal? Get Larry H. Parker to start some
carbon-dating tests on the current senior group....
</P>
<P>
   Wanna play nonstop golf for 11 hours and help someone else out?
The Cystic Fibrosis ``100 Holes for a Cure'' golf tournament is
next Monday at Braemar Country Club. Entry fee is $500. For more
information: (310) 479-8585....
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park says the last name of LPGA phenom
and fellow South Korean Se Ri Pak is actually the same as his _ and
also pronounced Park. Somewhere in the immigration process, it must
have been misspelled....
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch Stadium gift shops, by the way, stock the politically
correct collection of team bobble-head dolls. In addition to what
we'll call ``the traditional Caucasian,'' there is the
African-American and, now, the Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the giant cloth mural of Ramon Martinez outside the
field-level entrance on the third-base side (where Mike Piazza used
to tower over everyone). There's a flap notched out on the thing
for an air vent _ right on Martinez's right shoulder....
</P>
<P>
   An Aflac trivia question waiting to happen: What Dodgers
switch-hitting third baseman hit a homer in his game with the team
in '98 and never hit another again....
</P>
<P>
   Without any more bean-pal giveaways, watch the trickle-down
effect continue with less-than-sellout attendance figures. If the
recent Dodgers-Giants series showed one thing, it's that wild-card
races don't fit into our summer schedules....
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Atlanta-Chicago showdown: Greg Maddux vs. Kerry Wood.
Unfortunately, the game won't be shown on WTBS or WGN.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like we'll have Jerry West one more year, but then what
office do we find him in at the Staples Center?...
</P>
<P>
   Media writers in New York say Marv Albert's rehiring at Madison
Square Garden network only exacerbates the process of him being the
lead NBA play-by-play man for TNT this fall. If there is an NBA
season, of course....
</P>
<P>
   Lee ``High-sticking'' Hamilton has yet to announce his candidacy
for the Mighty Ducks play-by-play job even though the team just
signed a multiyear deal with XTRA....
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley has been yachting in the Mediterranean off the island
of Sardinia with actor Michael Douglas, reports the newshounds at
CNN's ``Showbiz Today.'' Maybe Douglas is doing research for an
upcoming remake of ``The Life Of Riley''....
</P>
<P>
   Brian Robbins and Mike Tollin, the executive producers of the
HBO drama series ``Arli$$,'' are wrapping up a movie called
``Varsity Blues,'' due out in the fall. Jon Voight plays an
overbearing high school football coach who thrusts backup QB James
Van Der Beek (Dawson from ``Dawson's Creek'') into the
spotlight....
</P>
<P>
   As the guys on the ``Matt And A'' show pointed out the other
night, Tom Cruise has to be the actor who has starred in more
movies that are sports-themed but are not really about him as an
athlete....
</P>
<P>
   And in what borders as a Forum halftime please-stay-and-watch
gimmick (complete with overenthusiastic Lakers girls), studio
audience members of ``The Magic Hour'' can win up to 10 grand by
throwing a ball through a portable basket (we'd call it ``shooting
baskets,'' but that's giving it credibility). The picked-at-random
members can also just take $50 and sit back down if they want, an
effort to help them erase the whole embarrassing experience of
being captured on TV as a ``The Magic Hour'' show witness. &QL;

MICHAEL JOHNSON PUTS HIS INJURIES BEHIND HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also GYM-GOODWILL-GAMES, BKO-GOODWILL-GAMES,
RHODEN-COLUMN-GOODWILL) 
(mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ To hear his coach talk, Michael Johnson's hips
have been out of alignment, much like the front end of a car. That,
in turn, has left his wheels wobbling, from his tight hamstrings to
his strained Achilles' tendon. But after a frustrating early
season, Johnson said he was again ready to road-test his form at
400 meters, where he is accustomed to reaching the finish line
greeted by a checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   He will run the quarter-mile on Tuesday at the Goodwill Games,
hoping to lower a 44.40-second performance in Rome last week. That
was Johnson's best time of an interrupted season that found him
finishing an unaccustomed third in Oslo in 44.58 to two British
sprinters. But his injury problems appear to be behind him, Johnson
said Sunday at a news conference. He can again think about winning
races instead of only about staying healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to end the season ranked No. 1 in the world
and winning the rest of my races,'' Johnson said. ``I feel
confident I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He strung together 58 consecutive victories in the 400 from 1990
until 1997 and won the Olympic gold medal in the 200 and 400 at the
1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. But he strained a quadriceps muscle
in a 150-meter race against Donovan Bailey in June 1997, which
essentially ruined Johnson's season, except for a gutsy performance
at that year's world championships in Athens, where he won the 400
on sheer determination.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics aside, that victory in Athens may have been the
greatest of Johnson's career. It was especially phenomenal, said
his coach, Clyde Hart, considering that Johnson's left leg had
one-third less strength than the right leg and one-third slower
reaction time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like running on a flat tire,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Johnson's hip alignment continued into this
season as he found himself training one or two days a week and then
having to take the rest of the week off. From day to day, he did
not know what his legs would allow him to do. With massage and
special exercises, Hart said, Johnson has corrected the problem in
the last month and now lacks only races to regain complete fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to deal with emotionally, not knowing when
I'm going out to train whether I'm going to get injured,'' Johnson
said. ``It got to the point whether it was day to day. Thankfully
I've got that behind me. I can go out and train hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is a month behind in training, Johnson said, which
left him unable to compete effectively at 200 meters. He withdrew
from the event here. But he said that attempts to write off his
career before the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, were
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Only injuries have slowed him, Johnson said, adding that he
believed he could still run under 43 seconds at 400 meters when
completely healthy, which would shatter Butch Reynolds' world
record of 43.29 seconds. Johnson owns the second-fastest time of
43.39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If he starts running 45 and 46 seconds, he said, he won't have
to be pushed out of the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you show vulnerability, people say, `O.K., it's
time,''' Johnson said. ``But they don't take into account what it
is. They don't think about injuries. The day I'm not running fast
and it's not because of injuries, I'll be in retirement.''

Holy Cow!
</P>

</P>
<P>
   _ The big story: The division is getting ugly again as both the
Rangers and Angels are in slumps while the Mariners have been the
hottest team since the break but it may be a little too late. The
Mariners went into Sunday's game with an 8-2 mark on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: Former Brave Rico Rossy, now the third baseman
with the Mariners, had a career high four hits Saturday.

his right knee in his last start.

Salmon goes on the DL. The ligament in his left heel is 70 percent
torn.

Cincinnati about Pete Harnisch, who is 7-4 with a 3.06 ERA.

players tuned the clubhouse stereo to songs from the 1970s, the
days of the Big Red Machine.

   _ The injuries: The Cubs finally got back outfielder Lance
Johnson, who had been on the 60-day with an injured right hand.

SENIOR SCHEDULE A DISSERVICE TO PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Player's father toiled in a gold mine in
Johannesburg, South Africa, and Player might have ended up doing
the same if he hadn't gotten the opportunity to mine for gold on
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Player was so appreciative of the chance to play golf
professionally in the United States that when he won his first and
only U.S. Open title in 1965, he promptly gave $20,000 of his
$25,000 winner's check back to the United States Golf Association
for the promotion of junior golf.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gracious gesture by Player, to be sure. And yet 33
years later the USGA couldn't give Player so much as a scheduling
break. As a result, Player, one of only two golfers to win
back-to-back Senior Opens, will be conspicuous by his absence when
the 19th U.S. Senior Open gets under way Thursday at Riviera
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Player's predicament is that he is the defending champion of the
British Senior Open, which will be held next week. He holds that
tournament in high regard even if the Senior PGA Tour leaves the
British Senior off its schedule altogether and the USGA also
blithely ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain scheduling one seminal Senior event right
before another on a different continent? The only thing more absurd
than that is the number of air miles Player would have had to log
in order to compete in his 44th consecutive British Open, the U.S.
Senior Open and the Senior British Open on successive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Player decided to go to England and stay there to save wear and
tear on his 62-year-old body. Jack Nicklaus, 58, forced by a
degenerative left hip to choose between the British Open and the
U.S. Senior Open, went the other route, choosing the U.S. event
even though it meant ending his streak of appearances in
consecutive Grand Slam events at a mind-boggling 154.
</P>
<P>
   It's ludicrous, making the likes of Player and Nicklaus select
one Open over another the way they would an iron out of their bags.
They're not between clubs, after all; they're in the midst of
history. In April, Player became the oldest man to survive the cut
at the Masters and Nicklaus nearly won his seventh green jacket,
finishing in a tie for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus and Player are among only four players to have won all
four of golf's majors (joining Gene Sarazan and Ben Hogan). Player
is the only golfer in this century to win a British Open in three
different decades. If he feels an affinity for the British Isles
that's on par with his love for the United States, well, you can
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic Player's drawing power should have been no small
consideration to the people running the show this week in L.A.,
given that Angelenos roundly ignored the last golf major that
passed through town. The 1995 PGA Championship at Riviera attracted
60,000 fans over four days, which wasn't a mob by anyone's
definition except, maybe, a Clippers season-ticket holder.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials are hopeful 100,000 people will turn out
this time to watch the 50-and-over set. Having Nicklaus and Arnold
Palmer in the field will help, but there's no question it'd be a
lot more compelling a ticket if Player came with the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sad because I love Riviera and I love Los Angeles,''
Player said recently from Johannesburg. ``And of course I'm sad
because I've won the U.S. Senior Open twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the conflict that's keeping Player away could have been
avoided. Unlike the U.S. Open, the U.S. Senior Open isn't locked
into the same calendar spot. The tournament had a June starting
date eight times in its first 18 years and a champion was crowned
as late as August in 1988, the year Player successfully defended
his title at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   USGA official Tom Meeks acknowledged Sunday there was some
flexibility in choosing the dates. Indeed, there was talk of
holding the tournament the first week in July, but Riviera
officials balked because they wanted their club to themselves over
the Fourth of July holiday. And USGA officials didn't press the
issue, the memories still fresh in their minds of the tepid
attendance in Cleveland two years ago when the Senior Open was
contested July 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Senior Open ought to have been held the last full
week of June, directly on the heels of the U.S. Open in San
Francisco (bumping a Senior PGA Tour contrivance called the
Cadillac NFL Classic).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the USGA was very inconsiderate, taking the date it
did,'' Player said.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks said the USGA intended no slight to Player or the British
Senior Open. But USGA officials had to know that by settling on
this week, they were sacrificing Player. The writing was in the
book Player penned 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Golf Begins at 50,'' Player described winning the 1987 U.S.
Senior Open at Brooklawn Country Club in Fairfield, Conn., with a
record score of 14-under-par, then hopping a plane to get to
England for the start of the U.S. Senior British Open three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of jet lag, the change in weather and age
caught up with me,'' Player wrote. ``I just wasn't myself in the
British Senior. In fact, I was completely useless. The experience
made me realize that at my age I can't expect to get on a plane,
cross umpteen time zones and go straight out on a golf course and
shoot subpar golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Shame on the USGA for once again daring Player to try. &QL;

 &HT;    Brewers leave Atlanta on short end of stick as error-filled
series ends
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Milwaukee Brewers got out of town and after a
12-error series and Sunday's interminable 11-6 Atlanta victory,
leaving was a far safer thing to do. Andruw Jones crumpled a fender
running into the center field wall, Kerry Lightenberg's right hand
was nearly detached by a Fernando Vina liner and Dennis Martinez's
ERA continues to hemorrhage after another two-run outing.
</P>
<P>
   But in taking three of four from the Brewers, Atlanta will keep
two items from Sunday's three-hour, 10-minute sweatbath: John
Smoltz (8-2) won again and the far end of the bench made a mess
that the Brewers never did clean up. Second baseman Tony Graffanino
had his first 4-for-4 day in the majors (including a home run) and
Curtis Pride, starting in right for the slumping Michael Tucker,
scored four runs and hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   For a team whose bench is seen as a general weakness, the day
deserved some bunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those guys need to be thrown in the lineup every once in a
while,'' said left fielder Ryan Klesko, ''especially when someone's
not swinging that good, whether it's myself or Tucker or Andruw.
Those guys need some at-bats. Plus, it's the challenge. You want to
try to do well for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride has. In two starts within the last five games, he scored
five times, driven in a pair and stolen a base. But Graffanino's
performance was more significant simply because he was hitting .203
at the All-Star break and had become little more than a lacking
understudy at Keith Lockhart. Making some critical adjustments at
the plate _ hands higher, stance closer to the plate and up further
in the box _ Graffanino is 8-for-13 since the break, bringing his
average to .240, its highest in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, I'd like to play every day,'' Graffanino said, ''but
Keith is huge for this team, he's on base all the time and we need
him to do well too. But I feel I can do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Pride was crossing the plate at a pretty regular pace and
Graff had an outstanding day,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ''It makes
a great day when two guys who haven't played a whole bunch do that
well when they do get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz worked seven hard innings before yielding to the heat,
allowing seven hits while striking out six but yielding just two
earned runs, which dropped his ERA to 3.53. After 14 starts last
year, he was 6-5 and wondering what could go wrong next. Even after
two visits to the DL, this season may actually wind up being one of
his most successful. He won for the fourth time in six starts since
coming off the DL June 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to put together a solid year, under the
circumstances,'' he said. ''I think I can do that. It's been very
gratifying to this point but at the same time, I'm also aware
things could change real quick for me.''

FLORIDA GIVES TEEN-AGE SMOKERS A DAY IN COURT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANTATION, Fla. _ Once a month for a couple of hours, Judge
Steven Shutter of Broward County clears his courtroom of lawyers
and defendants to make room for restless teen-agers and their
inconvenienced parents for what is known as Teen Smoking Court.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sometimes has to order quiet more than once, and
sometimes he even removes a few people to emphasize his point, but
the crowd recoils into silence on its own when Earl Mogk stands up
to talk about his larynx cancer, the product, he said, of 40 years
of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was your age, there was nobody out there to tell me
about the dangers of smoking,'' Mogk, 60, said at a recent court
session, talking through an electronic device he has used since his
larynx, or voice box, and vocal cords were surgically removed.
``The reason I'm here today is for a reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers applauded, even though many said later they would
keep on smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's fight against teen-age smoking, Shutter's courtroom
in Plantation, a suburb just west of Fort Lauderdale, is a new
weapon that combines education, health warnings and parental
nagging with the weight of the law. The Teen Smoking Court is part
of a large-scale campaign against underage smoking that the state
is financing with $200 million of the $11.3 billion settlement it
reached with tobacco companies last year after suing to recover
Medicaid payments for smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is experimenting with advertising, school-based programs
and increased policing of both minors and retail outlets suspected
of selling cigarettes to those under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts are part of a two-year pilot program that includes
``truth ads'' for the printed and electronic press, which are
designed by teen-agers themselves. ``Attention movie industry,''
one advertisement that objects to smoking in films reads. ``We are
your best customers, so why are you trying to kill us?''
</P>
<P>
   Another effort consists of a ``truth train,'' scheduled to stage
rock concerts and beach parties in 10 cities around the state to
spread the anti-smoking message.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy
group in Washington, said that states that had sued the tobacco
industry had emphasized the need to protect young people from
smoking and stop cigarette-makers from tailoring advertising
campaigns to entice them.
</P>
<P>
   A push on the national level to reduce teen-age smoking has
stalled with the failure of a $516 billion tobacco bill in the
Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the other states that have reached settlements, Texas,
Mississippi and Minnesota, are all expected to use part of the
money for anti-smoking programs aimed at minors, officials said.
Thirty-seven states have suits pending against the tobacco
companies. Some states, like California and Massachusetts, have
their own public education efforts with money from increased excise
taxes on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, executive vice president and general counsel for
the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said that Florida may help
design an effective model for other efforts to reduce smoking by
the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that everything they're doing will work,''
Myers said. ``It means that we can learn a good deal from these
efforts and do even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Florida made it illegal for those under age 18 to
possess tobacco products. Since then, state agents and local police
have cited thousands of teen-agers for smoking and required them to
pay a fine or do community service. Their offense is an infraction
and does not involve any criminal charges, but repeat violators,
and uncooperative ones, face suspension of their driver's licenses
or a legal block to getting one.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas,
also punish underage smokers with suspension of driving privileges,
fines or community service. In Idaho, violators face up to six
months in a juvenile detention center. But Myers said Florida was
among the first to enlist the courts.
</P>
<P>
   That effort began here in Broward County Court in April when
Shutter went beyond just handling smoking citations to create the
state's first Teen Smoking Court. Other counties are setting up
their own systems and are expected to use the court here as a
model.
</P>
<P>
   Underage smokers given citations in Broward County must appear
in court with a parent, sit through an anti-smoking video or class
and listen to Mogk ``for dramatic effect,'' Shutter said. About 150
teen-agers appear in court each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a crime,'' Shutter said jovially at a recent court
session with 175 ethnically diverse teen-agers. ``It's wrong, it's
stupid, it's dangerous, but it's not a crime. You ruin your health,
you ruin your life, but you don't care. So let's talk about the
legal consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice of a $53 fine, including court costs, or eight
hours of community service, like washing police cars, most
violators opted for community service. Those under age 16 were
required to watch a one-hour video that graphically depicted the
hazards of smoking while the older teen-agers signed up for a
four-hour class at the local chapter of the American Lung
Association that includes both videos and group discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Then the judge called out individual names for a brief
interaction at the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you what to do,'' Shutter said to one
smoker, Lisa Gottlieb, who turned 18 the day she appeared in court.
``You can make your own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Ms. Gottlieb said she had no plans to quit her
pack-a-day habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Ms. Gottlieb, a Plantation High School
graduate who started smoking at 14, said of the law-enforcement
effort. ``The bottom line is, kids are going to smoke. It's my body
and unless I have a desire to quit I'm not going to.''

United States goes deep on Spain
<TEXT>
<P>
   All 15 players score in victory
</P>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL; 
MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ It wasn't exactly the running of the Bulls.
Or even the running of the Clippers or Mavericks, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   But when Spain's national team confronted the U.S. World
Championship of Basketball team Sunday, it was a considerably
better test than the Americans had received a day earlier against
France.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a moderately respected international competitor _
though not expected to be a medal contender this month in Athens,
Greece _ was waiting for the United States. And when Rudy
Tomjanovich's team was locked in a seven-point game at halftime of
its second exhibition, it represented another opportunity for a
growth spurt for the young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   They continued to sprout up the chart.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Sasser scored the first six points of the second half,
point guard Michael Hawkins provided valuable leadership and the
United States wore down Spain for a 95-78 victory at Stade Louis II
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The United States never trailed in the game, but it wasn't until
the second half that the Americans put away the more physical
Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive part of the win was a different set
of heroes emerged than those who carried the heaviest weight a
night earlier against France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to be a trait of this team,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``We have good players, but the most important thing is that
we have the team concept. All the guys came out in the second half
and really got it going. Hopefully, one of the strengths of this
team is going to be our depth. On different nights, different guys
are going to get the job done for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser finished with 15 points and Hawkins had 12. They were the
only Americans to score in double digits although all 15 of them
scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good learning experience for us,'' Tomjanovich said.
``I'm pleased with the way we came out in the second half and kept
our intensity up there. And, again, defense was a big key for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain was forced into nine turnovers in the first seven minutes,
when the United States rolled up an 18-8 lead. But when it wasn't
stealing the ball, it was fouling the person who had it.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, no more than a few seconds elapsed on the game
clock without a foul being whistled. The United States had 20 fouls
in the first half, when Spain went to the free-throw line 21 times.
If it could have hit more than 62 percent, Spain might have been
closer than 43-36 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the team from Spain was a lot more physical and we
got in foul trouble early because of it,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We
didn't make the adjustments to how the game was being called.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hawkins began to run the U.S. club smartly after halftime,
when he had three of his four assists and 10 of his points,
including two opportunistic 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone for us might have 15 or 20 points on one night
and then the next night, it'll be somebody else, maybe somebody off
the bench, doing that type of scoring,'' Hawkins said. ``In this
game, we kind of got a feel for the way the game was going in the
first half and coach Tomjanovich told us we had to pick it up going
into the second half, so that's what we did.''

 PLANTATION, Fla.: I'm not going to.''. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other teen-agers interviewed after court said they had no plans
to quit, underscoring the difficulties in changing attitudes. Not
all could fully explain why they smoked, even when they disapproved
themselves. ``It's more of a social thing,'' one boy said. A girl
said, ``It's like biting your nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, in the parking lot, one teen-ager stole a
last smoke in the car, sitting with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, however, parents who smoked disapproved of their
child's smoking and were appreciative of the court.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the video with his 16-year-old daughter, Cary
Clark, 36, a superintendent at a church, said, ``I'm glad that
here's another piece of information that will help her at some
point say smoking isn't what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, about 35 percent of high school students smoke, a
rate that is similar to the national rate of 36 percent, state
officials said. But the urgency to reach teen-agers for prevention
efforts stems from studies that have also found that people who
have not started smoking by age 21 are unlikely to ever smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Most teen-agers in court were caught smoking near their schools
by undercover agents from the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and
Tobacco within the Florida Department of Business and Professional
Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Deployed against both underage smokers and the retailers who
sell cigarettes to them illegally, the agents and other local
law-enforcement agencies issued about 2,800 citations to minors
from October 1997 to May 1998. They issued 136 citations to
retailers from July 1997 to May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials do not see the point in punishing smokers.
``It's kind of absurd to hold the kids accountable in that way,''
said Jon Lloyd, a health program specialist with the California
Department of Health Services, whose smoking programs focused on
restricting ``vectors of the disease,'' like advertisers and
retailers. ``We feel it kind of takes attention away from the real
perpetrators of this addiction. That is the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florida officials say they are aiming at an integrated
effort. ``You have to do everything,'' said Chuck Wolfe, director
of Florida's program. ``You can't just pick one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all pieces of the program, the Teen Smoking Court will be
evaluated. Shutter, 54, said that realistically, he would deem the
court successful if it got 20 percent to 25 percent of the
teen-agers cited to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be some of them who will intellectualize it and say,
`Yes, I don't want this to happen,''' the judge said. ``That isn't
the run-of-the-mill teen-ager.'' But, he added, ``If I get 30 kids
out of this, was that worth half a day? I think so.''

CLINTON PREPARING TO GIVE MEDICAL ID TO EVERY AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As legislation that would protect patient privacy
languishes in Congress, the Clinton administration is quietly
laying plans to assign every American a ``unique health
identifier'': a computer code that could be used to create a
national database that would track every citizen's medical history
from cradle to grave.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic code was mandated by a 1996 law and would be the
first comprehensive national identification system since the Social
Security number was introduced in 1935. Although the idea has
attracted almost no public attention, it is so contentious that
federal health officials, who were supposed to propose a plan for
the identifier by February, have made little headway and are
instead launching a series of hearings beginning on Monday to
solicit public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, including insurance companies and public health
researchers, say the benefits would be vast. Doctors and hospitals
would be able to monitor the health of patients as they switch from
one insurance plan to the next. Patients would not have to wade
through a cumbersome bureaucracy to obtain old records. Billing
would be streamlined, saving money. A national disease database
could be created, offering unlimited opportunities for scientific
study.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, including privacy advocates and some doctors'
groups, say the code smacks of Big Brother. They warn that
sensitive health information might be linked to financial data or
criminal records and that already tenuous privacy protections would
be further weakened as existing managed care databases, for
example, are linked. They say that trust in doctors, already eroded
by managed care, would deteriorate further, with patients growing
reluctant to share intimate details. And in a world where computer
hackers can penetrate the Pentagon's computer system, they ask,
will anyone's medical records be safe?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very grave concerns about the unique patient
identifier,'' said Dr. Donald Palmisano, the American Medical
Association's expert on medical privacy. ``If this information
ended up in some central repository, some giant clearinghouse, what
protection do we have that some vandal would not break in?''
</P>
<P>
   The identifier was ordered by Congress in 1996 as part of
legislation that permits employees to take their health insurance
with them when they switch jobs. That law, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act, also requires codes for
employers, health plans, doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the requirements for what is being called
``administrative simplification'' has generated as much debate as
the idea of a patient identification number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a slow approach,'' said Campbell Gardett, a
spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is
charged with creating the system. ``This will be an issue that has
a lot of sensitivity and a lot of feeling,'' so much so, he said,
that if no consensus can be reached on how to develop the system,
the administration could be forced to drop the plan and report to
Congress that it was impossible to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say crucial questions remain, among them what kind of
identifier should be used. Some have proposed using the Social
Security number, which is already used as an identifier by many
health plans. But critics complain that too many people, including
credit card company clerks and state motor vehicles officials,
already have access to Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested a composite number, consisting of the
patient's date of birth, the latitude and longitude of the hometown
and some additional digits. Still others say the identifier should
not be a number at all but rather a ``biomedical marker,'' like a
thumb print or an electronic scan of the retina _ an option that is
considered remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own feeling is that you do need to have a way to identify
people uniquely,'' said Dr. Don Detmer, chairman of the National
Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, a citizens panel that is
advising Donna Shalala, the health and human services secretary, on
the issue. ``Now the challenge comes down to what is the best way
of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   To sort out these and other issues, Shalala's agency is
deviating from its customary rulemaking procedure. Rather than
issuing a proposal and inviting public comment, as it already has
with regulations for the employer and provider identifier codes,
the department is sponsoring a series of public hearings on the
unique patient identifier. The first is scheduled for Monday in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting,'' predicted Dr. Christopher Chute, the
head of medical information resources at the Mayo Foundation. ``It
could reduce to yet another forum for the disgruntled and the
paranoid to vent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chute, who will sit on a panel on Monday, is a strong advocate
of the patient identifier. The alternative, he said, is to ``rely
on folklore and anecdote in health care.'' An epidemiologist, he
envisions a day when a patient with an unusual combination of
diseases can walk into a doctor's office, and the doctor can tap
into a national repository that will turn up other patients with
the same complex history, along with advice about what treatments
work best.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fantasy,'' Chute said. ``We have the technology to
do such a thing. What we don't have is the social infrastructure to
support it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Americans may not accept that vision, said Dr. Richard
Sobel, a research fellow at Harvard Law School. Sobel, who studies
the political and constitutional questions raised by government
databanks, said the nation has a suspicion of technological
efficiency that dates to the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American political system was set up to be inefficient, to
divide power,'' Sobel said. ``What ID numbers do is centralize
power, and in a time when knowledge is power, then centralized
information is centralized power. I think people have a gut sense
that this is not a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier proposal for a national medical identification card,
put forth by the Clinton administration in 1993 as part of its
ill-fated plan to provide universal health insurance, generated
huge opposition. Critics complained that the card would become the
equivalent of a domestic passport; the idea dropped by the wayside
when the plan to overhaul the health system fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   The current debate is sharpened, both sides say, by the lack of
a federal law to protect patient privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a federal law right now that protects the privacy of
the titles of the videos you rent, but not one that protects your
medical history,'' said Mary Jane Collipriest, a spokeswoman for
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who is drafting privacy legislation
and expects to introduce his bill later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bennett's draft, there are five bills already
circulating in Congress. Each delineates who can have access to
medical records without a patient's consent and stipulates
penalties for the unauthorized release of medical information. But
each bill varies on several crucial points.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., would allow patients to
opt out of the electronic data system entirely, a feature the other
bills do not contain. Leahy would also require a court order for
law-enforcement officials to have access to medical records without
patient consent, a provision that is opposed by Bennett as well as
Ms. Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue is whether federal privacy legislation
should override stricter state laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any legislation, many say, privacy has already
been seriously compromised. ``There is no privacy anymore,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who is author of another of the bills.
``It has been eroded in so many ways that you can find out almost
anything about anybody if you know how to work the computer well
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites one incident that, he said, ``set my teeth on edge.''
In 1996, a Medicaid clerk in Maryland tapped into a computerized
database and sold patient names to a health maintenance
organization for as little as 50 cents per record.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethicists, including Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, contend
that debate over the unique health identifier is nothing more than
a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illusory to give people the idea that they can protect
privacy,'' Caplan said. ``Your managed care company knows what
doctors you see, what pills you take, how often they are
prescribed. What don't they know?''
</P>
<P>
   But the current system is highly balkanized; the computers at
one managed-care company cannot communicate with those at another.
Critics of the national identification code say that once different
plans can talk to one another, linking medical records for years
and even decades, patient privacy will be virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   A.G. Breitenstein, director of the Health Law Institute, an
advocacy group based in Boston, said: ``That information will be
irrevocably integrated into a cradle-to-grave medical record to
which insurers, employers, government and law enforcement will have
access is, to me, exactly what privacy is not. People are not going
to feel comfortable going to the doctor, because now you are going
to have a permanent record that will follow you around for the rest
of your life that says you had syphilis, or depression, or an
abortion or whatever else.''

SHOPPERS UNAWARE OF GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Sidebar with FARMING-GENETICS) 
(js) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American shoppers would be surprised to know that much of the
food they buy has genetically engineered ingredients. But they
cannot tell just how much, because the United States, unlike many
other countries, does not require the labeling of gene-modified
food.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers are unaware of the amount of genetically
engineered food that is available, making it difficult to judge
their resistance to such products.
</P>
<P>
   When the government granted Monsanto Co. permission to sell
rBGH, recombinant bovine growth hormone, which increases cows' milk
production, and milk containing a gene-altered hormone went on
sale, some states and several dairies tried to label their products
as free of the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto threatened to take them to court. Some capitulated. But
a number of dairy products are now labeled to show that they do not
contain rBGH.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few consumer groups seeking wider labeling, the
greatest awareness of genetically engineered food comes from the
organic-food industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods Market Inc. of Austin, Texas, which has 91
supermarkets in 18 states, requires its suppliers to guarantee that
none of the products they sell to the company have gene-altered
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national
standards for organic food that included genetically altered food,
more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed
regulations. The inclusion of genetically modified food was one of
the reasons most often cited, and the proposal was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the government gave the green light to genetically
modified soybeans, cotton, corn, summer squash, potatoes, canola
oil, radicchio, papayas and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of genetically modified soybeans, cotton and corn on
the market is significant. According to one study, the gene-altered
corn crop in the United States this summer is estimated to be 32
percent of the total, for soybeans 38 percent and for canola oil,
from Canada, 58 percent. There is no estimate for cotton.
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures for the smaller crops like papaya and
radicchio, and just because a crop has approval does not mean that
it is being sold. But within a year or two such crops are quite
likely to be available.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union, the Environmental Defense Fund and the
Center for Science in the Public Interest are among those pushing
for labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Norway and India are leading the fight to require the strictest
labeling on all foods. And virtually all European Union countries
want some labeling for gene-altered food.
</P>
<P>
   A senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, Rebecca
Goldberg, said the United States might be forced to require some
labeling because of international trade. ``Many products made
abroad,'' Ms. Goldberg said, ``will be labeled, and in order for
the United States to sell food products abroad we may have to label
them.''

LAWMAKERS' DEBATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Texas, Calif., Wis.)  (lb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call it the capital's rendition of ``Eine Kleine
Nachtmusik,'' the sometimes discordant strains of the
campaign-finance debate relegated to the post-prime-time evening
hours of the House's summer agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors galleries are nearly empty of curious tourists. The
reporters and television crews that cram the Capitol in daylight
have all but disappeared. But like night-wandering vampires, a
small tag team of lawmakers take the floor for a debate that often
does come close to drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the daytime votes that the Republican leadership
wants to showcase have been cast, long after news deadlines have
passed, some of the truths of modern politics are told.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Socratic dialogue seeking to define a ``shakedown.'' It
began when Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., seeking limits on money
in politics, clashed with Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip,
over the lessons of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations that huge cash donations were made to the Nixon
White House in satchels and manila envelopes led Congress in 1974
to enact the last sweeping overhaul of the campaign-finance law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the corporations that were being
shaken down by the Nixon administration are telling me now that
they are being shaken down by both political parties in soft
money,'' Shays said. ``Soft money'' is the term for the unlimited,
unregulated donations to political parties that would effectively
be banned by bipartisan legislation sponsored by Shays and Rep.
Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, of Texas, who has sometimes argued himself hoarse in his
fight against Shays' legislation, promptly asked for a definition
of ``shakedown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakedown,'' Shays responded, ``is when leaders from both
parties will call up a corporation president and say, `We would
like $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 or half a million,' and make
it very clear to those leaders that they can expect no action on
their legislation unless they get it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the gentleman like to name the members that do it?''
asked DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, usually mild-mannered to a fault, warned
uncharacteristically, ``Do not even wonder for a minute about
whether I will be able to document that information.''
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone, once a week, maybe twice a week since late May.
The next roundelay is scheduled for Monday after the sun goes down.
The debate has become an evening marathon dance, an endurance test.
And that is just as it was intended to be.
</P>
<P>
   With most Republicans fiercely opposed to changing a
campaign-finance system that favors incumbents, Speaker Newt
Gingrich first tried to scuttle the overhaul in March by having a
debate but never allowing the Shays-Meehan bill to come to
consideration on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   When that tactic backfired politically, Gingrich shifted gears
to allow a full and fair debate _ so full that 11 separate
proposals are up for consideration along with scores of amendments.
If more than one proposal draws a majority, then the one with the
most votes is the one presented to the House for a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Republicans showed some mercy by striking an
agreement with Democrats that whittled down proposed amendments to
the Shays-Meehan bill to 55. But that is still a formidable
obstacle course when many of the amendments are designed to water
down the bill or push away supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time has also allowed lobbying against the bill
to intensify. An array of 53 organizations _ including the
Christian Coalition, the National Right to Life Committee and the
Southern Baptist Convention _ are fighting the measure in large
part because it would restrict the use of television and radio
commercials by independent groups in periods close to an election.
</P>
<P>
   In this debate, certain questions return like a coda. Night
after night, Republicans insist that campaign spending is free
speech, protected by the First Amendment, and challenge the notion
that money raising sullies Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is too much money?'' Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., asked
Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis. ``Too much money compared to what? What kind
of money is appropriate? How much money is too much in politics?''
</P>
<P>
   Kind replied: ``The average person in western Wisconsin believes
that under the current finance system, even though it is legal for
a wealthy individual or group to contribute a million dollars to
either political party, that is too much money. That is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay often seems to have snack food on his mind as he doggedly
refutes such notions. When asked about the $2.8 billion spent by
the political parties in the last presidential campaign year, DeLay
said ``That is less than the American people spend on potato
chips.''
</P>
<P>
   On another night he toted up the $218 million spent on House
races in 1996. ``That breaks down to about $3.80 per voter who
voted in the election _ $3.80,'' he said. ``That is less money than
we spent on bubble gum in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Meehan asked Doolittle if he was ``not in favor of
any limits at all?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is correct,'' Doolittle answered. ``No limits.'' In fact,
Doolittle is sponsoring his own campaign-finance proposal that
would eliminate the current limits on how much individuals and
political action committees may contribute to candidates. He would
require in their place electronic disclosure of contributions, with
reports filed every 24 hours in the last three months before an
election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The long nights do give many Republicans one opportunity they
relish _ that of highlighting some of President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore's campaign-finance practices of 1996, which
spurred investigations by the Justice Department and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first ran in 1992 on a platform that included an
overhaul of the campaign laws. But his re-election campaign was
criticized as the very symbol of fund-raising excess as the
president courted big donors with White House coffees and
sleep-overs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a recent breakfast with reporters if he wanted the
president to use his bully pulpit to help propel the issue forward,
Meehan demurred. ``If he comes out and makes a statement, the
Republicans, they all take to the floor with their photographs,''
Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, DeLay stood last week next to a blow-up poster of
Gore at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles. Democrats later termed
the event inappropriate because of the temple's tax-exempt status,
and the party returned the donations.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay lambasted the Democratic National Committee for taking
illegal foreign donations in 1996. The party returned the money
after it became an issue in the final days of the 1996 campaign.
Several party fund-raisers have since been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said: ``If you have a friend by the name of Arief and
Soraya, and I cannot even pronounce the last name _ Wiriadinata,
something like that _ who donated $450,000 to the DNC and was
friends with a guy named Johnny Huang, and later returned it
because Wiriadinata could not explain where it came from, then
probably there is a high probability that it's money from foreign
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing names that emerged in congressional hearings, DeLay said,
``I could go on with John Lee and Cheong Am, Yogesh Gandhi, Ng Lap
Seng, Supreme Master Suma Ching Hai and George Psaltis.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays intervened. ``I know the gentleman did not mean it to
sound this way, but when I listened to it, it sounded this way,''
he said. ``It sounded like if you have a foreign name, there was a
high probability they were foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   After some give and take, DeLay said, ``No, I am not saying
that.'' He followed up with a written statement the next day
saying, ``In no way did I mean to suggest that Asian-Americans
should not participate in our democracy.''

O'MEARA WINS PLAYOFF AND THE BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (Eds: See also GLF-BRITISH-OPEN-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Moments after Mark O'Meara captured a
thrilling and memorable British Open on Sunday, his wife, Alicia,
was asked why her husband is having his best year at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's your time, it's your time,'' said Alicia. ``He's a
late bloomer, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   What a way to blossom. Prevailing over a courageous Brian Watts,
a charging Tiger Woods and winning his second major championship of
the year, O'Meara bested Watts in a four-hole playoff by two
strokes, providing a terrific climax to a demanding four-day test
of golf at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and Watts, who made a spectacular bunker shot on the
72nd regulation hole to save par and force the playoff, finished
tied after 72 holes at even-par 280. Woods, who shot a
four-under-par 66 Sunday and birdied three of the last four holes,
finished just one stroke out of the playoff and settled for third
place.
</P>
<P>
   Once the playoff began, O'Meara was at his steady best, adding
another major championship to his victory at the Masters in April.
Hitting every fairway in the playoff, which started at the 15th
hole, O'Meara birdied the first playoff hole to take a one-stroke
lead, then clinched the title on the 18th hole, where he made a
three-foot putt for par, after Watts had already bogeyed. As his
final putt settled in the cup, O'Meara raised his arms in triumph
as thunderous applause came from the grandstands and thousands of
fans who had surrounded Royal Birkdale's 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, in his 18th year on the PGA Tour, had reached the
pinnacle of his career. And while he savored the moment, even
O'Meara had difficulty absorbing the magnitude of winning two
majors within five months, after waiting his whole career before
this year to win his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could put my finger on it, I would have done it
earlier,'' said O'Meara, who shot a two-under-par 68 in regulation
Sunday, while Watts shot a 70. ``It's incredibly gratifying to know
my name is on this trophy. If you look at the names of the players
that have won the Open championship, and the golf courses they've
won on, it's a tremendous honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf ball sitting on the ground doesn't know how old you
are. It doesn't know if you're 41, 50, or 22. Granted, I don't hit
it as long as some of the young players, but once in awhile I wield
a pretty wicked putter. And I make some pretty good putts at some
important times.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning, O'Meara:
</P>
<P>
   _ Became the oldest player ever to win two majors in the same
year. Both Jack Nicklaus (1980) and Ben Hogan (1953) won two majors
in the same year at the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   _ Became the first man to win two majors in the same year since
1994, when Nick Price won the British Open and the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Became the first man to win the Masters and the British Open
in the same year since Nick Faldo in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ Became the first American to win two majors in the same year
since 1982, when Tom Watson won the U.S. Open and the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   At next month's PGA Championship at Sahalee Golf Club in
Redmond, Wash., O'Meara will have a chance to become the first man
to win three majors in the same year since 1953, when Ben Hogan won
the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But despite his achievements, O'Meara refused to call himself a
great golfer. ``Great players are Jack Nicklaus, Byron Nelson, Ben
Hogan, Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, you can go down the list,'' said
O'Meara. ``I consider myself a consistent player, a player that
tries to do the best I can at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, O'Meara's best was just good enough, as other players
were more spectacular, yet fell short. It was a difficult defeat
for Watts, a 32-year-old American who started the day holding a
two-stroke lead and fell just short of an improbable victory.
Having played primarily on the Japanese tour since 1993, Watts
started the tournament as a long shot, and almost ended it as the
champion. But he missed a costly 4-footer for par on the first
playoff hole, and O'Meara never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you had told me I would have been in a playoff
at the beginning of the week, I wouldn't have believed you,'' said
Watts, who lives in Edmond, Okla. ``I'm disappointed that I didn't
win, because I had the opportunity. But I'm still proud.''
</P>
<P>
   And Watts will be particularly proud of his brilliant bunker
shot at No. 18, which led to the playoff with O'Meara, who had
already finished his regulation round, and was watching from behind
the 18th green with his wife and two children. When Watts pulled
his second shot at No. 18 into the left-side bunker about 45 feet
from the pin, he was in serious danger of making a bogey that would
have given the title to O'Meara right there.
</P>
<P>
   But with one foot in the bunker, and one foot out, Watts lofted
a soft shot that floated out of the sand, landed on a slope near
the green, then trickled toward the hole and stopped less than two
feet away. The crowd roared, and O'Meara applauded in appreciation,
and when Watts tapped in for par, the playoff was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as good a shot as I've seen, with that kind of
pressure on,'' said O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to create something and visualize a good shot,
and it came off almost perfect,'' said Watts.
</P>
<P>
   The entire day provided memorable moments, as the wind calmed
for the first time all week, and seven players competed on the back
nine with a chance to win. Four players finished tied for fourth
place at 282: Jim Furyk, Jesper Parnevik, Raymond Russell and
Justin Rose, a 17-year-old amateur from England who was the darling
of the crowd and shot a 69 Sunday. But O'Meara left with the claret
jug, the trophy given to the British Open champion for a year.
Playing one group ahead of Watts in regulation, O'Meara took the
lead for the first time when he birdied No. 14, moving to even par,
one stroke ahead of Watts and Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, was several holes ahead, making his own run.
Standing at four over par as he reached the 15th hole, Woods made a
20-foot putt for birdie at No. 15. Then after making par at No. 16,
Woods made a spectacular birdie at No. 17 by chipping in from 30
feet, then capped his charge by making a 30-foot birdie putt at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Now Woods had to wait. O'Meara made a bogey at No. 16 to fall
into a three-way tie for first place with Watts and Woods at one
over par. But O'Meara made a crucial birdie at No. 17, hitting a
9-iron to within 15 feet, then making the pressure putt to go one
stroke ahead of Watts and Woods. Watts answered with a birdie at
No. 17, making an 18-foot putt to tie O'Meara at even par.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Meara made par at No. 18, Woods could not win. Then Watts
made his phenomenal bunker shot at No. 18, but O'Meara was not
fazed. After all, this has been O'Meara's year, and he knew where
he would put his latest trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will go in my trophy cabinet at home,'' said O'Meara.
``I've got a nice spot for it, right next to the Masters
championship trophy.''

FORMER DISHWASHER PLANS AUCTION FOR HIS SOUTH TEXAS SHOWPLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARNES CITY, Texas _ The Veladi Ranch mansion rises like a
lord's castle on these South Texas plains. But the lord has moved
out, and his impressive 30,000-square-foot estate is going on the
auction block Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-story, 34-room mansion will go to the highest bidder. It
will be an absolute auction, meaning that the house, the 240 acres,
the spacious sale barn and auction arena will all be sold
regardless of the price.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no haggling, no offers and counteroffers, no tea
for the local Realtors, no sign in the yard. When the gavel drops,
the sale is done. Bidders must have a $100,000 cashier's check to
qualify. They must be prepared to plop down 10 percent of the
purchase price and will have 30 days to close.
</P>
<P>
   It's clean, quick and simple.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be risky for the seller if the bids are low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there is probably some gamble to it,'' said William
Bone, president of the National Auction Group, the Alabama-based
company handling the sale. ``But people who own mansions like that
like a gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bone said Arturo Torres, the owner of Veladi Ranch, was told he
could sell his property on a nonabsolute basis, meaning he could
withdraw the property from the sale if the bids were too low, but
he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be any fun,'' Bone said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' Veladi Ranch appears almost out of time and place on the
relatively flat and open range southeast of San Antonio. It is an
antebellum-style home, with massive verandas surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   The main level has a foyer with marble floors and a
``double-flying'' staircase that flanks the 60-foot atrium and huge
crystal chandelier. The first level, or ground level, sports a
disco with deco bar and dance floor, a game area and a ballet room.
</P>
<P>
   Studies, parlors, baths and bedrooms fill the top two floors.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's 240 acres are immaculately groomed; the entire
acreage is irrigated. There are a 10-acre spring-fed lake, clay
tennis courts, a mammoth swimming pool, stables, kennels, an exotic
bird aviary, a manager's home and a staff dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fancy place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate Texas showplace ranch,'' Bone said.
``It's got to have cost him $15 million to build. He wanted to live
in it, but he couldn't get his family to settle there, so he
decided he was going to sell it, no matter what it brings. He
thought an auction just looked like fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a Cuban immigrant, came to the United States after the
Bay of Pigs invasion in the early 1960s. He landed in Miami and
with the help of a church organization made his way to Amarillo,
where he worked for a hardware company during the day and a
drive-in theater at night. He eventually took a $1.25-an-hour job
as a dishwasher at a Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, he had a franchise in Del Rio, and
eventually he came to own nearly 250 Pizza Huts and Taco Bells. In
1991, he sold out to PepsiCo for $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   He owns Play-By-Play Toys &AMP; Novelties, a worldwide
multimillion-dollar company that manufactures stuffed toys. He
opened a chain of Veladi Ranch Steak Houses and intended to raise
certified Hereford beef at his ranch to supply the restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Gilda Cisneros, Torres' personal executive assistant, said those
plans faded when Torres, 61, suffered a stroke in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided he wanted to simplify his life,'' she said. ``He
has closed most of his restaurants and is selling off the ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Veladi Ranch, she explained, is named for Torres' three
daughters, using the first two letters of each name _ Ve for
Veronica, La for Laura, and Di for Diane.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Witherspoon, a representative for the National Auction
Group, said the ranch has generated quite a bit of interest in the
Texas market. The company took control of the property after the
July Fourth holiday, and within the first week nearly 50
prospective buyers had toured the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had calls for more than 1,000 brochures,'' he said. ``We
sent out 10,000 to 15,000 brochures prior to that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the national advertising that makes these auctions
appealing, Witherspoon said. Ads are placed in all the essential
national magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Auction Group has handled the sale of the Lloyd
Bentsen ranch in McAllen, the Squaw Mountain ranch in Jacksboro,
and the CF Ranch in Aledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has been our bread and butter for the last 10 years,''
Bone said. ``The absolute auction sales started in Texas, and they
are catching on around the country. Texas is really a wonderful
place, where they literally still have a frontier mentality. People
in Texas don't mind taking a chance. They personify the
entrepreneurial spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, Bone said, isn't worried about the sale outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more excited about what kind of food is going to be
served, what band is playing. He is bringing in friends from Puerto
Rico, Mexico and Miami. He has never expressed any concern over the
money it's going to bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a big going-away party for him. It could
be a chance for someone to get a bargain. We're just going to throw
it open and see what happens. We'll keep going until we have a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres and his family have moved to San Antonio. Bone said he
expects the new ranch owners to be from either the Fort
Worth/Dallas area or Houston. It will probably be a weekend home,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Registration for the auction begins at 1 p.m. Monday. The
auction is at 4. Information is available from the National Auction
Group by calling (800) 473-2292.

NEWARK'S PROPERTY TAXES ARE NEARLY 40 YEARS OUT OF DATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ After four decades without a recalculation of
property values, Newark's property tax system is acknowledged to be
so rife with inequity that almost every property owner in the city
is either paying too much or too little.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials, under pressure from the state and Essex
County to set things straight, are in a bind: A citywide
revaluation, they say, will mean staggering tax increases in
Newark's most stable residential neighborhoods even as the city is
showing its first signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forcing Newark to go ahead with this reassessment as proposed
would have a devastating effect on our residential property owners
and severely hinder the great economic recovery Newark is
experiencing,'' Mayor Sharpe James said last month in testimony
before a panel appointed by Gov. Christie Whitman to consider an
overhaul of New Jersey's property tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the state attorney general's office asked a Superior
Court judge in Essex County to order Newark to comply with state
law requiring property taxes to be based on 100 percent of a
property's ``true value.'' Newark's assessments, on average,
reflect only 16.38 percent of true value, according to state tax
officials.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have asked the judge, Harry Margolis, to throw
out the state's request, citing reports by real estate experts
showing that a revaluation would shift 25 percent of the tax burden
from commercial to residential owners and, in the worst cases,
cause tax bills to double or triple for many of the middle-class
homeowners that Newark so desperately needs to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Newark, which completed its last full revaluation of property in
1961, has managed to fend off demands for an update since the early
1970s. In the decades since then, many state and local governments
have adopted sophisticated technology to monitor real estate prices
so they have the most up-to-date assessments and can guarantee that
taxes accurately reflect property values.
</P>
<P>
   Property values anywhere would be expected to change over 40
years, but Newark's history has been particularly tumultuous since
its last revaluation. The flight of much of the middle class, a
decline of manufacturing, the 1967 racial riots, an influx of
immigrants and now hints of downtown renewal are not reflected in
the city's property records.
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of how much things have changed, consider two
three-story, three-family homes on lots of the exact same size but
on different sides of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The first, with plain gray siding, is in the Ironbound, a solid
neighborhood of working-class immigrants and tidily kept homes. Its
owners, Antonio Matias and his wife, Carmina, paid $108,000 for it
10 years ago and could probably sell it for almost $200,000 today.
But according to city records, its assessed value is just $9,900,
unchanged since the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The second house, with blue-gray shingles and a covered porch,
is on the poorer West Side. There are several vacant lots nearby
and two houses on the block are boarded up. Its owner, Annie
Thorne, paid $40,000 for it last year and would probably get less
than $100,000 if she sold it today. But its assessed value is
$11,200, also unchanged in about 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Thorne paid $2,672.32 in property taxes last year, the
Matiases paid $2,362.14.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are gross inequities throughout the city that need to be
rectified,'' said George Librizzi, the administrator for the Essex
County Tax Board, which has been trying to force Newark to do a
revaluation for 25 years. ``There is no other interest other than
to be fair and equitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Newark's property tax system is so out of kilter, each
year the city faces hundreds of tax appeals, many by commercial
property owners, who are overcharged the most. So many of the
appeals are successful that Newark has often fallen short of the
tax revenues it needs. On several occasions, the city has had to
float bonds to make up the difference, which in some years has been
as much as $15 million.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Newark officials are quick to note that they could pay all their
bills if the owners of tax-exempt property would contribute more.
Almost 70 percent of property in Newark, an astoundingly high
percentage, is tax-exempt because it belongs to the federal or
state governments, to government entities like the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey or to schools, hospitals or religious
groups. These owners do pay the city fees in lieu of taxes, but
city officials contend that the fees are only a fraction of what
the owners would pay if taxes could be levied.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, when the state first sought to force a
revaluation in Newark, city officials fought back, reasoning that
in the wake of the riots, property values had fallen so far that a
revaluation would further encourage the flight of homeowners to the
suburbs and discourage commercial and industrial businesses from
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newark was a very, very different city at that point,'' said
Stephen Adubato, executive director of the North Ward Center, a
nonprofit social-service and educational organization that has been
in Newark for 25 years. ``It was a very troubling time. There was
no hope. There was very little feeling about staying in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Adubato's brother, Michael, a former state assemblyman who died
in 1993, and other state legislators came to Newark's rescue by
passing laws that made revaluation optional for more than 20 years.
The first bill stated that ``such cities are characterized by a
high incidence of buildings and structure in need of
rehabilitation'' and that ``any program for the general revaluation
of real property in such cities at this time can only result in
further deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   But those protections expired in the early 1990s. Since then,
city officials have continued to protest a revaluation while
acknowledging that it is virtually unavoidable, and the city tax
assessor's office has quietly proceeded with a revision of the tax
maps that is a crucial first step toward revaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by academics and consultants, commissioned by the city,
found that two neighborhoods that have blossomed, the Ironbound in
the city's East Ward and Forest Hill in the North Ward, would see
overall increases in property taxes. Residential neighborhoods that
have yet to recover, including Clinton Hill in the South Ward, most
of the Central Ward and most of the city's commercial areas,
including the central business district and the port area, should
see property taxes decline. Only in one residential area,
Weequahic, are taxes likely to remain more or less the same.
</P>
<P>
   One report, by Dickinson &AMP; McCormick, a real estate appraisal
company, found that 25 percent of the property tax burden would
shift from commercial to residential owners, with the Ironbound hit
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Matias, could see the taxes on his three-family
house at 82 Barbara St. more than triple to about $7,000 a year.
For another house that Matias owns in the Ironbound, an investment
property at 173 Oliver St., the jump could be even bigger: from
$858.96 in taxes last year to more than $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of crooks over there,'' Matias said of the city
government. Anger flashed in his eyes as he considered the
possibility of higher taxes. ``If we can't support the house, we'd
give it up or we'd put a match to the house and that's it,'' he
said. ``Where are we going to move? Who is going to buy the house
after that?''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is common among Ironbound residents who feel
that a revaluation would punish them for building a stable
neighborhood. ``They know what the city looked like 30 years ago,
and they know what it looks like now,'' said Matias, who came to
Newark from Lisbon in 1971 and worked for a big meatpacking company
before starting his own contracting business. ``Do they want us to
abandon the houses, too, so it will look like Central Avenue?''
</P>
<P>
   What makes revaluation hard for many people to understand is
that it is not a straight raising or lowering of everyone's tax
bill. The goal of a revaluation is not to change the total amount
of city taxes collected but to rebalance or equalize the tax
burden. What a revaluation changes is how much each property owner
pays in relation to other property owners.
</P>
<P>
   State law does allow a town to phase in major increases in
property taxes over three years. Newark officials would like that
to be five years.

U.S. HOOPSTERS STUNNED BY PUERTO RICO, 84-76 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Already wearing their road uniforms, the U.S.
basketball players felt even less at home Sunday with many of the
8,617 fans at Madison Square Garden waving Puerto Rican flags and
filling the arena with pro-Puerto Rican chants. After losing their
Goodwill Games duel, they felt even worse.
</P>
<P>
   After a torrid first half by U.S. forward Elton Brand, Puerto
Rico figured him out just in time. Brand scored 16 first-half
points, but only eight in the second half, and Puerto Rico rallied
from a 19-point second-half deficit to stun the Americans, 84-76.
It was the first game of the competition for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the comeback was guard Eddie Casiano, who scored 26 of
his game-high 31 points in the second half. It was his two free
throws with 6 minutes 11 seconds left that tied the score at 69-69.
A 3-pointer by forward Javier Colon gave Puerto Rico a lead it
never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Brand's inside play helped offset the crowd early on. His
emphatic dunk gave the United States a 31-19 lead before he topped
his seven-of-nine first-half shooting with a 15-foot baseline
jumper and a tip-in to stake the Americans to a 42-30 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have a lot of experience, and they have a lot of
moves in the post that are very hard to defend,'' Brand, a standout
as a freshman last season at Duke University, said of playing
international competition. ``This is a greater level than what I'm
used to in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was unable to capitalize on its chances in the first
half, shooting 18 free throws, 10 more than the United States shot,
but missing seven of them. It was worse from the floor. Puerto Rico
shot eight of 26 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Puerto Rico was just warming up. The U.S. lead was
55-36 before Puerto Rico made a furious run, outscoring the
Americans by 48-21 over the final 15:07. Puerto Rico never led
until Colon's 3-pointer with 5:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt very at home with the crowd of many Puerto Ricans,''
said center Jose Ortiz of Puerto Rico, a former member of the Utah
Jazz, who finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. ``Usually when
you have the home-court advantage, it plays a great part in one's
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preceding game, guard Shane Heal scored 18 points to lead
Australia to an 84-72 victory over Argentina.

STARR SEEKS TO KNOW WHEN PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS VISITED WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Whitewater independent counsel has subpoenaed
records of White House visits made by President Clinton's private
lawyers, David Kendall and Robert Bennett, a television news
program reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas, first reported Sunday on the CBS News program
``Face the Nation,'' could provide the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, with logs or dates that would allow him to explore whether
other White House aides had attended meetings between the president
and his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   If the sessions included other members of the White House staff,
Starr might be able to argue that those aides were not covered by
lawyer-client privilege and could be called to testify, legal
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor Starr's office would comment on
whether subpoenas had been issued. Starr's spokesman, Charles G.
Bakaly III, said, ``It has never been our intention to pierce the
president's attorney-client privilege with his personal lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, called on Sunday for
Clinton to testify about whether he had a sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and lied about it.
Clinton has denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, truth will set you free,'' Lott, R-Miss., said on ``Fox
News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he did not understand why the administration had tried
to shield the Secret Service agents from being questioned about the
man they are sworn to protect. ``They appear to be hiding
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said, ``It's regrettable
that the majority leader appears to question the integrity of
people who put their lives on the line every day.'' Kennedy said he
would not confirm or deny that Starr has sought records on visits
to the White House by Kendall and Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Clinton's bodyguards testified to a grand jury here
on Friday after the administration lost an emergency bid to the
Supreme Court to keep the agents off the witness stand.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Senior Israeli and Palestinian officials sat down
face-to-face on Sunday for the first time in months, but they
apparently agreed only to talk some more.
</P>
<P>
   After half a year without any contacts and with the entire peace
effort begun in Oslo, Norway, tottering on the edge of collapse.
the meeting between Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Mahmoud
Abbas, a senior Palestinian negotiator better known as Abu Mazen,
took on an air of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was preceded by what Israeli police described as an
abortive car-bombing attempt in the center of Jerusalem. A van
driven by a Palestinian and packed with flammable liquids, gas
canisters and nails caught fire at a major intersection, but did
not explode. No one was injured except the driver, identified as
Jalal Roumaneh, who was severely burned.
</P>
<P>
   He was described as a 30-year-old father of three from a
Palestinian refugee camp in Ramallah, who had been arrested eight
years earlier and spent 20 months in prison as a member of Hamas,
the militant Islamic organization.
</P>
<P>
   The episode seemed to reduce expectations further from the
high-level meeting, which was held in a Tel Aviv hotel. It lasted
three hours, part of it only between Mordechai and Abbas, and part
of it with other negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, both Mordechai and Abbas issued noncommittal
statements, stressing only that they would meet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to focus in coming days on the central issues and
to look for solutions to bridge the gap, with the aim of advancing
the agreement between the two sides,'' Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
   And Abbas said: ``We discussed all outstanding issues. We agreed
to continue to follow up and listen to the ideas, hoping that such
an endeavor will bridge the gap between the two sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was reportedly sought by the Clinton administration,
which, after months of intensive effort, has all but despaired of
wresting from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the decisions
needed to revive the moribund negotiating process. The Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, has essentially agreed to the U.S.
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. proposals are centered on an Israeli withdrawal from a
further 13 percent of the West Bank and Palestinian adherence to
specific security requirements. The dispute is currently said to be
around Netanyahu's requirement that 3 percent of that 13 be given a
new status, with Israel retaining a veto over any Palestinian
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has also demanded that Arafat convene the full
parliament of the Palestine Liberation Organization to draft a new
charter explicitly excluding demands for Israel's destruction, and
that the Palestinian Authority agree to turn over terror suspects
wanted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There was every indication that both Netanyahu and Arafat
accepted the talks reluctantly, and there was considerable
speculation about whether either gave his representative any leeway
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing Sunday, Netanyahu insisted that Mordechai had
a ``full mandate.'' He also said he was willing to open
round-the-clock talks, presumably with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat made no comment. But he has insisted that all he wants to
hear is a ``yes'' or a ``no'' from Israel to the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian Authority minister who was not
present at the talks, dismissed them as a futile exercise. ``I
never expected much from this meeting,'' she said. ``It is clear
that this Israeli government is not interested in progress in the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   With contacts already so strained, both Israel and the
Palestinians seemed to take pains to play down the attempted terror
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see with today's car bomb attempt in Jerusalem why we
are so concerned and preoccupied with having the Palestinians live
up to their obligations to fight terrorism,'' Netanyahu said. But
he added, ``I do not lay responsibility on anyone right now,
because we are checking the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian minister of planning, said, ``What
happened today is something we condemn, something we are doing our
best to prevent.''

U.S. GYMNAST MOCEANU IS OUT TO PROVE HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Eds: See also RUN-GOODWILL-GAMES, BKO-GOODWILL-GAMES)

 By FRANK LITSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ At 10, Dominique Moceanu was the youngest
gymnast ever to make the U.S. junior national team. At 13, she was
the youngest to win the U.S. senior championship. And at 14, when
she was part of the U.S. gold-medal team in the Atlanta Olympics,
she became the youngest athlete ever on a Wheaties box.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, when Goodwill Games gymnastics began before a
slim crowd at the Nassau Coliseum, an older, taller and wiser
Dominique Moceanu took part. She was one of 11 women from seven
nations in the women's all-around. They included Svetlana Khorkina,
the 19-year-old Russian who won the 1996 Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   First, that matter of Moceanu's size. At the Olympics, in a
sport in which smaller is better because the small gymnast can
tumble more quickly, Moceanu was the smallest of the small. The
American-born child of former Romanian gymnasts was 4 feet 5 inches
and weighed maybe 75 pounds after a good meal. In the last 18
months, she has sprouted to 5 feet and 95 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Quick growth like that has ruined careers in such sports as
gymnastics and figure skating because it changes the center of
gravity and thus affects balance. Moceanu survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of problems,'' she said. ``I hurt my knees and my
back. I had trouble getting used to the whole thing. My balance was
a little different, and I had to get used to that. I'm fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   She also seems happy. She trains in Houston with Luminita
Miscenco, a coach from Romania. Next month, she will start her
senior year in high school. And at 16, she is philosophical beyond
her years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics were the biggest thing in my life,'' she said.
``I had a couple of mess-ups there, but I learned from my mistakes.
That's what life teaches you. I think I've matured a lot over the
past year. I'm learning a lot about life. I take things as they
come. I can't look too far ahead. I can't look to my next goal
until I pass this one first.''
</P>
<P>
   Her goal here was a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard the last six months,'' she said. ``People
don't know how much I've put into it. I have a lot I want to prove.
I've improved a lot of things. I'm doing drills I never did before
in my life. I'm working on a new vault, a new bar connection, a new
dismount from the bars, a triple twist on the floor. It's a big
progression for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Olympics, I could have given up and quit. And people
consider me not that good anymore because I haven't done anything
extraordinary since 1996. Like everybody, I had a little downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get to the top, it's harder to stay there,'' Moceanu
continued, ``and when you fall from the top it's harder to come
back. Everybody has their obstacles. You've just got to get up
every day and prove you belong there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu is still a darling of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've made an impact on a lot of people,'' she said.
``People keep sending me good-luck notes on the Internet. It makes
you feel good that people out there are still rooting for you. It's
neat to make an impact on other people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day gymnastics schedule consists of an all-around and
six apparatus events for men, an all-around and four apparatus
events for women, a mixed competition and a final-night exhibition.
There is no team competition. Kendall Beck of San Antonio,
scheduled to compete on the balance beam, withdrew after injuring
her right knee during training in Houston.

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ In the Lagos slum of Makoko, perched on a
lagoon, the water is black with filth. But on Sunday the hymns and
chants of the faithful rose with fervor and the white robes of many
of the Sunday churchgoers glimmered in the putrid breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, offered in many guises, is booming in a desperate
Nigeria, plundered by successive military governments. The pigs
that snuffle amid the garbage in Makoko do so beneath signs for the
Redeemed Church of Christ, the Word of Life Bible Church, the
Foursquare Gospel Church, the Holy Ghost Solution Church and
countless others.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Olayiwola, an immigration official with a monthly salary
of $40, stood in spotless white robes outside the Celestial Church
of Christ, an evangelical church bordered by an open sewer. ``The
churches are springing up because of our suffering,'' he said.
``Without the preachers, there would have been war in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 miles from here, and a world away. in the newly
constructed capital, Abuja, signs abound of where some of the oil
wealth that might have lifted Makoko from its mire has gone.
</P>
<P>
   A sumptuous gold-domed mosque and the four gleaming towers of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Co. dominate Abuja; at two luxury
hotels, the talk is of oil contracts and marble and Jacuzzi sales
for new mansions.
</P>
<P>
   In these hotels and throughout Abuja, the late dictator, Gen.
Sani Abacha, had his agents, businessmen said. There was scarcely a
contract signed, or an agreement reached, before he had taken his
cut. On days when the general who died last month was unreceptive,
business ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country was ever so disastrously centralized,'' said one
executive with a construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, is expected to
make a speech on Monday laying out a program to return Africa's
most populous nation to democracy. The task facing him is enormous:
bridging the abyss between Abuja and Makoko's misery.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is a treacherously divided nation. Gulfs between a
wealthy minority and poor masses are, of course, nothing
exceptional in the developing world. But in this country where
almost one in six Africans live, the divisions are particularly
raw.
</P>
<P>
   They have been worsened by the scale of Nigeria's wealth _ more
than $10 billion is earned annually from oil _ and the scale of the
military misrule that has directed the use of these resources. The
widely held perception that northern Muslims _ particularly the
Hausa and Fulani _ have arrogated that rule and its immense fruits
to themselves has injected the venom of ethnic resentments.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death in detention this month of Moshood Abiola, the
opposition leader from the southern Yoruba people whose apparent
victory in the 1993 presidential election was annulled by a
northern general, anger and suspicion seem to have built to a pitch
that Abubakar will be hard pressed to allay.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, he must convince us that a new period of
public accountability, of checks and balances, and of a fair chance
for everyone from every region, is beginning,'' said Ote Enaibe, an
oil engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The very notion of a fair chance seems grotesquely distant in
Makoko, where a labyrinth of flimsy wooden planks perched on
supports in the lagoon form narrow raised pathways above the
stinking water. Clapboard houses and small improvised churches
nestle against one another at strange angles as they slowly sink
into the bog.
</P>
<P>
   Canoes glide through the shanty town. In some, women sell fish
caught in the lagoon. One boy could be seen on Sunday defecating
into the water, washing himself, and then casting his small net
into the same spot. This community of perhaps 500,000 people has no
sewers, no electricity, no garbage collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power is in the north, the weapons are in the north, and
the money goes to Abuja,'' said Uduma Obasi, 26, as he sat in his
single room in Makoko, perched on wooden posts above the lagoon.
``If there cannot be a shift of power, then we are better off
breaking away.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasi, who makes $30 a month selling rice and other staples and
dreams of becoming a soccer star, is from the Ibo people of the
east. After the Biafran war, in which one million died when the Ibo
sought to secede in 1967, his people no longer want to fight, he
said. Nor, he added, do they want to be downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Another Ibo, a trader named Clement Ubiajulu, said that northern
generals had been able to dominate only because the Yoruba and Ibo
had never been able to unite against them. If the Yoruba now led
the way, he said, the Ibo would follow.
</P>
<P>
   In Abuja, such talk tends to raise a smile. Economic power _ the
oil _ is in the south, officials say, so the political power must
remain in the north. ``The fear of the north, and the fear of
Abiola, was simply that the south might have been able to grab
everything,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Makoko's churches offer what solace they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are seeking God to see what he can do for them to
survive,'' said Steve Orovboni, who has the title of most senior
evangelist at the Celestial Church of Christ. ``For the children of
God there is no poverty so our members do not experience poverty.''

JAPAN'S HOLLOW HOPES FOR A BOLD PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As Washington yearns for a forceful new prime minister
to emerge in Japan and take charge of the economy, history suggests
that is not very likely.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades and centuries, Japan has had good rulers and
bad rulers, but only rarely has it had a strong leader. The last
leader who really reshaped Japan was arguably Ieyasu Tokugawa, who
lived four centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even many Japanese speak wistfully of the need for a bold leader
who could force through measures to revive the economy, end fears
of a Japanese recession setting off a global downturn and restore
the nation's self-confidence. But most also say that is simply not
how this country works.
</P>
<P>
   As the elders of the Liberal Democratic Party bargain furiously
among themselves to choose a new prime minister to replace Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who resigned last Monday after the party's disastrous
performance in parliamentary elections, the leading candidate is
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, a humble, graying man, is widely regarded as an
extremely nice and sincere man who has managed to leave no
fingerprints on his country's policies during 35 years in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is chosen seems likely to be another in the line of
colorless prime ministers who have presided in recent years and
left little impression on the world or their own country. Other
societies around Japan _ China, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, the
Philippines _ have frequently produced vigorous rulers tugging
their people this way or that, but not Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan remains a consensus society,'' said Yoshio Hatano, a
former representative to the United Nations. ``We may have had
strong leaders in the past in some cases _ I can think of a couple
_ but they were not very successful. The consensus makers were
rather more successful as prime ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Hatano was an assistant to postwar Japan's
strongest prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, who governed during most
of the period from 1946 to 1954. But Hatano and others say Yoshida
was an exceptional figure whose authority was possible only in the
special circumstances after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Hatano says, a strong leader like Yoshida would
never rise to prime minister or last long if he did. Forceful
politicians in Japan often irritate voters as well as bureaucrats
and their colleagues, the argument goes, so that in the end they
are unlikely to rise to the top and unlikely to accomplish much if
they do.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have been extremely frustrated with Hashimoto and
his Cabinet for failing to act decisively while Japan tumbled into
a slump that is creating havoc around Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But Hashimoto and his Cabinet were simply doing what Japanese
leaders always do: holding endless meetings and discussing
alternatives and hashing out a course of action that has general
support.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is some evidence that in the Japanese political
culture, that process may be more effective than U.S.style
arm-twisting or grandstanding. While Hashimoto was mocked in the
West for a lack of leadership because he never seemed able to get
anything done, by some accounts his problem was that he was too
much of a leader for Japanese society: he annoyed people and
therefore could not get their cooperation to carry out policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason why Hashimoto was not so liked in the party or
outside it was that he didn't listen enough,'' mused one senior
government official. ``When we went to brief him, he was
argumentative and said things like, `I think you're wrong.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who retains
far-reaching influence, the official added: ``But when we saw
Takeshita, he would say: `Thank you very much. That's so helpful.'
Then the bureaucrats feel satisfied and they give Takeshita full
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, one rare instance when Japanese government officials
acted decisively without worrying about building a consensus was
the announcement in 1966 of a plan to build a new international
airport at Narita, near Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who owned the land were outraged at the government's
failure to consult with them ahead of time, and 32 years later,
after constant battles and huge expenses, the government still has
not been able to pry them from the land and complete the airport's
second runway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few postwar prime ministers other than Yoshida who
was a strong and forceful leader was Yasuhiro Nakasone, who
governed from 1982 to 1987, although his strength was more visible
in his style than in any results he achieved. Nakasone was quite
popular among Americans, but he remains disliked by many Japanese,
who criticize him as pushy, arrogant and self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in recent years one of the most forceful and visionary
politicians has been Ichiro Ozawa, now leader of the Liberal Party.
Ozawa has been widely hailed in the United States as a symbol of a
new breed of Japanese leader. But within Japan he has very little
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be something about the Japanese character that
dislikes explicit displays of power,'' mused Takashi Oka, a former
aide to Ozawa who is now writing a book about the travails of the
reform movement in Japan. ``You don't have real political
leadership here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the same thing is true of modern Japanese history. In the
late 16th century there were several strong leaders, the last of
whom, Ieyasu, established the Tokugawa shogunate.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, even when Japan has undergone revolutionary
change, there has been no single person leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   The modernization of Japan a century ago was a result of the
efforts of many people. Likewise, while Americans often blame
Hideki Tojo, the wartime prime minister, for Japanese militarism,
Tojo was far less powerful than Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin or
Hitler, and in fact he was dismissed in 1944 after just two and a
half years as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar period, one reason for the lack of strong leaders
may simply have been that politics has not mattered so much.
Economic policy was largely left to bureaucrats, and in foreign and
defense policy Tokyo deferred to Washington, so politicians busied
themselves less with policy than with arranging pork barrel
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The natural place for politicians to develop their leadership
skills in a parliamentary system is the Cabinet. But in Japan,
Cabinet ministers are mostly rubber stamps who are not really
expected to do anything but back up the ministry's bureaucrats in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than prime ministers, the Cabinet members are
figureheads whose only preparation is years of political
machinations building seniority in Parliament. That leaves them
unprepared to take charge of their ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly hard for them to manage the job they are
given,'' said Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister who is
unusual in that he has unquestioned expertise in economic issues.
``Their basic knowledge is inadequate, I would say, to carry out
day-to-day duties as Cabinet ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of this system, said Hirona Seki, a historian of
ideas and a prolific author, is that Japan has an understanding of
political power and division of spoils, but no concept of a
politician as a moral leader.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politicians can hardly debate a topic without discussing it
in terms of moral right or wrong, and historically even arguments
over segregation or war or the gold standard have tended to be
couched in moral terms, sometimes with each side invoking God's
support against the other.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly a contrast with Japan, where mainstream
politicians mostly describe policies as wise or foolish but not as
moral or immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moral leadership is a very hard thing for Japan to
understand,'' Seki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan we don't have this religious tradition,'' he added,
arguing that Western concepts of leadership are rooted in a
Judeo-Christian tradition of not just adopting the best policy but
also of doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to establish political leadership, we must learn a
new tradition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese also argue that although their system is
perilously slow in reaching decisions during a crisis, it is very
rapid in carrying out decisions. They say that by the time the
decision is reached, a consensus has been formed and everyone is
wholeheartedly behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems to be a growing feeling that Japan needs
stronger leaders who devote more efforts to communicating with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese prime minister should be a better communicator to
the public and to the world, as your presidents usually are,'' said
Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a prominent Liberal Democratic member of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the emphasis on cooperation and the distaste for
strong leadership, many Japanese turn to pop psychology. Some say
that in contrast to Western countries rooted in a tradition of
hunting, Japan has always been a rice-growing nation of farmers
working together, so that forcefulness is looked down on.
</P>
<P>
   That image is not very convincing to Asian countries that were
invaded by gun-toting Japanese rice farmers during World War II.
But it is deeply felt in Japan, and it is true that Japanese
society is almost obsessed with harmony.

   Tyson's license was revoked by Nevada after he chewed off a
portion of Evander Holyfield's ear during a bout last year. He was
told he could apply for reinstatement after one year.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was expected to submit an application to Nevada officials
this month and his chances of reinstatement seemed to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that athletic commissions honor one
another's actions. And rightfully so: If the only theoretically
credible bodies that oversee the sport don't work in unison, chaos
will reign.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability goes out the window if a boxer is suspended or
disciplined in one state and simply fights in another state. The
commissions must stand by one another if there is to be order in
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Defending their position, New Jersey officials reportedly said
they aren't bound by the law because it applies to suspended
licenses, not those that are revoked.
</P>
<P>
   How convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible the money New Jersey or individual parties stand
to make if Tyson resumes his career there is the inspiration for
that interpretation?
</P>
<P>
   For the good of the sport and New Jersey's credibility, its duty
is obvious: reject Tyson's application and let Nevada handle it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the state in which Tyson's transgression took place. It's
the place where he should try to put his career back together.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as far as Tyson goes, this could turn out to be a major
blunder if indeed he wants to resume his career.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that New Jersey does the appropriate thing, Tyson would
have to come back to Nevada and face a commission panel that will
not have taken kindly to his decision to go to the East Coast. It
certainly wouldn't help his chances.
</P>
<P>
   And if he is rejected by Nevada, he would have to fight in a
state without a commission or outside the country, turning him into
more of a pariah than he already is.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy Oscar: Oscar De La Hoya was able to draw 50,000-plus
fans to a stadium in El Paso. However, he still has work to do in
his own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was booed and jeered by the rabid fans of Julio Cesar
Chavez when he spoke last week at a press conference at Olvera
Street to promote their Sept. 18 bout in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He was so flustered by it that he forgot to translate his
comments into English, as he normally does. The indignant
expression on his face was evidence of his anger, especially when
the two posed together for photos. And he didn't hide his feelings
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people doing that were drunk Mexicans,'' De La Hoya
said. He repeated the comment later in the same interview.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said he is angry with Chavez because the great
Mexican fighter failed to give him his due after their first
meeting, won by De La Hoya on a fourth-round technical knockout in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   And, obviously, he doesn't think much of his one-time role model
in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``After some of things he's done, I don't see why people like
him so much,'' said De La Hoya, referring to Chavez's personal
problems. ``It's very sad to know a fighter you once idolized isn't
the person you thought he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout De La Hoya's abbreviated speech, Chavez only smiled.
He had to find gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he smiled again and played the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has his fans, I have mine,'' he said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez certainly has his fans. They have undying love for their
hero, even at 36.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 500 fans at the press conference, the majority
supported Chavez, who has given them so many thrills over his
18-year career. In an informal survey, many who apparently are
blind to reality said they believe Chavez will win.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they're not crazy about De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, the autograph-seeking fans who pressed up against a
gazebo that served as a stage yelled out such remarks as: ``He's
not humble,'' ``he's a sell-out,'' ``he doesn't fight good
opponents,'' ``he forget where he came from'' along with crude,
unprintable remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Is De La Hoya simply going to have to accept such vicious
commentary? Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening mainly because he's fighting Chavez,'' said
Mexican-American Lionel Yanec of Los Angeles. ``When Chavez
retires, in time, these people will be cheering for De La Hoya.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: The much-anticipated Genaro Hernandez-Floyd
Mayweather bout is all but set for Oct. 3 at the Hilton in Las
Vegas. Mayweather might be in over his head. At the same time, it's
nice to see a fighter take a chance for a change....
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me but I can't muster an ounce of enthusiasm for the
George Foreman-Larry Holmes fight. Apparently, many people agree.
In a poll in Rich Marotta's latest column on the KFI640 web site,
65 percent said they wouldn't buy the pay-per-view fight. Foreman
and Holmes will be a combined 99 years old when they meet in
January. Let's hope the fight doesn't come off....
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bit absurd that Fernando Vargas of Oxnard has been
elevated to the No.1 spot in the IBF junior middleweight rankings
at 20 and after only 13 fights (all knockout victories). Then
again, there might be no one in his weight class who can beat him.
Vargas could end up challenging for Yory Boy Campas' title by early
next year....
</P>
<P>
   Five Californians will be taking part in the Goodwill Games
boxing competition between Friday and Aug. 2. They are Miguel
Espino of North Hollywood (147 pounds), Jose Navarro of Los Angeles
(106), Jose Santa Cruz of Monterey Park (119), Sergio De La Torre
(132) and Larry Mosley (147), the cousin of professional sensation
Shane Mosley and perhaps the best American amateur. Espino, 18, won
the gold medal at the 1996 Junior Olympics and finished third in
the 1998 U.S. Championships and second in the 1998 U.S. Challenge.

COMMENTARY: A TURN IN THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UMBERTIDE, Italy _ When the Rome conference agreed on a charter
for an international criminal court, after a month of tense debate,
attention focused on the compromises and the politics. But what
happened in Rome last week was more important than the details. I
think it will be seen as a turn in the road of history.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming number of countries in the world embraced the
principle that government leaders and their agents are to be
personally accountable, at law, when they commit genocide or crimes
against humanity. A permanent court will judge them.
</P>
<P>
   The need for such a court in our age was movingly explained
earlier this year by David Scheffer, the ambassador who led the
U.S. delegation at the Rome conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world following the Cold War,'' Scheffer said,
``where mass killings, mass rapes and other atrocities are
occurring with shocking frequency. The rule of law, which the
United States has always championed, is at risk again of being
trampled by war criminals whose only allegiance is to their own
pursuit of power.''
</P>
<P>
   One cannot read those words now without a sense irony and
regret. For the great disappointment at the Rome conference was the
performance of the United States. It fought to weaken the court,
using hard-boiled tactics to try to bring American allies around to
that position.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the United States insisted on a vote _ and was
humiliated. The vote was 120 to 7 for the treaty without further
amendment. America was in the company, on the losing side, of Iraq,
Libya, Qatar, Yemen, China and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been a staunch supporter of the ad hoc war
crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda _ a tribunal
that is increasingly effective. How, then, did it end up in Rome in
a tiny negative minority?
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer argued that, as a superpower with forces around the
world, the United States might become the target of political
prosecutions. If the court had existed during the Persian Gulf war,
for example, Iraq might have called for prosecution of American
soldiers there.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is fair enough. But the treaty as drafted goes very
far to meet it. No case can be brought in the international court
if there has been a genuine investigation and consideration of
domestic prosecution by the country of the suspect's nationality.
There are numerous procedural steps to delay or halt prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insisted that prosecution of a citizen of a
state that has not signed and ratified the treaty be barred unless
it consented. But others thought that would weaken the court's
legitimacy. It would have prevented the prosecution of Saddam
Hussein for war crimes his forces committed in Kuwait _ unless he
consented.
</P>
<P>
   It was puzzling that the United States so misjudged the mood _
the commitment _ of its friends. Countries that have suffered from
tyranny, among them Germany and Argentina and South Africa, spoke
with special authority for a strong court. Canada and Britain
played key roles.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason for the U.S. position may have been Sen. Jesse
Helms, who said any treaty exposing Americans even theoretically to
such a court would be ``dead on arrival'' in the Senate. Perhaps
so. But a president with vision, and with a backbone, would not
have let that undo America's championship of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had a great opportunity. His delegation won
significant protections against frivolous prosecutions. He could
have embraced the outcome in Rome as a victory for American
principles _ and then, if the Senate said no, waited for time to
bring us in. After all, it took 40 years for the Senate to ratify
the convention against genocide.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, American ideals were represented in Rome by such
non-governmental organizations as the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights and Human Rights Watch, whose arguments helped give the
delegates the strength to stand up for a real court. Their
spokesmen were sad that the voice of the United States was so
muted.
</P>
<P>
   American participation will be missed by the new court, which
will take form after 60 countries ratify the treaty. But there is
enough support from substantial countries to make it work. To be a
real deterrent to barbarity, the court will need years to establish
itself. But so did the American constitutional system.

   SOUTHPORT, England _ A handful of golfers left Sunday's British
Open dealing with deep disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who finished one stroke out of a playoff in third
place, might have won if he had putted better. On Saturday, Woods
missed six putts from 8 feet or less. But he tried to look at the
positive side of his best showing at a major this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could beat yourself up forever,'' said Woods, who had
shared the first-round lead with a 65. ``You have to look at the
positive, the fact I started good, finished good, and I hit a lot
of good shots this week. Most importantly, I came back today and
birdied three of the last four holes to give myself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk, who finished tied for fourth place at 2 over par
(282), did not try to hide his dejection. In the last six majors,
Furyk has five top-six finishes without a victory. And since the
start of 1997, Furyk has 22 top-10 finishes, more than anyone in
the world, but he has not won since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Furyk barely missed putts at Nos. 15, 16 and 17 that
denied him a potential victory. ``The putts at 15 and 16, I
couldn't have hit an inch better,'' he said. ``I thought I had made
them both, and I lipped them both out. There is nothing you can do
about that. I played well today. I guarantee I played as well as
anyone, and I feel like the worst I should have been was even par
for the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, who also finished tied for fourth, had to deal
with his third close call at the British Open. Parnevik finished
second in 1994 and tied for second last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to win this event once, but it seems
impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Turning Pro
</P>
<P>
   Justin Rose, the 17-year-old amateur from England who tied for
fourth, confirmed that he would turn professional this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole week has been really special for me,'' said Rose,
who will play in the Dutch Open next weekend. ``I was put at ease
by the crowd, the incredible support.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood Battle
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods are close friends and neighbors
near Orlando, Fla., and winning another major gave O'Meara a chance
to tease Woods. O'Meara said he would let Woods sip from the claret
jug, the trophy given to the British Open winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tiger wants a sip, he's more than welcome, because I
imagine his name will be on this trophy someday, too,'' O'Meara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he wanted strokes from O'Meara the next time they
play. ``No shots for Tiger,'' O'Meara said. ``Not when he hits it
60 by me on every hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods used O'Meara's backup putter this week. ``I finished
first, he finished one shot off,'' O'Meara said. ``That's why it's
the backup.''

   FLINT, Mich. _ Few cities are as lastingly seared by a single
event as Flint was by the sit-down strikes in early 1937, a violent
showdown between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
that led to the union's first contract to represent the workers of
a major automaker.
</P>
<P>
   People still remember whether their parents and grandparents
sided with labor or management when thousands of auto workers
seized GM factories here, sitting on the floors after wielding
20-inch wooden clubs to drive off the police.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's request, a state judge, Paul Gadola, ordered
the strikers evicted, and the National Guard was deployed. The
occupation of the factories ended quietly nine days later when the
governor, Frank Murphy, mediated a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Flint is again the site of a showdown between GM and the UAW, as
a 45-day strike at two auto-parts factories has crippled the
world's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1937, the company has sued the union in
a bid to end a major strike. And in a remarkable coincidence that
is the talk of the town, the federal judge assigned to the case is
Paul Gadola Jr., the son of the state judge who ordered the
evictions 61 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leafing through yellowed family scrapbooks in his office, Gadola
Jr., who will turn 69 on Tuesday, recalls the strike vividly.
Because of threats against the family by union sympathizers, he
rode in a police car to and from school, and an officer stood
outside his classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Gadola Jr. said he had spent his life looking up to his father,
who died in 1968. ``I believe in the independence of the judiciary,
and that's what my father upheld,'' said the judge, who has a
foot-high, framed photograph of his father on the wall near his
desk, and two other photos of his father in the reception area. ``I
have so much admiration; he was a wonderful role model. He was a
giant as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadola Sr.'s eviction decision was based on GM's ownership of
the factories. But the UAW for years criticized the decision and
Gadola Sr.'s conduct after the strike _ as an elected judge and a
Republican, he traveled around the state giving speeches condemning
Murphy, a Democrat, for mediating a settlement instead of ordering
the National Guard to storm the factories immediately and remove
the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   His son's handling of the current litigation has been gentler.
Asked by GM in a lawsuit filed last Tuesday to order the union into
immediate arbitration, Gadola Jr. declined. Instead, he presided
over a hearing Wednesday at which UAW lawyers acknowledged that the
company was entitled to arbitration under its national agreement
with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Gadola Jr. asked both sides to report back to him on Tuesday on
their progress in scheduling arbitration; the two sides announced
late Friday that arbitration would begin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials declined to discuss Gadola Jr., but a prominent
Democratic lawyer who has tried cases before the father and the son
said that the son seemed more temperate. Gadola Sr. ``did what the
law made him do, but he could have showed more compassion'' in
1937, said Jerome O'Rourke, a former county prosecutor whose father
was the union leader served with the judge's eviction notice that
year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gadola Jr.'s choice of persuasion to start the
arbitration process, rather than an injunction, ``was an objective,
fair, understanding ruling,'' said O'Rourke, who defeated the
younger Gadola in a 1956 race for county prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   GM has also asked for a court order to end the current strikes
and for financial penalties against the union if the arbitrator
finds that the strikes represent an illegal walkout in violation of
the company's national agreement with the UAW. In an interview on
Friday, Gadola Jr. said that he had only reviewed the legal issues
of arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also said that he was a strong opponent of
judicial activism, and that he was reluctant to play a direct role
in the collective bargaining between GM and the union. ``The merits
of this dispute are not for me to decide,'' he said. ``They're for
an arbitrator to decide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The coincidence of a father and son handling similar cases is
even more unusual here because the federal courthouse in Flint
shares a docket with federal district courthouses in three other
southeastern Michigan cities: Detroit, Ann Arbor and Port Huron.
</P>
<P>
   Gadola Jr. said that as with any other case, the GM lawsuit was
assigned when a clerk in Detroit shuffled a stack of index cards
bearing the names of the 12 judges and five senior judges of the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The clerk
drew the card with Gadola Jr.'s name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this case strictly by happenstance, not because I'm the
federal judge who sits here in Flint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gadola Jr. was appointed in 1988 by President Reagan, whose
Michigan campaigns he had led in 1980 and 1984. But he won
confirmation from a Democratic Senate on his record as a campaigner
for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Working free of charge for the American Civil Liberties Union,
he represented mostly black protesters here in the 1960s. They
wanted to hold an all-night rally on the City Hall lawn in support
of a local ballot measure to bar racial discrimination by
real-estate brokers and landlords. He won the case, and the measure
passed by 12 votes out of close to 60,000 that were cast, Gadola
Jr. recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's enthusiasm for civil rights grew out of the
persecution that his own family had suffered as Roman Catholics
early in the century, when the Ku Klux Klan and a similar group
known as the Black Legion were powerful here. Gadola Jr. said his
father had been denied a job in the Flint city attorney's office in
the 1920s because of his religion, and his mother had been turned
down for a bank job for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   His father broke the Black Legion in the county during the late
1930s. He named himself as a one-person grand jury, and then
investigated and indicted the group's leaders, many of whom went to
prison, The Flint Journal reported in his obituary.
</P>
<P>
   That case and others made Gadola Sr. a hero in the city's
Italian-American community. Despite opposition from the UAW, he won
re-election as a state judge here every six years until he retired
in 1960.

COMMENTARY` TEAM B VS. CIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imagine you are the next U.S. president and this
crisis arises:
</P>
<P>
   The starving army of North Korea launches an attack on South
Korea, imperiling our 30,000 troops. You threaten massive air
assault; Pyongyang counterthreatens to put a nuclear missile into
Hawaii. You say that would cause you to obliterate North Korea; its
undeterred leaders dare you to make the trade. Decide.
</P>
<P>
   Or this crisis: Saddam Hussein invades Saudi Arabia. You warn of
Desert Storm II; he says he has a weapon of mass destruction on a
ship near the United States and is ready to sacrifice Baghdad if
you are ready to lose New York. Decide.
</P>
<P>
   Or this: China, not now a rogue state, goes into an internal
convulsion and an irrational warlord attacks Taiwan. You threaten
to intervene; within 10 minutes, ICBM's are targeted on all major
U.S. cities. Decide.
</P>
<P>
   Before you do, remember this: in 1998, the CIA told your
predecessor that it was highly unlikely that any rogue state
``except possibly North Korea'' would have a nuclear weapon capable
of hitting any of the ``contiguous 48 states'' within 10 to 12
years. (That's some exception; apparently our strategic assessors
are untroubled at the prospect of losing Pearl Harbor again.)
</P>
<P>
   You have no missile defense in place. The CIA assured your
predecessor you would have five years' warning about other nations'
weapons development before you would have to deploy a missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the CIA record of prediction is poor. President Bush was
assured that Saddam would have no nuclear capability for the next
10 years; when we went in after he invaded Kuwait, however, we
discovered Iraq to be less than a year away. And India, despite our
expensive satellite surveillance, surprised us with its recent
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Congress decided to get a second opinion about
our vulnerability. Donald Rumsfeld, a former defense secretary, was
named to lead a bipartisan Commission to Assess the Ballistic
Threat to the United States. Its nine members are former high
government officials, military officers and scientists of
unassailable credibility. Cleared for every national secret, these
men with command experience had the advantage denied to
compartmented CIA analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The unclassified summary of this ``Team B's'' 300-page report
was released last week and is a shocker. The direct threat to our
population, it concluded, ``is broader, more mature and evolving
more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the
intelligence community.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Iran and other terrorist states capable of
producing a nuclear-tipped missile within five years of ordering it
up; they are capable of skipping the testing and fine-tuning we
have depended on as our cushion to get defenses up. That means, the
commission concluded, the warning time the United States will have
to develop and deploy a missile defense is near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Let's set aside our preoccupation with executive privileges and
hospital lawsuits long enough to consider the consequences of Team
B's judgment. The United States no longer has the luxury of several
years to put up a missile defense, as we complacently believed. If
we do not decide now to deploy a rudimentary shield, we run the
risk of Iran or North Korea or Libya building or buying the weapon
that will enable it to get the drop on us.
</P>
<P>
   Rumsfeld's commission was charged only with assessing the new
threat and not about what we should do to meet the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Nine serious men concluded unanimously that our intelligence
agencies, on which we spend $27 billion a year, are egregiously
misleading us. Smiling wanly, the director of central intelligence,
George Tenet, responded that ``we need to keep challenging our
assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong; we need to defend ourselves from the likely prospect of
surprise nuclear blackmail. A first step is Aegis, a naval theater
defense (named after the goatskin shield of Zeus). But that
requires this president to redefine a 1972 treaty with the Soviets
that he thinks requires us to remain forever naked to all our
potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is not likely to occur as Clinton's sands run out.
His successor will be the one to pay _ in the coin of diplomatic
paralysis caused by unconscionable unpreparedness _ for this
president's failure to heed Team B's timely warning in 1998.

NEWARK'S PROPERTY TAXES ARE NEARLY 40 YEARS OUT OF DATE

   NEWARK, N.J. _ After four decades without a recalculation of
property values, Newark's property tax system is acknowledged to be
so rife with inequity that almost every property owner in the city
is either paying too much or too little.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials, under pressure from the state and Essex
County to set things straight, are in a bind: A citywide
revaluation, they say, will mean staggering tax increases in
Newark's most stable residential neighborhoods even as the city is
showing its first signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forcing Newark to go ahead with this reassessment as proposed
would have a devastating effect on our residential property owners
and severely hinder the great economic recovery Newark is
experiencing,'' Mayor Sharpe James said last month in testimony
before a panel appointed by Gov. Christie Whitman to consider an
overhaul of New Jersey's property tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Property values anywhere would be expected to change over 40
years, but Newark's history has been particularly tumultuous since
its last revaluation. The flight of much of the middle class, a
decline of manufacturing, the 1967 racial riots, an influx of
immigrants and now hints of downtown renewal are not reflected in
the city's property records.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the state attorney general's office asked a Superior
Court judge in Essex County to order Newark to comply with state
law requiring property taxes to be based on 100 percent of a
property's ``true value.'' Newark's assessments, on average,
reflect only 16.38 percent of true value, according to state tax
officials.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have asked the judge, Harry Margolis, to throw
out the state's request, citing reports by real estate experts
showing that a revaluation would shift 25 percent of the tax burden
from commercial to residential owners and, in the worst cases,
cause tax bills to double or triple for many of the middle-class
homeowners that Newark so desperately needs to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Newark, which completed its last full revaluation of property in
1961, has managed to fend off demands for an update since the early
1970s. In the decades since then, many state and local governments
have adopted sophisticated technology to monitor real estate prices
so they have the most up-to-date assessments and can guarantee that
taxes accurately reflect property values.
</P>
<P>
   Newark, which completed its last full revaluation of property in
1961, has managed to fend off demands for an update since the early
1970s. It has now gone longer than any other city in New Jersey _
and apparently the country _ without updating its assessments. At
the same time, many state and local governments have adopted
sophisticated technology to monitor real estate prices so they have
the most up-to-date assessments and can guarantee that taxes
accurately reflect property values.
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of how much things have changed, consider two
three-story, three-family homes on lots of the exact same size but
on different sides of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The first, with plain gray siding, is in the Ironbound, a solid
neighborhood of working-class immigrants and tidily kept homes. Its
owners, Antonio Matias and his wife, Carmina, paid $108,000 for it
10 years ago and could probably sell it for almost $200,000 today.
But according to city records, its assessed value is just $9,900,
unchanged since the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The second house, with blue-gray shingles and a covered porch,
is on the poorer West Side. There are several vacant lots nearby
and two houses on the block are boarded up. Its owner, Annie
Thorne, paid $40,000 for it last year and would probably get less
than $100,000 if she sold it today. But its assessed value is
$11,200, also unchanged in about 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Thorne paid $2,672.32 in property taxes last year, the
Matiases paid $2,362.14.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are gross inequities throughout the city that need to be
rectified,'' said George Librizzi, the administrator for the Essex
County Tax Board, which has been trying to force Newark to do a
revaluation for 25 years. ``There is no other interest other than
to be fair and equitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Newark's property tax system is so out of kilter, each
year the city faces hundreds of tax appeals, many by commercial
property owners, who are overcharged the most. So many of the
appeals are successful that Newark has often fallen short of the
tax revenues it needs. On several occasions, the city has had to
float bonds to make up the difference, which in some years has been
as much as $15 million.

<P>
   Newark officials are quick to note that they could pay all their
bills if the owners of tax-exempt property would contribute more.
Almost 70 percent of property in Newark, an astoundingly high
percentage, is tax-exempt because it belongs to the federal or
state governments, to government entities like the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey or to schools, hospitals or religious
groups. These owners do pay the city fees in lieu of taxes, but
city officials contend that the fees are only a fraction of what
the owners would pay if taxes could be levied.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, when the state first sought to force a
revaluation in Newark, city officials fought back, reasoning that
in the wake of the riots, property values had fallen so far that a
revaluation would further encourage the flight of homeowners to the
suburbs and discourage commercial and industrial businesses from
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newark was a very, very different city at that point,'' said
Stephen Adubato, executive director of the North Ward Center, a
nonprofit social-service and educational organization that has been
in Newark for 25 years. ``It was a very troubling time. There was
no hope. There was very little feeling about staying in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Adubato's brother, Michael, a former state assemblyman who died
in 1993, and other state legislators came to Newark's rescue by
passing laws that made revaluation optional for more than 20 years.
The first bill stated that ``such cities are characterized by a
high incidence of buildings and structure in need of
rehabilitation'' and that ``any program for the general revaluation
of real property in such cities at this time can only result in
further deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   But those protections expired in the early 1990s. Since then,
city officials have continued to protest a revaluation while
acknowledging that it is virtually unavoidable, and the city tax
assessor's office has quietly proceeded with a revision of the tax
maps that is a crucial first step toward revaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by academics and consultants, commissioned by the city,
found that two neighborhoods that have blossomed, the Ironbound in
the city's East Ward and Forest Hill in the North Ward, would see
overall increases in property taxes. Residential neighborhoods that
have yet to recover, including Clinton Hill in the South Ward, most
of the Central Ward and most of the city's commercial areas,
including the central business district and the port area, should
see property taxes decline. Only in one residential area,
Weequahic, are taxes likely to remain more or less the same.
</P>
<P>
   One report, by Dickinson &AMP; McCormick, a real estate appraisal
company, found that 25 percent of the property tax burden would
shift from commercial to residential owners, with the Ironbound hit
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Matias, could see the taxes on his three-family
house at 82 Barbara St. more than triple to about $7,000 a year.
For another house that Matias owns in the Ironbound, an investment
property at 173 Oliver St., the jump could be even bigger: from
$858.96 in taxes last year to more than $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of crooks over there,'' Matias said of the city
government. Anger flashed in his eyes as he considered the
possibility of higher taxes. ``If we can't support the house, we'd
give it up or we'd put a match to the house and that's it,'' he
said. ``Where are we going to move? Who is going to buy the house
after that?''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is common among Ironbound residents who feel
that a revaluation would punish them for building a stable
neighborhood. ``They know what the city looked like 30 years ago,
and they know what it looks like now,'' said Matias, who came to
Newark from Lisbon in 1971 and worked for a big meatpacking company
before starting his own contracting business. ``Do they want us to
abandon the houses, too, so it will look like Central Avenue?''
</P>
<P>
   What makes revaluation hard for many people to understand is
that it is not a straight raising or lowering of everyone's tax
bill. The goal of a revaluation is not to change the total amount
of city taxes collected but to rebalance or equalize the tax
burden. What a revaluation changes is how much each property owner
pays in relation to other property owners.
</P>
<P>
   State law does allow a town to phase in major increases in
property taxes over three years. Newark officials would like that
to be five years.

SATURN WORKERS VOTE TO AUTHORIZE STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Workers at General Motors Corp.'s giant Saturn
factory, which was once a model of cooperation between labor and
management, voted overwhelmingly Sunday to authorize their leaders
to call a strike to protest GM's moves this spring to buy more auto
parts from outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The strike authorization, which carried with 95 percent of the
vote, was the latest sign of the worker dissatisfaction that has
swept the world's largest automaker since workers went on strike at
two parts factories here seven weeks ago. The Saturn factory in
Spring Hill, Tenn., is the only GM assembly plant in the United
States still producing vehicles; other factories have been forced
to close for lack of parts.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's strike vote, the first in Saturn's 12 years of
operations, authorizes leaders of the United Auto Workers union to
call a strike, but it does not require them to do so. Joseph
Rypkowski, the local union president, said talks would soon be held
with GM officials. Company officials had no immediate reaction.

THREATS REPORTED IN INDONESIA RAPE INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Human rights workers who are investigating
scores of organized gang rapes during three days of rioting here in
May say they and the victims have been receiving threats from
unidentified men.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the investigators said they had confirmed the
rapes of 168 women during the riots, of whom 20 had died during or
after the assaults. They said they presumed that many other women
had either fled the city or were too traumatized to report their
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims have been cowed into silence by threats or by
rumors of another round of attacks and rapes, the investigators
said. Others have committed suicide. And they said they had heard
reports of additional rapes and sexual assaults in the weeks after
the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks, like most of the looting and arson, were
directed against the ethnic Chinese minority, which often becomes a
scapegoat in times of conflict or hardship in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights workers said their continuing investigation had
reinforced their belief that the rapes, some of them involving
girls as young as 9, had been organized and coordinated in the same
way as much of the looting and arson.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,200 lives were lost in Jakarta in the May 13-15 riots
that helped end President Suharto's 32-year rule on May 21, and
thousands of buildings were burned or badly damaged. Most of those
who died were looters trapped inside large department stores that
were set on fire by arsonists.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of reports from witnesses has confirmed that many
of the attacks on property and residents, including the rapes, were
instigated or carried out by organized groups of up to a dozen men.
These groups traveled the city in vehicles, inciting crowds to
violence, according to reports released by the government's
National Commission for Human Rights and the Jakarta Social
Institute, a private Catholic charity that is investigating the
riots.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion has fallen on the military or other security forces,
particularly after the military acknowledged last week that members
of its special forces had been involved in kidnappings of
opposition activists in the weeks before the riots.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, about 100 women demonstrated outside the Defense
Ministry, demanding that the military take responsibility for the
rapes. They displayed a poster depicting troops sexually assaulting
women and held up a banner that read, ``Indonesia! Republic of
Fear, Republic of Terror, Republic of Rape!''
</P>
<P>
   The threats against workers at women's crisis centers and
against some victims who have called the centers' hot lines also
indicate the involvement of people able to monitor their activities
and listen to their telephone conversations, said Ita Nadia, an
organizer of Volunteers for Humanity, a private aid group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received telephone calls and anonymous letters
terrorizing our workers,'' she said. ``They say they will rape the
females and castrate the males.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sandyawan Sumardi, who heads the private Jakarta Social
Institute, said he had also received threats. In addition, he said,
threats have been made against witnesses, family members and
hospital workers who treated the victims.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Photographs purporting to show the victims of the rapes have
been circulating, some of them on the Internet. Ms. Ita said she
believed that these were not in fact photographs of riot victims
and that they were intended to sow fear.
</P>
<P>
   Because of fears that security forces were involved, victims
have avoided reporting the rapes to police, said Kamala
Chandrakirana, a spokeswoman for Ms. Ita's group, which now employs
as many as 300 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   At first the government seemed to doubt the growing reports of
rapes, but after meeting with 25 representatives of women's groups
earlier this month, President B.J. Habibie set up a government task
force to study their reports and issued a statement condemning
``this inhuman episode in the history of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He named his wife, Dr. Hasri Ainun Besari, who is a physician,
to be an adviser to the task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was saying, `I don't want this case to be blown up
and give a bad name to the Indonesian people,''' Ms. Kamala said.
``He was not clear on it at first. He was rambling about how bad
the economy was going to be unless he saved it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he heard the women out, Ms. Kamala said, his face took on
a look of shock and he asked them to draft a statement for him on
his office computer. ``On behalf of the government and the nation,
I condemn the simultaneous acts of violence during the riots,
including the violence perpetrated against women,'' the statement
read.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents reported by the investigators is the case of
a 9-year-old girl who was gang raped and mutilated and who later
died in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another case involved a woman and her 12-year-old daughter who
were raped side by side in their home by a group of men. When the
woman's husband tried to intervene, she said, the attackers hanged
him.

 &HT;    O'Meara major general
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Yes, Mark O'Meara can win a major. After
Sunday, that bears repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara can win another major.
</P>
<P>
   In less than four months, O'Meara has gone from someone who
couldn't win a major to joining an exclusive group that includes
the likes of Nicklaus, Watson, Trevino, Player, Palmer, Hogan and
Snead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's two-shot playoff victory over Brian Watts in the 127th
British Open at Royal Birkdale, after they both finished at
even-par 280, enabled O'Meara to become just the 12th player since
the birth of the Masters in 1934 to win two majors in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't put myself in their class,'' O'Meara said.
``They're great players who have won a lot of great championships
and have been incredible am- bassadors for the game. Me, I consider
myself a consistent player who more times than not can finish the
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who took 57 tries in majors before he finally broke
through at this year's Masters, just happened to be a late bloomer.
At 41, he's the oldest player to achieve a double-major year.
</P>
<P>
   And, with apologies to Augusta National, he says the Auld Claret
Jug he'll be taking to his Orlando home today after his 16th career
PGA Tour victory means more than the green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredibly gratifying to know my name is on this trophy
right here,'' he said. ``I want to savor this victory more than
what happened at Augusta National, because this tournament is all
about the history of the game. Links courses are where golf
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his victory in the Masters, when he didn't lead alone until
he birdied the final hole, O'Meara's British tri- umph wasn't
assured until late in the proceedings. And no less than seven
players had a chance at winning, in- cluding Tiger Woods (66_ 281,
whose two closing bird- ies left him a shot back.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara took advantage of calmer conditions Sunday to shoot a
two-under 68 and make up a two-shot deficit to Watts. He then had
to wait to see if Watts could save par from a downhill lie in a
green-H side bunker on the 18th. After Watts almost holed the shot,
they headed for the British Open's first fourhole playoff since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   For Watts, an American who has won 11 tournaments in Japan after
he lost his Tour card in 1992, just making it to the playoff could
have been considered a victory. The runner-up share of $329,000
would enable him to get his Tour card for 1999 and finally return
to America, where his wife and infant son live.
</P>
<P>
   But Watts, who won the 1987 NCAA individual championship for
national champion Oklahoma State, said he wasn't worrying about
coming home as he headed to the 15th tee for the start of the
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about any doors being opened for me,'' Watts
said. ``I was just thinking about trying to win the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts quickly fell behind when O'Meara birdied No. 15 and Watts'
3-foot birdie attempt lipped out. After the players both parred the
next two holes, Watts' chance of winning the Open and earning an
immediate Tour card ended when his approach at the 18th landed in
another green-H side bunker.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Meara on the green, Watts tried to make his sand shot,
but knocked it 30 feet past the cup. He two- putted for bogey, then
L watched O'Meara two-putt for par for an anticlimatic finish to a
hectic four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite proud of myself to be here, but I'm disappointed I
didn't win because I had the opportunity,'' said Watts, who will
improve on his No. 35 spot on the world ranking. ``I don't know
what this will do for my career. Hopefully, I moved up a little
notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as much as O'Meara, however. He now has won as many majors
as Greg Norman and Johnny Miller.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Meara's Masters victory, he had to endure accusations
from Sweden's L Jarmo Sandelin that O'Meara had cheated when he won
last fall's Lancome Trophy because he marked a ball incorrectly.
Now, O'Meara has made his mark in golf in a much better way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody used to write that Mark couldn't win a major,'' said
his caddy, Jerry Higginbotham. ``Now he's won two, so everybody
should shut up, and that includes Jarmo Sandelin. Jarmo Sandelin
couldn't carry Mark's bag.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara says he's content to stay on a plateau of players behind
the superstars. But what if he wins next month's PGA Championship
at Sahalee to join Ben Hogan as the only players to win three
professional majors in a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that, but if you guys want to think that,
that's great,'' O'Meara said. ``I really don't know why I've been
able to take my game to the next level at my age. I just try to not
put much pressure on myself. And like I've said, the golf ball
doesn't know how old you are.''

 &HT;    Three-putts haunt Woods
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Tiger Woods came up one birdie short
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods chipped in for birdie on the 17th hole and rolled in a
30-foot birdie putt on 18 to move into a temporary first-place tie,
celebrating each shot with his familiar pumping fist. But his
four-under 66 eventually left him one shot out of the British Open
playoff at Royal Birkdale, won by Mark O'Meara over Brian Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm very happy with the 66, but going out I knew
that probably even par was going to be the number and I just didn't
do it,'' said Woods, who finished at one-over 281.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who led this tournament after an opening 65, could look
back on his three-putt bogey at the first hole, a missed 4-foot
birdie try at the 10th or the 77 he shot Saturday as reasons why he
didn't win his second major. But Woods said he won't play those
mind games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do that and beat yourself up forever,'' he said.
``You could play `What if?' in every tournament. You have to look
at the positive: I started out good and I finished with three
birdies in the last four holes to give myself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other positives Woods could take with him on his
private plane back to the United States: This was his best finish
in a major (and just his second top-10) since his record-setting
Masters victory last year; and his practice rounds with buddy
O'Meara soon might become more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need more shots,'' Woods said, smiling. ``I can't wait until
we get home and play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a mixed weekend for Woods, who was heckled by some fans
and saw his mother sprain an ankle Saturday while walking the
course. But he has come a long way from the kid who once said
winning was his lone desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finishing third is not something you should be upset about,''
Woods said. ``I was one shot out of the playoff. That's been the
story of my year. I've been right there, but I haven't been able to
get a victory out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rose's parting shot: Justin Rose couldn't have picked a better
shot on which to end his amateur career.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old Englishman thrilled the home crowd when he holed
out a 45-yard sand wedge on the 18th hole for birdie, a fitting end
to a week in which he finished in a four-way tie for fourth, two
shots out of the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it went in because it was a tough shot out
of the rough over a bunker,'' Rose said. ``I could have bailed out,
but I told my caddy I was going to go for it. I had nothing to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose missed out on a $134,167 payday because he's an amateur,
but that will change this week when he turns pro and plays in the
Dutch Open. The 69 he shot Sunday under intense pressure left him
no doubt he was making the correct decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that has been weighing on my mind, but I was
going to use this week to help me,'' said Rose, who turns 18 later
this month. ``The way it's gone, I would be silly not to, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's fourth-place finish was the best showing by an amateur in
the British Open since West Palm Beach's Frank Stranahan finished
second in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unusual Grand Slam: O'Meara's victory means Orlando's
Isleworth is three-quarters of the way to a unique Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Besides O'Meara, U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen is a member at
Isleworth. This might be a good omen for the PGA Championship for
fellow Isleworth members Payne Stewart, Stuart Appleby, Craig Parry
and Scott Hoch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can you hold? Brad Faxon had a phone call Saturday from a man
who identified himself only as Gary, congratulating him on his play
so far in the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered the phone in the hotel and this voice said it was
Gary, but then room service came in and I asked him to wait and it
took a few minutes,'' Faxon said. ``I didn't know who it was, but I
didn't like to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got back to the phone, I said `Hi' and realized
I was talking to Gary Player. I had made Gary Player wait for room
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon said Player had called to give him some advice on his
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me the same advice four years ago, so I guess I
haven't been listening,'' Faxon said, ``but I'm trying.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Noteworthy: Lee Westwood, who would have won a $1 million
bonus had he followed up his Loch Lomond Invitational victory with
a win at the British Open, shot 78_298 and tied for 64th. ... Nick
Price rebounded from Saturday's humbling 82 with a 72. Asked how
much easier the course played Sunday, Price said: ``For me, 10
shots.'' ... Mark Calcavecchia of West Palm Beach shot 74_293 and
tied for 35th. ... Attendance for the four tournament days was
158,600.

 &HT;    No easy answers from Parnevik
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ First, the words came in Swedish. Then
English. Then jibberish.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the language, the answers didn't come easy for Jesper
Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he had a chance to win the British Open, and once
again he was left thirsting to take a victory swig from the Auld
Claret Jug. Parnevik is becoming the Tom Lehman of this country's
national open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's very frustrating,'' Parnevik said. ``This is
my favorite tournament and I'd like to win it once. But I'm getting
used to it now.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. Sunday marked the third time in the last five years
the Jupiter resident has come close but failed to win the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not getting any closer. After finishing second in 1994
and last year, Parnevik tied for fourth Sunday, two shots out of
the playoff won by Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik thought this would his day. He was in the final group,
two shots behind unheralded partner/leader Brian Watts. But
Parnevik never got closer to the lead during an even-par 70 that
included three birdies and three bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was walking uphill for 18 holes today,'' Parnevik
said. ``I played so well early and I thought the putts would start
dropping soon. Nobody was really doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt if I could be one-over going to the last two
holes and birdie the par-5s to get to minus-one, that would be the
winning score. You need to have the breaks the last day, and I had
a few putts today I thought I made and lipped out, and that turns
the whole round around.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his putter, Parnevik fought an erratic driver.
Errant tee shots led to all three bogeys _ on the sixth, eighth and
13th holes.
</P>
<P>
   He answered the first two bogeys with birdies on the next hole,
but the bogey at 13 proved too large to overcome. His par putt
there had looked to be in until it curled around the edge of the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hole the putt on 13 _ and I thought I had _ that was
big,'' Parnevik said. ``That put so much pressure on me to make
three birdies in the last four holes, which is very difficult to do
on this golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik has lost the British three ways. His back-nine rally in
1994 at Turnberry came up a shot short. He lost a two-shot lead
last year when his 73 wasn't close to matching Justin Leonard's
closing 65. And Sunday he failed to win from somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the near-misses, Parnevik said he doesn't think this
tournament owes him a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you have to do it,'' he said. ``Sometimes, the other
players give it to you, but so far it hasn't been that way. I just
have to keep on trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, 33, figures to have more chances. But one never knows
how many times he'll find himself in this position. Parnevik admits
the game may be becoming more mental in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be I'm getting jinxed in my head,'' he said. ``You
kind of wonder if you'll get back close to one.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Parnevik muttered a few words that nobody could
understand. But with the sad look on his face, no translation was
needed.

KNEE INJURY SIDELINES COWBOYS LINEBACKER THOMAS FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ With last year's retirement of Charles
Haley, and last spring's waiving of Tony Tolbert, the Dallas
Cowboys' most accomplished pass rusher was linebacker Broderick
Thomas. But the club must now turn to another source for putting
heat on the quarterback as Thomas sustained a season-ending knee
injury Sunday, severely hampering the club's depth at linebacker
and defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 31, injured his left knee during team drills as he made
a cut on the grass at Midwestern State University. A
magnetic-resonance-imaging exam late Sunday showed a torn
anterior-cruciate ligament, which normally takes about six to 12
months to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broderick Thomas is out for the year,'' Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones said. ``That's what our doctors tell us. I'm really sick for
Broderick. He was having an outstanding camp and he had a great
off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' injury effects the Cowboys on several fronts. He was
competing for a starting position at strong-side linebacker.
Because coaches felt he was competent at the position, the Cowboys
were experimenting with moving starting strong-side linebacker
Randall Godfrey to middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   And because of Thomas' pass-rushing skills _ he has 47 1/2
career sacks and led the Cowboys with 10 quarterback pressures in
1997 _ the club was also counting on him as a pass-rushing
defensive end during obvious passing situations. This would have
taken some of the pressure off starting defensive ends Kavika
Pittman, who has one sack in two years with the Cowboys, and Greg
Ellis, a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Late last night, the Cowboys brass still was huddling on what
changes, if any, would be made to the roster because of the injury
to Thomas, who had signed a one-year, $325,000 contract in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after practice, Jones hinted that the club would
probably look to fill the void from within. Darren Hambrick, this
year's fifth-round draft choice, who returned to practice Sunday
after missing a few sessions with a toothache, took Thomas'
repetitions in workouts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could also stop its experiment with Godfrey at
middle linebacker and move him back to the strong side. That would
give the starting middle linebacker spot to Fred Strickland. But
Strickland's subpar play last year was one of the reasons Godfrey
was moved to middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've got some players on this team that could step
in and play,'' Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have about $325,000 remaining under the salary cap _
enough to sign one veteran. But Jones said it is doubtful that the
club would sign either a linebacker or a defensive end to replace
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The club was not planning to re-sign Tony Tolbert, who might
have to retire because of chronic knee problems. High-profile
linebackers who remain unsigned are Renaldo Turnbull, Carlton
Bailey, Darion Conner, Vinson Smith, Bryan Cox, and Greg Lloyd, who
was cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers after sustaining an ankle injury
that led to a staph infection in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Lloyd was a great player, but his health is a question
mark,'' Jones said. ``The Steelers are a great organization, and
they don't release a player whom they think can be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was beginning his 10th NFL season _ his third with the
Cowboys. A linebacker for much of his career, the Cowboys moved him
to defensive end before the 1997 season. He could not beat out
Shante Carver for a starting spot and did not record a start for
the first time since his rookie season in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But he was looking at the 1998 season in a new way. The club was
going to allow him to compete at his natural position of
linebacker. He had dropped from 270 to 240 pounds. A few hours
before his injury, Thomas' position coach, George Edwards, had said
that Thomas was ``in the best condition of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, that career is in doubt. Star-Telegram staff writer
Clarence Hill Jr. contributed to this report.

 JUDGE VOIDS STUDY LINKING CANCER TO SECONDHAND SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge held Friday that the Environmental Protection
Agency made procedural and scientific mistakes when it declared in
a 1993 report that secondhand cigarette smoke caused as many as
3,000 cancer deaths a year among nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark report was considered critical in helping to launch
an era in which hundreds of municipalities nationwide passed full
or partial bans on smoking indoors.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's ruling, while sharply critical of EPA officials
and the methods they used, is likely to have little immediate
impact on those laws, said regulators, antismoking advocates and
some cigarette industry officials. That is because the
environmental agency does not regulate indoor smoke and because
local governments have wide discretion to set their own regulatory
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the EPA review is not the only scientific study to
have associated second-hand smoke with health risks. But its
findings were cited by a number of other government agencies and
were widely trumpeted by antismoking advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two cigarette industry officials said Sunday that
they believed the ruling, which government lawyers expect to
appeal, should make it more difficult for other cities to pass
similar laws and for plaintiffs to successfully sue over injuries
claimed to be the result of secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legislative body that was considering passing a law based
on the EPA report is going to have to rethink it,'' said Seth
Moskowitz, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of
R.J.R. Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, Judge William Osteen of U.S. District Court in
Greensboro, N.C., held that EPA officials made significant mistakes
when the agency brought together scientists to study secondhand
smoke. The ruling came in a lawsuit by major cigarette companies
seeking to have the report declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen found that the composition of the study panel was flawed
because, among other things, none of its representatives were drawn
from industry. But in a far more damning finding, Osteen held that
agency researchers, rather than rigorously proving their case,
frequently shifted theories and selected the data they wanted in
order to reach a preordained conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the EPA publicly committed to a conclusion
before research had begun,'' Osteen wrote. He vacated the bulk of
the report, entitled, ``Respiratory Health Effects of Passive
Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, EPA administrator, said the ruling should have no
effect on local antismoking ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inasmuch as the tobacco guys will claim that secondhand smoke
has no health effects, we are clearly upset,'' Ms. Browner said.
``But the important thing that people should understand is that
secondhand smoke is a real health risk. Nothing in this ruling
should be used to overturn any public health decision taken by any
business or any city to ban smoking.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
an advocacy group in Washington, said that he did not believe the
industry would use the ruling to challenge secondhand smoke laws
already in place. And a cigarette industry official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, agreed. But one regulator, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said tobacco companies might seek to repeal
laws in communities where support for antismoking measures was not
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   At least one cigarette producer, R.J. Reynolds, indicated that
it might challenge laws in place. In a statement released Sunday,
Charles Blixt, the company's general counsel, said the court's
finding ``destroys the basis for those agencies and state and local
governments that have banned or restricted smoking because of the
EPA classification.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, a lawyer with Philip Morris Cos., the nation's
largest cigarette maker, said that he believed Osteen's ruling
would be a setback to those suing for injuries said to be caused by
secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of those actions was a class action lawsuit
brought by flight attendants who claimed a variety of injuries from
secondhand smoke on airplanes. That lawsuit was settled by the
industry last year for $349 million, though producers said they
resolved the action to pave the way for last year's $368.5 billion
tobacco settlement proposal between the industry and 40 state
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the agency issued its 1993 finding that secondhand
tobacco smoke was a Class A carcinogen, putting it in the same
category as radon, the EPA's methods had come under attack by the
tobacco industry, which filed its lawsuit in 1993 soon after the
report was issued. The report's findings were also questioned by
some independent authorities, like the Congressional Research
Service, an arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1988 that the EPA started drafting policy
recommendations about controlling secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling, Osteen found that just a year later the
agency, rather than reaching a conclusion after ``collecting
information, researching and making findings,'' categorized
secondhand smoke as a ``known cause of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   With that conclusion in already in hand, Osteen wrote, EPA
officials spent the following years before their report's
publication making ``findings on selective information.''

SEA CHIMNEYS HOLD CLUES ON LIFE IN HARSH HABITATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Canada)  (lb) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like the astronauts who brought back the first rocks
from the moon 29 years ago this month, an expedition of scientists
returned to port here this weekend with exotic souvenirs, but this
time from a world even stranger than anything lunar, and more
geologically and biologically alive: the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the scientists had raised from the depths of
the Pacific Ocean huge sections of rocky chimneys that rise from
the sea floor like stalagmites, spewing toxic chemical-laden smoke.
The black smokers, as they are called, are where scalding water
percolating out of Earth's interior forges a wealth of minerals and
supports colonies of bizarre forms of life that thrive in the
harshest of environments.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists' catch, displayed on Saturday on the deck of the
Thomas G. Thompson, a University of Washington research vessel,
included four such chimneys, 5 to 7 feet tall and 1,200 to 4,000
pounds in weight.
</P>
<P>
   They were mainly dark and rough, like meteorites just fallen
from the sky. But they were also marked by seams of white minerals
and patches with a golden glitter, which might have sent
forty-niners rushing to celebrate at the nearest saloon under what
would have been the mistaken impression that they had struck it
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the largest chimneys were recovered while still hot and
teeming with small worms, sea spiders and limpets. Countless worms
inside tiny tubes, though dead on arrival at the surface, clung to
the chimney surfaces like a fringe. Still alive inside were
microbes that may be among the most primitive forms of life found.
Scientists were already making cultures of the microbes in
laboratory dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is not the size of the smokers,'' said Dr.
Edmond Mathez, chairman of earth and planetary sciences at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York. ``It's that we
raised something alive and hot. We can now study something about
the maximum conditions at which life can exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Expedition scientists said they expected the chimneys and
specimens to provide important clues about how life can originate
and persist in such extreme conditions, in volcanic vents beneath
the sea where temperatures reach several hundred degrees and
without sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Their investigations could shed light on the theory,
controversial but winning support, that life on Earth might have
originated in such sea-floor cauldrons. An abundance of life there
suggests that life may be more widespread than was once thought.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after the ship's arrival, Ellen Futter, president of
the American Museum, one of the expedition sponsors, said, ``These
amazing structures and the unusual life forms they support offer
tantalizing implications about the origins of life on Earth and the
possibility of life on other planetary bodies, or the possibility
that sunlight-based life as we know it here on Earth is quite
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Delaney, a University of Washington oceanographer and
the expedition's chief scientist, had his eye on the
extraterrestrial implications. ``Our research will help us look for
life off the planet,'' he said. ``In the long term, that's the
essential point of what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for life elsewhere has focused on Mars, encouraged
recently by findings in meteorites from the planet and evidence of
widespread surface water there in the past. But scientists are
increasingly interested in Europa, a moon of Jupiter. The Galileo
spacecraft has found considerable evidence that beneath the ice
surface of Europa lies a deep ocean warmed by internal heat and a
possible haven for simple life.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week expedition was mounted by the University of
Washington and the American Museum. The chimneys will be analyzed
in the university's laboratories and made available for study by
international scientists. At least one of the smokers will be
shipped to the American Museum for study and eventual display in
its new hall of earth science, to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian ship joined the search, and it was a Canadian
remotely operated vehicle that traveled more than a mile to the sea
floor to find the chimneys, separate them with a chain saw and
attach them to an 8,000-foot line to be hauled to the surface. A
camera on the vehicle videotaped the life around the smokers and
the recovery. A section of one chimney is to be sent to the Royal
Ontario Museum in Toronto.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The world of submarine hot springs bubbling with sulfide
minerals and gases from Earth's interior and crawling with exotic
life was unknown until 1977, when the first such site was
discovered off the Galapagos Islands. Two years later, off Mexico,
the first pinnacle-shaped black smokers were observed. They
appeared to be a common phenomenon along the volcanically active
ridges under the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   From photographs, scientists have measured one chimney to be as
high as 140 feet. Only a few small pieces of the chimneys had been
retrieved until now. The expedition made its haul near the Juan de
Fuca Ridge, 180 miles off the coast of Washington and British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations and interviews on the final leg of the voyage,
scientists described the geology of the samples they had retrieved.
The bulk of the chimney structures consisted of metal-bearing
sulfur compounds, like the minerals pyrite, chalcopyrite, wurtzite
and sphalerite, with silica and the white calcium sulfate mineral
anhydrite. Chalcopyrite is a copper iron sulfide that glitters like
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists could not estimate the age of the smokers, but
they appear to build quickly. Five days after the last retrievals,
remotely controlled video showed that 2 or 3 feet of new minerals
had accumulated on top of the chimney stumps.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Baross, a University of Washington microbiologist, said
the two largest chimneys were still hot internally when they were
brought on deck. Heat-loving, or thermophilic, microbes were still
growing on the surfaces and interiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots and lots of positive cultures of these
microbes,'' he said. ``This cruise will add a great deal to our
quest for what is the upper limit of temperatures at which life can
exist.''

RACE MATTERS, A LOT, FOR FLORIDA DEMOCRATS  
 A FAST-TRACK BATTLE OF A DIFFERENT KIND  
 DRAWING A BATTLE LINE AT A RALLY FOR UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida Democrats are moving to end the raw racial rift that
threatens to cripple their party in this fall's elections and leave
it weaker than at any point in more than a century. But is the move
too little, too late?
</P>
<P>
   The rift opened in January when white Democrats in the Florida
House voted to replace a black representative, Willie Logan of
Opa-Locka, as their leader, saying he was not aggressive enough in
the job. In his place they installed a white woman, Rep. Anne
Mackenzie of Fort Lauderdale, who they argued would be a stronger
leader in the coming battle for control of this ever more populous
and politically important state.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, after six frustrating months of struggling to
close the rift, raise campaign money and recruit candidates for a
solid showing in the 1998 elections (Republicans control the State
House now and probably will again next year), Ms. Mackenzie
announced she was retiring from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Other top House Democrats immediately began maneuvering to
replace her in the leadership post with a black candidate. They
warned possible white contenders for the job that if blacks were
not given more say in Florida politics, the deeply angered black
vote might become the swing vote in the fall and tip the balance to
the Republicans in crucial legislative contests and the governor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Logan is already moving in that direction. A few weeks
ago he set up a political action committee that he says will be
financed with money from Republicans and dissident Democrats and
will support Republican candidates running against House Democrats
who opposed him in January. He says he is no longer interested in
being the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, several white legislators who had considered
running for Ms. Mackenzie's job had been persuaded by other top
Democrats to drop out. Of the three contestants left, all of them
black, party insiders said Rep. Les Miller of Tampa was most likely
to get the nod for the post when the Democratic House caucus next
meets, possibly as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to pull every facet of our party together,'' Miller
promised. ``I'm a loyal Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   A FAST-TRACK BATTLE OF A DIFFERENT KIND
</P>
<P>
   This year's House race in Kentucky's 4th Congressional District,
in the northeast corner of the state, is one of the more closely
watched elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The seat is wide open because the incumbent, Rep. Jim Bunning, a
Republican, is leaving the House to run for the Senate. The
district is fairly evenly divided between Republicans and
Democrats. And the contenders to replace Bunning _ Ken Lucas, a
former county judge who is a conservative Democrat, and Gex
Williams, a state senator who is a conservative Republican _ are
fairly evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this is a political dogfight. And it's getting
meaner.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lucas accused Williams of casting two ``horrendous''
votes in the Kentucky Senate that were _ varoooom!!! _
``anti-NASCAR,'' as in anti-stock-car.
</P>
<P>
   This is serious. In a good-ol'-boy state like Kentucky _ and in
a congressional district like the 4th, in which ground was broken
this weekend for a $130 million speedway _ being against NASCAR
(the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) is like being
against motherhood, apple pie, bourbon and bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Lucas tell it, Williams voted ``no'' on two resolutions
that would have honored Kentucky drivers, among them the legendary
Darrell Waltrip. In each case the vote was 37-1, and Lucas sees
that as proof positive that Williams is one seriously out-of-touch
Kentucky politician.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Williams says his votes were cast for packages of
resolutions and bills that he did not know contained the stock-car
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as that was pointed out to me, I corrected it,'' he
said on Friday, adding that he was a fan of stock cars and Waltrip
and, indeed, had worked to get that new racing track located in the
4th District.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWING A BATTLE LINE AT A RALLY FOR UNITY
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years on Capitol Hill, Rep. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska has
built a reputation as a solid Republican moderate, seldom given to
partisan, in-your-face confrontation. The Republicanism practiced
in his 1st Congressional District, centered on Lincoln, the
capital, tends to be considerably less conservative and strident
than the brand practiced in Nebraska's two other districts, where
the Christian right increasingly holds sway.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Bereuter felt the urge to speak out against the
ever harder political line being taken by the state's religious
conservatives. He held his tongue, however _ partly by nature,
partly because he was considering running for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   But a few months back Bereuter gave up the notion of seeking
higher office. And a few days ago he spoke his mind on the issue of
Republicans and religion, with a vehemence that is resonating well
beyond the Cornhusker State.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a Republican ``unity rally'' at Grand Island,
Bereuter declared that the party was being held captive by
``misguided leaders'' who were more interested in ideology than
consensus and who were spending so much time and energy criticizing
abortion rights and ``bashing'' public schools that many voters
were being alienated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got religion lately when it seemed to be
especially good politics with certain voting blocs,'' he went on.
</P>
<P>
   Bereuter described himself as a Christian, but not one who wears
his religion ``like an armband.'' He also said he was ``pro-life by
commitment,'' but asserted that ``the average Nebraska Republican
doesn't believe the abortion issue should absolutely dominate all
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience walked out. Others refused to stand and
clap when the congressman finished. Here and there a few cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jon Christensen of Omaha, one of the leaders of Nebraska's
Christian right, said, with mockery in his voice, ``In light of
Doug's speech, can we pray?''
</P>
<P>
   Several party stalwarts declared that Bereuter was more
dangerous to the party than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Nebraska, Bereuter's blunt remarks and call for party
inclusion have given a lift to other moderate and centrist
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, the Republican Leadership Council,
whose board includes Gov. Pete Wilson of California, Gov. John
Engler of Michigan and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, hailed the
congressman as a man of courage and ``common-sense conservative
convictions'' who understood that ``narrow, single-issue politics
is the surest way to put the Democrats back in power.''

CHANGES TO TAXI PARTITIONS URGED AS INJURIES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, at the height of a crime wave against
taxi drivers in New York City, regulators voted to require a
seemingly simple precaution: a partition of bulletproof plastic
between the front and back seats in most yellow cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, robberies and murders of cabdrivers have plummeted,
along with other crimes. But injuries in taxi accidents have
increased, in part because riders have been hurled against the
partitions, with many suffering concussions or broken bones, or in
some cases jagged, disfiguring facial cuts from metal hinges and
screws.
</P>
<P>
   While no statistics are kept on the percentage of passenger
injuries caused by partitions, some doctors, personal-injury
lawyers and safety experts are pressing for changes in their design
to reduce the risk and severity of injuries. Some also complain
that the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani failed to tackle
these problems in its recent package of safety reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say they are also concerned about the
hazards, which lead to costly insurance claims. Although few in the
industry would be willing to do away with the partitions out of
concern for drivers' safety, regulators at the city's Taxi and
Limousine Commission say they are preparing to seek information
from partition manufacturers about ways to decrease some of the
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. John Sherman, an assistant clinical professor of surgery
at New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College and a vocal
critic of the partitions, said some of the blame rests with the
commission, which he noted has specifications for the design,
placement and padding of the partition so vague that the partitions
vary greatly from cab to cab. Some are so close to the back seat or
have so many protruding parts, he said, that even passengers who
wear seat belts _ and few riders do _ are sometimes thrown into
them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some say the options are limited. Industry executives had
hoped that roomier minivans and sport utility vehicles would lead
to safer and more comfortable rides. Almost 500 of the bigger
vehicles, mostly Honda Odysseys and Isuzu Oasises, are now on the
road, and some owners love them. But officials of the biggest group
of fleet owners, the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, said the
vans have not proved tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the taxi commission said the solution is not as
simple as mandating the use of roomier cabs, because some
automakers have proved unwilling to provide the support and
warranties for the vehicles to be used as cabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, what we're desperately searching for is options,''
said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the chairwoman of the commission. The
commission is now pushing the Chevrolet Venture, an even bigger
minivan than the Honda. Unlike the Honda, the Venture is
manufactured in a special heavy-duty taxi version.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that when it came to avoiding
injuries from the partitions, the most important preventive measure
was seat belts. In the last year, the commission has begun
requiring recorded messages in every taxi urging riders to wear
their belts, and has stepped up enforcement to make sure the belts
are available and not jammed between the seat cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sherman said that partition injuries had declined
somewhat at his hospital over the past year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The growing public awareness of the dangers of the partition and
of the increase in accidents may also be spurring more passengers
to buckle up. David Grant, the president of a Manhattan public
relations firm, who was not wearing a seat belt when a cab he was
riding in in 1996 struck another and he slammed into the partition,
breaking six bones in his neck, said he never gets in a cab without
putting on a belt now.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said many of the worst injuries could be avoided simply
by moving the partition's change tray from the right side of the
partition to the center, where passengers usually do not sit.
Others have suggested putting padding around the tray. A few people
have suggested doing away with the partitions altogether, given the
overall drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partitions came about at a time when there was a problem
with security,'' said Glen Wiener, a personal-injury lawyer who
represented a woman who was wearing a belt but still slammed into
the partition and suffered a brain injury when a cab she was riding
in struck another in 1996. ``But I can't think of the last time I
was in a cab and the driver had the partition window closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said the partitions were here to stay.
And Michael Higgins, a cabby who publishes the trade newspaper Taxi
Talk, said it made no sense to get rid of them just because crime
had fallen, adding that many drivers closed the partition window at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime is down because people have taken steps to protect
themselves, whether it's electing a crime-fighting mayor or putting
in partitions,'' he said. ``If you start taking away some of the
protective measures, then crime comes back.''

TEACHERS UNION PURSUING QUALITY CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of
Teachers, objects to what he says has been the most widely used
test to become a public school teacher: the thermometer test. ``If
you register above 97 degrees, you pass,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising to hear a teachers union leader
complaining that some of those placed in front of classrooms are
only warm bodies. And, indeed, Cole said, not many years ago he
would not have been caught doing so. He saw the union's role as
that of purely protecting members from attacks by administrators
and school boards.
</P>
<P>
   But today, with education moving to the top of the national
political agenda, much of the attention is focused on teacher
quality, widely seen as the most important variable in a pupil's
education. Advocacy groups, state legislatures and Congress are
seeking ways to attract better candidates to the teaching
profession and improve teacher education, needs that have grown in
urgency as school populations swell after years of shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the nearly 1-million-member American Federation of
Teachers, whose delegates, like Cole, are meeting here for their
biennial convention, is an organization under siege. The leaders,
who are treating better teacher quality as a priority, have little
choice: If they do not promote change it will be forced upon them.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, the union passed a resolution calling for local
affiliates to negotiate a role in the hiring of teachers, take part
in assisting and reviewing teacher performance and, ultimately, in
dismissing those teachers who are beyond help. Because a similar
resolution was rejected at the union's convention two years ago in
Cincinnati, this year's vote is evidence of changing times and
growing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also clear in the cavernous halls of New Orleans'
riverside convention center where some 3,000 federation delegates
have been meeting that the new national focus on teacher quality is
seen as an opportunity. If handled properly, it should translate
into higher pay, better benefits and greater honor for a profession
that has fallen on hard times in the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company has a shortage of computer programmers, what does
it do?'' asked Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers of Los
Angeles. ``It raises the salaries of programmers to attract more of
them. The market works in every other sector of the economy. Why
not here?''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher salaries start at about $25,000 around the country, well
below those of most other professions. Those who leave teaching _
as do some 50 percent within the first seven years of entering the
profession _ further complain about safety, especially in urban
districts, and lack of an attractive, professional environment. The
buildings in which they work are often old; they frequently do not
have easy access to telephones or computers and the lack of much
contact during the day with colleagues can be isolating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sisters are in the business world, and they don't have to
take professional development courses on Saturday or in the
evenings,'' said Brenda Mitchell, director of the Center for
Professional Growth and Development of United Teachers of New
Orleans, the local federation affiliate. ``They take them during
working hours. They work in nice, air-conditioned offices and are
treated like professionals. That's what we need for teachers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 51 years old and, as an African-American, I can tell you
that many career paths were not open to me when I was younger.
There was teaching or counseling. Today that's not true. All these
other fields are wide open, and people are going into them instead
of teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher crisis stems partly, researchers agree, from the
increased options opened to women and minority group members. Their
turning elsewhere combined with growing disorder in schools and
reduced budgets, especially in inner cities, and a drop-off in
school populations after the baby boom generation graduated. Now,
with the children of the baby boom group in school and most good
jobs so information-based, the need for teachers is heightened just
as fewer high-achieving students are interested in the profession
because of seemingly better options in a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what is worrying critics of public education,
who maintain that teachers are increasingly drafted from a
below-average group of applicants. In Massachusetts, for example,
the first mandatory teacher test, taken in April, showed 59 percent
of prospective teachers unable to pass a basic skills portion.
Words like ``improbably,'' ``corrupt'' and ``relief'' were often
misspelled by the test takers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The results led Massachusetts State Senate President Thomas
Birmingham to propose enticing new teachers with $20,000 signing
bonuses. ``We're never going to pay teachers what corporate lawyers
get,'' he said, ``but that doesn't mean you can't do something to
attract better people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some members of Congress are proposing other
financial incentives as well as sanctions, including abolishing
student debts of teachers, especially those who go to poor
neighborhoods to teach, and cutting federal aid to teachers
colleges whose graduates do not perform well on standardized tests.
Only about 40 percent of the education schools in the country are
accredited.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, made teacher quality the centerpiece of her convention
opening speech here on Friday, saying it was on everyone's mind as
well it should be, but she said the fault was not the union's.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as state and local education authorities continue to
issue emergency credentials and to misassign teachers into subjects
they are not qualified to teach, higher standards will be a
fiction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman said there would be a need for 2 million new
teachers in the coming decade and already some 6.5 percent, or
about 13,000 out of 200,000, new teachers hired in public schools
each year come with emergency credentials. In addition, she said,
some 36 percent of the nation's public school academic teachers had
neither a college major nor a minor in the subject to which they
were assigned to teach.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if administrators were to take up her challenge
and this school year end the practice of giving emergency
credentials, the teacher deficit would be truly exposed for what it
is _ the result of school boards and administrators more concerned
with placing anybody in front of a classroom than with real teacher
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi of Los Angeles said the national push for small class
size was actually counterproductive without improving teacher
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this illusion that all it takes is small groups to
improve learning,'' he said. ``But you could put the kids around a
dining room table and if the teacher doesn't know what he is doing,
it doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the federation delegates there was some concern about the
move to have the union involved in dismissing bad teachers when it
is also the advocate for all its members.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Roney, a kindergarten teacher from Yonkers, said such a
dual role would only weaken the union, turning it into a form of
management.
</P>
<P>
   But other federation members said it was time for the union to
move toward being a more professional association, rather than
purely a trade union, in keeping with what teaching is. The AFT's
union stridency is thought to have played a role in the rejection
by the National Education Association, its rival, of a merger with
it at its convention in New Orleans earlier this month. The two
unions are expected to continue merger talks as well as cooperative
ventures on things like peer review for teachers after the AFT's
overwhelming vote on Saturday to pursue the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mooney, president of the Cincinnati AFT affiliate, said that
in his city and a dozen others, peer review systems in which the
union helps select and dismiss teachers have been working well. To
critics who worry that the union will protect its own, he said that
since the system began in Cincinnati, twice the number of bad
teachers have been dismissed as under the previous system where it
was only up to the principals.

COWBOYS LOSE CORNERBACK TO KNEE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys cornerback Wendell Davis
has been lost for the year with a torn anterior cruciate ligament
in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Davis sustained the injury Friday, and a
magnetic-resonance-imaging test confirmed his worst fears. He is
expected to undergo surgery in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was bad the instant it happened,'' said Davis, a
third-year veteran from Oklahoma. ``When I jumped, it popped.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is no stranger to knee injuries, said he's worried
whether the injury is career-threatening. Davis underwent
arthroscopic surgery after the 1996 season to repair a lateral
meniscus tear in his right knee. He sprained his left knee during
training camp last year and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys replaced Davis on the roster with cornerback Ron
Bailey, who signed a rookie free-agent contract with the Cowboys in
May but was cut two weeks ago. GETTING PHYSICAL
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys resume practice tomorrow, after taking today
off for the team's annual training-camp golf tournament, expect the
intensity to go up a few notches.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the only negative thing he saw
after the first four days of practice was that the team wasn't
being physical enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress every day, especially offensively,''
Gailey said in his daily news conference before Sunday's afternoon
practice. ``I've seen the timing coming back to the passing game. I
like our team speed on defense. But we are going to have to be more
physical on both sides of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the coaches will create more situations for the team
to be physical this week in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive end Leon Lett must have heard Gailey. Roughly
an hour after the news conference, Lett delivered the biggest hit
of training camp when he leveled running back Chris Warren. MILLS,
EUBANKS IMPRESSIVE
</P>
<P>
   Gailey won't comment on position battles because he says it's
too early in camp to make assessments.
</P>
<P>
   However, receivers Ernie Mills and Anthony Eubanks are proving
that it's not too early to make impressions, drawing raves for
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   If Mills, an eight-year veteran who signed with Cowboys as a
free agent in the off-season, continues his sizzling performance,
he would likely surface as the team's No. 2 receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Mills has the advantage of knowing Gailey's offense from his
days with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Now, he is proving that he has
recovered from a 1996 knee injury and that last season's 11-catch
performance with Carolina was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of exactly what we had in Pittsburgh,'' Gailey
said. ``That's good enough for me. He didn't have the best year in
Carolina. But we thought he would be a good addition to the
football team. We've been through a lot of wars together. And I've
seen him make a lot of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks, a rookie free agent from Arkansas, will be hard-pressed
to win a spot on the roster. Gailey said the Cowboys hope to keep
six wide receivers and maybe seven. He also said the number could
be reduced to five.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks is unlikely to bump Irvin, Mills, Billy Davis, Stepfret
Williams, Jimmy Oliver or Macey Brooks. However, he has been
noticed, which could lead to a practice-squad spot or a contract
with another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He catches everything that goes up in the air just about,''
Gailey said. ``He was the same way in minicamp. He's not a guy with
blazing speed. But he catches the ball. You got to give the guy
credit.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Gailey said the Cowboys will change their practice schedule
next week, going with full pads in the morning and without pads in
the afternoon workouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie linebacker Darren Hambrick practiced Sunday for the
first time after missing the past two days because of a tooth
extraction.
He Said It
</P>
<P>
   ``Just call me Bill.'' _ Bill Bates former Cowboys safety and
new assistant coach when queried about who would known as coach
Bates between him and defensive-end coach Jim Bates

TEACHERS UNION PURSUING QUALITY CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of
Teachers, objects to what he says has been the most widely used
test to become a public school teacher: the thermometer test. ``If
you register above 97 degrees, you pass,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising to hear a teachers union leader
complaining that some of those placed in front of classrooms are
only warm bodies. And, indeed, Cole said, not many years ago he
would not have been caught doing so. He saw the union's role as
that of purely protecting members from attacks by administrators
and school boards.
</P>
<P>
   But today, with education moving to the top of the national
political agenda, much of the attention is focused on teacher
quality, widely seen as the most important variable in a pupil's
education. Advocacy groups, state legislatures and Congress are
seeking ways to attract better candidates to the teaching
profession and improve teacher education, needs that have grown in
urgency as school populations swell after years of shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the nearly 1-million-member American Federation of
Teachers, whose delegates, like Cole, are meeting here for their
biennial convention, is an organization under siege. The leaders,
who are treating better teacher quality as a priority, have little
choice: If they do not promote change it will be forced upon them.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, the union passed a resolution calling for local
affiliates to negotiate a role in the hiring of teachers, take part
in assisting and reviewing teacher performance and, ultimately, in
dismissing those teachers who are beyond help. Because a similar
resolution was rejected at the union's convention two years ago in
Cincinnati, this year's vote is evidence of changing times and
growing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also clear in the cavernous halls of New Orleans'
riverside convention center where some 3,000 federation delegates
have been meeting that the new national focus on teacher quality is
seen as an opportunity. If handled properly, it should translate
into higher pay, better benefits and greater honor for a profession
that has fallen on hard times in the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company has a shortage of computer programmers, what does
it do?'' asked Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers of Los
Angeles. ``It raises the salaries of programmers to attract more of
them. The market works in every other sector of the economy. Why
not here?''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher salaries start at about $25,000 around the country, well
below those of most other professions. Those who leave teaching _
as do some 50 percent within the first seven years of entering the
profession _ further complain about safety, especially in urban
districts, and lack of an attractive, professional environment. The
buildings in which they work are often old; they frequently do not
have easy access to telephones or computers and the lack of much
contact during the day with colleagues can be isolating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sisters are in the business world, and they don't have to
take professional development courses on Saturday or in the
evenings,'' said Brenda Mitchell, director of the Center for
Professional Growth and Development of United Teachers of New
Orleans, the local federation affiliate. ``They take them during
working hours. They work in nice, air-conditioned offices and are
treated like professionals. That's what we need for teachers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 51 years old and, as an African-American, I can tell you
that many career paths were not open to me when I was younger.
There was teaching or counseling. Today that's not true. All these
other fields are wide open, and people are going into them instead
of teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher crisis stems partly, researchers agree, from the
increased options opened to women and minority group members. Their
turning elsewhere combined with growing disorder in schools and
reduced budgets, especially in inner cities, and a drop-off in
school populations after the baby boom generation graduated. Now,
with the children of the baby boom group in school and most good
jobs so information-based, the need for teachers is heightened just
as fewer high-achieving students are interested in the profession
because of seemingly better options in a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what is worrying critics of public education,
who maintain that teachers are increasingly drafted from a
below-average group of applicants. In Massachusetts, for example,
the first mandatory teacher test, taken in April, showed 59 percent
of prospective teachers unable to pass a basic skills portion.
Words like ``improbably,'' ``corrupt'' and ``relief'' were often
misspelled by the test takers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The results led Massachusetts State Senate President Thomas
Birmingham to propose enticing new teachers with $20,000 signing
bonuses. ``We're never going to pay teachers what corporate lawyers
get,'' he said, ``but that doesn't mean you can't do something to
attract better people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some members of Congress are proposing other
financial incentives as well as sanctions, including abolishing
student debts of teachers, especially those who go to poor
neighborhoods to teach, and cutting federal aid to teachers
colleges whose graduates do not perform well on standardized tests.
Only about 40 percent of the education schools in the country are
accredited.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, made teacher quality the centerpiece of her convention
opening speech here on Friday, saying it was on everyone's mind as
well it should be, but she said the fault was not the union's.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as state and local education authorities continue to
issue emergency credentials and to misassign teachers into subjects
they are not qualified to teach, higher standards will be a
fiction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman said there would be a need for 2 million new
teachers in the coming decade and already some 6.5 percent, or
about 13,000 out of 200,000, new teachers hired in public schools
each year come with emergency credentials. In addition, she said,
some 36 percent of the nation's public school academic teachers had
neither a college major nor a minor in the subject to which they
were assigned to teach.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if administrators were to take up her challenge
and this school year end the practice of giving emergency
credentials, the teacher deficit would be truly exposed for what it
is _ the result of school boards and administrators more concerned
with placing anybody in front of a classroom than with real teacher
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi of Los Angeles said the national push for small class
size was actually counterproductive without improving teacher
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this illusion that all it takes is small groups to
improve learning,'' he said. ``But you could put the kids around a
dining room table and if the teacher doesn't know what he is doing,
it doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the federation delegates there was some concern about the
move to have the union involved in dismissing bad teachers when it
is also the advocate for all its members.
</P>

END IS NEAR, MAYOR TELLS NEW YORK SEX SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Sunday that sex
shops and strip clubs violating the city's tough new zoning law
could be shut down beginning Tuesday, and he warned businesses that
last-minute changes _ like dressing dancers in T-shirts or bikinis
_ might not help them.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that during the time that the sex-oriented
businesses had been fighting the new law in court, city
investigators had spent a year or more compiling files on the shops
and clubs so that they could be padlocked without warning as soon
as courts allow enforcement to begin. Barring a last-minute court
setback, he said, that would be Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the mayor said inspectors would use a
variety of charges, like implying sexual entertainment in
advertising, admitting underage patrons, or serving as a meeting
place for people who then go elsewhere to engage in illegal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases we have a pattern of activity, so merely making
a change now might not, in fact, satisfy the law,'' he said.
``There are lots of factors that can be looked to, and you can be
sure that we'll be looking to all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the agencies that would be involved included the
Police Department, the Department of Buildings and the Office of
Midtown Enforcement, which was established in 1976 in an effort to
drive the businesses out of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The zoning law bans the sex-oriented theaters, massage parlors,
bars, bookstores, video stores and cabaret clubs from operating
within 500 feet of homes, schools, churches, or each other. The
restrictions took effect in 1995, and businesses had a year to
comply. They have been fighting it ever since, but the city has won
victory after victory in state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a group of 107 of the businesses asked that the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delay enforcement to allow them to
take their case to the Supreme Court. Herald Price Fahringer, the
lawyer for the group, said enforcement would drive most of his
clients out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong First Amendment argument, but it won't be
much use if the businesses have already had to close,'' said
Fahringer, who says he has specialized in defending obscenity cases
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor criticized the last-minute legal appeal by shop
owners, but acknowledged that a court could delay his plans again.
``We've learned in the past that they try to exhaust every single
opportunity to abuse our legal system,'' he said. ``There really is
nothing to their legal argument. It's completely disposed of by
federal and state judges at every level.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has said that carrying out the restrictions on
sex-oriented shops was high on his list for his second term, and
the crackdown plays a starring role on the roster of
quality-of-life improvements that he cites in speeches across the
country. In those addresses, he has called the shops ``corrosive
institutions'' that destroy neighborhoods and discourage
``legitimate businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he would not reveal details of his enforcement
blitz. But he said that once it started, no warnings would be
issued. ``If they haven't figured it out by now, then there's no
point in giving them a warning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer said he was frightened by the breadth of enforcement
the mayor announced. ``It's not enough for them to comply with the
law,'' Fahringer said. ``He wants to stamp them out. Maybe we
should all just be real good people and not even think about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some video stores had already begun reducing their
sex-oriented titles to less than 40 percent of their stock, which
he said should bring them into compliance with the law. ``The mayor
just wants to be punitive,'' Fahringer said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of some topless clubs have said they hope to stay in
business by clothing dancers in bikinis or T-shirts. But Giuliani
declared that efforts to ``just get around'' the law's intent would
fail, since nudity was ``only one of many criteria'' that would be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Walter McCaffrey, a Democrat from Queens who helped
draft the zoning law, said efforts to outfit topless dancers with
bathing suits were doomed because of market competition. ``These
folks are in denial,'' he said. ``People aren't going to pay $7.50
for a juice to watch something they can see on Rockaway Beach.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JONES HAS A STANDARD TO SET OFF THE TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Shana Williams was on Cloud Nine late Sunday
afternoon. The Seton Hall graduate student had just won the Marion
Jones-less long jump competition at the Goodwill Games. With a host
of reporters surrounding her in the interview tent, Williams didn't
wait for the swarm to ask about the ghost who hadn't competed; she
brought it up herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was this your biggest victory of the year?'' someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest victory would have been to have beaten Marion
Jones,'' Williams said. Jones, a sprinter, has become omnipresent
for female sprinters and long jumpers. She won the 100 meters
Sunday night in a Goodwill Games record 10.90. She has quickly
filled the void expected to be left by Jackie Joyner-Kersee _ who
is at the Goodwill Games, making one of her final appearances
before her retirement _ in the bustling world of women's track and
field. At 22, Jones has been proclaimed as the sport's next
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   A former high school track sensation, Jones, who also played
basketball in college, has been a transformation of marketing
hungry for the new, the fresh. Williams shrugged Sunday afternoon:
She is resigned to the fact that from now until the 2000 Olympics
in Sydney, Jones will be the standard by which all sprinters and
jumpers will be judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not intimidated by her,'' Williams said. ``She's just so
intense; she comes out of the blue, blows everybody out of the
water with two jumps. She reminds you of Jackie Joyner in her
prime.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Marion Jones goes further than Madison Avenue and
the current field of competitors. She is being watched closely by a
cadre of girls five, six, seven years younger, who look up to her
the way she looked at Joyner-Kersee. A role model, a beacon light.
A target.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the meet on Sunday, about 150 runners _ high school
age and younger _ from the New York metropolitan area participated
in a hastily arranged exhibition. They ran dashes and spirited
relays. Robert Taylor watched proudly as members of his girls team,
the Bronx-based Zodiac club, held their own against runners from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been involved with the Zodiacs for 20 years, going
back to when his daughter was 16, and has coached the team for 17
years. At age 55, Taylor has watched the evolution of female
superstars from Wilma Rudolph to Jackie Joyner-Kersee and now
Marion Jones. The impression Jones has made on his runners is
striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's replaced Gail Devers in the eyes of the young kids,''
Taylor said. ``You hear them talking: `I want to run like her,' `I
want to do what she does.'''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Jones, one of his sprinters, 16-year-old Shirvonne
McCarthy, plans to compete in the long jump. Nolle Graham, one of
New York city's most promising sprinters and long jumpers, said
that Jones has become a performance role model.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the sudden attention and adulation, Jones has a steep
mountain to climb before she joins the icon ranks of Rudolph and
Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she gets there depends on what she does, not on the
track but off it. Taylor was 17 when Rudolph won three gold medals
at the Rome Olympics. On her return to the United States, the city
of Clarksville, Tenn., wanted to honor her with a parade and a
banquet. Rudolph told the city that she would not participate in a
segregated parade or in a segregated banquet. Rudolph made her
stand, and Clarksville had its first integrated parade and banquet.
</P>
<P>
   In intervening years, Taylor saw Rudolph dedicate her time to a
number of national community groups serving children _ especially
children from disadvantaged backgrounds. A couple of weeks ago,
Joyner-Kersee went to a recreation center in New York and worked
with young athletes on everything from running form to life skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids get to see Jackie, they know it's not phony _ they
know she really cares,'' Taylor said.``I don't know if she was like
that at the beginning of her career, but I think pretty quickly,
because of her background, she knew what kids needed,'' he added,
referring to Joyner-Kersee's upbringing in East St. Louis. ``I'm
not sure if Marion had the same background.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is young yet, in years and experience. The world is just
beginning to come to her. As a runner, Jones is having a dramatic
impact on young female runners. But she hasn't brought herself to
the same level as Kersee and Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' Taylor said as he rounded his girls up and prepared
to leave Mitchell Field. ``Not in the eyes of kids. Young kids talk
about running like Marion Jones, but Jackie Joyner-Kersee still has
the biggest impact on their lives. She's above Marion in the way
kids perceive her, even though everyone wants to run like Marion.''

   (NYT1) NEW YORK -- July 19, 1998 -- NY-SHELTER, 7-17 -- Kris
Hernden, 21, is among a group of homeless young people, most of
them gay and runaways, who hang out at the piers in the West
Village of Manhattan. Local community activists are seeking to
build a shelter for the homeless youth. Hernden, who left Baltimore
for New York with a close friend, once dreamed of moving to the
storied West Village. ``I just had to leave Baltimore,'' he says.
``I was basically working here and there. I got tired of that. I'm
21. I should be stable by now.'' (Michelle V. Agins/New York Times

NEW YORK'S MOST RESPECTED OFFICERS LED PRECINCT WHERE SEX SCANDAL
FESTERED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They include the police commissioner of Philadelphia,
a Manhattan criminal court judge, and the chiefs who supervise New
York City's detective and transit police bureaus. The list of
former supervisors at the Midtown South precinct over the last 15
years reads like a ``Who's Who'' in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Police Commissioner Howard Safir has blamed a ``breakdown in
supervision'' at Midtown South for enabling officers there to have
sex with prostitutes routinely, often while on duty, without being
caught. He said the activity went on for as long as a decade and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Although police say there is no evidence to suggest that
supervisors knew about the activity, were the internal inquiry to
show otherwise, the department could find itself in the unenviable
position of having to interview former ranking officers at Midtown
South, one of the city's busiest station houses and one of its most
prestigious commands.
</P>
<P>
   As the department confronts the scandal, which has enveloped 23
officers so far, it remains unclear how deep investigators will dig
in exhuming the precinct's past.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators say the inquiry might have led to other
supervisors had a leak to the press not prompted the department to
end it on Thursday. In the last two weeks, they said, two officers
had told investigators the illegal activity was more extensive and
had gone on for longer than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers agreed to cooperate by obtaining incriminating
statements from other officers, the investigators said. It is
unknown whether the two cooperating officers named any supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a break, and it looked like it might take us into a
whole new realm,'' said an Internal Affairs Bureau investigator who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But we never got the chance to
follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Few details have emerged about how extensive the relationships
were over time between the police and prostitutes at the brothel,
at 335 W. 39th St., and at a massage parlor where officers were
filmed at least once entering and demanding sex.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Safir has transferred three precinct supervisors at
Midtown South, including the commander, Deputy Inspector Joseph
McKeever. But Manhattan police supervisors confirmed that McKeever
arrived at the precinct a year and a half ago, only after the
Internal Affairs Bureau and the Manhattan District Attorney's
office had begun their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mayronne, who commanded Midtown South in 1987 and 1988
before going on to become the department's chief spokesman, finally
retiring in 1996, said he could not believe that his officers were
frequenting the brothel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say definitely, but I would be very much surprised,''
he said by telephone from his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. But he
added that commanding officers ``rely on the lieutenants and the
sergeants, because they're out there more than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it seemed impossible that police officers could have
kept the ring secret for so long. ``Fifteen years?'' he said. ``I
mean, cops are tight-lipped, but they go to parties. Eventually it
would get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the prominent officers who led Midtown South are John
Timoney, once the precinct's executive officer, who later rose to
first deputy commissioner before leaving to become police
commissioner in Philadelphia; Chief of Detectives William Allee,
also once the precinct's No. 2, now one of the ``superchiefs'' who
make up Safir's cabinet; Chief George Brown, formerly its
commanding officer, who now heads the Transit Division; Deputy
Chief Michael Fox, also once commanding officer, now the
second-in-command of Patrol Borough Manhattan South, and Capt. John
Wasiak, once the precinct's executive officer, who heads the
dignitary protection unit in the Intelligence Division.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mayronne, none of those former precinct supervisors
could be reached for comment Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who oversaw Midtown South during the time the sex
ring is said to have existed developed reputations for being tough
on corruption, prostitution, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Brown became known for aggressive vice crackdowns when he ran
Midtown South. His officers figured out when prostitutes began
their workdays and arrested them as soon as they hit the street,
cutting into their earnings and driving many out of the precinct.  &QL;

METS TAKE PHILLIES' GIFT AND HAND IT RIGHT BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets held Family Day before their game with
Philadelphia Sunday when the children of players and executives
took turns hitting plastic balls and running around the bases. The
real family day came later, though, when the game was on the line
and when Al Leiter watched Mark Leiter pitch and Hal McRae watched
Brian McRae bat.
</P>
<P>
   The game didn't have to come down to that matchup in the 10th
inning or any of the other confrontations Mark Leiter had with the
Mets that inning and the one before. But the Mets' pitchers
squandered what had appeared to be a good lead, and then their
hitters suddenly couldn't hit to salvage a victory.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Phillies won, 7-6, in 10 innings and benefited
instead of the Mets in the National League wild-card race that has
10 weeks left.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies won by erupting for three runs to take a 6-5 lead
in the seventh inning against Jeff Tam and Bill Pulsipher, then by
scoring a run in the 10th against Dennis Cook. That one came on
Mike Lieberthal's fourth hit of the game, a single, and a double by
Ruben Amaro Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost, too, by getting only two hits in the last six
innings after John Olerud led off the fifth inning with a home run
for a 5-2 lead. They struck out for all three outs in three of
those innings, including the ninth, in which they tied the game
because Mark Leiter walked just about everybody in the ball park
except the children of the Mets' players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the dugout after the game and I brought my
son in there,'' Leiter related later. ``I said, `Mark, I almost
blew the game. I walked four guys in one inning.' He said, `Yeah,
but Dad, I walked six guys in one inning this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter was not present for his 7-year-old nephew's Little
League travails, but he sat in the Mets' dugout watching his older
brother pitch a symmetrically wild ninth inning. The Phillies
closer struck out McRae, then walked Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike
Piazza. He next struck out Butch Huskey and walked Olerud and
Bernard Gilkey, forcing in the tying run, before he struck out Luis
Lopez for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter professed at first to not being torn between wanting
his brother to pitch well in those circumstances and wanting his
team to tie and even win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be like that, when we were younger,'' Al said.
``We've both been around long enough. He's got plenty of other
chances to get saves.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later he added: ``If our guys get hits and we score
runs, great, we win. If he does well, I'm happy for him. It's out
of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And after another moment he said: ``It's definitely a
double-edged sword. He's still my brother. It's definitely tough to
watch. Now I know what my mom goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark was incredulous that Al had initially taken the position
that he essentially is a big boy and is on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's on the mound, I root for him,'' Mark said. ``Last
night he threw a great game, I was happy for him. I don't root
against my team, but when he does a good job, I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And furthermore, Mark went on, how could Al not feel for him in
that awful ninth inning? ``I don't know how he sat watching in the
ninth without being a wreck,'' Mark said. ``When he used to walk a
lot of guys, I used to go crazy watching. I'd say, `Throw a darn
strike.' If he didn't get frustrated watching me, that would
surprise me. If he could say he watched that game and wasn't
pulling for me to throw a strike, I'd be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   After Amaro drove in the tie-breaking run with only his second
hit in 16 at-bats right-handed this season, the Leiters got to go
through the agony again in the 10th. But this time Hal McRae, the
Phillies' hitting coach, was on the Al Leiter end of the family
drama.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Matt Franco lined a pinch-hit double to left
field, bringing up Brian McRae, the Mets' leadoff batter, who had
made five outs in five times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see him do well and be successful but not in that
situation,'' the elder McRae said. ``If he drives in a run, hits
the ball out of the ball park, which he almost did, we lose the
ball game. I want him to have a good day, but I don't want him to
make a play or get a hit to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   So he was rooting for his son to make another out? ``I would
like him to maybe hit it hard right at someone,'' the father said,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Brian's fly to deep right field did not beat the Phillies
because Bobby Abreu caught it. Franco went to third after the
catch, and Leiter walked Alfonzo again. That brought up Piazza,
whose father roots hard for him to win games.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the first pitch, the catcher lined a hanging
slider toward the left-field fence, but it was clearly going foul.
``I hit it well and just pulled it foul,'' Piazza said. ``I just
got out in front of it a little bit. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The next pitch was even more frustrating because Piazza missed
it completely, ending the game. ``It was a fastball away,'' Mark
Leiter said. ``I think he got himself out because it was down and I
don't think he was expecting me to throw a fastball 0-2. I think he
was looking off-speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither batter nor pitcher was looking for another walk.

RESIDENTS OF RURAL TOWN ASK WHY THEIR TEENAGERS TURN TO MURDER
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y. _ Heather Pettit, 16, sat in the searing heat
on the porch steps of her home on North Street in this Fulton
County town, holding a portable telephone. She said she was waiting
for someone to call her, or for something to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the beginning they're all, like, shocked,'' she
said, ``but I think in a couple of months, it's going to happen
again, and in a couple of months, it's going to happen again. And I
really think somebody has to do something about Gloversville.''
</P>
<P>
   After years without a single homicide, Fulton County had four in
the three months starting in February. One victim was tortured,
strangled and stuffed in a car trunk. One died of a shotgun blast.
Another, a 77-year-old man, was suffocated. As many as 30 students
at Gloversville High School were said to have known about that
killing two days before suspects in the case were arrested, but no
one said a word to a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   The spasm of violence is horror enough. But what is especially
chilling, people here say, is that the accused in three of the
slayings are teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County has only about 54,000 people, most of them in the
adjoining towns of Gloversville and Johnstown, which are about 40
miles northwest of Albany. The weight of pain and fear that has
descended so unexpectedly on so many other rural towns in recent
months, places where young people have killed without any sign of
remorse or expectation of escape, has come here, too. And like the
bloodshed in those other places, the slayings here have left
questions and contending answers on the lips of the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a theory.
</P>
<P>
   The new Committee on Youth Violence met. ``We had four judges,
the DA and myself, and it took us seven seconds to agree that it's
the parents, stupid,'' said Warren Greene, head of the county
probation office and a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Seroussi, mayor of Gloversville, said: ``You've got
violence on TV, you've got violence on the damn video games, you've
got the whole ghetto chic from the city. And it's all coming up
here to the rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalie Sweet, 42, a former glove maker, said that there was
nothing for young people to do anymore. ``When I was a kid they had
the Glove Theater and the Civic Center and the Littauer Playground
and lots of places you could go,'' Mrs. Sweet said as she hung out
in the heat on South Main Street with her 13-year old son, Terry,
and Terry's friend, Elvis Taylor, who is 18. ``Kids don't have any
of those things anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of all police arrests in Gloversville are of people younger
than 18, said John Harzinski, chief of police in Gloversville, and
43 percent are of children younger than 15. He could not compare
those numbers with earlier ones, but federal statistics underscore
the rise in violent youth crimes nationally. According to the
Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention, trials of juveniles for assault, robbery, rape or
homicide almost doubled from 1986 to 1995, to 377,300 from 190,000.
Juveniles are generally defined as people 18 and younger, but the
definition varies from state to state. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Fulton County's last murder had been in 1992,
and that one occurred several years after the previous one, so
people around here began wondering if the sudden spate of deaths
was some kind of copycat phenomenon that could go on and on. Polly
Hoye, the Fulton County district attorney, said it was more like an
infection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as violence appears to be happening around you, some
people begin to see themselves as able to be involved in something
like that,'' Ms. Hoye said. ``They don't see it as abhorrent, and
as others do it, they no longer see themselves as being incapable
of committing it.'' &QL;

 GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y.: committing it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spate of killings began on Feb. 23, the day Timothy Morgan,
19, got into a taxi in Gloversville with his shotgun and told
Joseph Boop, 46 to take him to Bleecker, the next town north, for
rabbit hunting. When they got there, the police said, Morgan shot
Boop twice with his shotgun, once at close range, and again as Boop
tried to escape in his cab. Maybe it was about the fare, officials
said. The district attorney may seek the death penalty for Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, prosecutors say, Amanda Djzierson, 20; Lucas
Whaley, 17; and Theodore Cook, 17, kidnapped Miss Djzierson's
former boyfriend, John Morgan, 19, tied him up inside Cook's filthy
home outside Johnstown, tortured him and then strangled him to
death. Apparently the victim, no relation to Timothy Morgan, owed
Miss Djzierson money for the phone bill and for pay-per-view movies
on television from the period they had been living together.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the slaying, the authorities say, Miss Djzierson
and Whaley drove around with John Morgan's body in the trunk of her
Geo, looking for help in disposing of it. They showed the corpse to
a relative of Whaley's, who refused to help and then called the
state police. The three suspects were arrested hours later with the
body still in the car. Whaley and Cook have been charged as adults
with second-degree murder, and Miss Djzierson has been charged with
kidnapping. They could all get life sentences if convicted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, the police said, John . LaVeille Jr., 39, fatally
bludgeoned William Holland, 49, in Johnstown after an argument over
money. It was the only homicide of the four not involving a youth,
and LaVeille is the only murder suspect in those cases who made any
effort to get away. He was recently arrested in Ohio and arraigned
on charges of second-degree murder on Thursday. The death penalty
may be sought against him.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the killings that shocked and frightened the people of
Gloversville and Johnstown this year, the worst by most accounts
occurred on May 24, on North Street, five houses down from Heather
Pettit's. For months, Robert Wittemeyer, 77, a retiree who lived at
155 North St., had complained to the Gloversville police about
petty break-ins and harassment by teen-age boys, and on May 27 the
police went to see Wittemeyer about one of the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   They found Mr. Wittemeyer's decomposing body tied to an easy
chair that had been tipped forward, pushing Wittemeyer's face into
the floor and slowly asphyxiating him. Cushions, clothes and an old
vacuum cleaner had been piled on top, adding to the weight on
Wittemeyer's face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested Heather's friend and next-door neighbor at
145 North St., Ronald Johnson 3rd, 16, and Bruce Insonia, also 16,
who lived around the corner at 23 John St..
</P>
<P>
   By the time the body was discovered, the police said, the two
youths had been riding around in Wittemeyer's old Buick for two
days, taking friends on rides and showing off a gun they said they
had taken from Wittemeyer. There were five youths in the car when
the police closed in, Ms. Hoye, the district attorney, said. Local
newspapers said that as many as 30 students at Gloversville High
School knew of the slaying for two days before the arrests, but
said nothing about it to any one in authority. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County had been the center of the leather tanning and
manufacturing trade since the pre-Revolutionary Leatherstocking
days of the Mohawk frontier. Now most of the leather business has
moved overseas, and after years of high unemployment and economic
decline, Fulton County has begun to recover, partly by attracting
new but modestly paying manufacturing and assembly jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy has improved, parts of the county retain a
downtrodden, tumbledown look _ the ``Appalachian look,'' as
Seroussi puts it. On some of Gloversville's tougher streets, people
say they can see the change in young people, particularly among
teen-agers pretending to be gang members. (When Whaley was arrested
in the slaying of John Morgan, the police said, he told them he was
a member of the Bloody Murder Gang.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carmelo D'Amore has been a guidance counselor at Johnstown High
School for more than 20 years, and he puts the blame squarely on
boomer-generation parents who never learned to be parents. ``The
kids haven't changed; we've changed,'' D'Amore said. ``Our parents
said `No!' even if they knew we were up to something. Today's
parents say, `Oh, I did that when I was their age. They'll get
through it like we did.' '' &QL;

EDITORIAL: NUCLEAR SECURITY FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   An ingenious arrangement that has encouraged Russia to convert
its stockpiles of bomb grade uranium into much less dangerous
civilian reactor fuel and earn precious cash in the process could
soon be undone. The Clinton administration, in a move that could
easily disable the arrangement, is planning to sell off the United
States Enrichment Corp., the government-owned company in charge of
buying the Russian uranium.
</P>
<P>
   As a private, profit-making business, the Enrichment Corp. will
have strong incentives to walk away from the Russian deal, which
competes with its more profitable core businesses. There are just a
few days left before the sell-off becomes final. Vice President Al
Gore, who helped negotiate the Russian uranium deal, or President
Clinton could stop it and should.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement with Moscow, Russia blends down its bomb
uranium to reactor fuel and sells it to the Enrichment Corp. Moscow
is paid for its blending services in cash and also receives
offsetting amounts of natural uranium, a much less dangerous
material, to compensate it for the underlying value of the uranium
that it turns over to the United States. This scheme depends on
Washington's ability to insulate uranium prices against adverse
market trends. That leverage would be lost under privatization.
</P>
<P>
   The Enrichment Corp. makes modest profits on the Russian deal,
but much less than it does by enriching domestically obtained
uranium in its own facilities. As a private company, it would be
strongly tempted to cut back or even eliminate purchases from
Russia, possibly by flooding the market with cheap natural uranium.
Saving the Russian deal would then require large taxpayer
subsidies, which Congress might not approve.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most prominent critics of the privatization plan are
Thomas Neff, the scientist who conceived of the Russian uranium
deal, and Joseph Stiglitz, who evaluated the economics of the sale
during his term as Clinton's chief economic adviser. Sen. Pete
Domenici, a sponsor of the privatization legislation and the
Senate's most influential voice on nuclear issues, recently urged
the White House to review the national security issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   With private companies also wary of purchasing the Enrichment
Corp., the administration has turned to the unusual expedient of
selling shares directly to the public. That promises rich
underwriting fees for Wall Street. But this deal offers little
economic gain for the taxpayer and risks big losses for American
nuclear security.  &QL;

 &HT;    Ellis says former coach will do great things at Texas
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Rookie defensive end Greg Ellis received a
telegram from his former coach after being drafted in the first
round in April. Mack Brown congratulated Ellis and thanked him for
his contribution to the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said Brown's arrival at the University of Texas will help
the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a wondeful coach,'' Ellis said of Brown. ``I'm not
criticizing the other coach (John Mackovic). I don't know him
personally. (Brown) will lock down the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that every kid who's recruited out of high school
will want to go to the University of Texas. That's how it was at
North Carolina, and Texas will be the same. I hate to say this _
I'm still rooting for North Carolina _ but I won't be surprised if
Texas contends for a national title pretty soon. He's got that
capability.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The season is already over for cornerback Wendell Davis. The
former Oklahoma Sooner tore knee ligaments in Saturday afternoon's
practice. This marks the third straight year Davis has had a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed Ron Bailey of Georgia to take his place.
Cornerback Deion Sanders might return to practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The average high temperature in Wichita Falls is expected to be
105 this week. Coach Chan Gailey said that will prompt the Cowboys
to make changes in their practice schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Cowboys will practice in pads and helmets only
in the morning sessions. They will wear shorts and T-shirts in the
afternoon. Also, when the Cowboys have only afternoon sessions
scheduled, Gailey expects to move those workouts to the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CRITICS CORNER _ Associated Press writer Denne Freeman predicts
the Cowboys will be 9-7: ``With a new coach and new enthusiasm,
they'll win three more games than they did last year. If Chan
Gailey thinks he can get this team in the playoffs, he has me
convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE OF THE DAY _ Gailey was asked about the pass-interference
penalties cornerback Kevin Smith received last year: ``If I start
commenting on penalties, I'd get in trouble from the league. You
can say some of those were worthy and some of those were not
worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   NOTES _ The Cowboys will play in a golf social today and will
not work out. They return to two-a-day workouts at 9 a.m. Tuesday.
... The Cowboys are expected to keep six wide receivers on the
roster: Michael Irvin, Billy Davis, Ernie Mills, Jimmy Oliver,
Stepfret Williams and Macey Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Oliver, the former TCU standout will return
kickoffs. Oliver and Sanders are considered the fastest players on
the team. ... Tight end David LaFleur has been practicing his deep
snaps and might be used at that position if veteran Dale Hellestrae
gets hurt. ... Former Texas Tech quarterback Zebbie Lethridge has
``held his own'' as a cornerback, Gailey said, but added, ``He's
not where he needs to be.''

NATION'S 4TH-LARGEST VINEYARD MAY GO PUBLIC TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
The initial public offering of Golden State Vintners, the nation's
fourth-largest vineyard, is expected to get priced and rolled out
as early as tomorrow, financial industry sources say.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The offering is expected to raise about $40.9 million, with 4.3
million shares going on the block at a price between $16 and $19.
Lead manager of the offering is Goldman Sachs with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist and J.P. Morgan as co-managers of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Buying wine stocks can be as tricky as collecting vintage vino.
But investors who like to drink wine are finding it fun (and
sometimes profitable) to own shares in vineyards. &UR;  &LR; The October IPO
of Beringer Wine Estates, also underwritten by Goldman, was so
popular it shot up 25 percent to $32.50 on its first day of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State, based in Greenbrae, may be the biggest California
vineyard and winery you've never heard of. &UR;  &LR; And while its name may
sound more like a motor oil than a fine wine, you probably have
sipped its grape without even knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State, among other things, is a private label producer of
bulk wines that supplies such established brands as Sebastiani
Vineyards and Sutter Home Winery. It also produces wines, usually
in the $10 or less category, under its own proprietary names, such
as Summerfield.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's more to Golden State than just wine-making. It also
provides various services to larger wineries that like to outsource
in order to slash costs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Robert Mondavi Winery and Beringer Wine Estates,
two of California's largest publicly held wine concerns, have
contracts with Golden State for services such as barrel
fermentation and storage, according to Securities and Exchange
Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   And before you turn up your nose at wine that costs less than 10
bucks a bottle, consider that 83 percent of all wine consumed in
the United States is in this category, according to Lewis Perdue,
publisher of Wine Investment News in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 category is under such severe price pressure these days
from oversupply that vineyards are looking for ways to squeeze
margins and become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine prices are dropping like a lead blimp,'' Perdue says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  While Golden State has a Northern California address, 9,600
acres of its vineyards are in the Central Valley, which is better
known for its table grapes and raisins than it is for Chardonnay
vines.
</P>
<P>
   And at first blush, that causes some wine drinkers to pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite effort on their part to change their
Central Valley image,'' says George Schofield, a vineyard
consultant in St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   Modesto may not ring as impressively as Sonoma, but Golden
State's refined and advanced wine-making processes have allowed it
to make some decent wines for under a sawbuck &UR; ,  &LR; Perdue says. For
example, three of the top 13 Chardonnays rated by Wine Spectator
magazine in the under-$10 category were made exclusively from
Golden State's wine.
</P>
<P>
   Wine snobs ``would call anything from the Central Valley crap,''
but Golden State ``has been known to make good wine from Central
Valley grapes,'' Perdue says.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody must be drinking the stuff. Over the past five years,
the company has seen its revenues increased 19 percent a year.
Revenues in fiscal year 1997 were $95.8 million while net income
was $6.17 million, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are risks. A couple of clouds hang over Golden
State that investors should be aware of, Perdue says.
</P>
<P>
   The company is carrying a heavy amount of debt, $30.2 million,
and it may be losing future business with E.J. Gallo Winery, a
major customer, Perdue says. A spokeswoman for Golden State was
unable to comment due to the pre-offering quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Still, the strengths of Golden State's diversified operation
may outweigh any negatives. Says Perdue: The winery is ``as
well-positioned as any wine company in the business.''

IMPRESS THE BOSS WITH YOUR WORK, NOT KISSING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I just got a new job and want to start out on a good foot.
What's the best way to be on good terms with my manager without
kissing up to him?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Good managers don't want ``yes people'' who will follow
their orders without an independent thought. They want employees
who are enthusiastic, work hard and can work cooperatively as part
of a team _ but that's not the same thing as ``kissing up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a manager, I look for someone who lives and breathes our
mission,'' said Abby Snay, executive director of Jewish Vocational
Services, a San Francisco career counseling agency. ``A manager can
tell if someone is just kissing up or if they're sincerely
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of worrying about how to be on good terms with your
manager, focus on how to succeed in your job. If you're doing your
work well, chances are that you'll get along just fine with your
boss.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips for starting out at a new workplace:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scope out the organizational culture. If everyone works until
5:30 p.m., don't leave at 4:45 p.m. Find out what skills or styles
are most valued. Figure out who the truly respected employees are _
and then befriend one or two from whom you can learn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be afraid to ask questions. Clarify what your boss
really wants from you. ``Sometimes a manager will say, `Get the
report done soon,' '' said John Vercelli, a former manager who is
now a career coach with Coaching Resource Inc. in Burlingame. ``The
employee assumes he means next Wednesday. But the manager means by
lunchtime.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Do your own job really well, no matter how elementary it
seems. Then find ways to help the company that go beyond the basics
of your job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set up a time line for performance reviews with your boss _
maybe after your first month but certainly by the end of your first
90 days. That way, little issues won't have a chance to grow into
big problems.
</P>
<P>
   Want to read more? Take a look at ``Your First 30 Days: Building
a Professional Image in a New Job,'' by Elwood Chapman. It's a
short, very basic how-to book that's available for $10.95 from
Crisp Publications in Menlo Park at (800) 442-7477.
</P>
<P>
   For another easy-to-read book that takes a somewhat longer-range
view, try ``Rules for the Road: Surviving Your First Job Out of
School,'' by Eve Luppert (Perigee, $13).
</P>
<P>
   You also can check out ``How to Be a Star at Work,'' by Robert
E. Kelley (Times Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I had knee surgery last fall that kept me home for two
months. When I came back to work, my boss called me in and told me
I wasn't needed anymore because the people who had filled in for me
were doing such a good job. Is it legal for them to fire me like
that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Your company sounds like it's on shaky legal ground here.
By firing you, it may have violated federal and state laws that
protect employees on medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act, signed by President Clinton in
1993, applies to workplaces with 50 or more employees. It states
that companies must give eligible workers 12 weeks of unpaid time
off each year if they have or adopt a baby, face a serious health
problem or have a family member with a serious health problem.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLA requires companies to give workers their jobs back
after those 12 weeks unless something happens while they're gone,
such as a broad set of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knee surgery would probably qualify as a serious health
condition, so this would be a job-protected leave,'' said Claudia
Center, an attorney with the nonprofit Employment Law Center in San
Francisco. ``They can't take this person's job away unless there's
a legitimate reduction in force that would have occurred anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get more information on FMLA _ including an excellent
free question-and-answer booklet _ from the National Partnership
for Women &AMP; Families. Call (202) 986-2600, or visit their Web site
at www.nationalpartnership.org.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talk to a lawyer about your case. If your company has
violated your FMLA rights, federal law could require it to pay you
twice the amount of your lost wages. State law could hold the
company liable for punitive damages, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Employment Law Center offers free advice on FMLA issues, at
(800) 880-8047. The National Employment Lawyers Association can
refer you to a private attorney with experience in FMLA cases, at
(415) 227-4655.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I'm a bottom-rung supervisor on salary, and my boss
recently has started to schedule me for five 10-hour days each
week. Is this proper and/or legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The answer depends on whether you're being correctly
classified as an exempt employee.
</P>
<P>
   If you're truly exempt from overtime laws, you're required to
put in as many hours as necessary to get the job done. That might
be 35 hours, 50 hours or 80 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not an exempt employee, California law says your
company must pay you time-and-a-half whenever you put in more than
40 hours in one week.
</P>
<P>
   Simply being paid a salary rather than an hourly wage doesn't
automatically mean that you're exempt from overtime pay. Instead,
exempt status depends on a variety of factors related to the
content of your job _ such as whether you supervise two or more
other people, have hiring and firing authority, and spend more than
half your time on managerial tasks.
</P>
<P>
   This can be a really confusing area. And in fact, there's a
growing number of lawsuits by bottom-rung supervisors who claim
that their firms misclassified them as exempt in an effort to avoid
paying overtime.
</P>
<P>
   So check with a lawyer to see whether you've been classified
correctly. Or call the California Labor Commissioner at (415)
557-7878 to get a copy of the exemption criteria for your specific
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about your workplace or career, your boss or an
employee? Send it to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San Francisco
Chronicle, 901 Mission Street, San Francisco 94103. Or send e-mail
to workways &LR; sfgate.com. Or call (415) 764-2815. We can't respond to
each query in person, but we will answer as many in print as we

NETTING A JOB THROUGH SPECIALIZED WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL EMERT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Scott Dahl had been given notice by his employer and needed to find
a new job fast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspaper classifieds were of little help because Dahl's field _
funeral-parlor marketing _ is an esoteric one. But after 20 minutes
surfing the World Wide Web, Dahl, a resident of Cleveland, found a
want ad at Funeralnet (www.funeralnet.com) that seemed promising.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, he received a response to an e-mail query, and
in two days, he had a face-to-face interview. One month after his
Web search began, he was on the job at Brunner Funeral Home, 20
miles from his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so easy, as opposed to sending out resumes in the mail,
waiting a week and then getting a postcard saying, `You may hear
from us in six more weeks,''' said Dahl, who before his Web search
had mailed out dozens of paper resumes with no results.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl's experience is not typical, of course. Job hunting over
the Web generally involves a substantial time commitment and many
megabytes of frustration, just like conventional job searches.
</P>
<P>
   But Dahl's case does illustrate the value of the Web for
job-seeking in highly specialized fields. In the mortuary business,
for example, there are no nationwide trade publications, so a Web
site is the perfect way to reach members in the geographically
diverse industry.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past two years, hundreds of helpful Web sites have
been created with information for highly specialized groups. Some
of the sites are strictly employment related while others,
including Funeralnet, list classifieds as one of many features.
</P>
<P>
   Employment experts recommend that job seekers try targeted Web
sites before approaching humongous career sites such as America's
Job Bank (www.ajb.dni.us) whose hundreds of thousands of job
listings can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a smattering of examples of specialized sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Starchefs (www.starchefs.com), which started as a
consumer-oriented Web site with recipes and chef profiles, has
become an important employment resource in the restaurant industry.
It currently lists about 300 job listings and 200 resumes for chefs
and other restaurant personnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty Plus of Northern California (www.sirius.com/40plus)
posts resumes for professionals aged 40 and over. To use the site,
people must pay a membership fee, attend meetings and volunteer
time to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saludos Web (www.saludos.com) offers a job bank and a resume
database for Spanish-speaking professionals and recent college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Produce Job Exchange (www.producejobs.com) lists resumes
and jobs for positions such as produce brokers and grocery store
vegetable buyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Layover.com (www.layover.com) is a key resource for truckers
who stay connected to the non-interstate world through their
laptops. It contains listings for full-time jobs and individual
hauls for independent truckers, as well as information on labor
disputes, trucker health and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asia-Net (www.asia-net.com) matches job openings with job
seekers who speak English and Asian languages such as Japanese,
Korean or Mandarin. Asia-Net posts helpful information such as a
salary index and job listings. It also e-mails new listings to a
database of 40,000 bilingual professionals, mostly in technical and
financial fields.
</P>
<P>
   _ List Foundation (www.listfoundation.org) caters mainly to
multimedia types. It lists Bay Area jobs and other information for
the South of Market crowd, including apartment classifieds and art
gallery openings.
</P>
<P>
   _ COACH (www.coachhelp.com) lists football-coaching openings as
far away as Australia and has resumes for coaches of all sports.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women in Technology International (www.witi.com) offers job
and resume databases, employer profiles and electronic networking
opportunities for women in technical fields.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines are the best way to find relevant Web sites. Dahl
said he found Funeralnet quickly by plugging in the search words
``funeral industry'' on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Another good resource is the book Career Xroads
(www.careerxroads.com), by Gerry Crispin and Mark Mehler, which is
updated annually. The 1998 version lists the 500 top job-hunting
sites, and next year's may have as many as 700.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers may be charged a small fee, such as $20, to post a
resume on some sites, but most get paid only by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Asia-Net, for example, charges employers $795 to e-mail job
notices to thousands of potential applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites operate their classifieds for free. Funeralnet and
Starchefs, for example, provide the ads as a service to both
employers and job seekers. Starchefs is thinking about starting to
charge, though, now that its classified section has become so
popular, said site co-founder Fern Berman.
</P>
<P>
   Career Xroads co-author Mehler advises job hunters to use
services that e-mail job notices to them, rather than posting their
resumes in Web databanks. That minimizes the chance a current
employer will come across the resume, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites will post ``blind'' resumes _ without names, home
addresses and, sometimes, current employers _ to protect job
candidates' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   COMPANY SITES
</P>
<P>
   Job postings on corporate home pages are another good way for
Web job seekers to target their searches as long as they know for
which companies they want to work.
</P>
<P>
   QVC Inc., for example, uses newspaper classifieds less often
since it began posting jobs on its Web site (www.IQVC.com). This
year, more than a quarter of new hires responded to job notices on
the corporate home page, said Jean Brown, manager of human
resources at the Westchester, Pa.-based cable network.
</P>
<P>
   IQVC's job section is getting so much traffic that QVC is
planning to launch a separate employment-related Web site, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the standard job listings, a few businesses post
interactive exercises to help job hunters evaluate whether they
would be a good fit at the company.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas Instruments' ``Fit Check'' (www.ti.com)
allows potential applicants to answer a range of questions on
topics such as whether they prefer a smoke-free environment,
whether they are team players and what type of corporate dress code
they like best.
</P>
<P>
   Then, TI compares the applicants' responses to the answers that
fit best with Texas Instruments' corporate policies and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting's Web site (www.ac.com) allows potential
applicants to plug in various criteria such as their area of
expertise, salary requirement, preferred city of residence and
willingness to travel. The site then churns out matches.
</P>
<P>
   To research potential employers, Mehler recommends Hoover's
Online (www.hoovers.com), a storehouse of corporate information.
E-mail addresses for human resources staff or other personnel at
your employer of choice often can be found through the HotBot
search engine (www.hotbot.com).
</P>
<P>
   Advice on laying out a resume for computer purposes can be found
at the Web site of Resumix (www.resumix.com), a maker of staffing
software.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   If the targeted Web sites don't bear fruit, Mehler suggests that
applicants check one of the mega job sites such as Monster Board,
Career Mosaic (www.careermosaic.com), Online Career Center
(www.occ.com) and Nation Job (www.nationjob.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other good sites include Job Smart (www.jobsmart.org), which
specializes in California-based jobs, and Career Path
(www.careerpath.com), an assemblage of classifieds from 58
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent college grads should check out JobDirect
(www.jobdirect.com), JobTrak (www.jobtrak.com), JobWeb
(www.jobweb.org) and BridgePath Employment Services
(www.bridgepath.com).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the plethora of resources available on the Web, Mehler
encourages job applicants to use conventional search techniques as
well, especially networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is still just a tool _ it will never replace
face-to-face communication,'' Mehler said. ``I believe in three to
five years, the maximum the Web will have is 25 to 35 percent of
the job market,'' up from an estimated 3 to 5 percent today.

BILL WOULD EASE ROTH IRA INCOME-LIMIT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
For those with annual incomes hovering near the $100,000 limit, the
conversion to Roth IRAs from traditional IRAs has been tricky. Roth
IRAs are those popular new individual retirement accounts that
offer the chance to accumulate tax-free retirement income versus
tax-deferred income for regular IRAs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   To convert a traditional IRA to a Roth, your adjusted gross
income for the year can't exceed $100,000. That can be a problem
for some investors because it's not always easy to predict what
your income will be at the end of the year, given variables such as
investments and other sources of income.
</P>
<P>
   Because IRS penalties for exceeding the income limit still are
murky, many individuals near the $100,000 income mark have
hesitated to convert their accounts, fearing potential taxes or
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But a bill now awaiting the president's approval would allow
investors until April 15 of the following year to reverse an IRA
conversion _ with no penalties _ if their income ended up being
above the limit. The amendment is part of the IRS reform bill that
the president is expected to sign tomorrow. You can keep up with
the latest news on Roth IRAs at www.rothira.com.
</P>
<P>
   HOME OWNERSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Americans' optimism about home ownership is at a seven-year
high, according to a recent survey by Fannie Mae. About 29 percent
of those surveyed in 1998 said that not having enough cash for a
down payment and closing costs is an obstacle to buying a home.
That's down from 52 percent who cited the same obstacle in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the percentage of respondents who named job insecurity as an
obstacle to home-buying dropped from 48 percent in 1996 to 13
percent this year. Low interest rates and continued economic growth
are driving the trends, Fannie Mae said. Fannie Mae is a private
company with a federal charter to buy mortgages from lenders and
then sell them to investors.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN-CARD SCAM
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of opportunists are taking advantage of
non-U.S. citizens hoping to win in the annual green-card, or
``diversity,'' lottery, according to the State Department. The
lottery is a program that gives out 50,000 permanent resident
visas, or green cards, to natives of countries that historically
haven't had many emigrants.
</P>
<P>
   There is no charge to enter the lottery, but every year, scam
artists send out misleading information to would-be entrants,
charging up to $100 to expedite the process. You can find out more
about the legitimate entry requirements by calling the Bureau of
Consular Affairs at (800) 884-8840 (the call costs $5.10) or by
checking out http:// travel.state.gov.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG INVESTOR FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   I received many calls last week for contact information for
Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham's Young Investor Fund after last Monday's
story, ``Fund for Youngsters Appeals to Adults, Too.'' You can
phone (800) 338-2550 for a prospectus.

DOOMSAYERS RANT, BUT YEAR 2000 MAY NOT BE ARMAGEDDON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
As the end of the Millennium approaches, a few economists have
joined preachers of the apocalypse to warn that computers sent
haywire by the Year 2000 problem will drag the economy down with
them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most famous of these doomsayers is Edward Yardeni, chief
economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. He now estimates the
probability of a ``severe global Y2K recession'' at 70 percent.
Stock investors, he warns, easily could lose $1 trillion in the
resulting market collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But more-sober experts liken its probable effects to a
good-sized natural disaster _ plenty costly but far from hobbling
the economy. ``We view Y2K as a tremor, not a quake,'' said
economist Alex Patelis in a recent analysis for Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates for fixing the problem range from a low of about $50
billion (from Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward Kelley Jr.) to
$200 billion (Gartner Group). This cost, while large, represents
0.6 percent to 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product. And the
impact will be softened because it will be spread out over several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fixing or replacing defective computer code is
analogous to fixing or replacing lost bridges, highways and
buildings after an earthquake or hurricane, Patelis argues. Modern
economies have survived disasters in which costs approach those of
the so-called Y2K problem, including the Kobe earthquake ($100
billion) and Northridge temblor ($60 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Based on history and economic logic, Patelis sees several likely
aftershocks from the Y2K problem:
</P>
<P>
   _ The economy will suffer a loss of productivity as programmers
and information systems managers divert attention from other issues
to fixing or converting date fields in their software.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spending in the information sector will rise as the government
and private sector focus resources on the problem. Ironically, that
could show up in the statistics as an increase in GDP, much as
disaster-recovery spending does.
</P>
<P>
   _ The demand for specialized programmers will continue to drive
up wages in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ The costs of conversion will show as lower corporate profits
or higher consumer prices _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, there will be unknown costs stemming from disruption
of institutions that fail to convert their systems in time. But
most programmers are focusing on fixing critical applications
first, so the disruption should be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Unless many more computers fail than expected when Jan. 1, 2000,
rolls around, ``The impact would be similar to the economic effects
of a snowstorm,'' said Rick Egelton, an economist at Harris
Bank/Bank of Montreal. He predicts ``a temporary reduction in sales
as suppliers are unable to produce or deliver their products and
consumers are unable to spend because paychecks have been
delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Patelis notes that the current economic expansion has chugged
along unperturbed by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 22-day
closure of the federal government in December 1995 and the shutdown
of the Northeast by winter storms in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economies are resilient and can adjust quickly to temporary
shocks,'' Patelis concludes, ``especially when such shocks are
anticipated, as is the case with Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GAP WIDENS
</P>
<P>
   As if caught on the wrong side of an economic fault line, most
California workers are losing ground relative to the rest of the
country as their wages continue to slip.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the median (middle-ranking) worker in California made
$11.43 an hour, a drop (adjusted for inflation) of 1.5 percent over
1996. By contrast, the median worker nationally gained 2.4 percent,
to earn $10.82 an hour in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the median worker in only five states made more than
the median wage in California. But California's median has
plummeted 11 percent since then, adjusted for inflation, putting 13
states ahead of it.
</P>
<P>
   California paychecks shrank in the face of the state's unusually
long and steep recession earlier this decade. The effects of that
recession still are felt in California's unemployment rate, which
at 5.7 percent is much higher than the national rate of 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market has done wonders for low-paid workers in
the rest of the country. Last year, real hourly wages of workers at
the 20th percentile of pay jumped 3 percent, according to new
tabulations by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, wages of relatively poor workers fell nearly
1 percent last year. Their economic plight has been compounded,
among other factors, by growing numbers of low-skilled immigrants
who put pressure on the low end of the state's labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``California wages at the middle and bottom both took a big hit
in the 1990s,'' said Economic Policy Institute economist Jared
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is doing badly in California. Data from the
Franchise Tax Board, recently released by the state Assembly Select
Committee on the California Middle Class _ no kidding about that
name _ shows that 40,000 taxpayers declared incomes of $1 million
to $25 million in 1996, up from 23,000 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And an amazing 376 taxpayers _ termed ``Supernova earners'' by
the committee _ declared incomes of $25 million or more, nearly
triple the number in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the Public Policy Institute of California found
a sharp rise in income inequality in California during the past 30
years, particularly since 1980. By 1989, only five states,
including Arkansas and Louisiana, had a wider gap between rich and
poor households.

MCCARRON WINS THREE STAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Chris McCarron is about to win the Hollywood
Park riding title. Or is it the Hollywood Park Film Festival?
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, a 43-year-old Hall of Famer, credits morning study
sessions in the officials' film room for his return to the top of
the local jockey standings. And Sunday he added to his personal
highlight reel by winning three stakes, one short of the national
record for a single card, to take a 52-50 lead over Corey Nakatani
into closing day.
</P>
<P>
   While Nakatani went winless Sunday, McCarron rode Old Trieste to
a fabulous, 12-length victory in the Swaps Stakes, and won aboard
Uncaged Fury in the Answer Do, and Spirited Jacklyn in the Valkyr
Handicap. McCarron didn't ride in the Sunset Handicap, won by River
Bay and Alex Solis, or the Hollywood Juvenile Championship, won by
Yes It's True and Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer start a meet thinking, `I want to be leading
rider,''' said McCarron, whose 1995 Del Mar title was his last of
24 in California. ``I concentrate more on the quality of my mounts
than the quantity.... But when I'm in contention, my competitive
juices get going.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Park's 67-day meet, ``I started with a bang and my
adrenaline started flowing.'' So, in addition to exercising horses
six mornings a week, he spent from 20 to 90 minutes each racing day
analyzing tapes of his upcoming mounts and their competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the $500,000 Swaps, though, the difference wasn't study, it
was the early speed of Old Trieste, who put away his 3-year-old
opponents on the turn to embarrass Grand Slam, Old Topper and
slow-starting fifth-place finisher Shot of Gold. Look out for Old
Trieste at any distance short of 1\ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McCarron rides four horses, including favored Sam's in
the Robert K. Kerlan Memorial Handicap, and Nakatani six.
</P>
<P>
   Among trainers, meanwhile, Craig Dollase got his 19th winner,
Six Point Eight, clinching at least a tie for his first title.
Sandy Shulman has 16 and three horses today.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Del Mar's opening feature Wednesday, the Oceanside for
3-year-olds without a stakes win, overflowed with entries and was
divided for the 10th straight year and the 15th of 18.... Today
marks the last major-track thoroughbred racing in Los Angeles
County for 10 weeks _ until Oak Tree at Santa Anita opens Sept. 30.
Del Mar will be followed by minor-league Fairplex Park, Sept.
10-27....

   Favorite Trick edged Tomorrows Cat in the 1 1/16-mile Long
Branch Breeders' Cup Stakes at Monmouth. It was the first start for
the 1997 Horse of the Year since he ran eighth in the Kentucky
Derby.... Santa Anita-based Classic Cat won the Ohio Derby in a
photo over One Bold Stroke at Thistledown. Shane Sellers rode....
Hollywood Park will finish with a track record for average daily
wagering, $11 million, up 8 percent from 1997. Chairman R.D.
Hubbard said the increase more than makes up for declines of 2
percent in on-track wagering and 4 percent in on-track attendance.

HOW TO BECOME A STAR IN THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
OK, so your thighs are too thick, your brows are too bushy and your
diction too drawling to ever make it as a Hollywood star.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But you _ in fact, almost anyone _ still can be a star at work.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message of a new book by Robert E. Kelley, a Carnegie
Mellon University professor who spent 10 years researching the
kinds of people who are considered star performers in their
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a slew of books out there by self-styled career
gurus offering up their personal tips on how to succeed in the
business world.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley's effort was different because he attempted to survey
_ objectively and scientifically _ the actual common
characteristics of star performers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley went in assuming that workplace stars all would share
some common personality traits _ such as above-average
intelligence, driving ambition, willingness to work 14-hour days,
or good schmoozing skills. He assumed that workplace stars were
born, not made.
</P>
<P>
   The results completely shocked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After testing, we found no difference between stars and
average performers in any of these (personality) categories,'' said
Kelley, whose book is titled, ``How to Be a Star at Work'' (Times
Books, $25). ``The day I had to go in and tell the sponsors of my
research that we hadn't come up with anything was a very, very sad
day in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His assumptions blown to smithereens, Kelley switched gears. He
took another look at his research data and concluded that stars did
in fact have something in common _ but it wasn't personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (initial setback) forced us to stop focusing on what
people bring to the party and focus instead on how they do their
jobs,'' he said. ``What we discovered is that stars are made, not
born. They have a fundamentally different conception of what work
is.''
</P>
<P>
   So you, too, can be one of your company's stars _ even if you're
not a 180-IQ, Type A, Harvard graduate with the glad-handing skills
of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Just what do you have to do?
</P>
<P>
   Kelley singles out nine specific work strategies common to star
performers, whether they're white-collar computer executives or
blue-collar telephone repair people.
</P>
<P>
   The strategies at first sound cliched _ not very different from
the conventional advice offered up by many other career gurus.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley says star performers implement this advice in very
different ways from average performers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what he calls the nine ``breakthrough strategies'' of
star employees:
</P>
<P>
   _ Initiative _ Average performers think that they're taking
initiative when they come up with a faster or better way to do
their job.
</P>
<P>
   Star performers go beyond that _ excelling at their own work but
also coming up with new ideas outside the bounds of their own job
that help the company achieve its most important goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Networking _ Average performers think of networking as
something to do at cocktail parties in order to find a new job. But
star performers use networking as a way to do their current job
better _ sharing information with knowledgeable people who can help
them get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Average performers wait until they need some information, then
cold-call someone to get it,'' Kelley said. ``Stars know that you
can't get work done today without a knowledge network and that
you've got to put it in place beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-management _ Average performers think that they're
managing their time well if their desk is clean, their DayTimer is
full and their projects are being finished on time. Star performers
look at a bigger picture _ figuring out which parts of their work
are most important to the company's success and to their own
careers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Average performers spend a lot of time checking their to-do
list, while stars spend more time figuring out what should be ON
their to-do list,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perspective _ Average performers tend to see things from their
own points of view. Stars are able to view things from a variety of
different angles _ from the viewpoint of their boss, co-workers,
clients and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good followers _ We tend to think of stars as leaders, but
everyone's got to be a follower sometimes, too. Star performers
know how to work cooperatively with a leader even when there are
personality differences. They continue to be creative and use
independent judgment even when they're not in charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leadership _ Average performers often think that being a
leader requires huge amounts of charisma, vision or at least a
corner office. But star performers lead by knowing how to bring out
the best in other people, even without a high-ranking job title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most stars don't have the power to hire or fire or give
raises,'' Kelley said. ``So they try to understand, `What do the
people following me get out of it?' They pay real close attention
to the needs of their followers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Teamwork _ Everyone talks about teams these days, but star
performers are selective about what kinds of workplace teams to
join. They try to avoid meetings-for-meetings'-sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When stars ARE on a team,'' Kelley said, ``they pay very close
attention to the team and whether it's accomplishing its goals.
They make sure there are periodic checkpoints, that people are on
board. They make commitments and deliver on them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Organizational savvy _ Many average performers turn up their
noses at office politics as something dirty. Stars avoid needless
involvement in workplace melodramas, but they pay close attention
to how their organization works. They identify the competing
interests within their company, and how to manage those interests
to achieve their work goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Show-and-tell _ The workplace of the 1990s requires people to
present their ideas to groups more than ever before. Star
performers have the skills to get their points across _ whether at
a formal meeting or around the water cooler. Or if they really
don't feel comfortable making presentations, they team up with a
buddy who can handle that part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, employees also must have the basic skills and
intelligence needed to do their job before they can even think
about becoming a star.
</P>
<P>
   If someone's never been any good with numbers, even the greatest
teamwork or leadership abilities won't make him or her into a star
accountant.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley said his research should send an encouraging message
not just to employees, but to their managers: There's no innate
gene for workplace stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that when people learned these work strategies,
within a year their productivity rates went up 100 percent,''
Kelley said. ``Theoretically, it's possible that everyone can be a
star performer. And even if they don't become a star, they can
still improve their performance.''

ROAD TRIP ROBS YANKS OF THEIR USUAL GUSTO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The dog days of August do not officially begin for a
couple of weeks, but the New York Yankees' play on Sunday had that
dog-days feel to it, a staleness, as if they had been standing in
the sun too long.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Yankees may or may not prove to be one of the great
clubs of this century, but on Sunday they played like just another
team at the end of a long road trip, losing to Toronto, 9-3. Andy
Pettitte (12-6) allowed three home runs _ Jose Canseco hit two of
them _ in his first defeat in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As they begin a weeklong homestand Monday with a double-header
against the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees have a 92-game record of
68-24, which is one victory behind that of the 1902 Pittsburgh
Pirates. The Yankees will play 42 of their final 70 games at Yankee
Stadium, where they have won 33 of 39 so far.
</P>
<P>
   They respond to most losses with indignation, but as they packed
their bags Sunday, they seemed relieved, mostly. Some of the
Yankees have not been home since before the All-Star Game break;
Derek Jeter joked that he could not remember his way back to his
apartment. ``I'm going to see the Empire State Building,'' Jeter
said, like an excited tourist. ``The Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said: ``I can't wait to get home. This has been a long
trip, man. Four cities. We had a great trip.''
</P>
<P>
   They won seven of 11 overall. But, as Manager Joe Torre noted,
it ended poorly, three losses in the last four games. They made
more mistakes Sunday than they usually do in a week, and in spite
of the one-sided final score, there were a handful of moments when
the Yankees could have turned the game in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   They forced Woody Williams (9-4), Toronto's starting pitcher,
into throwing 37 pitches in the first two innings and then loaded
the bases with nobody out in the third. Bernie Williams, batting
with a full count, got a shoulder-high fastball _ and swung and
missed, a strikeout that crippled the rally; the Yankees mustered
just one run. ``A bad at-bat,'' said the Yankees' center fielder.
``A terrible at-bat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pettitte had great stuff and great control in the first two
innings, retiring six straight batters, overmatching Toronto, a
poor offensive team. A shutout seemed within the realm of
possibility. After a double and a walk in the third, Toronto had
two on and one out, and Tony Phillips at the plate. Pettitte fired
a fastball past Phillips for strike three, and with the runners
moving, catcher Joe Girardi threw to third, the ball beating
Toronto's Craig Grebeck. Inning over, Pettitte thought, pumping a
fist as he turned and headed for the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But Grebeck was called safe by Mark Johnson, the third-base
umpire. Scott Brosius, the third baseman, argued the call along
with Torre, but Brosius acknowledged that his own movement may have
confused Johnson: Brosius had delayed his break to the third-base
bag because of the 3-2 count to Phillips, and then tripped,
catching the ball off balance as a result, and made the tag with a
lunge rather than being set and deft with his tag. ``It may have
looked funny to him,'' Brosius said, ``because I was stumbling and
bumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   With first base open, Pettitte worked around Shannon Stewart,
issuing a four-pitch walk to get to Canseco. Pettitte was confident
he could retire Canseco with inside fastballs. Pettitte fell behind
two balls and no strikes, then tried throwing a fastball inside. He
missed his target, leaving the ball over the plate. Canseco, his
biceps twitching below his shirt sleeves, hammered the ball over
the wall in left, a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very satisfying at-bat,'' said Canseco,
offended that Pettitte preferred to pitch to him rather than
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on it later, Pettitte said he might have lost his
concentration after believing he had been out of the inning on
Girardi's throw to third. Maybe, he said, he just lost his focus.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Pettitte gave up seven walks, matching a
career high, and two additional home runs, monster shots. In the
fifth inning, Carlos Delgado became the first left-handed hitter to
drive a ball into the upper deck at the Skydome, a 469-footer, and
in the seventh, Canseco launched a ball off the facing of the fifth
deck in left field, 460 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Chad Curtis was picked off second in the fourth
inning, and an inning later, the same thing happened to Paul
O'Neill, Girardi throwing a towel in the dugout in frustration.
Mistakes were acknowledged afterward, but nobody seemed in the mood
for self-examination. The road warriors had run out of gas, and
they were ready to go home, finally.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first-base coach, was hit in the
right side of his head by an errant throw in the fifth inning and
went down, frightened that he was hit in the same place where he
fractured his skull six years ago. In 1992 Cardenal was hit by a
batted ball as he was working with a Cincinnati minor-league
player, and with his life in jeopardy, he was rushed to a hospital.
A plate was inserted into the right side of his head, at about the
same spot where he was hit Sunday. Cardenal was replaced by Chris
Chambliss before the sixth inning, but he reported only a light
headache after the game and made a few jokes at his own expense.
... Orlando Hernandez may start against Detroit on Wednesday with
three days' rest, if Ramiro Mendoza is needed in relief during
Monday's double-header.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   I was early for my tennis game at Central Park and decided to
look at the skirts in the tennis house shop. I took one to the
women's locker room, where two women, probably in their 70s,
scrutinized me as I tried it on.
</P>
<P>
   One of them said, ``Nice, how much does it cost?'' I replied,
``$45.'' Both frowned and the second woman said I should wait for
the sales or try the new sports store that replaced a Woolworth's.
``Why are you telling her to go there _ it's expensive,'' the first
woman said. The two then began a back and forth and I was obviously
irrelevant. I escaped, returned the skirt, met my partner and went
to our court.
</P>
<P>
   We began playing, and a half-hour later I looked up and noticed
the two women were on an adjacent court. After I retrieved a ball
for one of them, she looked at me and said, ``The way you play
tennis, buy the skirt.''
</P>
<P>

   Amy Hanan's friend, ``a lady of certain age,'' had searched,
without success, for a bathing suit with an overskirt that gently
grazed the thighs. Finally, to her delight, she saw the perfect
suit in a SoHo store window. She dashed into the store and
addressed the 20-something salesclerk. ``That bathing suit in the
window, do you have it in a size 14?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The young saleswoman was incredulous. ``Madam,'' she said.
``That's a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Goldreich reports that Kenneth Abrahami, a friend, took a
taxi in lower Manhattan and asked to be taken to the Jewish Museum.
He read a newspaper during the trip and looked up when the driver
informed him that they had arrived. They were outside the
Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I asked to be taken to the Jewish Museum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, this isn't a Jewish museum?'' the driver replied
indignantly.

   Dear Diary:

   Occasionally, the little boy next door, who was reputed to be a
fussy eater, watched me work in my vegetable garden. As he kneeled
beside me one day, I tried to tempt him into picking a fresh snack.
Pointing out various vegetables, I said, ``This is how yummy
tomatoes grow; these are crunchy cucumbers,'' and so on with
lettuce, carrots and green beans. He said ``no'' to everything, so
I gave up and continued weeding.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes passed before he thought of a plant he was willing
to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does the pizza grow?'' he asked.

   The advertisement earlier this year for the restaurant Palio
featured a ``pre-fixe'' lunch. Flora Lazar telephoned and pointed
out that the correct spelling was ``prix fixe.'' The man at the
other end of the line wasn't concerned, she reported. ``Oh, madam,
don't worry,'' he replied, ``we're not a French restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The man and woman approaching the Henry Hudson Bridge were each
on a motorcycle. As the lanes split for people paying with cash or
an E-Z Pass, the woman headed for cash and the man toward E-Z Pass.
Michael Golden and his wife, Anne, driving alongside, were curious.
Did the man have his pass fastened to his chest or his helmet? As
they watched in the rear-view mirror, the man unzipped his jacket,
reached for the E-Z Pass, put it in his mouth and zoomed without
problem through the toll.

<P>
   If this isn't the Catch-22 School of Instruction, what is? On
one wall of Valerie Anderson's local post office, the sign read,
``To see the manager, you must have an appointment.'' On the
opposite wall, another sign read, ``To get an appointment, you must
see the manager.''

   My 90-year-old mother and I were visiting my son. As we started
to go out to dinner, my son said, ``Just a minute, Grandma, I have
to read my mail.'' The two of them went into his computer room and
she stood by as he pulled up his mail. As we walked out the door to
go to dinner, she turned to me and asked, ``How did he open the
envelopes?''

   Ruth Dickler and her husband, Gerry, both in their 80s, were
almost at their destination on a Fifth Avenue bus when a
thunderstorm erupted, the rain coming down in torrents. No sooner
had she suggested that they run for and take any shelter they could
find, than a young man on the bus thrust his umbrella into
Dickler's hand and a business card into his breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Dickler demurred, the good Samaritan said, ``Don't
worry, I'll get a beer until it stops and you can send the umbrella
back when you get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The card read ``Andy Robson'' and he did get his umbrella back.
The Dicklers are convinced that he's the New York version of Sir
Galahad.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Donte recently had a very short haircut that brought out
the natural curl in her hair. As she stepped into the elevator in
her building, another passenger looked at her admiringly and asked,
``Where did you get those curls?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' Ms. Donte replied.
</P>
<P>
   Not skipping a beat, the other woman asked, ``Are they on the
Upper West Side?''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's waiting room was crowded and the rambunctious and
very vocal 3-year-old was annoying everyone. Evelyn Chapman pegged
the mother as an obvious New Age parent. The woman followed her son
as he roamed around the room, repeatedly admonishing him with
``Please, Brian, you must remember to shout quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Recently, three friends and I headed to Chelsea to check out the
new trendy bar Lot 61. A polite bouncer informed us that he could
admit only people with reservations.
</P>
<P>
   We conferred under our umbrellas near the roped-off entrance.
``So, let's make a reservation,'' one of the men suggested. The
other took out his cellular phone, dialed and handed the phone to
me. The woman who answered took the reservation with no hesitation
and agreed to give my name to the doorman. We waited 10 minutes to
be safe, returned to the doorman and entered the hallowed chamber,
leaving a cluster of shivering, reservationless people behind.

FAVORITE TRICK REDISCOVERS WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Favorite Trick, the 1997 juvenile champion and Horse of the
Year, won the Long Branch Stakes by a head at Monmouth Park in
Oceanport, N.J., Sunday in his first appearance since he finished
eighth in the Kentucky Derby two and a half months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not run with breakaway speed, nor did he shake off
the colt stalking him the entire route, Tomorrows Cat, who has won
only two races in his career. And Bill Mott, who trains Favorite
Trick, said he still was not sure where his champion would run
next.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at Belmont Park, in Elmont, N.Y., Parade Ground, who
ran sixth in the Derby, made a successful transition from dirt
racing to grass racing when he won the Lexington Stakes by a length
and a half over Ay Rouge. His trainer, Neil Howard, said that he
was not ruling out a return to dirt at times, but ``this race
serves as a sign as to what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight at Monmouth fell entirely on Favorite Trick, who
won all eight of his starts as a 2-year-old, won the Eclipse Award
as the juvenile champion and then was voted Horse of the Year over
Skip Away. He was the first juvenile champion to win both honors
since Secretariat in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But this season has been a struggle. He won the Swale Stakes at
Gulfstream Park in March, but then suffered his first defeat when
he ran third in the Arkansas Derby in April, and then lost again in
the Kentucky Derby in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mott, who became his trainer this year when Patrick Byrne became
an exclusive trainer for Frank Stronach of Canada, has handled the
champion with care, pointing out that he had distance limitations.
The Long Branch, at a mile and one-sixteenth, probably offered his
best distance. But the $1 million Haskell on Aug. 9 at Monmouth and
the $250,000 Jim Dandy at Saratoga on the same day both are run at
a mile and an eighth. The Travers, on Aug. 29, is run at a mile and
one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick raced stride for stride Sunday with Tomorrows
Cat, a 3-year-old son of Storm Cat, and they entered the
homestretch still locked in a duel. They stayed that way until
Favorite Trick prevailed by the length of his head, with Arctic
Sweep third and Eastern Daydream fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick, who paid $2.40 on a $2 bet to win as the
favorite, ran the mile and a sixteenth under Pat Day in 1 minute 43
seconds, which was almost three seconds slower than Formal Gold ran
it when he set the Monmouth track record last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his disposition and temperament, not to run away from
horses,'' Mott said. ``But he's a good horse, a class horse, and he
deserves to win. We want to preserve his reputation. He didn't draw
away in the stretch, but I think he knew all along that he had the
other horse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mott was less certain about the next chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next week,'' he said, ``I'll sit down with the owner,
Joseph LaCombe, and decide. We'll give the Haskell serious
consideration. It's one of the chief reasons we came here for this
race. But it's only one of several options we have in the month of
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can go a mile and an eighth, but it's probably not his best
distance. And one and a quarter is beyond his realm, so I don't
expect him to run in the Travers.''
</P>
<P>
   Parade Ground, the winner of the Lexington, had run 12 times on
dirt, never on grass. He had won three of his races and finished in
the money 10 times. He ran third in the Wood Memorial in April,
sixth in the Derby in May, third in the Peter Pan three weeks later
and fourth in the Belmont Stakes. But he was a fast closer with
speed in his pedigree from his sire, Kingmambo, and his mare,
Battle Creek Girl. So Howard decided to try him on the turf.
</P>
<P>
   After running a tight second for most of a mile, Parade Ground
took charge as they turned for home and was a length and a half in
front of Ay Rouge at the end, with La Reine's Terms two and a
quarter lengths back in third. The winner ran the mile and a
quarter on the inner turf course in 2:00 2/5. The favorite, he
returned $5.50 for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran a dynamite race,'' said Mike Smith, the jockey, ``and
he definitely took a liking to the turf.''

A VICTORY IN MAHWAH IS A BOOST FOR GRAF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. _ The situation was hardly unfamiliar to Steffi
Graf, standing before an adoring crowd at center court with an
oversized champion's trophy in her hands. But the first question
asked while she stood there seemed to catch her off guard. It
seemed simple enough, ``Is Graf back?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She laughed nervously, finding it hard, as she held the silver
trophy, to do anything but admit, ``I am, I guess.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graf impressively disposed of Amanda Coetzer, 6-3, 6-3, in the
A&AMP;P Classic today at Crossroads Center before a sellout crowd of
7,101.
</P>
<P>
   Winning an exhibition is hardly the sort of accomplishment that
would falsely raise the hopes of a player who has been on top of
her sport longer than any other woman in tennis history,
particularly since Graf has won the Mahwah tournament six times,
while no other player has won here more than twice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for Graf, who missed eight months after knee surgery, this
marked the first victory since her return, providing a much-needed
boost of confidence. Her time away dropped her ranking to the
unfamiliar territory of No. 57.
</P>
<P>
   The victory over Coetzer, who is ranked No. 8 and who beat Graf
three times in 1997, offered hope.
</P>
<P>
   Still, inside the interview room shortly after the match, Graf
acknowledged the reality of her comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the beginning,'' Graf said. ``I arrived on Wednesday,
so I think I made the best out of these few days. I couldn't expect
to come here and win all three matches, especially today. I haven't
really felt that great, and I haven't been in the heat for quite
some time. But it's a great way to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the percentage thing, it's so American,'' she said,
laughing again. ``I'm 85, 80 percent. I don't know. It doesn't
concern me. I've felt like in another one or two weeks, another
tournament, I think I'll be where I want to be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graf has three more tournaments lined up as a prelude to the
U.S. Open, hoping that the return to match play will get her ready
for the rigors of the Grand Slam event. She opted to pass on
playing in the Federation Cup, choosing instead to remain in the
United States and continue her rehabilitation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the competitor in Graf has set her sights on the U.S.
Open, wondering aloud whether she can be a factor again, she
asserted again day that she will not judge her comeback on rankings
or titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a long break,'' she said. ``The good thing about
winning everything before, you don't have to prove anything
anymore. I've done this many times before. What I can enjoy out
there now is to enjoy myself. That's a privilege I have. I'm not
going for titles. Obviously I want to do well, no question about
it. But there is not a number in my mind or a certain amount of
titles.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to convince Coetzer of that. The 26-year-old
South African struggled with her own serve and could see little
evidence of any injury or layoff in Graf. After defeating No.
2-ranked Jana Novotna on Friday to reach the final, she found
herself run around the court by Graf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some of what she had before,'' Coetzer said. ``I thought
her serve was really, really good, and she moved really well. Both
of us made a lot of errors, and both of us have to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``She's got so much pride, and no matter where she's
playing, she's not going to go out and lose. I really respect that.
That's a good thing. It's nice to see that somebody doesn't play
for money.'' &QL;
</P>

<P>
   This exhibition was marred by a number of players opting out,
with Anna Kournikova and Mirjana Lucic withdrawing during the week
because of injury and illness, as well as the embarrassment of the
winner of the USTA Challenger Tournament, Amy Frazier, choosing to
skip an invitation to play in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   So Graf's performance was a welcome change, playing through her
rehabilitation as well as a sinus infection that prevented her from
flying to New Jersey until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often been proud to go through a variety of injuries and
difficulties and been able to prevail,'' Graf said. ``I've very
proud of that. I've always had that. That's the good thing about
this sport, you always have to challenge yourself.''

ON BASEBALL: IT'S NOT ART, BUT THAT'S AL WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In summing up one of the uglier victories of the season on
Saturday, Texas Manager Johnny Oates captured the essence of the
division affectionately known as the American League Worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't artistic, but we'll take it,'' Oates aptly told
reporters after watching his Rangers commit two errors, give up one
passed ball and leave nine men on base, but survive, 9-8, in 10
innings against the visiting Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   What is artistic about the AL West? If you want art, look to the
Braves or the Yankees. If you want herculean performances, look to
the Indians, the Astros, the Padres. If you want superstars, think
Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Sammy Sosa and Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   AL West clubs have players on record-breaking paces, like
Seattle's Griffey, who leads the league with 39 home runs, and Juan
Gonzalez of Texas, who leads the majors with 103 runs batted in.
Yet those feats cannot camouflage the pedestrian nature of what the
teams are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Oakland Athletics, young and lacking expectations, can
be considered a pleasant surprise. They are the only third-place
team in the majors with a single-digit deficit. While the A's good
fortune has a lot to do with promising youngsters like Ben Grieve,
it has more to do with the underachievers surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   What is unfolding in central Texas, on Walt Disney's diamond in
Anaheim and in the Pacific Northwest doesn't inspire praise. Not
when the three top teams seem capable of ruling the division yet
appear incapable of seizing the opportunity. The division-leading
Angels had won just four of their last 15 games leading into Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has been stunted, as shown by the Angels' inability
to score more than four runs in six of their first 10 games after
the All-Star Game break. It is why the disappointing Cecil Fielder
has been benched and why frustrated Manager Terry Collins looks
like a juggler with his lineup as he tries to shake a teamwide
slump.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels seem unable to avoid the jinx that has dogged the
team throughout its history, avidly illustrated when the team
managed to blow a double-digit division lead in early August 1995.
The Angels eventually lost a one-game playoff with the Mariners,
who had trailed by 13 games as late as Aug. 2 only to rally in what
became the fourth-largest comeback in major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   Not even changing the team's name from the California Angels to
the Anaheim Angels has provided enough camouflage to hide this team
from ill fates. Consider Chuck Finley. The Angels' top pitcher was
expected to miss his next start because of a cut on his right knee
from his last game. On Saturday, while sitting in the dugout, he
was injured when he was hit in the right arm by a line drive foul
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Angels are hanging on to first, thanks mostly to the
fact that second-place Texas is also treading water, losing five
straight before beating Tampa Bay on Friday and Saturday. The
Angels and Rangers have looked more like weary shadowboxers than
true contenders, with the Angels clinging to a half-game lead
heading into Sunday night's game.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rangers' struggles go beyond bad luck. The pitching went
belly up after an impressive spring. John Wetteland, a usually
reliable reliever, has blown four of his last 17 save
opportunities, including one Saturday against Tampa Bay, forcing
the game into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gonzalez is performing poorly. The main piston in the
Rangers' offense, Gonzalez's 101 runs batted in in the first half
of the season appeared to make him a lock to surpass Hack Wilson's
RBI record of 190. But Gonzalez did not collect another RBI until
Saturday when he twice doubled in a run, breaking a nine-game
drought.
</P>
<P>
   If the Texas heat and league pitching combine to wilt Gonzalez
in that category, it could devastate the Rangers. The club is 18-27
in games in which Gonzalez does not drive in at least one run,
including 4-5 since the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are also heavily dependent on offense in lieu of
consistent pitching. And that offense has ignited a glimmer of
pennant fever on a team that allowed its pitching to all but bury
it in the cellar in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Alex Rodriguez stand 1-2 in the league in home runs
with 39 and 30, respectively. Griffey, pursuing Roger Maris'
single-season record of 61 home runs, has been scorching the ball,
with 25 hits and 17 RBIs in his last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, feeding off their leader, rang up 26 runs and 36
hits in the team's first two games against the Royals over the
weekend, but had only one run and four hits in Sunday's 4-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion at the plate had resulted in six straight
victories for Seattle before Sunday's loss. The Mariners, who were
16 games out on June 30, had made up seven games in the standings.
before failing to sweep the Royals. The Mariners entered play
Sunday just nine games behind the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mariners hinting at another historic second-half
charge, and the Angels fiddling while their lead burns around them,
the West may once again provide baseball's most intriguing race.
Artistic? No, but it seems this is the only way the AL Worst knows
how to perform as its teams backpedal toward a destiny under
constant threat of devaluation.

EDITORIAL: THE SHAYS-MEEHAN VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives takes up the issue of campaign
finance reform again today. Under pressure from principled members
of their own party, the Republican leaders have dropped some of the
tactics used to block consideration of the Shays-Meehan bill, but
it still has a long way to go before it gets the fair up-or-down
vote House leaders promised.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ named for Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin
Meehan, D-Mass. _ would ban the ``soft money'' that allows
unlimited special-interest contributions to political parties.
These contributions have rendered meaningless the Watergate-era
laws limiting contributions to candidates. Opponents have been
trying to smother Shays-Meehan in proposed amendments that would
delay final consideration indefinitely. But last week, the sponsors
and the House leadership announced an agreement that would reduce
the number of amendments to 55. Total debate will be limited to 17
hours, a deadline that should bring about a final vote before the
House recesses Aug. 7. Passage by that date is essential if the
measure is to have any chance of getting through the Senate this
term.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays-Meehan faces a second set of obstacles. Under a rule
imposed by the House leadership, the bill also must get more
support than a number of competing campaign finance bills waiting
on the runway. Only then can it move on to the Senate, where
Majority Leader Trent Lott is equally determined to thwart the will
of the majority and stave off any serious campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   This week the bill will have to survive a barrage of amendments,
none of which deserve passage. Some are intended to weaken its
provisions. Many are simply nuisance amendments, like the one to
embarrass the Clinton administration by outlawing the already
illegal practice of offering access to Air Force One for campaign
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thomas, House Oversight Committee chairman and no friend to
campaign finance reform, deserves some credit for working out the
time-limit agreement. But members of the Republican leadership led
by Majority Whip Tom DeLay seem unshaken in their determination to
kill Shays-Meehan by hook or by crook. Speaker Newt Gingrich and
Majority Leader Dick Armey have to come up with a timetable that
will allow the vote they have promised before the fast-approaching
recess.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich and Armey break their pledge, they will be exposed
to their membership as legislators whose word is absolutely
useless. They will also be the men Republicans will blame when the
slim majority goes home to run for re-election and has to explain
why the party went to such lengths to protect the rights of
big-money special interests to influence elections.

HENRY R. GEYELIN, 79, ORGANIZER OF FLOTILLA FOR BICENTENNIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Rawle Geyelin Jr., a retired New York business executive
who helped start Operation Sail for the 1976 Bicentennial and the
tall ships' birthday salute to the Statue of Liberty in 1986, died
July 5 at his home in Manhattan. He was 79 and also had a home in
Seal Harbor, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Geyelin retired in 1988 as president of the Council of the
Americas in Manhattan, a business affiliate of the broader based
Americas Society. He had assumed leadership of the council as
executive vice president in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The council, founded in 1965, is a forum for the consideration
of economic, political and social issues from Canada to South
America. When he took over, Geyelin was involved in Chase Manhattan
Bank's overseas operations as vice president in the international
department and executive secretary of the international advisory
committee.
</P>
<P>
   He was an originator of the idea for Operation Sail to celebrate
the country's 200th birthday with an international flotilla of tall
ships in New York Harbor and up the Hudson River, and he played a
leading role in its planning.
</P>
<P>
   He took part in getting the tall ships under sail for the 100th
anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. Geyelin was a great-nephew of
Emma Lazarus, whose sonnet ``The New Colossus'' is engraved on the
statue's pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan, he graduated from Yale University in 1939
after majoring in American history. After his discharge from the
Navy, in which he served as an officer in Cuba and the Pacific in
World War II, he was an advertising executive at the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. He joined Chase in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a
director of the Americas Society.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his daughter, Antoinette Hoar of Manhattan; a
brother, Peter, of Philadelphia; a sister, Patricia Drexel of
Northeast Harbor, Maine, and two grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ To hear his coach talk, Michael Johnson's hips
have been out of alignment, much like the front end of a car. That,
in turn, has left his wheels wobbling, from his tight hamstrings to
his strained Achilles' tendon. But after a frustrating early
season, Johnson said he was again ready to road-test his form at
400 meters, where he is accustomed to reaching the finish line
greeted by a checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   He will run the quarter-mile on Tuesday at the Goodwill Games,
hoping to lower a 44.40-second performance in Rome last week. That
was Johnson's best time of an interrupted season that found him
finishing an unaccustomed third in Oslo in 44.58 to two British
sprinters. But his injury problems appear to be behind him, Johnson
said Sunday at a news conference. He can again think about winning
races instead of only about staying healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to end the season ranked No. 1 in the world
and winning the rest of my races,'' Johnson said. ``I feel
confident I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He strung together 58 consecutive victories in the 400 from 1990
until 1997 and won the Olympic gold medal in the 200 and 400 at the
1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. But he strained a quadriceps muscle
in a 150-meter race against Donovan Bailey in June 1997, which
essentially ruined Johnson's season, except for a gutsy performance
at that year's world championships in Athens, where he won the 400
on sheer determination.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics aside, that victory in Athens may have been the
greatest of Johnson's career. It was especially phenomenal, said
his coach, Clyde Hart, considering that Johnson's left leg had
one-third less strength than the right leg and one-third slower
reaction time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like running on a flat tire,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Johnson's hip alignment continued into this
season as he found himself training one or two days a week and then
having to take the rest of the week off. From day to day, he did
not know what his legs would allow him to do. With massage and
special exercises, Hart said, Johnson has corrected the problem in
the last month and now lacks only races to regain complete fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to deal with emotionally, not knowing when
I'm going out to train whether I'm going to get injured,'' Johnson
said. ``It got to the point whether it was day to day. Thankfully
I've got that behind me. I can go out and train hard every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is a month behind in training, Johnson said, which
left him unable to compete effectively at 200 meters. He withdrew
from the event here. But he said that attempts to write off his
career before the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, were
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Only injuries have slowed him, Johnson said, adding that he
believed he could still run under 43 seconds at 400 meters when
completely healthy, which would shatter Butch Reynolds' world
record of 43.29 seconds. Johnson owns the second-fastest time of
43.39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If he starts running 45 and 46 seconds, he said, he won't have
to be pushed out of the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you show vulnerability, people say, `O.K., it's
time,''' Johnson said. ``But they don't take into account what it
is. They don't think about injuries. The day I'm not running fast
and it's not because of injuries, I'll be in retirement.''

ZANARDI OVERCOMES A LOT TO WIN HIS FOURTH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Alex Zanardi overcame an engine failure, a rare
driving mistake that caused him to spin, and several very close
calls in a most improbable and dramatic victory on Sunday in the
Molson Indy.
</P>
<P>
   With an aggressive pass of Michael Andretti with two laps left,
Zanardi emerged with a victory on a road course that curls along
the banks of Lake Ontario in the shadows of Toronto's skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a record-tying fourth straight triumph and the sixth this
season for Zanardi, the defending Championship Auto Racing Teams
champion. He now has an almost insurmountable 69-point lead in this
season's points race. Andretti took second, and Zanardi's teammate,
Jimmy Vasser, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happened to me today,'' said Zanardi, who tied Al
Unser Jr.'s 1990 record for consecutive victories. ``I spun. I got
stuck behind an accident. I had problems with my brakes, my tires
and my engine. And still I'm here with another victory. I'm almost
sorry for all of the luck I'm having.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi, who won by 1.92 seconds, was lucky. But it was a
combination of luck and his ability behind the wheel that won him
the race.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 laps left, Zanardi was in fourth place, and did not seem
to have the handling or the power to move up. His red Reynard Honda
was sliding through the hairpin turns, and Dario Franchitti of
Britain was driving away from the field, leading by 11 seconds. But
it was then that Zanardi got the break he needed. Franchitti, the
pole-winner for the second straight year, lost control of his car
in Turn 1, the same turn where he crashed on the first lap in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti, who finished 20th, was horizontal, his green Reynard
Honda blocking the middle of the track just beyond the turn. First,
Andretti came speeding around the corner, saw Franchitti and got by
on the left. Then, Vasser did the same, clipping the nose of
Franchitti's car. Finally, there was Zanardi, who, heeding the
advice of his car owner, Chip Ganassi, steered right, overtaking
Vasser for second place.
</P>
<P>
   So now, with Vasser's tires ruined and Franchitti out of the
race, it came down to two cars _ those of Andretti and Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   Despite handling problems, Andretti, in his black Kmart
Swift-Ford/Cosworth, was able to hold off Zanardi until Lap 93 of
95, when at the entrance to Turn 3, Zanardi boldly dived to the
inside. Andretti locked all four wheels, allowing Zanardi to make a
spectacular pass and accelerate out of the turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had made a mistake,'' Andretti said, ``then I would be
upset. I drove OK, but it wasn't enough. I did the best I could
with the equipment I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi's day surely ended better than it had begun. His engine
failed during the morning practice, and he was forced to borrow a
backup engine from Franchitti's team.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not all that threatened Zanardi on Sunday. On Lap
63, Zanardi spun out of control while challenging Vasser for third
place. Several times before that, he almost lost control while
pushing his car past its limit.
</P>
<P>
   For a second straight year, Franchitti was driving the best car
but wasted the opportunity to get his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' Franchitti said. ``I just can't believe it.
The brakes were a worry all day. When I spun in Turn 1, I caught
the throttle as I was braking. It's really disappointing.''
</P>

FIRST KNOCKDOWN BREAKS THE MONOTONY FOR JONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Jones Jr. has six-pack stomach muscles, the
biceps of a weight-lifter and the knockout record of a marauder.
But before Saturday night's light heavyweight title fight, he had a
dream: the soft-punching Lou DelValle would knock him down.
</P>
<P>
   This was an odd premonition. For the way Jones tells it, he has
not been knocked off his feet since he was a 12-year-old holding
the heavy punching bag for a heavyweight fighter in his hometown of
Pensacola, Fla. The puncher hit the bag, the bag hit Jones, and the
next thing he knew, he was looking up. That was 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the next knockdown blow came on Saturday night in the
eighth round of Jones' victory before a raucous crowd at Madison
Square Garden's Theater, he said to himself, ``I knew this was
going to happen _ and I still let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones gets bored, and that made him vulnerable, he
explained. ``I'm going to get lackadaisical,'' he said. Thus, he
fought sideways to start the fifth round. ``I did it to keep myself
from getting bored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DelValle, a world champion himself who sparred 38 rounds with
Jones three years ago, knows all of his tricks _ turning sideways,
shifting to southpaw, vaulting off the ropes _ and he did not let
Jones sucker him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult fighting your sparring partner,'' Jones
said. ``He knows all your tricks. That's why I don't like to fight
sparring partners.''
</P>
<P>
   DelValle won that eighth round with his left-right knockdown
after Jones dropped his guard. Jones quickly got up. It was the
only round he lost on the three judges' scorecards in gaining a
unanimous decision in the 12-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   He did, after all, throw 483 punches to DelValle's 286, landing
233 to DelValle's 113.
</P>
<P>
   DelValle, an admitted former drug dealer who lives in the Morris
Park section of the Bronx, proved not only courageous, but also
lived up to Borough President Fernando Ferrer's assessment of
fighters from the Bronx. ``They may lose,'' Ferrer said before the
bout, ``but there's not a chump among them.''
</P>
<P>
   This victory, though, did little for Jones' ultimate dream:
fighting for Evander Holyfield's heavyweight title. Even though
Jones dominates a fight, there probably will not be a huge public
demand for a fight with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll fight all the top fighters at his weight,'' said HBO's
boxing director, Lou DiBella, whose company televised Saturday's
bout. ``He has to clear up the light heavyweight division first. I
don't think Evander will happen any time soon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With his 37th victory in 38 fights, the 175-pound Jones not only
retained his World Boxing Council crown, but wrested away
DelValle's World Boxing Association title. Now there will be a
mandatory title defense, followed by a winter meeting with the
International Boxing Federation champion, Reggie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who knocks out almost 90 percent of his opponents, never
had DelValle down. DelValle (27-2) came away with a severely
battered face that included cuts around the left eye, perhaps from
a head butt, and bruises on his arms, cheeks and forehead.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jones' Pensacola pals, junior lightweight Derrick Gainer,
may have convinced Kevin Kelley that it is finally time to
seriously consider moving from the ring to ring side. Kelley, 31,
the former two-time featherweight champion from Flushing, Queens,
suffered only the third loss in a fine career that has seen 48
victories and a pair of draws.
</P>
<P>
   He understood what he had to do against Gainer, who at 5 feet 9
inches was 2 inches taller. Each weighed 126 pounds. But even
though Gainer stayed away the last two rounds, using his reach,
Kelley did not have the stamina to bull inside. He was knocked down
twice in dropping a unanimous 10-round decision to the 25-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Gainer increased his record to 24-4. One of those losses was an
eighth-round knockout by Kelley two years ago.

UNION REPRESENTATIVES SCHEDULE MEETING WITH STERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For the first time since the National Basketball
Association instituted its lockout at the end of last month,
representatives of the players association will meet with
Commissioner David Stern on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see where he is and whether there's any possibility
of reaching an accord between now and the time to go to camp,'' the
players association's executive director, Billy Hunter, said Sunday
at Miami Arena before a charity game organized by Heat center
Alonzo Mourning. ``Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter requested the meeting with Stern, as he had promised to
do after meeting with all but four of the league's player
representatives last week in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the dispute is over the owners' desire to put a
ceiling on how much players earn. The owners would like to change a
system in which player salaries account for more than 57 percent of
basketball-related revenue taken in by the league.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter calculated that there were more than 100 NBA players last
season making the minimum salary _ $272,000 _ compared with 22 whom
the league feels may be excessively compensated. ``So the issue is
about the owners being able to cap the guys who are responsible for
putting the fans in the seats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter reiterated that he seriously doubted the league's
assertion that nearly half its 29 teams lost money last season.
``Maybe there's one or two at the most,'' he said. ``And there's
nothing there that couldn't be overcome by better management.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter came here to offer assurances about the union's strength
to 30 of his constituents, including Gary Payton, Mitch Richmond,
Juwan Howard, Allen Iverson, Glen Rice and Vin Baker, who
participated in Sunday's game, and Patrick Ewing, the players
association president, who was here for moral support.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, sporting a blue wrap on his long-mending right wrist,
said the union had never been more unified and was ready for
anything. He declined to answer further questions.
</P>
<P>
   For Ewing and Hunter, Sunday's game _ dubbed Zo's Summer Groove
II _ was a chance to laugh and clap with the rest of the fans,
estimated at 7,000, who paid from $17.50 to $33.50 for tickets.
Proceeds went to two charities in the South Florida area.
</P>
<P>
   The players seemed divided on how long the lockout would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a feeling it's going to be a long summer,'' Heat
forward P.J. Brown said. ``I'm thinking this thing may last up to
the season _ or beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the locker room, Payton was far more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much stronger than we were three years ago, much more
together,'' he said of another labor impasse. ``I'm thinking it'll
be done by sometime in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to Payton, Washington Wizards point guard Rod Strickland
nodded agreement. ``I believe that, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Damon Stoudamire, who is a Toronto free agent, said
he had heard of Ted Turner's idea to play exhibition games, and
maybe even form a league, with the NBA's 180 or so free agents, but
he was noncommittal about the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how much money they're talking,'' Stoudamire
said. After a pause, he added: ``Who knows? If this thing lasts a
long time and it came down to it, maybe I would be interested.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His fellow free agent Ike Austin, the Los Angeles Clippers'
center, said he would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm game for anything,'' Austin said. ``If the NBA is going to
keep us locked out and we don't come to terms, this may be an
alternative for players. The main thing is we're going to stick
together, all the free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The only player who hinted at any doubt of solidarity _
hypothetical as it might be _ was Heat point guard Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get closer to the season, who knows what might
happen?'' Hardaway said. ``Some guys may say: `Man, I've got bills
to pay. I can't deal with this much longer.'''

GISELLA CACCIALANZA, BALLERINA IN BALANCHINE'S COMPANY, DIES AT
83 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gisella Caccialanza, a major American ballerina with George
Balanchine's first New York company and with the San Francisco
Ballet, died on Thursday in Seton Hospital in Daly City, Calif. She
was 83 and lived in San Bruno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said Diane Kounalakis, associate
director of public relations for the San Francisco Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miss Caccialanza danced with pioneering American
companies and was married to Lew Christensen, an important American
choreographer, her early training was Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Born of Italian-American parents in San Diego, she studied
ballet in Los Angeles with Giovanni Rosi, an Italian teacher.
Italian ballet training was prized at the time, and Rosi
recommended that she continue her studies in Milan, Italy. Yet he
lamented that Enrico Cecchetti, Italy's most celebrated teacher,
had just died.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Caccialanza and her mother arrived in Milan in 1925,
they were astonished to find Cecchetti still alive. Miss
Caccialanza became his protegee and he served as her godfather at
her confirmation. ``Letters From the Maestro,'' a collection of
their correspondence, was published in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to America in 1928, she worked with Albertina
Rasch, a Viennese choreographer who staged ballet numbers for
musicals and vaudeville shows. In 1934, she became a charter member
of the American Ballet, Balanchine's first American company,
creating parts in many works, notably that of the bride in
Balanchine's ``Baiser de la Fee'' in 1937. She also danced in ``The
Goldwyn Follies'' and ``On Your Toes,'' movie musicals
choreographed by Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   When the American Ballet was not performing, its members
appeared with Ballet Caravan, a touring group founded in 1936 that
encouraged American choreographers, among them Christensen, whom
Miss Caccialanza married in 1941. That year, the American Ballet
and Ballet Caravan combined for a Latin American tour. For this
organization, which disbanded shortly the tour, Miss Caccialanza
was cast as the Second Ballerina in the premiere of Balanchine's
``Ballet Imperial.''
</P>
<P>
   She was guest ballerina with the San Francisco Ballet in 1943.
In 1944, she danced the Sugarplum Fairy when that company presented
America's first complete ``Nutcracker.'' Her partner was Willam
Christensen, Lew's brother and the company's director.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, Miss Caccialanza joined Ballet Society, the
forerunner of the New York City Ballet, in 1946 and created the
Third Theme in Balanchine's ``Four Temperaments.'' When Willam
Christensen left California in 1951 to found Ballet West in Salt
Lake City, of which he is now director emeritus, his brother
succeeded him in San Francisco. Miss Caccialanza danced with his
company until the birth of their son in 1953. She then taught at
the company's school.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1984. Miss Caccialanza is survived by her
son, Chris Christensen, a conductor, also of San Bruno.

METROSTARS PUSH BACK OVER .500 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Are the New York MetroStars an average
team that is going to wobble toward the playoffs? Or are they a
special team that can do damage when the postseason arrives?
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-0 domination of the Columbus Crew Sunday lends credence
to the latter view. But the MetroStars have found themselves here
before: over .500 and seemingly on their way to greater
achievements, only to stumble into a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm, hazy afternoon in front of 13,826 fans at Giants
Stadium, the MetroStars (10-9, 28 points) snapped a two-game skid
while seizing second place in Major League Soccer's Eastern
Conference from the Crew (9-9, 27 points).
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars did it by penetrating a Columbus defense that
virtually waved them into the last third of the field. The
MetroStars got goals from the two men they count on to finish: two
by Eduardo Hurtado and one by Giovanni Savarese. And they stopped
Columbus' attack before it could start. The Crew managed four shots
on goal, but only two were threats, requiring leaping grabs by
goalkeeper Tony Meola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you saw the potential of this team,'' MetroStars Coach
Alfonso Mondelo said. ``Without a doubt, the first 45 minutes were
the best 45 minutes this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Alexi Lalas said: ``I hope we're the team we saw today.
We understand that in order to have a chance in the postseason,
we'll have to put together games like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Tab Ramos contributed his most aggressive play since
returning from a second knee surgery and the United States'
disappointing showing in the World Cup. Ramos, in full sprint,
hooked a perfect crossing pass that Hurtado headed in from 15 yards
out in the 42nd minute to give the Metros a 2-0 lead. Then Ramos
was ejected in the 60th minute for an overly aggressive mouth with
the official. ``I take the blame,'' said Ramos, who felt he was
pushed by a defender.
</P>
<P>
   In the 26th minute, Hurtado used his head to serve up an assist
to the streaking Savarese. Savarese cradled the pass with his right
shoulder, hesitated and then scooted an 8-yard roller by the
sliding goalkeeper Juergen Sommer. The goal was Savarese's
team-leading ninth of the season and 36th in his career. Hurtado's
assist gave him 11, a MetroStars season record.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado completed his potent performance with a breakaway goal
in the 86th minute, letting defender Ansil Elcock slip by him, then
tapping in a 5-yarder with his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had good games like this before,'' Hurtado said, ``but
today's was very important. We wanted second place. We were
thinking, `Let's win the game,' but not by 3-0.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Columbus Coach Tom Fitzgerald said of Hurtado: ``That's the
first time I've seen him play like this since he played in L.A.
Unfortunately, he had to do it against us.''

 EDITORIAL: A SPECIAL OLYMPICS ANNIVERSARY  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1963, Eunice Kennedy Shriver was seized by the
interesting if perhaps counterintuitive notion that competitive
sports might actually enlarge the self-esteem of mentally retarded
people whom society had officially shielded from the challenges of
normal life. She started with a small day camp in her backyard in
Rockville, Md., and five years later _ 30 years ago today _ she
helped stage the first Special Olympics for about 1,000 athletes
with mental disabilities at Soldier Field in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, these games were one of the few genuinely
positive moments in an otherwise bitter summer marked by war,
riots, bloodshed and, most cruelly for Mrs. Shriver, the
assassination of her brother, Robert Kennedy. Yet she and the
athletes persevered, and from that original competition has sprung
an international movement with Special Olympics programs in 143
countries and 16,000 sports events every year.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as its global reach is the simplicity of the idea
_ the notion that mentally retarded athletes are not to be coddled
or pitied but admired as skilled and courageous competitors. It is
not a big leap from that idea to the broader notion that all people
with disabilities deserve equal access to recreation, to education
and to jobs. Mrs. Shriver did not write the modern laws
guaranteeing such access, but she and her athletes did much to make
them possible.

<P>
   That was the buzz around California Speedway in the days
preceding Sunday's Busch Kenwood Home &AMP; Car Audio 300.
</P>
<P>
   Team 34 came into Sunday's race with Mike McLaughlin leading the
Busch points race. And in recent weeks, owner Frank Cicci had
caught the attention of his rivals in a big way by adding
top-flight drivers David Green and Todd Bodine _ both recently let
go from Winston Cup teams _ to his three-car stable.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers Matt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt Jr., running close
behind McLaughlin in the points chase, were among those who
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those guys had been here from the start of the season,''
Kenseth said, ``this would be a five-man points race instead of a
three-man race. I think having teammates like that is going to be a
big advantage (to McLaughlin).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But not on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some not-so-funny things happened to Team 34 on the way to its
Kenwood domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those days,'' said McLaughlin, who finished 24th
and slipped behind Earnhardt and Kenseth in season points.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's troubles began Friday with a poor showing in
qualifying that put him in the 30th starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he had moved up to ninth position midway through
the race and figured he was on his way to a top-10 finish when he
rear-ended Kevin Lepage and sheared off the bolts that hold down
the hood on his Chevy Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the hood start to fly up in the air, I knew we were
done,'' said McLaughlin, who lost two laps and a lot of points to
the leaders while his pit crew worked on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine's return to Team 34 was a homecoming. Before moving to
Winston Cup racing with the Tabasco racing team earlier this year,
Bodine had eight Busch wins _ including last year's Kenwood _ for
Team 34 and was second in last year's Busch points race. So when he
and Tabasco parted ways last week, Cicci eagerly invited him back.
</P>
<P>
   He was in position for a while to make his return triumphant.
But his pit crew failed to get his left-front tire back on tight
during a stop on lap 100 while he was running fourth. And as he
sped away, the wheel came off and he had to limp back into the pit
and have another put on.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just got excited because they were running
well,'' said Cicci. ``They just got overanxious and the crew chief
said go before they were finished with the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine was gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're all human. I could
get mad at them, but I wouldn't be as mad as they probably are at
themselves. And they're a good bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Green survived his mistake _ running out of gas _ thanks to some
help from Bodine and finished fifth. Just as Bodine was getting
back on the track with a new wheel, he got a message over his
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `David's out of gas on the backstretch, see if you
can push him in,''' Bodine said. ``I said, `Sure. Glad to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Green said he knew help was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a brother (Mark, who finished 19th) and two teammates
out there,'' he said. ``So I knew somebody would help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cicci also took the day's travail in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone is going to
count us out.''

EDITORIAL: FAMILY LIFE WITH A VENGEANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 20:
</P>
<P>
   The facts are incomplete. The allegations have not yet been
sifted nor indictments handed down. Still unknown is the fate of
Irene Silverman, the wealthy widow who disappeared in early July
from her East 65th Street town house. But already the story has
shifted from the potentially tragic mystery of Mrs. Silverman's
whereabouts to the strange lives of the only pair of suspects in
this case _ Sante Kimes, 63, and her 23-year-old son, Kenneth, who
were arrested in Manhattan on another matter the same day Mrs.
Silverman vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes, described by her former lawyer as having ``mounds of
hair,'' has allegedly made a calling, at least since 1961, of
violence, intimidation, and fraud. Only while she was in prison did
her son, free at last from her overweening control, seem to have a
reasonably normal life. In those days, his father, Kenneth Kimes,
an indulgent, if distant businessman, was still alive. He died in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the claims of past friends that Kenneth Kimes Jr.
hated his mother, he has become her accomplice, against his will or
not. Side by side, they stare balefully at the public from
newspapers and television, she with a slightly blurred mien, he
with sharp-edged malevolence and evident loathing of the
photographer. You can only imagine what expressions mother and son
would wear if they were looking at each other and if, still harder
to imagine, they actually let their guard down.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Aeschylus would have known what to make of this pair, or
Jim Thompson, author of ``The Grifters.'' The temptation is
certainly to psychologize and, perhaps, to sexualize _ with
Aeschylean austerity or with Thompson's blunt leer _ the predation
that the Kimeses have inflicted on themselves and, by allegation,
on many others.
</P>
<P>
   But among the inversions so apparent in the Kimes story, the
most interesting is the inversion of what we call normal life. In
1989, Kenneth Kimes Jr. is poised on the edge of an ordinary
existence, but it slips away when his mother returns from prison.
The crimes chalked up to Mrs. Kimes include insurance fraud, the
enslavement of Mexican servants, the murders of two men unfortunate
enough to stumble into her business and now the possible murder of
poor Mrs. Silverman _ are in themselves oddly domestic crimes,
hostile variations, you might call them, on the themes of normal
life: housing, comfort, cleanliness and security. This is family
life with a pathological vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   A crime story is nearly always a kind of living obituary, of the
accused as well as the victims. At first there is only the fact _
the crime itself, the death. But almost immediately we begin to
tell the story again and again, adding, refining, connecting,
always looping back as far as we can into the past until the
narrative makes sense. Our taste, at the moment, is to believe in
cause rather than chance. Either way, ``there is trouble here,'' as
the chorus says in Aeschylus, and ``there is more to come.''

PIT STOP PROVES PERILOUS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Sunday's NASCAR Busch Grand National Kenwood Home &AMP;
Car Audio 300 at California Speedway was injury-free on the
track. &UR;  &LR; Brad Akins, co-owner of the Barbasol Ford driven to 12th
place by Elton Sawyer, was not so lucky in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   While preparing for a tire change, Akins' ankle was run over by
the passing No.80 Chevrolet driven by Mark Krogh.
</P>
<P>
   Akins completed the tire change on his car, then was taken to
Loma Linda Hospital with what was diagnosed as a severely fractured
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Winston what? Some say Winston Cup drivers should stay away from
lower-level races in the interest of preventing unfair
competition. &UR;  &LR; That argument isn't supported by Sunday's results.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four Winston Cup regulars entered, pole-starter Robert
Pressley finished highest at 14th. Michael Waltrip was 23rd, Dale
Jarrett blew an engine and was 37th and Dick Trickle was 39th.
</P>
<P>
   World Championship mistake: Palmdale expatriot Lance Hooper
suffered an early setback when the sponsor decal on the hood of his
Pontiac came loose and threatened to fly up and block his view.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper's car is sponsored by World Championship Wrestling and
the decal, applied just minutes before race time, advertised a
forthcoming pay-per-view event.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper was not able to overcome the disadvantage and finished
25th.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow former Palmdale racer Ron Hornaday Jr. was 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Sons of the rich and famous: Dale Earnhardt Jr. wasn't the only
son of a famous dad on the track Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Gibbs, son of former Redskins coach and full-time race
owner Joe Gibbs, was a last-minute addition to the race, subbing
for Tony Stewart, who was racing in the Indy Racing League event.
Gibbs finished 36th.
</P>
<P>
   Also present was Jason Jarrett, who lost his ride for the
weekend to his father, Dale.
</P>
<P>
   Final count: Speedway president Greg Penske said about 100,000
fans attended the weekend's tripleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Penske estimated that 5,000 attended Friday's qualifying heats,
with 45,000 in the stands Saturday for the Winston West and
Craftsman Truck races. Penske said a little more than 50,000
watched Sunday's Busch race.

YOUNGER EARNHARDT WINS BUSCH 300
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ If not the ``The Intimidator II,'' how about
``The Dominator?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds good,'' said Dale Earnhardt Jr., who easily won
Sunday's NASCAR Busch Grand National Kenwood Home &AMP; Audio 300
before an estimated crowd of more than 50,000 at California
Speedway. ``It's a good nickname. Hopefully, it will stick. I've
got a T-shirt that says, `Here to dominate, not intimidate.' Maybe
it will start to sell now.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after Sunday's event, which saw Earnhardt lead all
but 10 of the 150 laps and finish a healthy 6.76 seconds ahead of
second-place Kevin Lepage for his fourth victory of the year. Matt
Kenseth was third. Palmdale's Lance Hooper was 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup regulars Michael Waltrip and Dale Jarrett finished
23rd and 37th, respectively. Jarrett, who retired early in the
California 500 at this track in May, went out in lap 79 because of
engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AC Delco team just gave me an awesome race car today,''
said Earnhardt, who leads the Busch Grand National season standings
by six points over Kenseth. ``It was pretty fast in qualifying, and
I'm not too comfortable with our qualifying setup, running tape on
the nose and the grill. But I know if we're good then, when we pull
that tape off, the car really comes to life. That was the case
today. As soon as they dropped the green flag, that thing was no
holds barred.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt didn't waste any time in gaining the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   He took the lead from polesitter Robert Pressley before the end
of the opening lap, then increased it to over seven seconds before
the caution flag was brought out on lap 30 because of debris.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old, who is in his first full season on the NASCAR
Busch Grand National circuit, held the lead on the restart and was
able to increase his edge to 10.36 seconds before pitting on lap
96.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who dropped to 10th after taking on four tires and
fuel, then moved up to fourth when the caution came out on lap 100.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine, who was recently released from his Winston Cup
ride, caused the caution when his left front tire fell off his Slim
Jims Chevrolet and on to the track.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred after Bodine pitted on lap 99, taking four
tires and fuel. His tire changer failed to get the tire on square.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, who won this event last season, dropped a lap down after
driving the car around the track slowly on the apron before making
an additional pit stop. It dropped him a lap down and he was unable
to threaten again, finishing 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real shame,'' said Bodine, who had moved up to second
before the incident. ``That's part of racing. Anybody can make a
mistake. I just feel sorry for our guys. Finally we get to run up
front, and we make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and Lepage were the beneficiaries as Jeff Purvis and
Elliott Sadler made pit stops during the caution, putting Earnhardt
in the lead and Lepage in second.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage, who recently signed on to race on the Winston Cup
circuit with Jack Rousch Racing, was able to shadow Earnhardt over
the next few laps before clipping the wall on 117.
</P>
<P>
   He began the restart in third, slipped by Kenseth on lap 106 and
moved within .55 seconds of Earnhardt on lap 110.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage was just .29 seconds behind Earnhardt when they came to
lap 116.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a hold of my draft,'' Earnhardt said. ``I think in that
respect, this track is as big as Daytona or Talladega (Ala.). I was
trying to shave the draft off, but every time I moved around, it
actually created a bigger hole for him to draft off of. So I just
tried to be patient and go fast.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Lepage, who appeared to get even closer before tagging
the wall on the exit of turn four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed he was carrying the car in the corners,'' Earnhardt
said. ``He was probably using me to judge where to get off the gas
and get back on the gas. I think after four laps I kind of lulled
him into a trance, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying real hard to run (Earnhardt) down,'' Lepage
said. ``I think I pushed it a little too hard and caught the wall.
It just hit the wall a little bit, no damage, but I think it took
some of the down force away. It got real tight after that and I
couldn't run with him after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we would try for second and, for us, finishing
second here is like winning.''
</P>
<P>
   So to for Kenseth, whose third-place finish gave him a 76-point
edge over third-place Mike McLaughlin in the season standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to win every week,'' Kenseth said. ``That's what we
do this for, is to win. But we had a decent car today and had a
solid run. We got beat really bad by Dale Jr. and pretty bad by
Kevin, but overall we're just six points back in the championship,
and that's pretty good.''

JOHN HENRIK CLARKE, 83, BLACK STUDIES ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Henrik Clarke, an Alabama sharecropper's son
whose thirst for unfettered knowledge led him to hop a freight
train to New York and transform himself into an African history
scholar who helped spur the development of black studies and who
spent six decades as a gadfly fixture in the intellectual life of
Harlem, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was a professor emeritus at Hunter College. If it is
unusual to become a full college professor without benefit of a
high school diploma, let alone a Ph.D., nobody said Clarke wasn't
an academic original.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-grade dropout who eventually took courses at New York
University and Columbia but never graduated, Clarke, who ultimately
received a doctorate from the nonaccredited Pacific Western
University in Los Angeles at age 78, was hardly stymied by the lack
of formal academic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as a scholar devoted to redressing what he saw as a
systematic and racist suppression and distortion of African history
by traditional scholars, he said he had not missed all that much.
</P>
<P>
   In a varied career during which he wrote six books, edited and
contributed to 17 others, wrote more than 50 short stories, turned
out a stream of articles and pamphlets, helped found or edit
several important black quarterlies, lectured widely and did
research in every African country except South Africa, Clarke,
largely self-taught and highly outspoken, became an imposing figure
in black intellectual circles.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Union Springs, Ala., who moved to Georgia as an
infant, Clarke demonstrated his academic prowess early, once
amazing one of his teachers by ``reading'' a seamless English
essay. The teacher later realized, after seeing that the student's
pages were blank, the essay had been composed on the fly. (A man
with a prodigious memory, Clarke later amazed his students and
lecture audiences by delivering complex, detailed lectures without
notes.)
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who left school to help support his family with jobs
that included caddying for Dwight Eisenhower, Omar Bradley and
other officers at Fort Benning, Ga., came to New York in 1933
partly because he had become enchanted by tales of the literary and
cultural fervor of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and partly
because, as a black youth in segregated Georgia, he was not allowed
to check books out of the local library.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrived in New York, he haunted the city's libraries and
gravitated to an influential personal tutor, Arnold Schomburg, the
scholar whose library became the foundation for the Schomburg
Center for Research in Black Culture. Like Schomburg, Clarke said
he had been led to study African history after being told that
black Africans had no history before European colonization.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the scholarship he championed was dismissed by
traditional historians as specious propaganda seeking to aggrandize
African influence on Western culture, Clarke threw the charge right
back, accusing white scholars of having disguised their own
Euro-centric propaganda as historic fact.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, Clarke relished the fray, among other things
editing a 1968 book, ``William Styron's Nat Turner: 10 Black
Scholars Respond,'' in which he and the other contributors accused
Styron of painting a false picture of slavery and of Turner's
character in his acclaimed novel ``The Confessions of Nat Turner.''
</P>
<P>
   Other collections Clarke edited include ``American Negro Short
Stories'' (1966), ``Malcolm X: The Man and His Times'' (1969),
``Harlem U.S.A.'' (1971) and ``Marcus Garvey and the Vision of
Africa'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   By the time he joined the Hunter faculty as a lecturer in 1969,
Clarke, who quickly established black studies programs there and at
Cornell, had supported himself in a series of low-paying jobs,
served a wartime stint in the Army Air Forces and emerged as a key
figure in the 1960s movement to celebrate black culture.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he had been director of the Heritage
Teaching Program for the anti-poverty agency Haryou-Act (Harlem
Youth-Associated Community Teams) and a consultant and coordinator
of the 1968 CBS television series ``Black Heritage: The History of
Afro-Americans.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clarke was a gregarious man whose Harlem home became a way
station for visiting Africans. His interest in modern African
affairs led him to support the pan-African political movement, and
he was on a first-name basis with many African leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when he was stranded in Ghana without funds, he bumped
into a man he had known in New York years earlier, Kwame Nkrumah,
the first president of Ghana, who promptly gave him a government
research job.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when a younger colleague told Clarke how proud he
had been to meet Eduardo Mondlane, the founder of the Mozambique
Liberation Front, Clarke nodded and recalled that during his visits
to New York, Mondlane always stayed at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke is survived by his wife, Sybil Williams Clarke; two
children from a previous marriage, a daughter, Nzinga, and a son,
Sonni, both of New York; a sister, Eddie Mary Hobbs; two
stepbrothers, Walter and Hugh Clarke, and a stepsister, Earlene
Clarke, all of Columbus, Ga.

THOMAS MENDENHALL, 88, ROWING AUTHOR AND SMITH COLLEGE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn., Wis.)  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, the foremost U.S. historian of the
sport of rowing and a former president of Smith College, died
Saturday at Windemere, a long-term care facility on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., where he and his wife lived. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest following a long illness, said his
wife, Cornelia Baker Mendenhall.
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall was the president of Smith College in Northampton,
Mass., from 1959 until he retired in 1979. He was a noted professor
of history at Yale before that appointment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He wrote 10 books, earned numerous degrees and taught classes.
His students, friends and family, however, remember his engaging
humor and his many probing interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall grew up in Madison, Wis., the son of the chairman of
the physics department at the University of Wisconsin, Charles E.
Mendenhall. His mother, Dr. Dorothy R. Mendenhall, was a
pediatrician. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall graduated from Andover and then from Yale in 1932. He
went on to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and was captain of the
Balliol College crew there. He began teaching at Yale in 1937 and
was named an associate professor in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Among many assignments at Yale, Mendenhall served as Master of
Berkeley College and coach of the Berkeley crew.
</P>
<P>
   Rowing always had his passionate attention, and among his books
are ``A Short History of American Rowing,'' and ``The Harvard-Yale
Boat Race 1852-1924.'' That book went beyond that event and
justified its subtitle, ``The Coming of Sport to the American
College.'' He also wrote ``Have Oar Will Travel,'' a history of
Yale's 1956 crew team, which won an Olympic gold medal in
Melbourne, Australia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mendenhall recalled that her husband was always busy when
he was teaching. During a typical day at Yale, she said, he might
teach three classes, attend two meetings, coach the Berkeley crew,
advise students and help clean up the dining hall in advance of a
rehearsal of the Berkeley Players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was not much room to sit down in Mendenhall's small
office, one jammed to its ceiling with books and papers.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lamar, a history professor and later interim president of
Yale, told of a meeting of the history department faculty in
Mendenhall's office at which someone pulled out a drawer to sit on.
In the drawer was a paper bag that contained a forgotten sandwich.
It was not an example of an absent-minded professor, but of a busy
one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall continued to teach history at Smith, and he also
worked to bring the four neighboring colleges of the Connecticut
Valley into closer contact. Even as president, his popularity with
students did not diminish.

   Following his retirement, Mendenhall for many years attended
Smith reunions, where he tried to maintain a rule: ``I won't let
them kiss me,'' he said, ``until they tell me their maiden names.''

   Along with his wife, Mendenhall is survived by two daughters,
Bethany Mendenhall and Cornelia Small, and two grandchildren.

   Mendenhall remained busy during his retirement at Vineyard Haven
on Martha's Vineyard, close to the ocean that had meant so much to
him. The most popular course he taught at Yale was ``The History of
Sea Power,'' and at the Vineyard what he liked to do best was to
take his sloop out for a sail on Nantucket Sound.
