UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
recommended a one-month extension of the United Nations Mission in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), known as MONUC, to allow
time to assess the impact of recent development in the central
African country, a U.N. spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mission's current mandate is set to expire on August 31
following the February 24 resolution of the Security Council,
under which Annan is expected to present his next report to the 15-
nation body on the status of MONUC by August 24.
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter to the Security Council released here
Wednesday, Annan requested that the Council consider an interim
extension of the Mission through September 30 to allow sufficient
time to assess the impact of the latest event and to formulate
appropriate recommendations. (UN-Annan)

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday dropped
a strongest-ever hint that Israel will agree to the Palestinians'
plan to declare statehood if they promise to end their conflict
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Israel's National Military Colleague graduation
ceremony, Barak said clearly he will agree to a Palestinian state,
a political taboo which the prime minister has consistently
avoided touching in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak added, the condition for Israel's consent to
Palestinian statehood will be the Palestinians' announcement of
the final end of the conflict with Israel, and no less than that.

BRUSSELS -- A senior Russian naval officer said here Thursday
that the 118 sailors on board the stricken Kursk submarine could
survive for two more weeks before their oxygen runs out.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Naval Vice Chief of Staff Alexander Pobozhy, head of a
visiting Russian delegation, told a meeting of NATO delegates that
in an incident some years ago when a Soviet submarine sank,
survivors were found after three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience with the Soviet submarine forces, it can
be as long as two to three weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the
western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a
nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.(Russia-

WASHINGTON -- The White House on Thursday reacted angrily to
leaked reports that independent prosecutor Robert Ray has convened
a new grand jury to decide if President Bill Clinton should face
fresh charges for the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven, but given the
record of the office of the independent counsel, it is not
surprising," White House spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the jury will investigate whether
Clinton committed perjury or obstruction of justice by denying an
affair with White House intern Lewinsky during sworn testimony. (

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright held a work meeting Thursday with her Chilean
counterpart Soledad Alvear, exchanging opinions over global,
regional and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the meeting, Soledad Alvear
said both countries "share the same visions" over many issues and
that with these advances it will be soon possible for them to
arrive at a free trade accord in the framework of the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Albright described as "historical and significant" the recent
decision by the Chilean Supreme Court to strip former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet of immunity.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States will declassify more than 11,000
documents on the 1973-1990 rule of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, has stripped of immunity from prosecution and
could put on trial in connection with the deaths and
disappearances of political opponents during his regime.
</P>
<P>
As part of her South America tour, Albright arrived to Santiago
on Thursday morning for an one-day visit to Chile. She was
scheduled to meet Chilean President Ricardo Lagos during her stay
here.

<HEADLINE> Henman Beats El Aynaoui in RAC Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Briton Tim Henman was
extended fully to a third-set tiebreaker in the battle against
Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco Thursday in the third round of the
RCA Championships in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
The 4-6 6-2 7-6 (7-2)victory moved the seventh-seeded Henman
into the quarter-finals against the winner of the Thursday evening
match between second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia and
Gianluca Pozzi of Italy.
</P>
<P>
 Henman, a finalist last week at the Tennis Masters Series-
Cincinnati tournament where he lost to Swede Thomas Enqvist, was
simply outplayed in the first set by El Aynaoui.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan broke serve at ad-out in the ninth game of the
first set with a winning backhand crosscourt passing shot.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Henman regrouped and put his serve-and-
volley game to work, taking a 5-1 lead. The Briton lost his serve
when serving for the set in the seventh game,but won the next game
to even the score at one set apiece.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, both players played risk-free tennis.
</P>
<P>
 At 6-5 in the final set, Henman had three match points on El
Aynaoui's serve in the 12th game, but the Moroccan was able to
hold on a little bit longer.
</P>
<P>
In the tiebreaker, play stayed on serve until Henman scored
minibreaks on the sixth and seventh points for a 5-2 lead. On the
first of those points El Aynaoui hit a forehand deep and then
double-faulted to end his chances of winning the match.

<HEADLINE> Separated Families Hope for More Family Reunions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thursday is the last day for the DPRK separated family members,
who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day family reunions with
their South Korean relatives, to share the joy of brief family
reunions in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
With just one day left before returning to Pyongyang Friday
morning, the DPRK people kept exchanging family stories and
promised to see each other again, but broke in tears once again as
the question was left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton Walker Hill Hotel where they stay was bustling
with South Koreans who eagerly wanted to meet their DPRK
relatives but were excluded from the list restricted by Seoul and
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
A large number of South Koreans who came from the DPRK five
decades ago visited the hotel to contact the visiting DPRK people,
asking them help confirm whether their families and relatives in
the DPRK are still alive.
</P>
<P>
Some reunited families held parties for those who will
celebrate their birthdays in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Kim Ok-bae, 62, a DPRK professor, was thrown a birthday party
at the hotel by her 88-year-old mother and other families in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Some of the visiting DPRK people expressed regrets that they
were not able to see all their family members or relatives because
of restrictive regulations.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see all my relatives here in South Korea but I
couldn't do so. I feel as if time passed by like lightning,'' said
70-year-old Oh Kyong-su.
</P>
<P>
Yang Han-sang, 69, may be the saddest man of the 100 DPRK
people as he was the only one who failed to meet his 87-year-old
mother, who is very sick in Sokyo-dong in Seoul, some 40-minute
ride to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
"I shall be enormously deplored if I return to North Korea
without even seeing my mother in five decades,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Ha Kyong, 74, who met three sons in South Korea, burst into
tears when his sons wished him good health.
</P>
<P>
"Korea is the only country in the world in which families are
barred from meeting each other for decades,'' he said in tears.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, South Korean Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu
hosted a farewell dinner for the DPRK separated family members at
Seoul Hyatt Hotel.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Declares Epidemic Alert at Argentina, Brazil Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's government
declared an epidemiological alert at the Argentina-Brazil border
Thursday to prevent the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease
into its territory.
</P>
<P>
The state of alert was declared by President Luis Gonzalez
Macchi. He affirmed that "it is necessary to carry out preventive
measures to stop foot-and-mouth disease from entering Paraguayan
territory."
</P>
<P>
The measures, which include a preventive vaccination campaign
for cattle bred in border areas, were taken because of "the
emergency situation declared in the Republic of Argentina as a
consequence of the appearance of foot-and-mouth disease,"
according to the decree.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay has denied that cattle bred on its land entered
Argentina with the virus, as Argentine health authorities claim.
</P>
<P>
Beef exports from Paraguay have been suspended to Argentina and
Brazil, which represents the larger part of the Paraguayan market,
according to official reports.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Request Panel to Solve Sugar Controversy with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking Mexican
official said Thursday that Mexico would request a panel under the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to resolve the dispute
with the United States on the export of its surplus sugar
production.
</P>
<P>
Herminio Mendoza, the secretary of commerce and industrial
promotion, said the request was made following the local sugar
industry rejected a U.S. proposal to resolve the issue on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currently allows the entry of about 25,000 metric tons
of Mexican sugar free of duties and would accept the increase to
250,000 tons from October 1 for the 2001-2002 period, according to
the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
But Mexican authorities estimated the country's sugar surplus
at between 500,000 and 600,000 tons and Mexico would look for an
accord for an intermediate solution to its export to the United
States, which in any case would be between 375,000 and 450,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sugar industry fears that increased Mexican imports
would flood its already oversupplied market, adding to pressure
that has pressed down domestic sugar prices to a 22-year low.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Economy Grows Well in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's economy developed
well in the first half of the year, with industrial production and
foreign trade jumping drastically, compared with the same period
last year, according to figures released Thursday from the
national statistic bureau.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that industrial production in the first
seven months rose by 20 percent, topped by nonmetal and
construction materials with a growth rate of 55.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in July increased 24.3 percent from that of
the same month in 1999, but dropped 5.3 percent in June because of
seasonal factors. Economists here believe the decrease will not
affect the planned 15-percent growth of the gross national product
(GNP) this year.
</P>
<P>
In the trade sector, bureau statistics said the total amount of
foreign trade in the first six months increased 26.1 percent, with
imports rising 31.4 percent and exports 15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food products led the list of exported commodities worth 120
million U.S. dollars, followed by non-ferrous metals worth 114
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's major trade partners are Germany, Italy, Russia
and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav economy, which has dampened in the recent decade
due to domestic and external political factors, was further
worsened by the 78-day NATO bombing of the Balkan country last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country has been gathering strength because of favorable
government policies and painstaking efforts of the Yugoslav people.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Appeals to Guyana to Respect Geneva Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
Thursday called on Guyanese authorities to recognize the Geneva
accord on the solution of a land dispute.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said some Guyanese officials refused to recognize the
existence of the accord on the problem of 150,000-square kilometer
Esequibo land, southeast of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
He said that all of the Esequibo river land up to its mouth on
the Atlantic Ocean is legally Venezuela's territory.
</P>
<P>
Chavez made the remarks in response to recent statements by
Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee, who said that Guyana will
not yield even an inch of Esequibo to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his country does not intend to provoke
conflicts and is ready to resolve the dispute on the negotiation
table.
</P>
<P>
Guyana conceded in 1999 part of the land, known as Esequibo,
which is rich in oil, minerals and forests, to an American firm
for establishing a satellite launch base and another part for oil
exploitation, which provoked Venezuela's protest and generated
tensions in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela claimed sovereignty over this land from Britain in
the 19th century and from Guyana 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> China to Close Tax Loophole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers are due to
review an amendment to the tax collection law to prevent state
taxes from being nibbled away.
</P>
<P>
The existing tax collection law cannot deal with the practice
of local authorities that mixed up local and central taxation and
diverted part of central revenue to local coffers, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The existing law, enacted in 1993, does not cover the new
developments since China started to share taxes between local and
central authorities in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The State Council is expected to submit the amendment to the
17th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), which is scheduled to open in Beijing
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The amendment should fill the gap in the current law to
prevent taxation evasion," said Yao Jiamin, division chief of the
Department of Tax Collection and Management of the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
He said that the amendment will help prevent corruption caused
by nibbling central treasury funds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the existing law does not stipulate all tax duties
and the responsibilities of companies to inform tax collecting
agencies before they declare bankruptcy or merge with other
corporations.
</P>
<P>
Other unlawful practices that need amending include selling
illegal value-added-tax receipts, interfering with tax collecting
agencies and illegal tax reduction and exemption, China Daily
quoted Yao as saying.

<HEADLINE> Russian Sub Rescue Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Frantic efforts continued Friday
with little progress to save the 118 servicemen aboard a Russian
nuclear submarine that has been stranded on the floor of the
Barents Sea since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin has announced that he would leave for
Moscow later Friday, cutting short his stay in Crimea, Ukraine,
where he was attending an informal summit of the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came amid rising criticism of his decision not
to cut short his vacation in the Black Sea resort of Sochi and of
Moscow's initial rejection of foreign help in rescuing the sailors
of the Kursk, which went down during a naval exercise last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There are still conflicting versions on what caused the tragedy.
While Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said the sub had
collided with a heavy object, the commander of the Northern Fleet,
Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, said the sinking could also be caused by
an explosion inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and that
the nuclear reactors aboard have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
As the Russian military confront repeated failure in attempts
to dock its rescue vessels with the submarine, hopes for the
sailors' safe return are becoming more and more slim.
</P>
<P>
Signs of life on board have not been registered since last
Monday, but the rescuers hope that submariners are lying low to
conserve oxygen and strength.
</P>
<P>
Popov, the fleet commander, said attempts to search for and
find the submarine's crew began immediately after it failed to
respond to radio signals at a predetermined time.
</P>
<P>
"We did not waste a single minute or hour in starting the
rescue operation," the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Admiral Eduard Baltin, a former commander of the
Black Sea Fleet, suggested Friday that the Kursk might have
suffered a collision with a U.S. submarine.
</P>
<P>
Baltin used to command Division 41 of missile-carrying
submarines under project 667 of the Russian Northern Fleet, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I spent three hours at the computer modeling the situation and
arrived at this conclusion: the Kursk submarine did not hit a dry
freight ship or an ice-breaker, even if they were very deep in the
water. It hit a U.S. submarine," Baltin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Navy headquarters have refrained from making any
comments on the Kursk disaster scenario suggested by Baltin,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
While the nation and the whole world hope for the sailors' safe
return to the surface, the relatives of those aboard Kursk are
having an especially hard time.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government decided Friday to provide 500,000 rubles
(18,031 U.S. dollars) to help those families who arrived in
Murmansk, the city near the site of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Many families came to Murmansk without enough money and they
were not expecting to stay there so long, and some of the people
who traveled to Murmansk spent literally the family's last
resources, a government session on the rescue efforts was told.

<P>
SANTIAGO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright ended Friday a visit to Chile and left for La
Paz, Bolivia, as part of a tour of South America.
</P>
<P>
Albright talked Thursday with Chilean President Ricardo Lagos
in the Palace of La Moneda, and with Foreign Minister Soledad
Alvear.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean foreign minister said "we share (with Albright) the
same visions" on global, regional and bilateral issues.
</P>

<P>
Albright praised the recent Chilean Supreme Court decision on

Pinochet, and announced that her government will declassify 11,000
CIA documents linked to the Chilean military regime.
</P>
<P>

foreign minister in the government of the deposed President
Salvador Allende, who was assassinated in Washington in 1976.
</P>

Lagos denied that his government is investigating the Letelier
case, although it promised to supply all the possible
collaboration.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Barak, Arafat Next Month: U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during the U.N. General Assembly
meeting in New York next month, U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross told
Barak here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's office said Ross told Barak that
the window of opportunity is closing with regard to the peace
process and the time factor is becoming critical.
</P>
<P>
Barak replied there is no point in meeting with Arafat as long
as there have been no positive changes in his positions.
</P>
<P>
Ross also met Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat at an
undisclosed location in Jerusalem. Erekat was quoted by Reuters as
saying "The gap between the sides are still there and it is still
premature to talk about summit."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they had discussed holding a new summit, Erekat
said no such proposal was discussed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy also met on Friday afternoon with Israeli
Minister of Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day before meeting Israeli President Moshe
Katsav, Ross said it is still too early to say whether the Israelis
and Palestinians are able to reach an agreement in the wake of the
failure of last month's Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the summit meeting was significant but there are still
differences that have to be overcome between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy arrived here Thursday in a bid to revive the
peace talks and met Israeli Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
Thursday afternoon. Ben-Ami said "another summit would be
reasonable only if there was a noticeable move" in the stance of
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus FM Calls for Change of Procedure on Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Friday called for a change of procedure to pave the way
for meaningful negotiations to settle the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Russian Ambassador to
Nicosia Vladimir Pavlinov, the minister underlined "substantive
talks have to take place, without preconditions and based on U.N.
resolutions" for a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
While explaining what a change in procedure means, Kasoulides
said "we mean to stop talking and start negotiating."
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that the talks are substantive and not so
much whether they are direct or proximity," he said, noting that "
for us these talks aim at searching for a settlement in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island, has been divided into
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island following a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. embarked on a procedure of proximity talks and separate
meetings with the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders last
December to pave the way for substantive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meetings were also held in February and July during which the
two sides elaborated on their positions. Another round of talks are
scheduled to start in New York on September 12 and expected to end
early October.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the Greek Cypriot side has given its consent to
a calendar for the talks until the beginning of October.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance after the beginning of October will be decided then
by the National Council, depending on our assessment of the talks,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Council is the top advisory body to the president
on the Cyprus issue comprising parliamentary parties.

<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh is due to visit Egypt on Sunday to prepare for a visit by
President Bashar al-Assad, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad has not travelled abroad since taking power last month.
His visit to Egypt is expected to take place at the end of August,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Shareh's visit will last two days, during which he will meet
with President Hosni Mubarak and hand him a message from al-Assad,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister will hold talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa to discuss the Syrian-Israeli peace process
and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They will also deal with bilateral relations and other regional
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Shareh's visit is part of the continued consultations between
the two countries, two political heavyweights in the Arab world and
the Middle East, on regional issues, especially the Mideast peace
talks, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Names Special Envoy for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan intends to send Abubakar, former head of state of Nigeria
to the subregion within the next few days to "make clear once more
" the position of the Security Council and the role of the U.N.
Mission to the DRC, known as the MONUC, Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar is mandated to discuss with the government of the DRC
issues on the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement, including a
cessation of hostilities and the granting of full freedom of
movement to the MONUC, he said.
</P>
<P>
A civil war broke out in the DRC in August 1998, with some
regional countries involved in supporting the government of
President Laurent-Desire Kabila and some others supporting the
anti-government forces.
</P>
<P>
The two-year conflict cost 1.7 million lives, leaving 1 million
wounded and over 2 million displaced.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, 1999 the belligerent sides signed a cease-fire
agreement in Lusaka, Zambia, but armed clashes along front lines
have gone on, making the agreement fragile.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution in February this year,
deciding to send 5,000 peacekeeping troops to the DRC and
extending the MONUC's mandate until August 31.
</P>
<P>
Despite the appeal of the international community for a rapid
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops, it is difficult for the U.
N. to take actual action because of the unstable situation in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
This week Annan asked the Security Council to extend the MONUC'
s mandate by one month until September 30 to give him more time to
assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's visit to the region is expected to take him also to
Lusaka for talks with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and
Addis Ababa for discussions with Organization of African Unity (
OAU) Secretary-General Salim A. Salim, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> EU Experts Find Suspect Source of Swine Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- European Union researchers have
found possible origins of swine fever in Britain which might be
brought into Europe from Asia two years ago by an illegally
imported wild boar, the European Commission said Friday.
</P>
<P>
EU researchers in Germany have matched their identified strain
to one already on their files, sourcing it to a wild boar imported
into Europe in 1998, spokeswoman for the Commission Andrea Dahmen
told reporters at a briefing here in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the strain has appeared since and it was
likely that the boar infected a pig on the European continent that
was subsequently exported into Britain, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokeswoman could not say exactly where in Asia
the boar had come from or in which EU country it was found. But it
had no vaccination certificates because it was illegally imported.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that the virus strain comes from a wild boar
from Asia. It has been isolated and stored in our laboratory in
Hanover," Ms. Dahmen said. "We have thought there was possibly a
reservoir of that virus left in Europe. That seems not the case
now," she added.
</P>
<P>
Dahmen also said the number of confirmed infected sites in
England remained at five, and this was "rather encouraging." Swine
fever is highly contagious and nearly always fatal to pigs,
although it poses no threat to humans. Experts say the virus can
spread like wildfire through herds. So far, some 12,000 animals
have already been slaughtered in England since the outbreak of
swine fever was found in East Anglia in England early this month.
</P>
<P>
The latest discovery could have calmed some fears in Europe
because it had been suspected the virus was the same one that hit
the Netherlands in 1997 and subsequently spread to Belgium and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In that case, some 14 million pigs were slaughtered in total
and close to a billion euro (916.3 million U.S. dollars) was paid
out in compensation, according to Dahmen.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Banks Ready for Early Euro Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Belgian banks are actively
following a recommendation by the European Union to introduce euro-
only accounts from July 1, 2001, six months ahead of the official
and compulsory switch schedule, said local press reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm,
has said it is high time to give individual account holders and
businesses the opportunity to get accustomed to the euro currency.
</P>
<P>
In 500 days from now on, Belgians will have to do all their
shopping in euro notes and coins, but most citizens are still
holding on to account in Belgian francs. Only 6 percent of
businesses work with euro accounts, according to banks data.
</P>
<P>
The banks in this country agree that it would be a good idea to
introduce euro accounts six months ahead of the beginning time of
euro coins and notes on January 1, 2002, but it is better to
express the equivalent amount in Belgian francs during the switch
period.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mideast Envoy: Window of Chances for Peace Deal Dwindling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. special envoy to
the Middle East Dennis Ross said Friday that the window of chances
for reaching a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians is
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
Ross made the remark while meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak who told him that it is pointless to hold another summit
meeting before seeing a substantial change in the Palestinian
stance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day before meeting Israeli President Moshe
Katsav, Ross said that it is still too early to say whether the
Israelis and Palestinians are able to reach an agreement in the
wake of the failure of last month's Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the summit meeting was significant but there are still
differences that have to be overcome between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, who arrived here Thursday in a bid to revive
the peace talks, also met Minister of Regional Cooperation Shimon
Peres Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ross on Thursday met acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami who
said that "another summit would be reasonable only if there was a
noticeable move" in the stance of the Palestinian National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Friday, Barak's office said in a
statement that there are no formal understandings at this point on
the fate of the Jordan Valley in the negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that any agreement would include continued
Israeli settlement and security presence in the region, which was
seized by the Israelis in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The statement was in response to a request by the right-wing
United Settlement Movement for a clarification of Israel's position
on the matter following remarks by cabinet minister Amnon Lipkin-
Shahak Friday morning that the Jordan Valley settlements will come
under Palestinian sovereignty in a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there have also been speculations that the Jordan
Valley is likely to be evacuated in a future peace deal with the
Palestinians as the region is mostly filled with small settlements
which house about 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The future of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories is
one of the core issues to be settled by the Israelis and
Palestinians in their final status negotiations. There are
currently about 190,000 Israelis living in 125 settlements.

CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Foreign trade in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has
witnessed a quantum leap within the past 15 years, making the
country one of the main trading hubs in the Gulf and the Middle
East, the official WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The country's volume of imports increased notably from 11
billion dirhams (3.0 billion U.S. dollars) in 1975 to 99 billion
dirhams (27 billion dollars) in 1999. And exports volume surged
from 39 billion dirhams (10.7 billion dollars) to 130 billion
dirhams (35.5 billion dollars), of which 10 billion dirhams (2.73
billion dollars) were non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports volume was estimated at 23 billion dirhams (6.3
billion dollars) in 1999, bringing the volume of the country's non-
oil foreign trade to 131 billion dirhams (35.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Though oil is still the country's major foreign currency earner,
its share dropped from 45.3 percent in 1996 to 40 percent in 1997
due to the emergence of new exported products.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries, mainly Japan and China, continued to top the
list of importers as imports from these countries rose from 43
percent in 1990 to 45.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Imports volume from Japan dropped to 9 billion dirhams (2.5
billion dollars) in 1999, compared to 10.5 billion dirhams (2.87
billion dollars) in 1998. Imports from Europe also experienced a
slight drop.

</P>
<P>
The Czech exports to the EU increased by 23.5 percent to 377.3
billion crowns (10 billion U.S. dollars) in the January-June

<HEADLINE> Russia Willing to Actively Assist Peace Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
underlined its willingness to actively assist efforts to reach a
settlement in Cyprus based on U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian stand was contained in a message sent on Friday by
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to his Cypriot counterpart
Ioannis Kassoulides on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russian ambassador to Nicosia Vladimir Pavlinov handed Ivanov's
message to Kasoulides, who is also sending a similar message to his
Russian counterpart thanking him for Moscow's consistent support to
the efforts for reaching a settlement in Cyprus, the Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus by
way of establishment of a bicommunal, bizonal federation with a
single international personality, in accordance with the parameters
defied in the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, would be to the interest
of all the Cypriots," Ivanov said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has consistently stood, including in the
framework of the U.N. Security Council, for the achievement of a
lasting, just and viable solution of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov noted the Cyprus issue has continued for too long,
causing pain and suffering to the island's people and complicating
the political situation in the Eastern Mediterranean island and in
the southeast of Europe in general.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister described cooperation between the
two countries in the political, economic, educational, defense and
other fields as "constructive" and said this is a guarantee for
their further improvement.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides' letter to his Russian counterpart was scheduled to
be handed Friday by Cyprus' ambassador to Moscow Charalambos
Ioannides.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Kasoulides reportedly thanks the Russian
government and people for the consistent support and understanding
to the Cyprus government and people on the island's political
issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the principled position adopted by
the Russian Federation on Cyprus will continue in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also underlined every state has the right to combat
international terrorism and armed insurgencies on its own soil.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after an abortive pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit rose
to a new record of 30.6 billion U.S. dollars in June as U.S.
imports of industrial supplies and crude oil increased, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The June deficit was up 1 percent from May's 30.3 billion
dollars, which was revised down from the government's previous
estimate of 31 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total imports of goods and services were up by 4.3 billion
dollars to 121.2 billion dollars in June. Exports increased by 4
billion dollars to 90.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase in June's imports mostly reflected a jump in
shipments of crude oil, automobiles, parts and engines and
consumer goods, such as televisions, stereos and toys. And imports
of capital goods, including computer accessories and
semiconductors, were up 0.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, the increase came from stronger demand for
capital goods, which jumped 2.1 billion dollars, and industrial
supplies, up 0.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit totaled
177.6 billion dollars, surpassing the record 116 billion dollars
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose to 518.7 billion dollars during the first six
months of the year from 464.6 billion dollars in the same period
in 1999, while imports increased to 696.3 billion dollars from 580.
6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) jumped from 4.1 billion dollars in May to 4.6
billion dollars in June. Imports from OPEC nations rose to 6.03
billion dollars in June from 5.4 billion dollars May.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan fell to 6.3 billion dollars in June from
6.9 billion dollars in May, while the deficit with Western Europe
dropped to 4.3 billion dollars from 5.7 billion dollars. But the
trade shortfall with Canada rose to a new high of 4.3 billion
dollars in June from 3.7 billion dollars in May.

<HEADLINE> Federal Ministers Attack Initiative Imposing Quotas for Foreigners in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss federal government has
launched its offensive against a proposal to introduce quotas for
foreigners, warning of the detrimental consequences of the
initiative, which goes to a nationwide vote next month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference Friday, Economics Minister Pascal
Couchepin and Justice Minister Ruth Metzler said that the proposal
would solve none of Switzerland's problems, and would only serve
to damage the economy and Switzerland's standing in the world.
</P>
<P>
On September 24, Swiss voters will cast their ballots on the so-
called "18 percent initiative," a plan to keep the number of
foreigners in Switzerland to 18 percent of the population.
Currently, foreigners make up 19.3 percent of the country's whole
population of about 7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
According to a Swiss Radio International report, Metzler said a
yes vote to the initiative would be "detrimental to Switzerland
and all its people." Couchepin described as "absurd" any attempt
to place an "arbitrary" quota on the number of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The ministers concentrated their fire on the economic and
diplomatic issues surrounding the initiative. Metzler said it
would damage Switzerland's humanitarian tradition and set back
efforts to improve relations between foreigners and native Swiss.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the ministers used the occasion to put in a good word
for the government's proposed new law governing policy towards
foreigners. Launched in the wake of the campaign for the 18
percent initiative, the law would make it tougher for non-EU
citizens to come to Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Meets Shas Leader over Peace Talks, Social Issues 1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas
party leader Eli Yishai said on Friday that during his meeting with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv, they discussed the latest
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and major
social affairs.
</P>
<P>
Yishai denied any talks over the party's re-entry into the
coalition as reported earlier. He said Barak and he agreed to meet
again in the future, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been speculations that Barak is still
interested in bringing Shas back into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party with 17 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (Parliament), plays a pivotal role in the parliamentary
endorsement of any governmental move.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing party, which used to be the largest ruling
partner in Barak's coalition, quit on the eve of Barak's departure
for the July 11-25 Camp David Summit, citing differences with his
peace policies.
</P>
<P>
The summit, however, ended in failure due to the wide gaps
between Israel and the Palestinians over the final status issues,
particularly the status of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Following his return from the summit, Barak embarked on the task
of patching up his fragmented coalition which was dwarfed to only
40 seats in the Knesset as a result of the resignation of coalition
partners.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has so far made some appointments to fill up
vacancies left by the former ruling partners, with three portfolios
vacated by the pro-peace Meretz Party remaining open.
</P>
<P>
Following the withdrawal of its backing for Barak at a critical
moment prior to the Camp David Summit despite Barak's repeated
concessions to meet its demands, Shas dealt the ruling Labor Party
another heavy blow during the presidential election on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Shas was believed to play the key role in bringing about the
dramatic defeat of the leading candidate Shimon Peres from Labor by
casting their votes for the Likud candidate Moshe Katsav.
</P>
<P>
Shas has since then sent out mixed signals as to whether to
rejoin the coalition, sometimes slamming the door and sometimes
keeping the hope alive for Barak.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz Party, the arch rival of Shas with 10 seats
in the Knesset, had its three ministers resigned in June at the
height of the government crisis in order to enable Barak to keep
Shas.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by the refusal of Meretz leader Yossi
Sarid, former education minister, to allocate more funds to Shas's
educational network unless the latter improved its management.
</P>
<P>
Meretz has expressed its willingness to return to the government
on condition that it retains the education portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Sarid Tuesday night on Meretz's return but failed to
reach an agreement. Both agreed to meet in a few days to discuss
the issue again.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly planned to use the time to gauge the
chances of getting Shas back into the coalition. Meretz, in the
meantime, has accused Barak of foot-dragging in the talks over its
return to the government.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Meretz and the secular Shinui Party, another rival of
Shas, blasted Barak for forgetting the old scars by courting Shas
again.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Ha'aretz Friday quoted people close to Barak
as saying that the meeting between Barak and Yishai was not aimed
at inviting Shas back, but rather at determining Yishai's
positions.
</P>
<P>
Shas officials said on Thursday that they do not see the meeting
as important and that they are focusing more on elections than
returning to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak's associates say the prime minister has no intention to
speed up his coalition-building talks so long as there are no
dramatic developments on the diplomatic front and the Knesset is
still in recess.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that after his meeting with Yishai, Barak will
call for another meeting with Sarid in preparation for the return
of Meretz to the cabinet, said Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted sources in the Prime Minister's Office as
saying Barak is also talking with other parties regarding their
possible entry into the coalition, including the two-seat
Democratic Choice faction, and the Likud, though indirectly.
</P>
<P>
But analysts and political insiders here believe there is a
strong smell of early elections in the air.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to meet U.S. special envoy on the Middle East
Dennis Ross Friday afternoon to discuss ways to advance the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and to examine chances for holding
another summit in a bid to strike a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Makes New Efforts to Promote Rubber Plantation  By Li Chaobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Government of
Cambodia has encouraged farmers to produce more rubber products so
as to increase their income and to contribute in eliminating
poverty in this war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
In new efforts to promote rubber plantation, a five-point
policy was spelled out at the cabinet meeting recently in which
Prime Minister Hun Sen participated.
</P>
<P>
Following is the main points of the new policy:
</P>
<P>
1. Farmers have right to possess their original lands without
disturbance by the government or any privates, and they are
authorized to transfer their land to any other persons depending
upon their will.
</P>
<P>
2. To facilitate the credit loan from Rural Development Bank to
poor families.
</P>
<P>
3. Techniques and training for plantation, as well as
information for marketing and other services, will be offered to
rubber planters.
</P>
<P>
4. Free marketing of their rubber products by farmers.
</P>
<P>
5. Association of rubber plantation will be allowed to set up
for protection of farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has a great potential to develop rubber production.
About 300,000 hectares are suitable to plant rubber trees, which
would produce more than 200,000 tons of dry rubber a year. But the
industry has suffered from decades of warfare, neglect and bad
management.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 43,600 hectares are used for rubber planting,
33,000 of them are controlled by the authorities, while 5,000
hectares are privatized and the rest are planted by individual
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The soil in Cambodia's central and eastern provinces, including
Kompong Thom, Kompong Cham, Kratie, Mondulkiri and Ratanakkiri
provinces, is suitable for culturing rubber trees. The authorities
are urging farmers there to plant rubber seedlings to guarantee
future income from their land.
</P>
<P>
Ly Phalla, director general for the Rubber General Directorate,
said the other day that seedlings planted now could start yielding
latex for export in seven years, and could keep harvesting rubber
for up to 40 years, which can benefit planters a lot.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country produced 46,214 tons of dry rubber,
compared with 40,820 tons a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the Royal Government plans to expand the size of
rubber plantation from currently 43,600 hectares to 50,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide the poor families with their needed
financial aid, the Royal Government works hard to strive for more
foreign fund or loans. The French government recently donated one
million U.S. dollars for a rubber-growing program in Kompong Cham
province.
</P>
<P>
The government, meanwhile, has negotiated with World Bank to
get a 5-year credit loan totaling 15 million dollars for a
feasibility study on the rubber planting expansion.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President to Get Polio Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos will get here on Friday the "polio eradication champion
award" issued by the Rotary International for his efforts to speed
up the immunization operations against the poliomyelitis in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by the Rotary International, the
award is a recognition of dos Santos' commitment to eradicate the
disease in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
The progress made in the fight of polio in Angola is "
extraordinarily good", said Luis Vicente Giay, Curator of the
Rotary International, on arriving here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the award is meant for all those who are in the fight
against poliomyelitis, including volunteers working in this field.
</P>
<P>
The honor has already been awarded to such prominent figures
like U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.K. former Prime Minister John
Major, Egyptian first lady Suzane Mubarak, Nigerian head of state
Olusegun Obasanjo and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Rotary International, poliomyelitis was a
threat to the whole world in 1988, but nowadays it only hits
children in Africa and some southern Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, the immunization activity is severely affected by
poor health infrastructures, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Rotary International, founded by lawyer Paul Harris in 1905
in Chicago, the United States, has 1.2 million members in 162
countries. It is one of the world's biggest non-lucrative
volunteer service organizations.
</P>
<P>
With the support of international health agencies and
governments, the Rotary International has launched its most
ambitious initiative, the "polio plus" program, in an effort to
make sure the world is free of polio by 2005.

rate in July remained unchanged from the level in previous month
at 2.4 percent, the European Union's statistical office, Eurostat,
said Friday.
</P>

reported the highest annual rate with 5.9 percent, followed by
Luxembourg with 4.7 percent and Spain with 3.7 percent. Britain
recorded the lowest with 1.0 percent, followed by Sweden with 1.3
percent. Germany, France and Austria all had a 2 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the situation in July 1999, Luxembourg registered
the sharpest rise, from -0.3 to 4.7 percent. The only relative
drop was reported in Britain, from 1.3 to 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Migrants Pass 1st Night With Mixed Feelings in Shanghai Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Pan Jialong, one of the 639
former Three Gorges villagers resettled on Shanghai's Chongming
Island, held a family meeting in his new home on Thursday, the
first day they arrived at the new place.
</P>
<P>
Pan used to support his family through a river transport
business, but the 25-year-old man was confident that he could soon
find a new way to make his fortune where he lives now.
</P>
<P>
He said he is experienced in making stainless steel kitchenware,
so it will be easy for him to find a new job. "I also want my wife
to learn how to use a computer or to drive," he said. "Things are
certain to get better when we have certain skills."
</P>
<P>
The only family member absent from the meeting was Pan's
sleeping son who turned one-month old on Friday (today). A grand
party was held for the occasion, according to Chinese custom,
participated by his new neighbors and village head.
</P>
<P>
The other members of Pan's family in Chongming are his mother,
wife, sister, grandfather in law and father in law.
</P>
<P>
The night of August 17 aroused mixed feelings among these
former Three Gorges residents whose homes are going to be
submerged once the gigantic dam project is completed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
They were happy to find their new homes on Chongming Island, a
suburban island in northern Shanghai, a beautiful place to live,
but they were sad as well, when they thought about their relatives
and dear old houses in Yunyang County, Chongqing Municipality, on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xuelan, 36, cried. The woman was really happy that she
received the big new house and fertile fields but became tearful
because she missed her parents, now 2,000 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
"I want to visit my parents next Spring Festival (the Chinese
Lunar New Year)," she said, but wondered if she could manage to
get enough money, 1,000 yuan at least, to cover the traveling
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jibo was the busiest among the relocated villagers since he
was the first to apply for moving to Shanghai. He was invited to
speak on behalf of the migrants at a welcoming ceremony held by
the county government of Chongming.
</P>
<P>
Then he was besieged by curious reporters who followed him all
day until late in the evening. Liao Qinglan, his wife, managed to
clean up the house alone trying to keep things in order.
</P>
<P>
But Xu was thinking about something else. He decided to buy a
telephone and a TV set at request of his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
"I've got many relatives and they are wondering about how we
would live in the new place," he said. "With the phone, I can tell
my relatives and friends that we are satisfied."

<HEADLINE> China's 1st Autonomous Prefecture Marks 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A festive ceremony including
dancing was held in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, in
southwestern China's Sichuan Province, to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the prefecture's founding.
</P>
<P>
The local government of Ganzi, the first ethnic minority
autonomous prefecture in China, was congratulated by central and
provincial governments for the event.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous prefecture was set up in 1950, the year it was
peacefully liberated from slave owners.
</P>
<P>
Currently, people from 30 different ethnic groups, mostly
Tibetan, Yi, Hui and Qiang, live in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the prefecture's gross domestic product reached 2.36
billion yuan, 26 times that 50 years ago; while its total
industrial output value approached 580 million yuan, growing by
106 folds in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The total mileage of local highways extended 7,444 kilometers,
more than 74 percent of the villages have electricity supply, and
optic fiber telecommunication is available in all villages.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture now has 1,200 schools and colleges with 90,000
students, compared with 40 and 3,100 five decades ago, compared to
3,100 before 1950.

DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed
announced Friday that he is donating his eyes posthumously to
Sandhani Eye Donation Association so that a blind man would be
able to see by using them, the official Bangladesh News Agency
reported here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function organized by the association to draw
Sandhani Prevention of Blindness Lottery 2000, Tofail said it was
really encouraging that some 1,296 blind people so far regained
their eyesight after cornea transplantation, and 32,850 persons
committed themselves to donating their eyes posthumously.
</P>
<P>
Later the minister took part in the lottery draw in which a
ticket won the first prize worth 2.5 million taka (46,000 U.S.
dollars) or a residential flat.
</P>
<P>
Sandhani Eye Donation Association started to sell tickets worth
48 million taka (900,000 dollars) against the lottery. Sandhani
will spend the money to establish a modern eye bank and a cornea
transplant hospital.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured the association to help in seeking more
fund through Economic Relations Division and getting land for
establishing the cornea transplant hospital.

<HEADLINE> Putin Fields Criticism Over Handling of Sub Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
said he would return to Moscow later Friday, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came amid rising dissatisfaction over his
perceived inaction following the sinking of the Kursk nuclear
submarine in the Barents Sea last weekend. All efforts have so far
failed to rescue the 118 servicemen aboard.
</P>
<P>
Putin is attending an informal summit of the Commonwealth of
Independent States in Crimea, Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He defended his decision not to cut short his vacation in the
Black Sea resort of Sochi and go to the Barents Sea following the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Boris Nemtsov, leader of the Union of Right Forces
parliamentary group, said Putin's behavior was "amoral."
</P>
<P>
"As the supreme commander-in-chief he has no right to vacation
while his subordinates, Northern Fleet sailors, face this drama,"
Nemtsov said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Nor is there a reasonable explanation why Putin did not agree
to accept foreign help before Wednesday, when much valuable time
had been wasted," Interfax quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Putin said his first reaction upon hearing the news of the
incident was to fly to the place where Kursk sank.
</P>
<P>
"But I stopped myself, and I think I did the right thing,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"When non-specialists and high-ranking officials come to a
disaster area, it does not help, but most often hampers (the work),
" he said. "Everyone should be in his own place."
</P>
<P>
Putin also defended the performance of the military, saying
they had acted right away.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that this information got to mass media late is a
different thing," he said. "One can criticize it, but one can also
understand that the sailors needed to sort things out themselves
before official information was given."
</P>
<P>
Putin said that he spoke with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
and Navy Commander Vladimir Kuroyedov immediately after learning
of the accident and was assured by them that Russia has "all the
means for rescue work."
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle hampering rescue efforts has been the storm
and bad weather, the president said. If foreign rescue craft had
come to the accident site, it "would not have improved the weather,
" Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow later agreed to enlist help from Britain and Norway.
Their experts and hardware are on the way, but will not reach the
site until late Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As for the direct participation of our foreign colleagues in
this work, I must once again say that Russia did not reject any
proposals. As soon as they were made, our sailors contacted their
colleagues and immediately began discussing the technical
parameters of the craft for its possible participation," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official version of the cause of the accident,
the submarine collided last Saturday with a heavy object, which
left "a dreadful hole" on its front section. The sub then sank
rapidly to the seabed and encountered another powerful explosion.
</P>
<P>
"Every sign shows that the command of the submarine was
immediately disabled, making a negative impact on subsequent
developments," Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
Video footage suggests that following the disaster, "water
immediately filled the fore, destroying the command bridge, the
brain of the submarine," the RTR television channel reported.
</P>
<P>
Up to 75 people may have died immediately, Interfax said,
quoting an expert.
</P>
<P>
However, the Northern Fleet headquarters refused to predict
the number of dead among the crew of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on board the sub is alive for us until we know what
happened there and we see what is inside it with our own eyes,"
said Igor Babenko, of the fleet's press service.

<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Vowing to let the Concorde
supersonic aircraft fly again in secure conditions, France and
Britain on Friday set up a group to work on the possibility of re-
establishing the airworthiness of Concorde.
</P>
<P>
The French Ministry of Transport said in a communique that the
group, of a permanent nature, will meet in 15 days in Paris to
study the latest result of the investigation on the July 25 crash
of the Air France Concorde near Paris, in which 113 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group will help coordinate the efforts made by
manufacturers of Concorde and their partners in order to re-
establish the airworthiness of the plane.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the aviation officials from France and Britain met
in London to discuss the future of Concorde. Both countries
withdrew the airworthiness certificate of Concorde on Wednesday,
provoking outcries from the French aviation circle and media.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said they hope that the future of Concorde will
not be buried.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation results show the Concorde crash might be
caused by the explosion of a tire of the undercarriage. French and
British aviation authorities have said Concorde cannot be allowed
to fly again unless adequate security measures are taken.

NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's 3,000-meter world record
holder Bernard Barmasai is among seven runners who have opted to
train at home for Olympics instead of training at Adelaide,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, part of the Kenyan Olympic team left for Adelaide
for a two-week pre-Olympic training camp before proceeding to
Sydney next month.
</P>
<P>
The seven runners, who arrived at Eldoret training camp in
western Kenya on Tuesday, include World 1,000-meter record holder
Noah Ng'eny, world junior 3,000-meter steeplechase record holder
Reuben Kosgei, and All African Games 800-meter champion Japheth
Kimutia and 1,500-meter champion Bernard Lagat.
</P>
<P>
The athletes have planned a joint training program on their own
as all the coaches picked to train the Olympic team left for
Adelaide last week for acclimatization.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya Amateur Athletes Association assistant secretary
Kipkemboi Hussein said it was mandatory that all runners would
link up with the rest of the squad before August 25.

Kenya's 12-member national women's volleyball team left here on

JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party leader Eli Yishai on
Friday to discuss coalition issues.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the two were examining the chances of
Shas' return to the coalition. Shas, the third largest party with
17 seats in the 120-member Knesset, plays a pivotal role in the
parliamentary endorsement of any governmental move.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing party, which used to be the largest ruling
partner in Barak's coalition, quit on the eve of Barak's departure
for the July 11-25 Camp David Summit, citing differences with his
peace policies.
</P>
<P>
The summit, however, ended in failure due to the wide gaps
between Israelis and Palestinians over the final status issues,
particularly the fate of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Following his return from the summit, Barak embarked on the task
of patching up his fragmented coalition which was dwarfed to only
40 seats in the Knesset as a result of the resignation of coalition
partners.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has so far made some appointments to fill up
vacancies left by the former ruling partners, with three portfolios
vacated by the pro-peace Meretz Party remaining open.
</P>
<P>
Following the withdrawal of its backing for Barak at a critical
moment prior to the Camp David Summit despite Barak's repeated
concessions to meet its demands, Shas dealt the ruling Labor Party
another heavy blow during the presidential election on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Shas was believed to play the key role in bringing about the
dramatic defeat of the leading candidate Shimon Peres from Labor by
casting their votes for the Likud candidate Moshe Katsav.
</P>
<P>
Shas has since then sent out mixed signals as to whether to
rejoin the coalition, sometimes slamming the door and sometimes
keeping the hope alive for Barak.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz Party, the arch rival of Shas with 10 seats
in the Knesset, had its three ministers resigned in June at the
height of the government crisis in order to enable Barak to keep
Shas. Meretz has expressed the willingness to return to the
government conditionally.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Sarid Tuesday night on Meretz's return but failed to
reach an agreement. Both agreed to meet in a few days to discuss
the issue again.
</P>
<P>
Barak had reportedly planned to use the time to gauge the
chances of getting Shas back into the coalition. Meretz, in the
meantime, has accused Barak of foot-dragging in the talks over its
return to the government.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Meretz and the secular Shinui Party, another rival of
Shas, blasted Barak for forgetting the old scars by courting Shas
again.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Ha'aretz Friday quoted people close to Barak
as saying that the meeting between Barak and Yishai was not aimed
at inviting Shas back, but rather at determining Yishai's position.
</P>
<P>
Shas officials said on Thursday that they do not see the meeting
as important and that they are focusing more on elections than
returning to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak's associates say that the prime minister has no intention
to speed up his coalition-building talks so long as there are no
dramatic developments on the diplomatic front and the Knesset is
still in recess.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that after his meeting with Yishai, Barak will
call in Sarid for another meeting in preparation for the return of
Meretz to the cabinet, said Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted sources in the Prime Minister's Office as
saying that Barak is also talking with other parties regarding
their possible entry into the coalition, including the two-seat
Democratic Choice faction, and the Likud, though indirectly.
</P>
<P>
But analysts and political insiders here believe there is a
strong smell of early elections in the air.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to meet U.S. special envoy on the Middle East
Dennis Ross Friday afternoon to discuss ways to advance the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and to examine chances for holding
another summit in a bid to strike a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Israel Terminates Infringement on Border Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel has terminated its
infringement on a disputed religious grave that is located right on
the U.N.-drawn Israeli-Lebanese borderline.
</P>
<P>
An Nahar newspaper said the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) removed an Israeli-erected barbed-wired fence around the
grave Thursday and established a permanent position at the site
that allowed hundreds of Lebanese civilians to visit and take
pictures.
</P>
<P>
The disputed grave is located in the central sector of the
border on Tall Abbad, or Abbad's Hill. The Israelis claim that
Rabbi Ashi, a renowned Jewish theologian who lived 500 years ago,
is buried in that grave. Muslims contend the tomb belonged to an
Islamic cleric called Sheikh Abdullah Abbad, whose name was given
to the site for the last five centuries.
</P>
<P>
When the U.N. drew the Blue Line, with which it measured the
authenticity of the Israeli withdrawal two months ago after Israeli
troops withdrawal, two thirds of the grave fell inside Lebanese
territory and one third remained in Israel. Lebanon and Israel had
given the U.N. their agreement to the split.
</P>
<P>
But local residents Monday saw Israeli troops with bulldozers
cross into Abbad Hill, removing the Lebanese flag from the grave
and raising their own after fencing off the entire site with barbed
wire.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli army announced in Jerusalem on
Thursday that it had lodged 49 new complaints with UNIFIL against
Fatma Gate hostilities this week.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was officially authorized by Lebanon to patrol the entire
length of the border with the exception of the Fatma Gate,
where the Lebanese have been staging almost daily stone-throwing
attacks on Israeli troops and farmers on the opposite side of the
barb-wired fence.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli communique, which was highlighted by An Nahar, said
Lebanese civilians threw stones, fireworks and locally-made petrol
bombs on Israeli troops and farmers at Fatma Gate in 49 separate
incidents over the past seven days.
</P>
<P>
"This conduct threatens the sensitive stability along the
border. It also underscores the urgent need to deploy UNIFIL units
and Lebanese army troops in the area very quickly," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest protest raised the overall number of Israel's
official complaints to 249 since Israeli troops' withdrawal from
south Lebanon on May 24, ending a 22-year occupation.

CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirate's national carrier,
Emirates airline expressed
interest in Air India's privatization, saying that it will look
into the Indian carrier's tender details to decide whether it will
bid, reported the UAE local media on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions of Air India's tender have not yet been issued
so we can't start making a decision (whether to bid or not). We'll
look at the tender and see if it's something we can venture into,
but that's as far as we can say at the moment," said an Emirates
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that ITC Ltd., India's biggest cigarette
firm, Emirates airline and Swissair may jointly bid for a stake in
Air India, but the spokesman only reiterated Emirate's stand that
it has no plans to bid as yet until the tender details have been
released.

</P>
<P>
Fraud Squad and Finance Ministry inspectors who have been
carrying out operations in 15 provinces discovered that exporters
and other groups have been robbing the state of millions of U.S.
dollars through VAT breaks and simple tax evasion on nonexistent
expenses.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Turkey's new world stock exchange market will be set up and
should be fair and work with minimal costs.

<HEADLINE> Singapore-New Zealand Agreement on Closer Economic Partnership Initiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and New Zealand
initiated an agreement on closer economic partnership (ANZSCEP)
here Friday, bringing an end to their negotiations on the pact.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry
(MTI) said the ANZSCEP is a comprehensive agreement covering trade
in goods and services, investment and government procurement,
amongst others.
</P>
<P>
MTI said that Singapore is very pleased with the outcome of the
negotiations as the ANZSCEP, when implemented, will provide
certainty and predictability for Singapore businesses and
investors, lower barriers to trade and investment and open up
considerable opportunities for the business community of the
island state.
</P>
<P>
The ANZSCEP will also play an important role to promote the
liberalization and integration of regional markets and to hasten
global free trade within the context of WTO, MTI added.
</P>
<P>
The ANZSCEP negotiations were launched at the fringe of the
APEC Leaders' Summit in Auckland, New Zealand, on September 11,
1999, and the agreement was achieved after six rounds of
negotiations since.
</P>
<P>
MTI said both parties will now bring the agreement to their
respective governments to seek final cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
According to MTI, the actual signing of the agreement will
probably take place in late September 2000 and the document is
expected to come into effect early next year.
</P>
<P>
The ANZSCEP will be the second Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for
Singapore after the ASEAN FTA and will further strengthen
bilateral linkages, promote greater trade and investment flows
between the two countries, the MTI said.

<HEADLINE> CBD Blueprint For Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing municipal government
spokesman Shen Baochang said the city is preparing for the public
bidding of the design of the Central Business District (CBD)
project in September.
</P>
<P>
The CBD will be built on a 3.99-sq.km area about two kilometers
east of Tian'anmen Square. Shen said the plan was initiated in the
early 1990s. Over 60 percent of foreign-funded companies and
around 50 percent of star hotels are located in the planned CBD
area.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three office buildings, apartment buildings and other
facilities have been built. Ninety-two of the 156 large
multinational companies such as Motorola and Samsung, have already
set up their representative offices in the planned CBD area.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the CBD Project has been included into the city's
next five-year plan. He is confident about CBD's future, saying
its ideal location, facilities and spacious area will help Beijing
play a more important role in global economic development.
</P>
<P>
CBDs first appeared in the United States in the 1920s, serving
as the hub for commerce, trade, finance and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The CBD will take about 20 to 30 years to build.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Qingdao are also planning to
set up their own CBDs.

<P>
XI'AN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A new railway linking Xi'an, the
provincial capital of Shaanxi, and Ankang, a city in the southern
part of the province, was completed today, half a year ahead of
the timetable.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji and Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo have given
separate instructions and congratulated the railway workers.
</P>
<P>
The railway line ensures a new access to the southwestern part

<P>
One of the key projects for China's Ninth Five-Year Plan for
1996-2000, the electrified railway costs 10.25 billion yuan and
has an annual capacity of 15 million tons in the first few years
and 20 million tons in the future.

<P>
The project includes a 18.64 kilometer-long tunnel, the longest
and hardest one to build so far in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a local gathering to mark the event, Fu Zhihuan, minister of
railways, urged the builders to work even harder in a bid to

<HEADLINE> Legislator Advocates Lower Age for Criminal Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A legislator of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said at a seminar here Friday that the
age for criminal responsibility should be lowered from the present
16 years in an effort to deter youngsters from being involved in
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
The current Criminal Law of Macao stipulates that people under
the age of 16 can be exempted from criminal penalty and those
between 16 and 18 can have their criminal punishment mitigated by
the court. Only those over the age of 18 should take full
responsibility of their conduct.
</P>
<P>
"I think the age limit is inconsistent with the present
conditions of maturity of youngsters in Macao," lawyer and
legislator Vong Hin Fai said at the seminar marking the Judicial
Police Day of Macao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the past several years, increasing number of
crimes involving youngsters has drawn public concern.
</P>
<P>
In order to check juvenile delinquency and the misuse of age
protection for youngsters, the minimum age for criminal
responsibility should be lowered, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the fact that youngsters commit crimes at the instigation
of adults in many cases, Macao should in the meantime enact legal
statements demanding that adult people who entice youngsters to
commit crimes must shoulder heavier penalty," the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the rights of minors should be protected.
Appropriate punishment is aimed at assisting them to stay away
from misconduct. "They should not be ruined by a criminal tag in
the rest of their life," Vong Hin Fai said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Cooperate With U.S. for Locating Deserting Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government will do all
it can to help the United States to locate a deserting spy, senior
official in Jerusalem said Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. army intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jeremiah
Metissia, went on vacation in Israel and was supposed to return
on August 7.
</P>
<P>
However, he failed to report for duty and phoned his boss from
Israel that he wants to desert the service and intends to stay in
Israel, according to the official, who spoke to Israel's Ha'aretz
daily website.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the spy's desertion, according to the report,
was probably for "personal reasons."
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear why the spy chose Israel, a traditional ally
with the U.S., as his sanctuary. One speculation is that he also
worked for Israel as a double spy.
</P>
<P>
If Israel did not surrender the intelligence officer, some
analysts said, the matter would surely harm the relations between
Israel and the U.S., who provided 3 billion U.S. dollars economic
and defense aid to the Jewish state each year.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew working as an U.S.
naval intelligence analyst, was arrested and later convicted of
spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The issue over his release had been put on the negotiation table
between Israel and the U.S. for several times. It was even close to
ravaging the Wye peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians,
which
was under the guidance of U.S. President Bill Clinton, at the last
moment in 1998.

<HEADLINE> India Assures Help For Restoration of Democracy in Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emerging from a 40-minute meeting with Chaudhry, who is here on
a 10-day visit, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said: "
India stands for a multi-racial, constitutional and democratic
order in Fiji. We will continue our efforts and intensify
international action in this direction."
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Vajpayee said he
had held detailed discussions with "Prime Minister Chaudhry" and
the two "covered a lot of ground regarding the recent events in
Fiji."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told the local press that "the first and foremost
thing is that there should be international pressure" for
restoration of democracy in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
He said that India would raise the issue at the United Nations
and the Commonwealth. Vajpayee is heading the Indian delegation to

and the Indian government for unstinted support for swift return
of democracy and constitutional role in Fiji.

<HEADLINE> No Immediate Hike in Interest Rates: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha on Friday ruled out any immediate hike in interest
rates in the face of sharp depreciation of the Indian currency
rupee, which he said was "temporary and manageable" and was no
cause for panic.
</P>
<P>
"It is a temporary phenomenon...though the situation is
difficult, there is no cause for worry as our economic
fundamentals are strong and the country has enough foreign
exchange reserves to meet seven-month imports," Sinha was quoted
as saying in Lok Sabha, or the Indian parliament, here on Friday
by the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
However, Sinha said there was no room for complacency and the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was handling the situation extremely
well by curbing excessive speculation to check volatility.
</P>
<P>
Despite a series of measures taken by the RBI in recent weeks,
the value of rupee fell to 45.89/90 rupees against one U.S. dollar
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the legislators if the rupee might touch 50 rupees to
a dollar, Sinha replied: "Let us not give in to soothsayers. There
is no reason to panic."
</P>
<P>
The current situation had risen as a result of an extraneous
factor which was expected to stabilize in the course of time,
Sinha told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Because of a fear of a crisis situation, authorities in the
United States increased interest rates due to which dollars had
flown into that country from all over the world, including India,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
This had led to downslide of not only the rupee but also
several other currencies as compared to the dollar, he said,
adding that the rate of depreciation of rupee to dollar was much
less than that of other currencies like Euro and Pound Sterling.
</P>
<P>
While the rupee had depreciated by 5.13 percent, the Euro by 9.
16 percent and Pound Sterling 10.17 percent, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that India's interest rates were reduced by 200
basis points since March this year to boost industrial recovery
and "we have now increased it by 100 basis points in the face of
rupee depreciation".
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the situation does not warrant any further
increase in interest rates," he added.

<HEADLINE> Three Malaysians' Release Remains Unconfirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A confirmation has yet to be
issued as of 7 p.m. Friday by chief Philippine government
negotiator on the reported release of three Malaysians hostages
held by the Abu Sayyaf group in Jolo, a TV report said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, the country's leading TV news channel ABS-
CBN quoted Lee Peng Wee, a government negotiator, as saying that
he was told by his special emissary that the reels have freed
three Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
But Robert Aventajado, the chief government negotiator who is
said to have flown to Zamboanga city, which is 150 kilometers
northeast of Sulu provincial capital of Jolo, has not extended any
further confirmation on the said development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aventajado denied a newspaper report that releases
had been delayed because two leaders of the Abu Sayyaf rebels
clamor for political asylum in Libya, which is taking the lead in
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier said that Galib Andang and Mujib Susukan, two
Abu Sayyaf chieftains, had demanded that they and their families
be given asylum in Libya as part of the deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Olympic and
Paralympic swimmers have chosen conservative blue over green and
gold for the full-length bodysuits they will wear at the September
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Speedo Friday in Sydney unveiled the colour schemes for the
traditional and new-age costumes and there was surprisingly little
green and gold to be seen.
</P>
<P>
The full-length suits are predominantly navy blue.
</P>
<P>
Australia's aquatic athletes, led by swimmers and water polo
players, were consulted in the design process and they all
supported the final version.
</P>
<P>
Freestyle sprinter Brett Hawke said green and gold in neck-to-
ankle outfits would have looked too arrogant as Australia tried to
topple the United States as the No.1 swimming nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be good for us to go out there with a
really obnoxious green and gold," Hawke said.
</P>
<P>
Four suits will be given to each member of the Australian
Olympic swimming squad while the 51 members of the Paralympic team
will be provided with more than 300 suits for training and
competition.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua)-- The live coverage of a 2000 year
old tomb being excavated at Laoshan in the western part of Beijing
will be shown on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some experts suspect that the occupant of the tomb was the
offspring of famous Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Hanwu (156 BCE.- 87 BCE) was the fifth emperor of the
Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE-24 A.D.).The emperor was a strong
advocate of Confucianism and unified the Han and other ethnic
groups. He reigned for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dan, the third son of the Emperor, was buried in the
Liangshan Mountains which some experts consider to be located
around present-day Laoshan.
</P>
<P>
If the tomb proves to be Liu Dan's, archeologists might find
lots of ancient books there, for according to historical records,
Liu Dan Loved to read.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Wooden Structures of 2,000-Year-Old Imperial Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- People who turn on the TV Sunday
morning will be able to watch live archaeologists opening a 2,000-
year-old tomb in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located 10 kilometers west from downtown Beijing, is
well preserved by a wooden structure, known as "ticou" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ticou was a wooden tomb structure used during the Han dynasties
(206 B.C. to 220 A.D.) The wooden structure encased the tomb and
prevented outside moisture and earth from entering the tomb.
</P>
<P>
This structure was reserved only for the tombs of emperors,
empresses and princes.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists today can figure out the identity of the buried
according to the amount of timber used and height of the piled
timber.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have unearthed these wooden structures in seven
tombs dating back to Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C. to 24 A.D.),
including the one being excavated in Beijing.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people will watch

</P>
<P>
The tomb is believed to be the third important archeological
discovery in Beijing, after the Ming Tombs and the Dabaotai Tomb.
</P>
<P>
The Laoshan tomb, which was found in a hill in western Beijing
earlier this year, is 12 meters high, 60 meters long and 55 meters
wide.
</P>
<P>
Some of the excavated relics reveal that the tomb may belong to
a king in the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.).

<P>
According to historic records, there used to be 12 kings in the
ancient state of Yan, which is in present-day Beijing and the

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The annual session of Indonesia'
s highest law making body of the People's Consultative Assembly (
MPR) ended here Friday with some achievements.
</P>
<P>
The session, initially suspected to be used by President
Abdurrahman Wahid's political rivals to unseat the incumbent,
concluded successfully without any significant troubles. And for
the time being, it seems that Wahid leadership could run till 2004.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the 12-day session has been seen as an important
event during which the assembly and the president could criticize
each other and practice the real democratic political life which
is also then expected to be followed by the people at large. While,
legislators could also argue on several topics democratically
without fear that such a thing would endanger their position.
</P>
<P>
The session which cost billions of rupiah has also produced
some important decisions, which directly, or indirectly will
influence the country's political constellation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some decrees have been resulted by the Assembly during the
session, while new hopes also had been outpoured for the
Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's speaker Amien Rais even said: "the session was
successful to present a modern constitution to the nation."
</P>
<P>
But, perhaps the most important point which has to be recorded
from the session was the issue on the delegation of the day-to-day
technical government's affairs from the president to Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputeri, which was conveyed by incumbent
president Wahid before the session on August 9, observers said.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Wahid said that he would assign Megawati to
handle the daily technical government's affairs such as arranging
agenda for the cabinet working and presiding over the cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The decision also means that the vice president will bear a
greater responsibility in handling the technical affairs of
statehood and administration. The position of vice president will
not just become a symbol any longer, but a strategic one.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up, President Wahid has planned to restructure and
reshuffle his cabinet in a bid to slenderize the country's
bureaucracy and to increase the efficiency of the government.
Wahid has indicated that he will announce his new cabinet lineup
on August 24 or 25.
</P>
<P>
Many parties believed that with the "power sharing" between the
president and vice president, and the formation of the new cabinet,
the performance of Wahid's administration will be better from now
on and the economic recovery process could be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Economically, the success of the assembly's annual session also
has boosted the positive market sentiment, and strengthened the
country's currency of rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, slow but sure, continued to regain strength as it
now traded at around 8,275 level per U.S. dollar against the
previous level of 8,550/8,775 per U.S. dollar when the assembly's
annual session started on August 7.
</P>
<P>
The positive market sentiment was also reflected in the
composite index on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) as it seems to
keep edging up gradually to touch the higher point.
</P>
<P>
These signs, however, have born new hopes that investors will
come back real soon to invest their capital again in the country,
while the economic recovery is just a matter of time, economists
here said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Leading Mobile Operator to Expand Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's leading mobile telephone
operator Safaricom Limited is to invest 3.7 billion shillings (
around 50 million U.S. dollars) in expanding its network in a bid
to deliver better service for customers, major Kenyan newspapers
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measure has become necessary due to imminent fierce
competition from the upcoming rival KenCell Communications, the
company's sales and marketing director Hugh Herschell said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
KenCell, which is to start operation next week, has been waging
an intensive publicity campaign for its launch, including the
promise of a cut in phone tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Safaricom has inherited a network with 12,000 subscribers from
former state monopoly Kenya Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation, which was disintegrated in July 1999 following the
government's move to introduce a market system in the
communications sector.
</P>
<P>
"We have received and started installing the necessary
equipment from Siemens, which will enhance the quality of our
service greatly," said Herschell.
</P>
<P>
Safaricom currently charges 28 shillings (about 0.38 U.S.
dollar) per minute but KenCell has pledged to cut the price by
half.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that phone tariffs in Kenya are expected to
drop after the introduction of competition in the sector. So far
the charges on phone service in Kenya are much higher than those
in neighboring Tanzania and Uganda.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- On Friday, China's securities
investment fund market gradually revived in consolidation as
investors were attracted by the discounted price levels.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Market Fund Index rose 4.28 points or 0.4 percent
to 1081.44 points, while the Shenzhen Market Fund Index climbed 6.
28 points or 0.58 percent to finish at 1097.47 points.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 30 funds, 16 advanced, 13 remained unchanged with
only Fund Yuyang declining, according to Homeway, China's leading
on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Fund Handing, listed on Thursday, was still stuck at its price
ceiling of 1.47 yuan, with 205,000 fund units traded. Fund holders
were reluctant to take profits, while outside money was hesitant
with follow-up buying at such high levels, indicating the fund may
soon break its current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Over the week, the Shanghai Market Fund Index dipped 1.04

Shenzhen Market Fund Index slipped 0.95 percent from last week's

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- If the Palestinians want to establish a state, they must
first declare that the century-old Jewish-Arab conflict has come to
an end, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday night, in
his clearest reference as yet to the possibility of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The alternative, he added, is a bloody confrontation that would
bring no gain.
</P>
<P>
Barak's comments came amid reports that one way of getting
beyond the impasse that led to the failure of last month's Camp
David summit is to put off both a decision on Jerusalem and a
declaration by the Palestinians that the conflict has ended.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Most of the budget set aside for the development of
infrastructure in East Jerusalem have been frozen since Barak came
into power some 13 months ago. When former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was in power, on the other hand, there was a regular flow
of funds directed toward this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Planned operations - including the construction of sewage and
water systems, roads, sidewalks and lighting various neighborhood
and villages in East Jerusalem - have not been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources in the Jerusalem Municipality say that in
light of Barak's willingness, as demonstrated at Camp David, to
transfer numerous East Jerusalem neighborhoods to Palestinian
sovereignty, his actions, or the lack thereof, may have been
premeditated.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Jerusalem police increased its presence and patrols
throughout the city recently in anticipation of possible terror
attacks, and Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said
on Thursday that Islamic terrorist organizations are planning
attacks "and we must show vigilance."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Wednesday issued a warning to its
citizens traveling in Israel. Israeli officials are concerned that
such a warning could adversely affect tourism to Israel, especially
at the height of the summer season.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A mother and her baby son were killed after being hit by a
train, on its way from the north to Tel Aviv, on Thursday
afternoon. Police believe the deaths were the result of a suicide.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the train said he saw the crouched figure of a
woman alongside the tracks from a distance of some 200 meters. He
braked and blew the train whistler in an attempt to warn her, but
to no avail, adding that the woman jumped onto the tracks a few
meters in front of the train and he had no chance of stopping.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Alexandria Port has taken emergency precautions to
secure entry of giant ship Aaron Bank carrying 684 tons of uranium
inside 38 containers on board.
</P>
<P>
The ship is coming from Australia and heading for Belgium.
</P>
<P>
An official said Egyptian Atomic Energy Agency experts allowed
the vessel to cross the Suez Canal after verifying the safety of
uranium storage procedures.
</P>
<P>
Another atomic energy experts committee will inspect the cargo
again prior to its entry and will accompany the ship till it leaves
the port.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's second satellite, NileSat 102, has been launched
successfully on Thursday from French Guayana in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Nilesat 102 is planned to enhance Egypt's capabilities in
keeping pace with the era of information technology and Internet
provision.
</P>
<P>
The blastoff came two years after Egypt launched its maiden
satellite Nilesat 101.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian pound weakened against the dollar, hitting 3.60
in some exchanges Thursday amid a seasonal dollar shortage
possibly, aggravated by rising imports, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayan Thursday denied sharp
differences with the U.S. investigators over unlocking causes
behind the crash of an Egyptian plane last October.
</P>
<P>
He cited only "differences in views on some points."
</P>
<P>
The craft that crashed off a U.S. coast killed 217 people on
board and the U.S. has blamed the co-pilot of the plane for the
downfall.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mori's Visit to Dhaka Seen as Most Vital for Bangladesh by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori will come to Bangladesh on Saturday for an official visit
which is seen as most vital for Bangladesh from the economic point
of view.
</P>
<P>
Mori will be here for a two-day visit from August 19, on the
first leg of his South Asian trip. The eight-day tour to the
region will be the first time in ten years for a Japanese prime
minister to visit Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, and the first
ever to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of the most important development partners of
Bangladesh as the largest bilateral donor. The assistance Japan
has extended to this country up to 1999 amounts to approximately 8.
94 billion U.S. dollars. Of the amount, 3.78 billion dollars was
in grants and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami, during Mori's visit
to the country, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Mori would hold
official talks covering bilateral political and economic relations.
The two leaders will also discuss regional and global issues,
including nuclear disarmament and security of South Asia and
reforms of the U.N. Security Council in which Japan aspires to be
a permanent member.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between the two countries, however, will
top Mori's agenda. As many as four MOUs (Memorandum Of
Understanding) will be signed for four new projects, including the
much-awaited Rupsha Bridge, with a total loan of 147 million
dollars. More than 73 million dollars will be given for the Rupsha
Bridge project in Khulna, 335 kilometers southeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the business community does not have any formal
involvement with the Mori's itinerary during his two-day stay in
Dhaka, it wants the government to negotiate to reap maximum
economic benefit out of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders here hoped that apart from continued official
development assistance, Bangladesh needs more investment from
Japan, specially in the manufacturing sector where Japanese
presence is still quite insignificant. They suggested that the
government should also negotiate for facilitated market access of
Bangladesh's products to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade now heavily tilted towards Japan with
Bangladesh importing more than five times of its exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's imports from Japan totaled 493.98 million dollars
in the fiscal year 1998-99 while its exports were only 92.85
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that the 63-year-old Mori took a personal
initiative to visit the South Asian countries to deepen Japan's
relations with the region.
</P>
<P>
So long, Japan has concentrated its attention on the countries
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but now it wants to
expand ties with the South Asian nations for their economic
potential, natural resources and huge market, the observers noted.

Analysts said investors positioned heavily on blue-chip buying,
owing to the positive developments in Mindanao hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"Today's market is giving us a sign we're headed on the right
direction. Sentiment is really better. This could be attributed to
the expectations of the release of foreign hostages abducted by
Moslem extremists in Mindanao," said Irving Ackerman, a market

<HEADLINE> 2ndlead: Sri Lankan Parliament to Be Dissolved Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga on Friday announced that the current 10th parliament
will be dissolved with effect from midnight of the same day, six
days ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said the next general
elections will be held on October 10. Nominations for the
elections will be received from August 28 up to noon on September
4.
</P>
<P>
The six-year term of the current 225-member parliament ends on
August 24. But President Kumaratunga has the power to dissolve the
parliament ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here expect the upcoming elections to be
keenly and fiercely contested.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of President Kumaratunga's People's Alliance (PA)
, which took office in August 1994, has been severely dented by a
series of hikes in fuel, power and telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
Serious government reversals in the battle against Tamil Tiger
rebels in recent months have added to the ruling coalition's woes.
The abrupt suspension of a debate on a new constitution bill,
which aims to resolve the 17-year-old ethnic civil war, is also
said to have eroded the PA government's credibility.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has said the new parliament
could be turned into a constituent assembly to pass the draft
constitution by a simple majority, if it cannot get the necessary
two-thirds support in the parliament after elections.
</P>
<P>
The campaign for the ruling coalition will be led by new Prime
Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, who was appointed premier
earlier this month after Sirimavo Bandaranaike stepped down due to
poor health.
</P>
<P>
Sports and Youth Affairs Minister S.B. Dissanayake, a confidant
of Kumaratunga, was elected on Thursday new general secretary of
the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the flagship party in the ruling
coalition. Dissanayake was also expected to play an important role
during the campaigning.
</P>
<P>
For the main opposition United National Party, its leader
former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the key
campaigner.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches Asia's 1st Logistics Certification Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Certified Professional Logistician (CTL) program is part of
the overall plan to develop a critical mass of logistics
professionals to propel the industry towards the e-logistics
frontier, said TDB official David Chin at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The program is also a joint effort in collaboration with the
Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) and the
Chartered Institute of Transport (CIT), he said.
</P>
<P>
A benchmark of excellence for measuring competency and
proficiency within the profession of logistics and supply-chain
management, the program represents the hallmark of logistics
professionalism, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that successful candidates will achieve international
recognition from CIT's 28 international affiliates under the
global CIT network, and reputable universities.
</P>
<P>
The program is a key initiative under the IT Action Plan for
the logistics industry announced in March this year by Lim Swee
Say, minister of state for Communications and Information
Technology.

<HEADLINE> 50 Percent of Petrol Sold in Zambia Contaminated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted ERB petroleum manager Kenneth
Kangende as saying here Thursday that many fuel importers have not
been sending quality certificates to the ERB, thereby offloading
sub-standard petrol on the market.
</P>
<P>
He told a workshop held here that the problem has been
compounded by lack of testing equipment in the country as cities
like Lusaka does not have ideal laboratory facilities to conduct
thorough investigations.
</P>
<P>
Kangende said many fuel importers and distributors have not
been reporting accidents to the ERB, while the license conditions
stipulate that they do so within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The ERB is also investigating reports of fuel smugglers who are
selling the products to unauthorized dealers, Kangende said.
</P>
<P>
ERB petroleum inspector Lukonde Mfula told the workshop that
penalties and fines will be slapped on the those who do not stick
to the standards.
</P>
<P>
Executive secretary of the Zambia Bureau of Standards, Muyunda
Illilonga, said it appears the standards only exist on paper as
the ERB survey results have plainly shown that they are not
followed.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the contaminated petrol has raised fears of engine
damage to vehicles and Zambia Consumer Association has urged the
government to immediately address the issue.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Proposes Burundian House Speaker Transitional Government Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It quoted"reliable sources" as saying that Mandela is of the
opinion that Ngendakumana, not any other person, should lead a
proposed transitional government in that country.
</P>
<P>
However, the pro-Tutsi G12, a group comprising of 11 parties
and the Burundi government, insist that the current President,
Major Pierre Buyoya, should be the one to lead during the proposed
transition, because he is the only man who has managed at least to
restore order and security in the tiny central African country,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said another group of pro-Hutu parties involved in the peace
process, identifying themselves as G7, was suggesting Dominic
Ndayizeye, a man from Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), as
their choice for the post.
</P>
<P>
The sources, however, said there has been disagreement among
the G7 themselves on possibility of allowing Ndayizeye to lead
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Heads of 19 delegations negotiating peace in Burundi are
meeting in Arusha on outstanding issues blocking the signing of a
power-sharing peace agreement, which has been set by Mandela on
August 28.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, informal meetings involving President Buyoya,
several rebel leaders and other prominent politicians have been
taking place in South Africa this week to try to break a deadlock
in peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed accord, the Tutsis, who have dominated the
political and economic life in Burundi since independence, would
have to hand over power to an elected government in three years'
time.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has said the remaining sticking points are arrangements
for a cease-fire and who will lead Burundi's transitional
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the pro-Tutsi parties said last week there are other
crucial issues that still need a consensus, notably the question
of genocide, recognition of a 1996 international inquiry
commissioned by the U.N., the electoral system, composition of the
security forces, and guarantees that will not put Burundi "under
foreign supervision."
</P>
<P>
The ethnic war between the Tutsi army and Hutu rebels in the
central African state has killed more than 200,000 people, mainly
civilians, uprooted many more from their homes and driven others
into exile.

MOSCOW -- Intensive efforts continued Friday in the Barents Sea
to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine that went

</P>
<P>
All previous attempts to dock a rescue capsule to the sub have
failed and a seventh attempt was under way early Friday, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting Russian Northern Fleet
spokesman Igor Babenko. The failures were blamed on a strong
undercurrent and poor visibility. Babenko said four docking
attempts were made on Thursday but none of succeeded. (Russia-

Rodrigues, also Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister, said the
cartel's central point in this question is to keep market stabile

international market hasn't been affected immediately. He said

stable". If there is a price increase, OPEC has had "corrective

<HEADLINE> Rare Animals Reproduce in Shanghai Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Several rare animals in the
Shanghai Zoo have become parents this summer.
</P>
<P>
A monkey, from a virgin forest in the southeastern part of
Brazil, has given birth to a healthy baby after five years at the
zoo.
</P>
<P>
In total, the zoo has 12 such monkeys which have thin, long and
sleek hair. The monkey's head looks like a lion's and the animal
is an endagered species.
</P>
<P>
A South America tapir has become the mother of a seven-kilogram
male cub.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the tapir gave birth to a cub which unfortunately
died. Zoo keepers said the tapir at that time appeared to lack
experience on how to care for her baby.
</P>
<P>
This time, she seems to be much more experienced and takes care
of the newly-born meticulously in hot weather, a climate she likes.
</P>
<P>
The young tapir looks healthy, and its brown skin has white
spots and stripes as if wearing a colorful shirt. The cub is
attached to his mother, following her closely.
</P>
<P>
Not all animals are as responsible. A white-head monkey
recently reproduced a male baby but abandoned it and played by
herself.
</P>
<P>
Although the little monkey did not get a mother's love, it has
received care from zoo keepers.
</P>
<P>
This kind of monkey, one of the animals under state protection,
is mainly found in forests and hills in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The young monkey is now able to jump briskly here and there in
its the cage and likes to stay with human beings.

GUANGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou City, the main
Chinese southern gate to the outside world, will host a flower
festival on December 20-25.
</P>
<P>
The fair will have an exhibition area of 34,000 square meters
where activities such as trade talks, floral displays, marketing
of fresh flowers and potted plants will be conducted, according to
information from the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, also capital of Guangdong Province, has become a
center for the production and supply of potted plants and is also
a distribution center for imported flowers.
</P>
<P>
Every year, 130 million to 150 million stems of fresh flowers
are shipped to other cities throughout China from Guangzhou.
Sixty percent of potted plants in the country are produced in
Guangdong. Flower prices in Guangzhou usually affect the flower
prices in other Chinese cities.

funds to protect, maintain and restore the mausoleums. So far, a
total of 960,000 yuan has been spent on the tombs.
</P>
<P>
"We will draw more funds through various channels to protect
the cultural relics," Zheng Xinmiao, deputy director of the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage, said at the opening ceremony
for the mausoleums.

Tibetan Buddhism has spread in the regions of China inhabited
by the Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Yugur, Naxi, Pumi and Moinba ethnic
groups. It is widely practiced in the regions of the Tibetan
ethnic group in Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces, the
Tibet Autonomous Region, and the regions of the Mongolian ethnic
group in Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and the
Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions. Today
Tibetan Buddhism has 140,000 nuns and lamas, including 2,000
incarnated Living Buddhas, and over 3,300 temples and monasteries
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism has many famous temples and monasteries such
as well-known six Principal Monasteries: the Gandain, Sera and
Drepung monasteries in Lhasa, the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Xigaze,
the Taer Monastery in Qinghai, and the Labrang Monastery in Gansu.
In addition, there are important monasteries in the interior of
China, such as the Yonghe Lamasery in Beijing, the Puning
Monastery in Chengde, and the Luohou temple on Wutai Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism is characterized by its succession f Living
Buddha incarnations, observed in varying ways by the different
sects. The Dalai and Panchen Lama successions of the Gelug Sect
are the most influential, and the most famous Living Buddhas today
include Goigyi Gyaibo, the 11th Panchen Erdeni.
</P>
<P>
There are many ancient books on Tibetan Buddhism, the most
widely read being The Tripitaka Sutra. The work consists of two
parts, the Gangyur and Dangyur. This sutra offers philosophy,
linguistics, medicine, astronomy, and music, as well as the
Buddhist classics, laws and doctrines.
</P>
<P>
Almost all Buddhist sects in Tibet have their own rituals and
methods of cultivation. The Esoteric Sect of Tibetan Buddhism
practices such distinctive methods of cultivation as the
sprinkling of holy water on the head and twin body cultivation, or
cultivation in partnership with opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism has colorful festivals and celebrations, and
the buildings, sculptures, and paintings of Tibetan Buddhism are
of significance in the religious culture and art of the world.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism is an important concern of the Buddhist
Association of China, and the Chinese Institute of Buddhist
Studies in Beijing has become a center for Tibetan Buddhist
talents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars and Dunhuang Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- If Chinese scholars can make
best use of Dunhuang sutras and documents preserved in the country,
they should no longer feel sad about the priceless treasures
contained in the Mogao Grottoes.
</P>
<P>
According to Chai Jianhong, secretary general of the China
Dunhuang-Turfan Society, many of its treasures were either
destroyed or taken abroad by foreigners at the turn of twentieth
century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars are among the best Dunhuang scholars in the
world and more and more Chinese scholars are doing research on
Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
"The Society alone has about 400 members across the country,"
Chai said, adding that over 200 books and 2,000 theses on Dunhuang
are published every year which was "unimaginable" in the past.
</P>
<P>
Chai is also proud of the fact that China is widely recognized
as the world's center for Dunhuang researches, as was made clear
recently at an international meeting on Dunhuang studies held last
month in Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
China's studies on Dunhuang treasures started in 1910, but was
interrupted for almost half a century until the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1950s, the government has spent much effort in
promoting Dunhuang studies. In 1983, the China Dunhuang-Turfan
Society was founded and is now at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the National Library, China will
apply modern digital technologies to preserve its ancient arts in
the Dunhuang Grottoes to facilitate the Dunhuang studies at home
and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Buddhism can be divided
into three forms according to language: Chinese-language, Pali-
language, and Tibetan-language Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism is also
called lamaism because the learned monks are called Lama, or "
master".
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism adopted the rituals of Tibet's indigenous pro-
Buddhist religion, known as Bon, and the doctrines are based
mainly on Mahayana Buddhism with Esoteric Buddhism being the most
popular sect and yoga being the highest method of self-cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The years from 640 through 841 marked the beginning stage of
Tibetan Buddhism. During this period, Buddhist statues and
scriptures were introduced into Tibet through Nepal and the
regions inhabited by the Han Chinese. Translation of Buddhist
scriptures into Tibetan and construction of monasteries in Tibet
also began at this time.
</P>
<P>
Later, the development of Tibetan Buddhism was stifled for 100
years because of the persecution by Lang Darma, the new zanpo (
leader of the local religion). The year 978 marked the formal
establishment of Tibetan Buddhism, when Buddhist rejuvenation
forces from Qinghai and Sichuan provinces and the Ngari Prefecture
of Tibet influenced the interior of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tibet Buddhism gave rise to many different sects, owing to
differing succession of masters and differing interpretations of
the doctrines and methods of cultivation. The major sects included
Nyingma, Kagdems, Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug, and the minor sects
included Jonang, Zhibyed, and Shalu. The Gelug Sect, also known as
the Yellow Sect because its monks wear yellow hats, has become the
largest.

<HEADLINE> Four Factors Key to Hi-tech Industry: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China must properly deal with
four key areas in its efforts to develop its hi-tech industry,
according to a senior official in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
These areas include structural reforms of scientific
institutions, government guidance, technological invention and the
upgrading of traditional industries with high-tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
With China's imminent entry into the WTO, "it becomes all the
more urgent and necessary to find a way of speeding up the
development of our hi-tech industry," Ma Songde, vice-minister of
science and technology, said in an article in the latest issue of
the "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
Despite of the rapid growth of China's hi-tech industry in
recent years, a number of problems still hinder the development of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Ma cited several of the problems such as low efficiency of hi-
tech enterprises and high dependence on foreign technologies.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the government to work out measures that
will speed up institutional reforms, said Ma.

Buddhism in China also became separated into various schools
and sects. During the Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties,
the monasterial economy was well developed, and many rituals were
systematized. Among the flourishing schools and sects of Buddhism
at the time, there were the San-lun (Three-Treatise), Tien-tai,
Hua-yen (Avatamsaka), Zen, Fa-hsiang (Dharmalaksana), Lu (Vinaya),
Ching-tu (Pure Land), and Tantrism.
</P>
<P>
In the years between the eastern Han and Song dynasties, 130
famous Chinese and foreign scholars translated Buddhist scriptures
into Chinese. Some 5,620 tests in 1,520 fascicles of the Tripitaka
in the Chinese language still exist today. These translations can
match any other known translations in the world. Of all the
translators in the history of Chinese Buddhism, the monk Xuan Zang
of the Tang Dynasty is considered the greatest. Traveling 25,000
kilometers in 17 years, he brought back 520 Sanskrit-edition
Buddhist scriptures from India, and spent more than 20 years
translating 1,335 texts in 75 fascicles from the scriptures of
Mahayana Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Buddhist monasteries and pagodas are found all over China.
Wutai Mountain in Shanxi, Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang, Emei
Mountain in Sichuan, and Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui are four famous
Buddhist shrines highly regarded by practitioners. Among the
famous monasteries are Baima Monastery in Luoyang, Nanchan and
Foguang monasteries on Wutai Mountain, Biyun (Azure Clouds) Temple
and Yonghe Monastery in Lhasa, and eight temples in Chengde. The
famous pagodas include Zhuanta (Brick pagoda) on Mount Songshan,
Muta (Wood Pagoda) in Yingxian County of Shanxi, Shita (Stone
Pagoda) in Quanzhou, and Dayan (Greater Wild Goose) Pagoda in Xi'
an. The Dunhuang Grottoes in Gansu, Yungang Grottoes in Datong,
and Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang are world famous for their
Buddhist art. Buddhist buildings are also considered jewels of
ancient Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist Association of China, established in 1953, is a
nationwide organization formerly led by late Zhao Puchu, a famous
Buddhist lay scholar. The association has its own journal, Fayin,
and 14 Buddhist academies.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese religious delegation
will attend the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and
Spiritual Leaders to be held at the United Nations Headquarters in
New York on August 28-31 and visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
As of today, Xinhua News Agency will release a series of
backgrounders about Buddhism, Daoism, Islamism, Protestantism and
Catholicism in China. The Tibetan Buddhism will be specially
introduced for its unique features and extensive influence.
</P>
<P>
The following is a brief introduction of Buddhism in China.
</P>
<P>
China has 56 ethnic groups, each with its own culture and
religion, but among all the religions in China, the largest is
Buddhism. It is difficult to estimate how many people follow
Chinese-language Buddhism, as it is widely distributed and does
not have initiation rituals, but Chinese-language Buddhism has at
least 40,000 monks and nuns and more than 5,000 temples and
monasteries. Tibetan-language Buddhism is found mainly among the 7
million people of the Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Yugur, Naxi, Pumi,
and Moinba ethnic groups, and has 120,000 lamas and nuns and over
3,000 temples and monasteries. Pali-language Buddhism is found
mainly among the 1.5 million people of the Dai, Blang, De'ang, Va,
and Achang ethnic groups, and has more than 8,000 monks an nuns
and over 1.000 temples and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
Tradition has it that Emperor Ming Di of the Eastern Han
Dynasty (25-220 A.D.) dispatched Cai Yin and 17 other officials to
China's western neighbors in a quest for spiritual teachings. They
met kasyapamatanga and Dharmaranya, great Buddhists of India, and
brought them to Luoyang, When the two India Buddhists arrived,
leading a white horse carrying Buddhist images and sutras, Emperor
Ming Di ordered the construction of a residence for them in
Luoyang. Thus the Baima (White Horse) Monastery, the first
Buddhist monastery in China, came into being. The translation of
the Fouty-Two-Chapter Sutra by the two Buddhists is the earliest
translation of a Buddhist text in China. Later, Buddhism was
widely disseminated in China during the reigns of the Eastern Han
emperors Huan Di and Ling Di (both together 147-189 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
When Sakyamuni founded Buddhism in ancient India, different
preaching methods were adopted according to the audience. After
the departure of Sakyamuni from this world, his followers
established several sects according to their own understanding.
Among these sects, Mahayana and Theravada are the two most
important. Theravada Buddhism stresses overcoming illusion and
detachment from death so that one can become an arhat, an
enlightened saint. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes salvation and the
attainment of Buddhahood not only for oneself but also for all
other living creatures. Mahayana has two forms: Tantrism, and the
open school, which is further divided into the Madhyamika and
Yogacara schools.

<HEADLINE> Denktash Urges Clerides to Settle Cyprus Issue Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has urged Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides to join him in
solving the Cyprus issue before the end of their lives, the Cyprus
Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a speech commemorating the 1974 Turkish invasion this
week, 76-year-old Denktash addressed 81-year-old Clerides: "You are
very old and even though I am younger, I am also getting close to
the end of my life. Let us end the Cyprus problem together."
</P>
<P>
Denktash said, however, that a solution would follow Clerides'
acceptance of the Turkish Cypriots equality and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He also said Clerides was mistaken to believe that Cyprus' entry
into the European Union "would deprive the Turkish Cypriots of
their rights."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean island after a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have held three rounds of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks in an effort to solve the Cyprus issue, but no
tangible results have been achieved. A new round is scheduled to
start on September 5 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Denktash does not recognize Clerides as president of the entire
island while only Turkey recognizes the Turkish Cypriot regime in
the northern island established in 1983 with Denktash as its head.
</P>
<P>
Clerides supports establishing a bizonal, bicommunal federation,
a prescription for a solution laid down in numerous Security
Council resolutions. But Denktash insists on a confederation
between two independent states on the island that would mean
recognizing the self-declared "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
One of Denktash's arguments against accession is that the Cyprus
constitution does not allow it to join an international
organization if Greece and Turkey (together with Britain are the
guarantors of Cyprus' independence) are not also members.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A film "Mao Zedong and Edgar
Snow" will compete with 25 domestic and overseas films for the
top prize of the Changchun Film Festival starting from August 23.
</P>
<P>
Song Jiangbo, film director, said, "The film is different from
previous ones in that it focuses more on Mao Zedong as a poet than
as a leader."
</P>
<P>
The film, produced by three film companies including the
Changchun Film Studio, depicts the friendship between Chinese late
Chairman Mao Zedong and US journalist Edgar Snow and the hardships
that the Chinese Communist Party members conquered during the
fight against the Japanese invaders in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The film started shooting in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Snow came to China in the 1930s. He is one of the first
to tell the world about the red army's fight against the Japanese
troops in Yan'an, a revolutionary base in northwestern Shaanxi
Province before the New China was founded. His book "Red Star Over
China" continues to leave an indelible impression for many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The festival will last four days.

WELLINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- After operating for the past

from Carter Holt Harvey, which is the owner of the mill.
</P>
<P>
The local giant of forestry industry said the reasons for the
closure included higher raw material costs, the collapse of world

overseas, especially the development of giant mills in Asia.

<P>
The mill, which has been losing money for the past four years,

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Strengthen Links with Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has set a wide ranging series of initiatives to boost the country'
s relations with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release the government issued here Friday,
Prime Minister Helen Clark launched at a function at Auckland
University a three-year program which aims to broaden and
strengthen New Zealand-Latin American links across political,
economic, cultural and academic areas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, the prime minister announced the
government is to open an embassy in the Brazilian capital Brasilia
next year, adding to those in Santiago, Buenos Aires and Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
Other initiatives include: Tagging 100,000 NZ dollars (45,500 U.
S.dollars) of the Trade Access Support Program to improve access
to Latin American countries; the introduction of a 150,000 NZ
dollars (68,300 U.S. dollars) fund to assist media, cultural,
education, science and sports visits and exchanges; increasing
funding for tertiary scholarships for Latin American students to 1.
3 million NZ dollars (591,500 U.S. dollars) this year and climbing
to 3 million NZ dollars (1.37 million U.S. dollars) in 2002-2003;
and stepping up cooperation on international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
"Our interest in the region is based on the enormous
opportunities that it holds for New Zealanders in many fields and
on the many interests we have in common," Helen Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru and
businessmen of Latin American countries in New Zealand were
present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, trade between New Zealand and Latin America
has risen sharply. New Zealand's exports to the region climbed
from 184 million NZ dollars (84 million U.S dollars) in 1990 to
841 million NZ dollars (383 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, before
falling back due to the region's recent economic slump. The New
Zealand side is of the view that there is considerable scope for
its exports to rise and diversify.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Efforts Continue for Russian Sub Despite Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Intensive efforts continued
Friday in the Barents Sea to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk
nuclear submarine that went down to the seabed last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All previous attempts to dock a rescue capsule to the sub have
failed and a seventh attempt was under way early Friday, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting Russian Northern Fleet
spokesman Igor Babenko.
</P>
<P>
The failures were blamed on a strong undercurrent and poor
visibility.
</P>
<P>
Babenko said four docking attempts were made on Thursday but
none of succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Docking attempts will continue until the arrival of foreign
rescuers expected Saturday evening and Sunday. Two Norwegian ships
are heading for the disaster area one the British LR5 submarine
rescue craft and the other a group of Norwegian deep-sea divers.
</P>
<P>
The weather forecasting service says the weather is relatively
good on the coast with gushes of wind not exceeding 36 km/h and
visibility of 1-2 kilometers in some places marred by fog. The air
temperature is 6-11 degrees Centigrade, and the temperature of
seawater at the depth of 100 meters, where the submarine is lying,
3 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who leads a
government commission probing the incident, said Thursday night
that collision with a heavy object caused the Kursk nuclear
submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said the collision resulted in "a dreadful hole" in the sub
and that the disaster "was developing within two minutes," the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The sub fell to the seabed from a depth of 20 meters. When it
struck the sea floor, the submarine received a second blow,
Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It has
a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up
to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite"
cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for up to 120
days, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 ships and other vessels are participating in the
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
There have had no banging signals from inside the submarine
from Wednesday, but officials said the crew might be lying low to
conserve oxygen and strength.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said earlier that the oxygen availability aboard
the Kursk could last until Friday, but they later revised that
prediction, saying if the crewmembers minimize their activities
oxygen could last until next week.
</P>
<P>
The military said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and
that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down. Radiation
levels are also normal.

<HEADLINE> Two Federations Yet to Join Random Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Anti-Doping Agency (
WADA) announced on Thursday at Lausanne that only two
international sports federations have yet to join its unannounced
out-of-competition testing program.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came when the International Modern Pentathlon
Union changed its mind, agreeing to take the random drug tests.
</P>
<P>
The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) and the
International Gymnastics Federation are yet to join the scheme but
the FIVB "has informed WADA that it will join the program very
shortly," the WADA statement added.
</P>
<P>
Among 28 international federations, gymnastics could become the
sole Olympic sport to refuse random drugs tests in the run-up to
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week WADA chairman Richard Pound said that
athletes in sports which had not accepted random testing could be
saddled with an "unnecessary stigma of suspicion...this is an
unfair burden for them to carry."
</P>
<P>
The agency hopes to conduct 2,150 drug tests before the Sydney
Games.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Hopes to Win First Olympic Medal at Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has pinned its hope of
winning the country's first medal at the Sydney Games to two top
female taekwondo athletes.
</P>
<P>
The two athletes represent the country's best hope of winning
its first-ever Olympic medal at the Sydney Games next month, local
English newspaper Vietnam News (VNS) quoted Truong Ngoc De, vice
president of Vietnam's Taekwondo Federation, as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both being already SEA Games gold medalists, Tran Hieu Ngan and
Nguyen Thi Xuan Mai showed their strength again by sailing through
the Olympic qualifiers in the Philippines last September.
</P>
<P>
Taekwondo, making its debut in Sydney, is one of the most
popular martial arts in Vietnam. VNS claimed that its new status
as an Olympic event could mean a stream of golds, silvers and
bronzes for Vietnamese competitors for years to come.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's four top Taekwondo athletes including Ngan (under 51
kg category), Mai (under 49 kg), Nguyen Duy Khuong (under 54 kg)
and Asiad gold medalist Ho Nhat Thong (under 58 kg) are currently
training in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Along with taekwondo, Vietnamese athletes will compete in four
other disciplines at the Sydney Games. The team includes Nguyen
Ngoc Anh and Nguyen Thi Huong (swimming); Luong Tich Thien and Vu
Bich Huong (athletics); Nguyen Trung Hieu, Nguyen Manh Tuong and
Dang Thi Dong (shooting); and Nguyen Thi Kim Vui (Judo).

<HEADLINE> Hingis Wins Third Round at du Maurier Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Martina Hingis of
Switzerland came closer to her title defence by winning the third
round match Thursday at du Maurier Open women's tennis tournament
being held in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who has held the world number one ranking since May,
dispatched unseeded Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-
4.
</P>
<P>
Chilly wind was bringing temperature down to 15 degrees Celsius
at du Maurier Stadium, where spectators sporting wind-breakers
huddled to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
"It was cold," said Hingis, "My muscles got sore in the second
set, so I thought: 'Just go for it, straight forward, every point'.
"
</P>
<P>
"The quicker I am out there, the better, because I also have to
play doubles," she added.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport retired her
third-round match with a sprained left foot.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 U.S. Open champion trailed qualifier Magdalena Maleeva
of Bulgaria 4-3 in the opening set when she opted to retire from
the 1.08 U.S. million dollars tournament.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Davenport have traded the No.1 ranking six times
since the 24-year-old American first bumped Hingis from that spot
after winning the 1998 U.S. open.
</P>
<P>
The day also saw third-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain reach
the quarter-finals with No. 10 Julie Halard-Decugis of France
forfeiting the match because of lower back pain on her left side.
</P>
<P>
In another third-round match of the day, No. 4 Serena Williams
of the United States ousted Anna Kournikova of Russia 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, who won du Maurier Open
in 1992 and 1994, downed 1991 American winner Jennifer Capriati 6-
4,7-5.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew Malaysia Visit Paves Way for Better Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew wrapped up his four-day informal visit to Malaysia
Thursday which has been hailed by local media as a success in
paving the way for solving the outstanding bilateral issues
between the two countries and opening a new page in their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before leaving Kuala Lumpur, the
senior minister said that "I leave more optimistic than when I
came. I believe that if there is enough give on both sides on the
key points, it is possible within two, three months to tie up the
details."
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia were sour
and strained due to outstanding bilateral issues, including the
long-term supply of water to Singapore, the use of Malaysia air
space by Singapore's air force, the withdrawal of CPF (the central
provident fund) savings by West Malaysians and the location of
Malaysia's customs, immigration and quarantine facility in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Lee's trip to Malaysia came after about one year of suspension
in the negotiations between senior officials from the two
countries on the issues.
</P>
<P>
The visit, his first in 10 years since his last visit in
November 1990, just days before he stepped down as prime minister,
conveyed a clear and strong signal to Malaysian side that
Singapore is eager to patch up relations with its northern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar said
that Lee's visit to Malaysia indicates a willingness by Singapore
to understand its northern neighbor better and a desire to try and
resolve outstanding bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Lee spoke highly of Malaysia's economic
development and its standing in ASEAN, saying both Singapore and
Malaysia had done well "in its own way" to respond to the Asia
financial crisis and are in a position to help restore ASEAN's
standing as an economic partner of the G-7 countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee also reiterated to the Malaysian side principles in solving
the outstanding bilateral issues as he said they had to be worked
out as a package, "which is balanced with both sides getting more
out of it than if we both stood still."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian defense Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said that
principles agreed upon by leaders would pave way for resolution of
bilateral issues and Lee's visit pointed to that direction that
should be taken in managing Malaysia-Singapore relations.
</P>
<P>
As relationship between Singapore and Malaysia is too deep both
in economics and politics and sometimes features difficulties,
hindrance and stumbling blocks, more efforts and involvement from
the senior minister are needed in developing what he called the
easy business-like ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Bangladesh Against AIDS Prevalence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leading experts at a roundtable
urged the Bangladesh authorities to create an "enabling
environment" immediately to fight back AIDS infiltration as the
country is surrounded by high prevalence countries, The Finance
Express reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable hosted Thursday by the South-South Center,
Bangladesh, was informed that Bangladesh is fortunate to have low
prevalence rate amid rising trends of global HIV/AIDS figures.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Health and Family Welfare M. Amanullah said
that according to the Progress of Nation 2000 report conducted by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the prevalence rate
of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh was registered at 0.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh Shahida Azfar
warned that too little was known about HIV/AIDS prevalence in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates on the number of AIDS cases vary between 12
to 105 people, while the World Health Organization estimated that
the number of HIV-infected individuals in Bangladesh is closer to
21,000, 31 percent of which are believed to be between the ages of
16 and 30, she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prevention of the deadly disease, Geeta Sethi,
country program adviser of Joint United Nations Program on HIV/
AIDS(UNAIDS), said early AIDS prevention efforts focused on a
combination of information, treatment of sexually transmitted
diseases and condom promotion.
</P>
<P>
The most important element, however, is creation of an "
enabling environment", she said.
</P>
<P>
"Behavior is not a result of choice, but more an outcome of the
situation and circumstances and the socio-cultural milieu," the
UNAIDS representative said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Accepts Nomination, Promises To Fight For Working Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 17 (Xinhua) -- In a nomination acceptance
speech to close the Democratic National Convention, Vice-President
Al Gore Thursday night vowed to speak and work for "the quiet,
every-day heroism of hard-working Americans," and laid out a
vision long on policy specifics.
</P>
<P>
"I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I
will never let you down," Gore promised the delegates and all the
American people.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth and final night of the convention, Gore, 52,
formally accepted his party's presidential nomination and
delivered a state-of- union-address-like speech that touched on
almost all major issues, from campaign finance reform to education.
</P>
<P>
He outlined his stock proposals to create tax-free savings
accounts for retirement and college tuition; alleviate the estate
tax for people passing on a small business or family farm;
increase the minimum wage; codify employment rights for gays and
lesbians; hire 50,000 new community police; mandate child-safety
trigger locks on handguns; protect abortion rights, and more.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said he wants the nation's wealth to be
shared by all Americans, especially ordinary working people who
had not fully shared in the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
"My focus is on working families -- people trying to make house
payments and car payments, working overtime to save for college
and do right by their kids," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
He said powerful forces and powerful interests often stand
against working families. "I want you to know this: I've taken on
the powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and
I'll stand up for you," Gore added.
</P>
<P>
He drew perhaps his loudest ovation of the night when he
pledged to protect abortion rights and said, "The last thing this
country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns a woman's right to
choose."
</P>
<P>
Just before Gore made his speech, Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush issued a statement saying he was ready to
take part in three presidential debates and also proposed holding
two vice presidential debates. Analysts believe it was a gesture
of confidence from the Texas governor who is considered a less
experienced debater than Gore.
</P>
<P>
Gore has never led Bush, the son of former President George
Bush, in any poll of likely voters, and time is beginning to run
short. History shows that the candidate leading the race in early
September wins in November.
</P>
<P>
A poll by the Voter.com Internet service found Gore has so far
received no bounce from the convention, and has in fact slipped
two points further behind Bush since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Regarded by admirers as a brainy and well-informed politician,
a skilled and aggressive debater, Gore is viewed by others as
overly cautious, wooden, programmed and willing to say just about
anything to win.
</P>
<P>
"I know my own imperfections. I know that sometimes people say
I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe
I've done that tonight. But the presidency is more than a
popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes,
you have to choose to do what's difficult or unpopular," he said.
</P>
<P>
Polls have consistently shown that voters are closer to Gore
than Bush on many main issues, but the Texas governor has a huge
advantage on the question of leadership.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the gap may be due in part to Gore's staunch
support of Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but it is
also due to the nature of the job of vice president.
</P>
<P>
After two terms as vice president, aides said Gore wanted to
introduce himself to the voters anew, and emerge from Clinton's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
"This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not
asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have.
Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer,
more prosperous America we can build together," Gore told the
voters.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who has struggled to outrun President Clinton's shadow
since launching this campaign 14 months ago, told Americans: "
We're entering a new time. We're electing a new president."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the president by name just once, calling him a
partner and giving him credit for moving the country into the
longest period of economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
Before Gore made the speech, testimonials from friends and
family colored in the corners of Gore's self-portrait: young farm
hand, Vietnam vet, mountain-climber, surrogate brother to his
sister's kindly widower. All of them urged the Americans to trust
Gore and vote for him as next president.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Civil Aviation Authority of
Nepal (CAAN) has allowed Singapore Airlines to operate four
scheduled weekly flights to Kathmandu beginning on October 2,
according to CAAN.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines will fly in and out of Kathmandu on Sunday,

</P>
<P>
The international airline presently operates three scheduled

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Chief Plays Down Oil Price Rise Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai central bank governor Chatu
Mongol Sonakul believed that rising global oil prices will have a
limited impact on Thailand's economy as the country's capacity
utilization remains low, The Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's production capacity is still very low, at only 60
percent, so he is not worried about the impact of higher oil price.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that oil prices could rise further in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
Chatu Mongol said that as long as there is no sharp increase in
oil prices he would see it as major threat to the economy.
</P>
<P>
He declined to assess the impact of recent oil price hikes on
inflation, but added that the central bank's monetary policy board
will make an official announcement on inflation targeting on
September 5.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the central bank shifted to inflation
targeting as its main monetary policy goal, setting a target range
for core inflation of between zero to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in Thailand have risen to all-time high and are
expected to rise further, triggering speculation of higher
inflation and slower economic growth.

<P>
YANGON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 322,054 cubic-
meters of teak and 519,871 cubic-meters of hardwood in fiscal year
1999-2000 which ended in March, the highest annual volume in the
last five fiscal years, according to the latest figures released
by the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
During the 1999-2000, export earning from them totaled 218.18
million U.S. dollars, which was also the highest annual foreign
exchange income obtained through export of timber during the five-
fiscal-year period.
</P>
<P>
During the previous four fiscal years, the export volume of
teak and hardwood were annually maintained at 200,293 cubic-meters
and 216,035 cubic-meters respectively with their total annual
earning amounting to 153 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Timber has become Myanmar's second largest export goods after
agricultural products. Foreign exchange gained through export of
timber accounts for about 20 percent of Myanmar's total export
earning.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's forest covers 50 percent of the country's total land
area, a 7-percent reduction compared with 1962. The decline of
forest coverage was attributed mainly to the indiscriminate
felling of trees.
</P>
<P>
To protect environment, Myanmar plans to increase the reserved
and protected public forest areas to 30 percent from 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Myanmar has established 30,375 hectares of forest
plantations annually including 8,100 hectares of teak plantations.

<HEADLINE> Lankan Govt. Decides Paddy Distribution for Welfare Beneficiaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Cabinet of
Ministers has decided to grant 400 rupees (about 5 U.S. dollars)
worth of paddy each to welfare beneficiaries, according to the
Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a cabinet media release on Thursday as saying
that the beneficiaries will be given coupons for a period of three
months and it has also been decided that they can have their paddy
stocks in one instance.
</P>
<P>
The media release adds that the reason for the government's
decision was that the latest paddy harvest had exceeded targets
and there was also a shortage in storage space.
</P>
<P>
The paddy allowance is in addition to the regular 1500 rupees (
around 19 U.S. dollars) dole paid to these beneficiaries each
month.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Cabinet has also decided not to pursue the
Norachcholai coal power plant following opposition to the
establishment of the plant from various organizations.
</P>
<P>
The plant had been decided on due to the acute shortage of
power the country had suffered as a result of its dependence on
hydro power for electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet has appointed a committee to find alternative
sources of power as an acute shortage of power has been predicted
for year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Economic Slowdown in Third Quarter: Thai Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand
said on Friday that a fall in the Leading Economic Index (LEI)
shows that the country's economic growth is likely to slow down in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The LEI, which is a method used by the central bank to forecast
economic growth of the next quarter, fell to 118.2 points in the
second quarter this year from 119.3 in the previous quarter, the
bank said in a report.
</P>
<P>
"The third quarter expansion may slow from previous quarter,"
the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
The expected slowdown would put pressure on the Thai government
's efforts to accelerate the economic growth to 5 percent this
year, up from 4.2 percent last year, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
While the LEI generally gives an accurate indication of future
economic activity, the report added that it is useful only to
gauge economic direction and not the exact growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The LEI began declining in the fourth quarter of 1999, followed
by the slowdown of economic growth to 5.2 percent in the first
quarter in 2000 from 6.5 percent in the previous quarter.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Predicts Higher Inflation for Indonesia in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central bank (
Bank Indonesia) has predicted that the national inflation would
likely be at about 7.67 percent this year, exceeding the
government's target of between 5 percent and 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its latest economic report that prices would
be higher than initially expected due to the weakening of the
rupiah and a planned increase in fuel prices later this year, the
Jakarta Post Daily reported Friday, adding that the weakening of
rupiah has increased the price of imported goods and raw material.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in fuel subsidies is planned for October, which
will cause fuel price to increase.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also predicted that inflation in 2001 would
range between 6 percent and 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank has allowed the benchmark interest rate of
its one month Bank Indonesia promissory notes (SBIs) to increase
for the past several weeks to help the ailing rupiah and curb
inflation pressure," the newspaper said, citing that the benchmark
interest rate moved higher to 13.56 percent at an auction on
Wednesday, compared to 13.52 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank maintained its initial forecast of
3 percent to 4 percent of growth in gross domestic product (GDP)
this year, but it said that the economy would grow higher within
next year at between 4 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Indonesia also said that exports were projected to go
up to 14.13 billion U.S. dollars in the third quarter of this year,
against the second quarter figure when it reached 13.88 billion U.
S. dollars. Imports were also expected to rise to 8.72 billion U.S.
dollars from 8.3 billion U.S. dollars in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The total investment was expected to grow by between 1 and 2
percent this year and jump to between 5.5 and 6.5 percent within
the next year, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Survival-and-Growth of Chinese Shipping Company in Thai Market By Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- By sticking to a customer-
oriented marketing strategy and taking innovative measures, a
Chinese shipping company has managed to gain a strong footing in
the highly competitive local shipping market, a top executive of
the company said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zou Bin, the general manager of the Chinese Ocean Shipping
Company's Thailand branch (COSCO(Thailand)), told Xinhua that the
survival-and-growth story of his company during the past seven
years in Thailand is part of a grand scheme to build a worldwide "
maritime kingdom" of the whole Chinese shipping business.
</P>
<P>
"To set up such a kingdom, COSCO should establish strongholds
in every strategic point of shipping business across the world,
including Thailand," he said.
</P>
<P>
With its concentrated deepwater ports, advanced port facilities
and navigational conditions, Thailand has long been the favorite
of world's leading shipping business, while its export-oriented
economy also creates a sustainable and huge demand for cargo
shipping, he stated.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 50 shipping firms competing in the
Thai market, including shipping giants, namely American President
Lines (APL), Maersk Lines, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Chao Yang Agency
Co. and others.
</P>
<P>
"We can not neglect such a strategically important place, since
we are already one of the first-class shipping firms in the world,
" Zhou Bin said, noting that the fast-expanding COSCO has recently
become the fourth-largest container shipping business.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that since his company established its first
business in Thailand in 1993, it has managed to survive the tough
wars with many rivals and the financial crisis, and kept the
growth momentum continuously.
</P>
<P>
COSCO (Thailand) now is an influential shipping business in the
local market, with four subsidiaries in charge of container
shipping, land transportation, bulk cargo and its own container
port, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Zou said his firm is planning to establish the fifth subsidiary
in the south of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Among the over 50 shipping companies in the local market, the
standing of COSCO (Thailand), in terms of the capacity of
container business, has climbed to the 12th place leaving a number
of big international rivals behind.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the secret of the success of his company, Zou
said as a service business, the shipping company should always put
the customer at the first place, and take relating innovative
moves. "We compete by providing good services, not cutting prices,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the needs of customer, he said, shipping firms
should strengthen their "hardware", in other words, to bring in
new facilities and equipment
</P>
<P>
The company's decision to get a container port of its own in
Bangkok in 1998, is a vital step to enhance competitiveness, he
noted. "Without own ports, you can not guarantee the sailing date
of the ship, which will affect your credibility."
</P>
<P>
Also, by opening a website, the company made the customer
easier to know the newest information about the sailing date,
types of containers, the shipping route, the capacity of each ship,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Besides, to shorten the time of sending business documents and
orders, COSCO (Thailand) has equipped itself with the advanced
Mailbox satellite communication system.
</P>
<P>
The management problems, or the "software" of the company is
equally important to develop a shipping business, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
With only six Chinese executives, the company is impossible to
supervise hundreds of Thai employees all by themselves. "So we
decide to invite Thai executives to supervise Thai workers, and it
works very well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that to improve the personnel quality, he is very
strict in recruiting new employees, who must have college
education and a fairly good English language ability.
</P>
<P>
By imposing quality control measures, the company finally got
the International Standard Organization's approval of the quality
of its service last year, which is set to further improve its
image and enhance confidence of its customers.
</P>
<P>
When questioned about the future plans about his company, the
former captain of ocean liner said it will move toward the
direction of "logistics service", in which a shipping company will
provide sea, land and air transportation methods and other
services in a continuous line.
</P>
<P>
"This is the future trend of shipping business, and we will
catch up with it," Zou said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Interior Ministry Official Sacked Over Bugging Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov
signed two decrees on Thursday, dismissing Secretary-General of
the Interior Ministry Bozhidar Popov over the bugging scandal and
appointing Slavcho Bosilkov as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
Bosilkov, a former chief of the police, was the national
security advisor to Prime Minister Ivan Kostov.
</P>
<P>
The president later met with Kostov and Interior Minister
Emanouil Yordanov and harshly criticized the work of the Interior
Ministry and the minister.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech on Thursday evening, Stoyanov said: "The
bugging scandal is a very serious problem as it is related to a
citizen's dignity, peace and security."
</P>
<P>
A change to the secretary-general of the ministry did not put
an end to the problem, and the task of the minister and the
general secretary of the Interior Ministry is to regain, as soon
as possible, people's trust in that department, he said.
</P>
<P>
In late July, Bulgaria Public Prosecutor Nikola Filtchev
revealed that bugging devices were uncovered in his flat in Sofia
and demanded an investigation.
</P>
<P>
The government announced last week the results of a probe into
the scandal, blaming Popov and former Interior Minister Bogomil
Bonev for the bugging activities. Kostov made a recommendation to
the president that Popov be fired and replaced by Bosilkov.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Chief Says No Plan to Increase Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- President of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Ali Rodriguez said Wednesday
that the oil cartel had no plans to increase production yet, since
the prices have gone over its price ceiling only two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues, also Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister, said the
cartel's central point in this question is to keep market stabile
and OPEC's statistics had shown some overproduction, but the
international market hasn't been affected immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the cartel's estimates, oil prices
will keep "stable". If there is a price increase, OPEC has had "
corrective formulas".
</P>
<P>
The member countries of OPEC agreed in March on the price band
mechanism to stabilize oil market. Under the price target
mechanism to keep the prices at between 22 to 28 U.S. dollars a
barrel, OPEC should raise or lower output by 500,000 barrels per
day (bpd) if prices remain above the band for 20 consecutive days
or below the band for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices on International markets went over 30 U.S.
dollars a barrel on August 16, reaching their highest level in
recent years.

BOGOTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Colombian rebels on an "armed
strike" in north and northeast Colombia, burned at least 27
vehicles Wednesday night in protest to U.S. President Clinton's
forthcoming visit, according to military sources here.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the incident was carried out by
guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN) outside San
Rafael municipality. Roadblocks were also placed by the rebels in
an attempt to stop traffic.
</P>
<P>
ELN have burned nearly 140 vehicles in the past 11 days in a
campaign of destruction against the 1.3 billion U.S. dollars anti-
narcotics aid package to Colombia
</P>
<P>
The aid package, the outcome of negotiations between U.S. and
Colombian governments, was criticized by the opposition because
they think too much money is being spent on the military and not
enough on solving social problems.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Than Half U.S. Homes Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Two different Internet
traffic reports confirm that there are now more homes in the
United States wired for Internet access than not.
</P>
<P>
Nielsen/NetRatings reported Thursday that 52 percent of U.S.
households, or 114 million people, had access to the Internet in
July, up 35 percent in just a year.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report from Media Metrix, also an Internet audience
ratings firm, said that 51 percent of American homes had Web
access.
</P>
<P>
According to Nielsen Ratings, the jump in numbers should be
attributed to lower prices for hardware, the emergence of free
Internet service providers and affordable broadband. The
availability of flat rate pricing for unlimited Internet access,
which has made the United States the most wired nation in the
world, was cited as another reason for the shrinking digital
divide.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one third of all American Web users are accessing
streaming media, and 56K modems remain the norm. But the number of
households wired for high-speed lines has nearly doubled since
October last year, from 5 percent to 9 percent, according to
Nielsen Ratings.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Communications Commission of the
United States, there were 2.8 million high-speed and advanced
services subscribers in the country at the end of 1999. A new
research released Thursday by research firm Allied Business
Intelligence predicted that this number would increase to 42
million in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Economy Grows Well in First Half Year EDS: Repeats with correction in 3rd para </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's economy developed
well in the first half of the year, with industrial production and
foreign trade jumping drastically, compared with the same period
last year, according to figures released Thursday from the
national statistic bureau.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that industrial production in the first
seven months rose by 20 percent, topped by nonmetal and
construction materials with a growth rate of 55.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in July increased 24.3 percent from that of
the same month in 1999, but dropped 5.3 percent compared with the
previous month because of seasonal factors. Economists here
believe the decrease will not affect the planned 15-percent growth
of the gross national product (GNP) this year.
</P>
<P>
In the trade sector, bureau statistics said the total amount of
foreign trade in the first six months increased 26.1 percent, with
imports rising 31.4 percent and exports 15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food products led the list of exported commodities worth 120
million U.S. dollars, followed by non-ferrous metals worth 114
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's major trade partners are Germany, Italy, Russia
and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav economy, which has dampened in the recent decade
due to domestic and external political factors, was further
worsened by the 78-day NATO bombing of the Balkan country last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country has been gathering strength because of favorable
government policies and painstaking efforts of the Yugoslav people.

<HEADLINE> Leading Somali Warlord to Attend Peace Talks in Djibouti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DJIBOUTI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A well-known warlord in
northern Somalia will arrive here on Saturday to attend the
ongoing Peace Conference of Somalia, a member of the transitional
parliament of the east African country told Xinhua on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abshir Muse, a doyen in the transitional parliament,
said, "Abdillahi Yussouf, now in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is due to
fly in here Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Yussouf, over 70, has been a top leader of Puntland which
declared independence in July of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He had formerly rejected the invitation by Djibouti President
Ismael Omar Guelleh to attend the peace talks held in Djibouti,
the 12th of its kind since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The leader had claimed that he would not come to the meeting
unless he was promised a key post either in the new parliament or
in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Yussouf's participation of the
peace talks will throw his weight to the importance of the meeting
which is designed to put an end to the 10-year-old civil war in
Somalia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military is
assembling a team of divers, engineers and medical experts to be
ready this weekend to rescue the crew of a sunken Russian
submarine, Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he got a letter from his Russian counterpart Igor
Sergeyev on Thursday night thanking him for U.S. offer of
assistance but asking that any U.S. help be coordinated through
the NATO. Still no final request for U.S. help had yet been
received from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make it clear that the Defense Department
remains ready, willing and able to provide whatever assistance we
can to the Russian authorities that they would find helpful,"
Cohen told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pentagon had already begun putting together a team
of sea rescue experts -- divers, engineers and medical experts --
that could move to the site -- where the Russian Submarine Kursk
was trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea -- within 24 hours if
requested by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said U.S. offers of help were being coordinated in
television conferences between Washington and Moscow and NATO
officials at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"They (the rescue team) will remain here until such time as
there is a request made for their assistance," Cohen said. "They
will be on the ready."

<HEADLINE> UK Swine Fever May be Contained: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government's chief
veterinary officer said Friday that there were "encouraging" signs
that the outbreak of swine fever may have been successfully
contained.
</P>
<P>
The government's chief veterinary officer Jim Scudamore said: "
It would be very early to get an all-clear for England for swine
fever, but if we can show we haven't got the disease spreading
they (the European Union) might take a decision on whether the ban
needs to cover England or a smaller area."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six farms were currently affected by the contagious
disease which has caused the EU to impose a ban on the export of
live English pigs.
</P>
<P>
It has also been suggested that the source of the outbreak
could be from Asian wild boars illegally imported into the UK, the
BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
New restrictions have been placed on the movement of pigs on
seven more farms across the country after the animals showed
symptoms of the illness.
</P>
<P>
But three farms on the banned list for transporting pigs were
given the all clear on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The news came after British Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown
held talks with representatives of the pig industry where he told
them there would be "significant" results from tests for the
disease by next week.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in London, he also told them all possible
efforts were being made to provide evidence to European scientists
that the disease was not spreading ahead of a crucial meeting with
an EU veterinary committee next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Only pigs on five farms have so far been confirmed as having
been affected by the disease, but another 31 farms with sick pigs
are under observation.
</P>
<P>
A further 100 farms had also been tested after it was
discovered they had links to the infected sites.
</P>
<P>
The area of the country most affected so far has been East
Anglia. But farms in Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire,
Lancashire, Sussex, the Isle of Wight and Dorset have been banned
from transporting pigs while tests are carried out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier in the day, Brown promised pig farmers they
will be "treated fairly" over compensation for the outbreak of
swine fever.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had discussed compensation for farmers who
were forced to destroy diseased animals and for "industry
restructuring", with other EU states.
</P>
<P>
The consultations with countries including France and Germany
had been very helpful, he said, and the European Commission had "
gone out of their way to help us."

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for Reelection to Sustain Development  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Saturday urged his people to protect social and
economic gains registered in the country over the last couple of
years by re-electing him and other candidates of the ruling Chama
Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) in the October general elections.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the CCM's campaign and its 2000 elections
manifesto at a public gathering here, the president told thousands
of CCM members and well-wishers that reforms pursued by his
government since mid-1980s have enabled Tanzania revive the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge ahead of us now is to expand the economy and
empower our people to have control over it. And CCM and its
government is capable and committed to this cause if given another
term," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
In a speech later, Mkapa's running mate, the current Vice-
President Omar Juma presented a catalogue of the government's high
points over the last five years, including steady annual GDP
growth of 4 percent, fall of inflation rate from around 30 percent
in 1995 to 6 percent at present, and increased revenue collection
from an average of 29 billion shillings (about 36.3 million U.S.
dollars) per month to about 70 billion shillings (about 87.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Mkapa is seeking a reelection for another five-
year term in the polls scheduled on October 29.
</P>

<P>
The four contestants are Benjamin Mkapa of the CCM, Augustine
Mrema of the Tanzanian Labor Party (TLP), Professor Ibrahim
Lipumba of Civic United Front (CUF) and John Cheyo of the United
Democratic Party (UDP).
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
resettled nearly 2,000 farmer families countrywide since the fast-
track resettlement scheme began in June, this year.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary George Charamba Saturday told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the families had been resettled on 81,
321 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
All the provinces, except for Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe,
had started resettling families on the recently acquired farms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said since independence in 1980 when the government embarked
on the resettlement program, some 60,000 families have been
resettled on 3.3 million hectares of land countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Under its fast-track resettlement program, the government has
identified 3,041 farms or over 5 million hectares of farmland for
the resettlement exercise.
</P>
<P>
At present, 70 percent of fertile land in Zimbabwe is still
owned by 4,500 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
Charamba said the government's target still stood at 5 million
hectares on which the majority of land-hungry Zimbabweans are to
be resettled in order to correct the land ownership imbalance.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Pledges to Enhance Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has pledged to further enhance bilateral cooperation with
China, which has been playing an important role in international
arena.
</P>
<P>
"China is the biggest developing country in the world, while
Nigeria is the biggest in Africa, it is by no means to over-
emphasize the importance of the need to consolidate and push
forward the cooperation between the two countries," said Obasanjo
when he met on Saturday with visiting Chinese vice-minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic cooperation Sun Guangxiang.
</P>
<P>
While being briefed on the preparatory progress of the
forthcoming Sino-African Forum, scheduled to open in October in
Beijing, China, Obasanjo said African countries, with a diversity
of political and economic systems, are facing the challenges of
developing their economies to catch up with the trend of world
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Forum provided a venue for African countries to find ways
to further develop the existing friendly relationship with China,
said the president, adding that Nigerian government would be
actively engaged to make it a successful one.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo had personally sent messages to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, pledging that the Nigerian government would
actively involve itself into the Forum.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Sun Guangxiang conveyed the messages and
good wishes of President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji to
President Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Sun said his visit to Nigeria was specially focused upon
briefing the Nigerian government about the preparatory progress of
the Forum and solicit opinions and suggestions about the draft
documents for the Forum.
</P>
<P>
Sun said China spoke highly of Nigeria's leading role in
maintaining the peace and stability in the sub-region and believed
that the scheduled Forum could not be a success without the active
support of the vast majority of African countries including
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has been paying special attention to
enhancing the existing good relationship with African countries,
both politically and economically.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Visits Oman on Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amour, accompanied by a three-man entourage, left Zanzibar on
Thursday and was expected to hold talks with Oman Sultan qaboos
bin Said and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
Amour, who will complete his second and final term of office
in October, announced early this year pardon for the former ruler
of Zanzibar Sultan Jamshid Abdulla bin Khalifa bin Haroub who was
deposed in the popular 1964 revolution.
</P>
<P>
Amour said that his government welcomes Jamshid to make
contribution to the development of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Jamshid, who fled Zanzibar after the revolution, now lives in
exile in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, consisting of the main Unguja island and its sister
island of Pemba some 40 kilometers east of the mainland of
Tanzania, had been ruled by the Omani Arabs until 1964.
</P>
<P>
Following the revolution, Zanzibar and the then Republic of
Tanganyika merged to form the United Republic of Tanzania, but it
still has its own government dealing with affairs except foreign
and defense ones.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Warns Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has warned officials against pocketing international loans, saying
that he would sack any cabinet minister who is found to be
involved in such acts.
</P>
<P>
"Each and every cent of these loans must be accounted for,
strictly to the last word," Moi was quoted by Saturday's Daily
Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those top officials who have colluded with contractors to steal
the money would be dealt with swiftly and prosecuted, Moi told a
gathering on Friday in west Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered all investigative arms of the government,
including the Criminal Investigation Department and Kenya Anti-
corruption Authority, immediately to start getting rid of
corruption in the government.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) resumed a loan of 198
million U.S. dollars to Kenya in July this year after three years
suspension of the credit, which had triggered off economic slow-
down. The World Bank also restarted lending money to Kenya in
early August.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyans have suffered long enough when the World Bank and IMF
denied the country loans because of corruption, which must be
cleaned once and for all in the civil service," Moi noted.
</P>
<P>
The money earmarked for development projects must not be used
to pay local officials' or government workers' salaries, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
In order to crack down rampant corruption, the Kenyan
government has set up the Anti-corruption Authority and prosecuted
a number of officials in recent years. These measures have
received approval from the international financial institutions
and donors.

<HEADLINE> Drought to Ease in East Africa: Meteorologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The severe drought hitting Kenya
and other parts of east Africa could come to an end in the near
future, meteorological and climate experts have predicted.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the region are likely to experience adequate
rainfall next month, the East African Standard reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea and other
countries have been devastated by the drought with the failure of
crops and decimation of livestock. More than 10 million people in
the region are threatened by famine.
</P>
<P>
The La Nina episode seems to have ended, according to Lisa
Goddard, an expert with the International Research Institute for
Climate Prediction.
</P>
<P>
The expected heavy rainfall in the region could ease the acute
water shortage and resume the capacity of hydropower stations in
Kenya, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, some meteorological experts here say that the signals
for the coming normal weather pattern are still weak and the next
month will be very crucial.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Spend 800 Million U.S. Dollars on Roads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nasasira revealed that the government was planning to spend
more on construction of roads as it had promised, and about 1.3
billion U.S. dollars could be spent on roads in the next 10 years,
reported the New Vision daily Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister and other government officials, the African
Development Bank and two international firms, Stirling and Strabag,
recently met to sign a joint contract for the upgrading of the
Kyotera-Mutukula Road.
</P>
<P>
The road is part of the international route running north-south
of Africa connecting from Masaka to Mutukula at the Uganda-
Tanzania border in northwest Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"This road is 45 kilometers long and currently made of gravel.
Its rapid deterioration is due to increased traffic. This is a
constraint to economic and social development and discourages
investment in the development of regional and local natural
resources," Nasasira was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The works ministry also signed a contract recently with
Stirling and Strabag to upgrade the 82.4 kilometers Malaba-Bugiri
Busia Road, part of an international highway that passes through
Monbasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Lagos.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni and his government have paid special
attention to construction of roads, and called for improvement of
infrastructure in the east Africa country so as to attract foreign
investors.

Foreign Affairs Minister Keli Walubita disclosed in Lusaka on
Friday that the ministry had since written to the ministry of
Finance, urging it to release the budgetary allocation for
foreign missions to clear the outstanding bills which had now
become an embarrassment to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the minister as saying in an interview that as
at December 31 last year Zambia was owing foreign missions 7.4
billion kwacha that it was making the operations of diplomats
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Walubita was worried about the huge debt in Washington, London,
Cairo, Moscow, Benin, Abidjan, Tokyo, Geneva and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"This is very shameful for the country because we have had
cases where diplomats and their families have been thrown out of
their houses due to non-payment of bills," Walubita said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, denied reports that the government was
in the process of closing some missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was considering the possibility of
purchasing properties for foreign missions in order to reduce the
high rental bills.

<HEADLINE> British Team Hopes to Rescue Russian Submarine on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The commander of a British rescue
team said Friday that he hoped he might be able to save some of
the 118 soldiers in the sunken Russian submarine by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible if conditions are favorable and the Russians
give us permission to proceed that we could have rescued someone
by this time tomorrow," Commander Alan Hoskins told BBC at about
2200 GMT on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hoskins and his rescue crew are currently working around the
clock to get to the Russian submarine Kursk in Barents Sea as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Commodore Tim Chittenden, who is head of the team's command
center in the Ministry of Defence base near Bath, a city in the
southwest of England, said the team's spirits were very high but
the mood was very determined.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are increasingly pinned on the British rescue effort,
after an eighth Russian rescue mission failed to link with the
submarine on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rescue has become a race against time, as it is not known
how many of the 118 trapped sailors are still alive.
</P>
<P>
The Russian submarine has been stranded on the bed of the
Barents Sea since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian boat carrying the British rescue team and a mini-
submarine left Norway on Thursday. It is expected to arrive on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to get them there as fast as possible," said
Commodore Chittenden.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a submariner, as are many involved in this operation, and
we have no other agenda but than to get these guys out," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chittenden said his technical experts were working around the
clock to devise engineering solutions to the problems the team
face.
</P>
<P>
He said they had received a huge amount of help from
specialists in private industry, including the oil and
construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Russian rescue capsule reached an escape hatch on
the stricken nuclear submarine for the first time, but was unable
to latch on due to heavy damage.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America Expects Fed to Hold Interest Rates Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. monetary policymakers
will vote to leave interest rates unchanged at the next week's
Federal Reserve Board meeting, said a report released Friday by
the investment management group of Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Capital Management expects no major surprises at the
Fed's meeting, although Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan "will likely warn that the Fed remains on guard against
inflation."
</P>
<P>
A final polling of economic reports leading up to the Fed's
meeting suggests that U.S. economic growth is moderating to a pace
that should be consistent with the Federal Reserve's platform, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's analysis, confirmation of no change in
monetary policy should help some of the more interest-sensitive
sectors in the stock market, including banking, insurance and
brokerage. Investors are also likely to warm up to the technology
sector once again, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Three major concerns, namely interest rates, profits and
valuation levels, have weighed on the U.S. equity market this year,
the report said. All three areas are beginning to improve. It
appears that the Federal Reserve has ended its tightening stance;
operating earnings should rise a solid 13 percent to 15 percent
this year; and valuation levels have become reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America Capital Management estimates Federal funds rate
to be 6.50 percent in 2000, up from 5.50 percent in 1999, and
forecasts 6.25 percent in 2001. This year, real GDP growth is
estimated to be 5.2 percent from 4.2 percent in 1999, and in 2001,
it is expected to go down to 3.2 percent.

WASHINGTON,August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government on Friday
added two Colombians to its list of 524 individuals and companies
banning them from doing business in this country because of
suspicion of their drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department said in an statement that Arcangel de
Jesus Henao Montaya and Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia were listed
because they were responsible for huge volumes of drugs that had
entered the United States.
</P>
<P>
Treasury would blocked their access to any assets they may have
in the United States and also barred U.S. companies from doing
business with them, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Treasury described Henao as a leader of one of the most
powerful drug-trafficking groups that comprise the North Valle
cartel and Ramirez as an overlord of the infamous Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
Treasury also added to the list one individual and five
businesses that it said are acting as fronts for the North Valle
drug cartel in Colombia.
