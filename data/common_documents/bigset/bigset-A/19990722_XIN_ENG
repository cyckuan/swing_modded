<HEADLINE> New Trade Arrangement between S. Africa, Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's captains of industry
Wednesday welcomed the increase in export quotas to South Africa
as a step toward improving trade relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira
and his South African counterpart Alec Erwin met last Thursday in
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city and agreed to review
existing quotas under the 1964 Trade Agreement in light of their
utilization by exporters and benefits to the Zimbabwean economy.
</P>
<P>
The revised quotas, effective from August 1, are an interim
measure to pave the way for the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Trade Protocol expected to come into force on
January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The products approved for revision included yarn which
increased from 800,000 kgs per annum to 2,000,000 kgs, blankets
from 40,000 units to 150, 000 units, household linen from 145,000
to 245,000.
</P>
<P>
The clothing quota remained at 3,127,000 units.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Nhlanhla
Masuku Wednesday said that the move was a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
"The best area should have been for tariff reductions without
quotas. I suspect the South Africans are waiting for the SADC
Trade Protocol. The quotas will definitely have an effect on
export earnings from South Africa, no doubt about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economist of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Farai
Zizhou also said the increased quotas were "welcome" and a "good
starting point".
</P>
<P>
"Obviously our trade includes a lot more products than just
those mentioned. The South Africans are looking at limitations to
what they can do in light of certain problems with the trade
agreement itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the move was an interim arrangement because under the
bilateral agreement, tariffs on clothing were at 30 percent but
under terms of the SADC Trade Protocol it would be 35 percent but
with no quotas.
</P>
<P>
After that, he said, South Africa would reduce tariffs by five
percentage points every year.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has been haunted by trade
imbalances with Zimbabwe importing goods worth 13 billion
Zimbabwean dollars (342 million U.S. dollars) while South Africa
imported only three billion Zimbabwean dollars (78 million U.S.
dollars) worth of goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai economy has turned to
positive in April and May with 4.9 percent and 1.4 percent growth
rates respectively, said a statement issued by the Thai Finance
Ministry on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, Thai economy still posed an
overall 1.5 percent contraction in the first five months of this
year due to the negative growth of 6.5 percent, 5.4 percent and
3.6 percent in January, February and March consequently.
</P>
<P>
The economic rehabilitation of Thailand resulted from
increasing domestic consumption and investment, which were spurred
by the government's economic stimulus package, the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the first half of this year rose by 1.1 percent,
much slower than the level of 9.7 percent in the same period of
last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports in June increased for the third
consecutive month, reaching 4.85 billion U.S. dollars, a 4.8
percent year-on-year growth from 1998, and a 3.28 percent growth
from May, the statement said.

ATHENS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Wednesday held talks with his visiting Bulgarian counterpart, Ivan
Kostov, to discuss bilateral relations, cooperation in the Balkan
region and Sofia's bid to join the European Union (EU) and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Both premiers agreed that the works provided in the stability
pact for the Balkan region should go ahead at a rapid pace and the
pact should not aim at tackling isolated problems but rather than
those of the Balkans as a whole.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the criterion for dealing with the Balkan
problems should be the rules of international law, the
international treaties in force and that the United Nations should
play a more active role.
</P>
<P>
The two men also agreed to submit joint proposals within the
framework of the stability pact for the Balkans and to support the
construction of highway 4 which will connect southeastern Europe
with the rest of the continent.
</P>
<P>
While paying great attention to bilateral relations, Simitis
and Kostov said that they were opposed to any change of borders in
the Balkans or in Europe in general.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also voiced Geece's support in Bulgaria's effort to
join the EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kostov said that Bulgaria supported the
construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupoli oil pipeline and was
ready to meet the Greek and Russian sides at the end of July to
form the joint venture
</P>
<P>
Kostov, who arrived here Wednesday for an official two-day
visit, will also meet with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos
and Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Thai Largest Bank's Loss Soars in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest
privately-owned commercial bank, reported Wednesday to the Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET) a net loss of 26.9 billion baht (727
million U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have been suffering deepened losses in the
first half of this year due mainly to provisions against possible
loan defaults, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank said it has set aside loan-loss reserve of 33.1
billion baht (894.6 million dollars), bringing the total provision
to 134.6 billion baht (3.6 billion dollars), or 84 percent of its
total reserve requirement which is at 159 billion baht (4.3
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thailand's second largest private commercial bank, Thai Farmers
Bank, reported to SET earlier Wednesday an unaudited result with a
significant loss of 17.3 billion baht (467.6 million U.S. dollars)
for the first half of this year against 3.92 billion baht (105.9
million dollars) over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank also reported a huge loss of about 5.97
billion baht (161.4 million dollars) during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Ayudhya, the country's fifth largest bank, reported a
net loss of 15.6 billion baht (421.6 million dollars) in the first
half of 1999, a steep increase from 7.4 billion baht (200 million
dollars) loss in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
DBS Thai Danu Bank, majority owned by Development Bank of
Singapore, posted a net loss of 9.97 billion baht (269.5 million
dollars), rising from 5.33 billion baht (144 million dollars) for
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank of Asia, taken by ABN-Amro Bank, registered its
loss at 1.8 billion baht (18.6 million dollars), better than 6.7
billion baht (181.1 million dollars) loss in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that all banks are expected to post hefty losses
for the second quarter and the first half of this year as
provisioning against non-performing loans (NPLs) continues, due to
the central bank's June 30 deadline for all banks to meet at least
40 percent of the total required provisions.
</P>
<P>
NPLs in the system represented 47 percent of total loans at the
end of March.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Slow Down in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 21 (Xinhua) Retail sales in Britain remained at the
same level in June as they were in May, but growth over the past
year has exceeded expectation, according to official figures on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office of National Statistics (ONS) said that over the
year, sales were up 3.8 percent - the biggest rise since May 1998.
Market analysts had been expecting a monthly rise of 0.4 percent
and a year-on-year rise of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the latest figures confirmed that the underlying
rate of sales growth had picked up since the turn of the year but
did not necessarily point to a further pick-up in growth.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that the strong year-on-year figure was
mainly due to a weak performance in June 1998 rather than a strong
performance in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the June figures suggest retailers have been
making discounts to boost sales. Some argued that the Bank of
England's interest rate cut in June may have been an error.

<HEADLINE> Millenium Bug Can Be Arrested: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A United Kingdom-based engineer
working on coordinating the Y2K millenium bug (Year 2000 computer
compliance) project said Wednesday that it is possible to overcome
the new millenium bug and avert threats it poses.
</P>
<P>
Richard Earp, who is heading an operational policy development
group in England, said in an interview with the Zimbabwe News
Agency here that it is not possible for governments and task
forces to solve the millenium bug problem alone.
</P>
<P>
There is need for lower levels to know the problem and they
should try to solve it on their own, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Earp said the role of external task forces should be to check
on organizations, advise and possibly bring sanctions to
organizations that do not work toward solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said though it is possible to solve the threats of the
millenium bug, organizations should not be complacent and not to
over-react.
</P>
<P>
Earp is one of the speakers attending a two-day workshop on how
the effects of the millenium bug could be minimized for the
critical sectors in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Participants will map out contingency plans for possible
adoption by the targeted sectors.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the workshop Wednesday, Zimbabwean
Higher Education and Technical Training Minister Ignatius Chombo
said the National Y2K Task Force was in the process of carrying
out an analysis on key sectors in the country to determine their
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
He said the findings from the studies were intended to help
interested parties to put in place corrective steps to avoid total
systems failures.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's clothing industry
workers have been awarded a 30 percent salary increment with
effect from this month, an industrial official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the National Union of the Clothing
Industry Freddy Mpofu said the increase followed successful
negotiations between the union and the employers.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiating parties had also agreed that workers
would be awarded a further six percent increment in February next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Although we agreed on this percentage that does not mean that
it will offset the prevailing inflationary cost of living as the
prices of basic commodities keep on rising," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that workers realized during the negotiations that
employers were also facing viability problems.
</P>
<P>
Problems faced by the clothing industry had resulted in massive
 retrenchments which saw the number of employees in the sector
dropping from 26,000 to 19,500 since last October, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Calls for Meaningful Indo-Pak Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Wednesday called on India to restore the Line of
Control (LoC) in Kashmir and resume meaningful dialogue with
Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
India cannot expect Pakistan to respect the LoC but itself
continues to violate it by moving into the Pakistan-held Kashmir,
Aziz said at the conclusion of the National Assembly debate on
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said it is vital for peace in South Asia that the LoC,
accepted by the two sides under the 1972 Simla Agreement, should
be respected by both India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a statement by Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh on trust between the two neighbors, Aziz said, "Real trust
between India and Pakistan had never existed throughout the past
52 years."
</P>
<P>
Singh, in an earlier statement, said India is not ready to
resume talks with Pakistan because it, by backing intrusion into
Indian-held Kashmir, had betrayed India's trust.
</P>
<P>
Aziz further pointed out that it is India that had repeatedly
damaged the prospects of building a relationship of trust by using
force or coercion to resolve issues that arose between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
To explain, the foreign minister said the Indians had violated
the LoC separately at Chorbatla in 1972, at Siachin glacier in
1984 and at Qamar in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"Today Kashmir is a flash point and fully engages the attention
of the world community, " Aziz said, adding that "a just and final
settlement of the issue cannot be delayed any longer."
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations and the major powers to play their
roles to facilitate a "meaningful dialogue" between India and
Pakistan, "a dialogue that leads to a final solution of the
Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
"We do not need dialogue for sake of dialogue. We do not need
yet another process of sterile and unproductive talks," stated the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan would like to revive the Lahore process with a
meaningful and result-oriented dialogue to resolve all issues that
divide the two South Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Cyprus Officials Discuss Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister
Yiannos Kranidiotis Wednesday discussed with visiting Cyprus
Foreign Minister Yiannakis Kasoulides the Cyprus problem and the
island's relations with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Kranidiotis criticized the visit
by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to northern Cyprus this
week, saying that this undermined the attempt at Greek-Turkish
talks on low-level issues, with the first meeting to take place in
Ankara next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Kranidiotis hoped there would a positive outcome from
the talks that could have a run-off effect on larger issues, such
as the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis urged the international community not to hold the
island republic to a double standard but to assist in finding a
solution to the divided island by exerting pressure on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He also asked neighboring Turkey to change its stance and
respond to its international obligations by encouraging talks on
the creation of a bizonal, bicommunal federation with one
international identity and nationality.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus's accession course toward the EU should proceed
regardless of the present political problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides called on the international community
not to accept any of the demands pursued by Ecevit concerning the
recognization of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that if developments moved within the framework of the
G-8 communique providing for talks without preconditions, there
was a real hope of settling the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Attack City Near Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The General Staff of the Angolan
Armed Forces Wednesday confirmed that the rebel UNITA troops
attacked Catete City, 63 kms southeast of capital Luanda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the general staff said in a statement that the
government army has defeated the troops of the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The statement said it was the first time that the rebels has
attacked a city so close to the capital since the civil war
renewed late last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, an unknown number of UNITA troops
attacked Catete in the central part of Bengo Province around 4:00
a.m. Tuesday, killing two government soldiers, wounding six
civilians and destroying three civilian vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The government army immediately launched counter-attack. The
fighting lasted for some four hours before the army chased the
rebels out to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention the casualties of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
But according to eyewitnesses fleeing from the city, many
people were forced to flee toward Luanda for fear of the UNITA
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the UNITA troops and the government army
used to take place hundreds of kilometers away from the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the situation in the central cities of Huambo and
Kuito has been relatively calm.
</P>
<P>
However, Angolan government officials said that the rebels are
stepping up attacks on minor cities and towns in order to foil the
government offensive during the dry season.

<HEADLINE> Syria Denies Involvement With Palestinian Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian official said on
Wednesday that his country has nothing to do with the Palestinian
factions residing in Syria, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in response to local press reports that the
Syrian government intends to ban the armed struggle of the
Palestinian factions in Syria against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The official, whose name was not disclosed, said Syria
interferes neither in the activities of the Palestinian
organizations nor in their decisions on their national legitimate
rights.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian factions and organizations residing in Syria
play their political role according to their vision in the
interest of the just cause of the Palestinian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 Damascus-based radical Palestinian Islamic
factions that are opposed to the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Most prominent among such factions are the Hamas movement, the
People's Front for Palestine Liberation, the Democratic Front for
Palestine Liberation and the Jihad (holy war) movement.

<HEADLINE> WTO Ruling Body to Approve Leadership Plan on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The ruling General Council of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will formally approve a
power-sharing plan to appoint Mike Moore of New Zealand and
Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand as the WTO's next two consecutive
leaders, according to trade sources.
</P>
<P>
During an informal meeting Tuesday at the WTO headquarters,
trade envoys of the WTO's 134 members discussed the draft "3+3"
plan brokered by Bangladesh and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Although no participants said that they really liked the plan,
none of them said they were opposed to it, meaning that the plan
was effectively accepted, officials said at the end of Tuesday's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Mike Moore of New Zealand would be the WTO
Director-General for three years from September 1, 1999 to August
31, 2002. Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand would succeed Moore
from September 1, 2002 for three years to August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the candidates should be eligible for reappointment
as Director-General nor should his period of office be extended,
according to the proposal. It stressed that the special
arrangement for the two candidates should not be the precedent for
future appointments of the WTO chief.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years
like former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has served.
</P>
<P>
The remaining problems now appear to be the number of the
deputy director-generals and their allocation among different
geographical regions but they will not prevent the WTO members
from reaching consensus around the arrangement of the top
leadership.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Urged to Discuss Upward Trend of Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Oil experts here urged on
Wednesday the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
to hold an emergency meeting to deal with the present upward trend
of the oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
In interviews with the Kuwait News Agency, the experts, who
declined to be named, suggested that OPEC members meet to reach a
formula protecting their interests, in case other oil producers
take advantage of the current market situation.
</P>
<P>
They said the oil cartel should act quickly, because it was not
in the interest of the member states that prices reach very high
levels.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices witnessed record rise recently in global markets
touching the highest level ever since November 1997, mainly due to
the adherence of OPEC states to the output reductions they agreed
last March.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever oil prices are moderate, OPEC is in the safe-side,"
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They underlined that OPEC must play an active role in the oil
markets whenever prices begin to climb up or drop down, adding
that they should agree on price limits.
</P>
<P>
They warned that if OPEC members fail to move quickly other oil
producing nations will "take advantage and accomplish projects and
maintenance of their oil fields to pump more oil into the world
markets."
</P>
<P>
The experts also attributed the current price rise to the increase
of oil demand in Asia, maintenance on North Sea fields and the
shrinking world oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
They also expected that the oil prices would rise to about 20
U.S. dollars per barrel, as winter is coming and demand will
increase.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Europeans See Internet Part of Daily Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Europeans are more and more
interested in using Internet for doing things as part of their
daily life despite of their slower pace for embracing information
society than that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that many European citizens rely
increasingly on the use of new Information Technology (IT)
applications. For the interviewed Europeans, 47.8 percent usually
consult local town or council services from their home in order to
get documents they need.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's Eurobarometer survey said that 42.3
percent of respondents show their interest in preparing a complete
trip from home on a computer screen, while 41.9 get a doctor's
advice on a health problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Europeans choose an easy way to look for a job
by consulting the employment office from a computer. The survey
showed 41.5 percent seek their jobs from Internet and 33.9 learn a
training program from a computer or television at home as if
attending the course in person.
</P>
<P>
Some Europeans believe that the worthiest spending for using
Internet is distance learning. Some 18.2 percent of the
interviewed, an equivalent of 56 million European citizens,
expressed their willingness to pay 10 euros (10.4 U.S. dollars)
per month to get such a service.
</P>
<P>
The data showed Internet users in Europe have doubled since
early 1997. Now, about 27 million people use the Internet at home
and some 22.4 million use it at work.
</P>
<P>
Currently, an average of 8.3 percent of private households in
the 15-nation European Union have Internet access, compared to 4.4
percent in 1997. However, the contrast is obvious in the whole
picture of the 15-country bloc. The leading countries using the
Internet are Sweden (39.6 percent), Denmark (24.6 percent) and the
Netherlands (19.6 percent), while the less active countries are
Greece (2.9 percent), Portugal (3.4 percent), France (3.9 percent)
and Spain (5 percent).
</P>
<P>
But for Internet companies and commercial banks, they are happy
to see the growing passion for Internet in Europe. Last week, a
two-month old Internet firm, Funmail, announced its listing plan.
The company providing fun and strange E-mail addresses has lured
about 45,000 Internet surfers since it established two months ago.
Observers said Funmail has the right sight over the prospects of
Internet investment by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
For America Online Inc. (AOL), the unchallenged leader in
cyberspace access in the United States, keeping up with growth in
Europe is important. While AOL still has plenty of room to grow in
the United States, where about 37 percent of households are
on-line, the potential is even higher in Europe, analysts said.
According to the Jupiter Communications, only 13 percent of
households are on-line in Germany and only 4 percent in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Banks are also trying to tap their businesses to cater for the
Internet fever. Some bankers say they would do their businesses on
the Internet while viewing the European market as a whole.
Observers believe the on-line banking will be the best way to tap
the market in European.
</P>
<P>
The on-line businesses of Several banks in the Nordic countries
are in full swing. Sweden's SEB bank started its Internet services
at the end of 1996 when they expected some 10,000 clients, but
they were surprised to see ten times of the figure six months
later. Now on-line customers accounted for 20 percent of SEB's
total retail services.
</P>
<P>
With the development of information society, Europeans would be
easy to find that the Internet makes their life easier since
E-mail, E-commerce, E-shopping, E-course and other E-led
activities and services have already entered their daily life,
though some countries are still reluctant to push ahead with the
trend in the continent.

MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Wednesday that it will
allocate 150 million U.S. dollars in loans to help rebuild

</P>
<P>
The government has approved a plan of urgent steps aimed at
rebuilding the Yugoslav economy, especially the supplies of
natural gas and technical aid to rebuilding priority assets.
</P>
<P>
Diesel fuel and gasoline will be sent to Yugoslavia as a
priority to insure the timely harvesting and processing of crops.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's 91 Percent of Businesses in Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's private sector accounts for
91 percent of the country's total businesses and employs about 10
million of its 17 million-strong labor force, according to a
census released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The economic census for 1996-97 revealed that Egypt had 3.078
million businesses, but only 1.691 million of them are
operational, said Ihab Alawi, head of the Central Organization for
Statistics and Mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Of the operational businesses, 1.541 million, or 91.4 percent,
are run by the private sector; the government and public sector
control the rest, Alawi told a news conference announcing the
results of the economic census, conduced in one and half years,
and an update of the 1998 population census.
</P>
<P>
The private sector employed a total of 10.354 million people
out of 17.147 million in the labor force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alawi added, however, that only about 15 million people are
officially counted as part of the country's work force. The
remainder are not officially included because they are completing
military service or are part of an official sector such as fruit
sellers operating from street carts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's unemployment rate is 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparative figures from previous years were not available as
this was the first extensive economic census performed, Alawi said.
</P>
<P>
With the launching of an ambitious economic reform and
structural adjustment program in 1991, Egypt has pushed private
sector development and is attempting to privatize its public
sector companies.
</P>
<P>
The census showed that the government employs a total of 4.364
million people and that 876,729 people work for public sector
firms.
</P>
<P>
The largest private sector employers are the agricultural and
fisheries industries, which employ 4.404 million people.
</P>
<P>
Alawi also released updated population statistics, placing the
country's population at 63,915,319 people as of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figures, an update of census statistics from January 1,
1998, include 1.9 million Egyptians living abroad. Alawi said the
population is growing by about 1,287,480 people per year, or 3,527
per day.
</P>
<P>
The annual population growth rate in 1998 was 2.099 percent.
Egypt had projected an annual population growth of 1.8 percent for
the 1990s, which it hoped to decrease in following decades.
</P>
<P>
Alawi said the larger than anticipated growth rate was not an
indication that the population planning measures had failed, but
that the death rate had declined and life expectancy rose.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging family planning to reduce the
population growth, which is eating away into its social and
economic development plans.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdul-Aziz
Bouteflika and his Yemeni counterpart Ali Abdullah Saleh have
agreed on the necessity of holding an Arab summit to restore Arab
solidarity to face the current challenges.
</P>
<P>
The proposed summit aims to heal the rift of the Arab rank, the
to presidents said in a joint press conference after their
political talks here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They asserted their determination to go ahead with the efforts
to hold an Arab summit for rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Algeria and Yemen support the Arab national causes in all
weathers, Bouteflika said, pointing out that there were Arab calls
to achieve full or gradual regional rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
He urged for strengthening the Arab-African ties, expressing
satisfaction with the resolution of the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
On the Algerian-Yemeni bilateral ties Bouteflika and Saleh
agreed on enchancing them in all fields.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on reviving the work of the Joint Ministerial
Committee that is proposed to convene its sixth session in Algiers next
November.
</P>
<P>
There are ten cooperation accords between the two countries
that are awaiting signing, the Algerian leader said, urging the
Yemeni business people to visit Algeria and invest in it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday Saleh held talks with Bouteflika on several
issues including the bilateral ties and the developments on the
Arab, African and international arenas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants to Scrap Mir, Focus on ISS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov
said here Wednesday that Russia should scrap its Mir space station
and focus its limited resources on its role in the International
Space Station project.
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old Mir has fulfilled its task and has exhausted
its resources, and there is evidence it is becoming decrepit, the
Interfax news agency quoted Klebanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state is no longer able to pay the annual 250
million U.S. dollars to keep the station operating, he said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said Russia should now concentrate on the ISS project.
Russia has undertaken to provide 11 of the future station's 36
component units and 33 percent of its operation time would be at
Russia's disposal.
</P>
<P>
He said the ISS could not materialize without Russian
participation and that meeting its commitments for the project was
a "matter of honor" for Russia.

<HEADLINE> Russian Navy Denies Presence of Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Navy on Wednesday
denied a Norwegian newspaper report that its Northern Fleet keeps
chemical weapons in a top-secret depot near the Norwegian border
in Murmansk region.
</P>
<P>
"No chemical weapons are stored at any storage facilities or
bases of the Russian Navy," the Interfax news agency quoted the
navy's press service as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The report in the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (VG) caused
"great concern" among the navy command, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry and Norwegian
environmentalists also refuted the reported presence of chemical
weapons near the Norwegian border.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia has
honored its international commitments and published information on
all its chemical stockpiles and their locations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bellona, a Norwegian environmental
organization, said the group "does not possess any information
that there is a storage facility for chemical weapon components
near Severomorsk and believes the report to that effect in the
Norwegian newspaper VG not to be true," Interfax reported.

MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus plan to create a
single regional air-defense system, the Interfax news agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources in the Russian Defense Ministry, Interfax said
a Russian air force delegation flew to Minsk Wednesday for
consultations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
This new system is believed to be more integrated than the air
defense system of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation, led by Deputy Commander
Lieutenant-General Yuri Bondarev, will stay in Minsk until
Saturday. The two sides will also discuss Belarussian air defense
units' participation in the Combat Cooperation '99 exercises to be
held on the Ashuluk training ground in the Astrakhan region on
August 23 to 27, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Implement Agreements Signed with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan expressed hope on Wednesday
that Israel will implement the frozen agreements signed with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak would succeed in seeking steps to
implement the signed agreements, especially the Wye River accord,
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib was speaking to reporters after a meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak along with Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
Jordan's chief of the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian officials arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for
a brief visit, during which they conveyed a message to Mubarak
from Jordanian King Abdullah on the Mideast peace process. They
also discussed with the Egyptian leader various ways to revive the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib said the implementation of the signed agreement is
the key to the success of the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib's call came amid Arab anxiety over Barak's proposal
to fold the Wye land-for-security agreement into the final status
negotiations, rather than implement it immediately. The
Palestinians have rejected Barak's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the agreement is the key to making the peace
process succeed," Al-Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, signed last October, calls for Israeli troop
withdrawals from a further 13.1 percent of the West Bank and the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze the
implementation in December but Barak promised to revive the
agreement in his election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Accused of Actively Training Rwandan Hutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) - More details have emerged about the
 recruitment and training of Rwandan ''Interahamwe'' militia and
defeated former Rwandan government soldiers (ex-FAR), the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that the Republic of Zimbabwe has been
actively training members of the ex-FAR and Interahamwe militia,"
Rwandan army spokesman, Major Emmanuel Ndahiro, was quoted as
telling the RNA Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan army official's accusations followed declarations by
Rwandan Vice-President, Major General Paul Kagame, who accused
Zimbabwe of actively training the Hutu militia with the objective
of sending them to Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
A statement issued early this week by the Office of the
President also expressed concern over "the continued training of
the Interahamwe militia in Zimbabwe and their deployment in Congo
(K)," which it said was in violation of the Lusaka Accord signed
on July 10
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Kigali, quoting Zimbabwean and Rwandan
 "Interahamwe'' POWs, told RNA that the first group of trainees
mobilized and retrained were mainly former air-force pilots and
mechanics who were taken to Gweru Air-Force Base in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
They included Celestin Nzeyimana, former presidential jet
technician, and Maj. Kalisa (only one name), a pilot in ex-FAR and
many others.
</P>
<P>
"Full relations with ex-FAR and Interahamwe were established in
October 1998 when more than 30 former Rwandan politicians and
ex-FAR officials were given political asylum to assist the war
effort in Congo (K)," the sources told RNA.
</P>
<P>
More recruits have been arriving from Nairobi (Kenya), Central
African Republic, South Africa and elsewhere, and include
well-known genocidal leaders like Selvain Nkunzurwanda who went to
Harare from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
These recruits have been given Zimbabwean passports while
others from South Africa have been using refugee travel documents
delivered by the host country.
</P>
<P>
One cited by the sources is Captain Edisbald Maniraguha who is
said to have moved from Cape Town to Harare. He is said to have
been involved in arms trafficking for ex-FAR in Congo (K) from the
South African town.
</P>
<P>
It is said that some of these ex-FAR officers have been sent to
serve in the planning and operations staff of the allies in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while others were assigned to
serve in the military intelligence structures in the Cranbourne
barracks in Harare.
</P>
<P>
So far at least 505 company commanders have allegedly received
training in Zimbabwe since January 1999, with Rwandan Hutu militia
disguised as Congolese soldiers at Gweru army college.
</P>
<P>
A Rwandan government official who asked not be named charged
that from March 1999, Zimbabwe expanded the training program
enormously and committed 33 million Zimbabwean dollars in January
to assist the Interahamwe and ex-FAR as well as Ugandan and
Burundi rebels which Zimbabwe want to use against the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Angola, as well as Chad have been
fighting alongside Interahamwe militia in the DRC where they have
sent troops to prop up president Laurent Desire Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passenger Traffic to Grow through 2001 Globally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Scheduled passenger traffic
of the world airlines is expected to grow 4.1 percent in 1999, 5
percent in 2000 and 5.7 percent in 2001, according to the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total international and domestic scheduled passenger traffic
generated by ICAO's 185 contracting states is forecast to rise to
2739 billion passenger-kilometers in 1999, ICAO said in a news
release issued by the U.N. Department of Public Information.
</P>
<P>
ICAO's 1998 figure was 2630 billion. It is expected to go up to
2875 billion in 2000 and 3038 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Traffic in Asia/Pacific is expected to grow at the highest rate
among ICAO regions after a decline of 1.5 percent in 1998, said
ICAO, a 45-year-old specialized agency of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Seeing markets for European and Latin America/Caribbean
"reasonably buoyant", ICAO expects a close-to-the-average moderate
growth for the Middle East and Africa, and more moderate growth
for the mature North America airline markets.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Open 3 New Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (RNA) - Three new commercial banks are soon
opening up banking services in Rwandan capital Kigali, bringing
the total number of banks operating in the country to 11, the
Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has a total of seven commercial banks and one
cooperative bank which commands the biggest countryside network of
branches, a Rwandan central bank official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Three groups have already applied for permission to open up
their commercial banks and the processes are in advanced stages,"
said Angelique Kantengwa, chief inspector of banks and other
financial institutions in the Central Bank of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
She said that among the three groups which have sought
permission from the central bank, one of them has fulfilled over
90 percent of the requirements.
</P>
<P>
However, she declined to reveal the new springing banks.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's current laws require a capital base of 285,000 U.S.
dollars for any banking group to qualify for setting up a
commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that opening of the new banks and the growth of
the financial sector will facilitate the utilization of the
investment funding, and will boost economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement of the financial institutions will address
medium and long-term lending problems," Kantengwa noted.
</P>
<P>
The central bank official condemned some local banks which
concentrate more on lending, while not caring about mobilizing
savings which is currently derived from very few clients and are
mainly short-term.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is soon to enact a new law giving powers to the central
bank to decide, depending on the economic indicators, the amount
of capital necessary for setting up a financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The new banks have sprung up when the Rwandan franc has
witnessed a serious depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Rwandan francs against a U.S. dollar stood at
between 285-320 in 1994-1997, whereas in 1998-1999 its value has
been depreciated in the range of 330-365, while on the black
market the dollar was sold at 380 Rwanda francs.

JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang will be in South Africa Saturday to strengthen
business ties and explore new trade and investment opportunities,
the South African Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang will be the highest-level official of the Chinese special
 administrative region to visit South Africa, the ministry said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Tsang, who was invited by South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin, will be accompanied by his wife, 12 business
people from a wide range of industries, and eight senior members
of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the delegation would meet Erwin, other
high-level dignitaries and various business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region regards South
Africa, in its own right, and as the gateway to the much larger
southern sub-Saharan region, as an attractive proposition for Hong
Kong entrepreneurs," Tsang was quoted as saying in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said with the establishment of formal ties between South
Africa and China in 1998, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region could play an even more active role as a "bridge through
which increased trade and investment would flow between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region currently stands at more than one billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Tsang will be in the country until August 5.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Urged to Support Anti-polio Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Wednesday called upon the people to support the national
anti-polio drive.
</P>
<P>
"Polio must be wiped out," the president said in his message to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The anti-polio campaign this year is scheduled to be
implemented in two stages: first one from July 26 to 30 and the
second from August 30 to September 3.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.3 million children under the age of five will be
vaccinated. The drive will cost some 1.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1997, four polio cases
were reported and in 1990, only one was reported as compared to 60
reported cases in 1980.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano noted that the southern African country has
been carrying out its anti-polio drive nationwide since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, children aged five or six will this year be fed with
Vitamin A to strengthen their immunity and eyesight.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has targeted to wipe out the
childhood disease by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the 41st congress of the World Health Organization in May
1988, the Mozambican government promised to root up polio by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Orient House Remains Opened Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials agreed on Wednesday that the Orient House, Palestinian
headquarters in east Jerusalem, will continue to operate
according to the peace accords between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami held talks with Faisal Husseini, chief
Palestinian official over Jerusalem affairs, for two hours at a
hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, both Ben-Ami and Husseini said the
agreement opened a new chapter for the negotiations over Jerusalem
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said that there are still disputes over the Orient
House, but all problems will be resolved by dialogue, not by force.
</P>
<P>
Husseini praised the new Israeli government as "a government
of peace." He noted that the two sides will make efforts to find a
final settlement over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Orient House almost caused violent
clashes between Israeli security forces and the Palestinians two
months ago before Israel's May general elections.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to
close three offices in the Orient House on the grounds that it was
violating a commitment of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
to abstain from political activity in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's accusation and warned
that there would be violent confrontations if Israel closed down
the offices by force.
</P>
<P>
After Ehud Barak, a moderate, won the Israeli prime ministerial
elections, he has pledged to end the Israeli-Arab conflicts by all
efforts. And the atmosphere in the peace process, soiled under the
three-year tenure of hard-line Netanyahu, has been improved.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the Arab-populated east Jerusalem, which
was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital
of a future Palestinian state, but Israel has insisted that
Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing peace accords, the two sides will
reach a settlement over the status Jerusalem in their final status
talks.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Committee Approves Text of Strategic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian ministerial committee on
Wednesday approved the text of a strategic agreement with the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The committee, which includes representatives from eight
ministries, approved the final form of the text of the Egyptian-EU
partnership agreement during a meeting in the day, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Gamal Bayoumi, who is the
chief negotiator for the agreement, said the text "contains big
privileges which were not enjoyed by any other country in the
agricultural and industrial fields."
</P>
<P>
The text "has secured balanced interests for Egypt and EU at
the political, economic and cultural levels," Bayoumi was quoted
by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Egypt's export of agricultural products to
the EU will be increased by 252 percent, particularly potatoes,
oranges, raisins, peanuts and honey, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The draft package will be submitted to the cabinet in August
for approval and then to President Hosni Mubarak for a final say.
The agreement is expected to be signed in months.
</P>
<P>
After almost four years of negotiations, Egypt and the EU
reached the agreement last month. EU foreign ministers endorsed
the draft agreement on June 21.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides for more open trade, coordination in many
economic and financial areas, a political dialog and joint efforts
to combat money laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The accord is viewed to be part of an EU bid for a bigger
economic and political role in the region, where the 15-nation
European organization aims to have a free trade agreement with all
southern and eastern Mediterranean nations by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Egypt's largest trade partner, accounting for 638
million U.S. dollars of Egypt's exports and 3.6 billion dollars of
its imports in the first half of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Congolese Refugees Fleeing Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 refugees have
been forced to flee Congo (Kinshasa) and Congo (Brazzaville) over
the last three weeks by the continued fighting in the two central
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) regional office
said in a press release here Wednesday that half of these new
refugees are from the east and north of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), where the conflict continues despite a peace
agreement signed on July 10 in Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"Political solutions must be found urgently for the crises in
the two Congos," the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugee Sadako
Ogata was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees and the hundreds of thousands of internally
displaced persons in both countries are suffering untold misery in
the absence of political solutions to the fighting in their
homelands," she said.
</P>
<P>
Talks between parties to the conflict in the DRC have slowed
since the July 10 accord was signed, with some rebel leaders
refusing to endorse the cease-fire and continuing their advance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting between government forces and rebels in
neighboring Congo (B) has been unrelenting since December 1998.
This month, the conflict pushed thousands of refugees into Gabon.
</P>
<P>
In Africa's Great Lakes region, the UNHCR has only 3.4 million
U.S. dollars available, which is enough to assist the region's
more than 750,000 refugees for only two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the funding difficulties, the UNHCR has to
establish new camps in Tanzania, Gabon, and the Central African
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"Contributions are not even meeting the needs of long-time
refugees, much less the newest arrivals," Ogata warned.
</P>
<P>
In the east of the DRC, more than 600 refugees a day are
fleeing across Lake Tanganyika aboard small boats to escape
fighting between rebels and local opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Congolese refugees are now crowded into two
refugee sites in western Tanzania and aid workers fear a rise in
tension in the camps.
</P>
<P>
The war in the DRC, the third largest country in the continent,
has also compelled more than 14,000 Congolese to flee into remote
areas of the Central African Republic during the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
More arrivals are expected from the town of Zongo and the UNHCR
is rushing aid to the remote region.

WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton called
Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday to report on his
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and reassured Arafat
that Barak was committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Arafat that he had a "very positive feeling" about
the resumption of the peace process after Barak's visit, White
House spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "conveyed to Chairman Arafat that he believes that
Prime Minister Barak is very serious, is very committed to the
peace process, and I think the president is pleased that this
provides an opportunity for the kind of direct dialogue and moving
forward together that really needs to be a key ingredient of the
way the peace process needs to work," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also reassured Arafat about Arafat's concerns at
Barak's comment that he wanted to reach a comprehensive Middle
East peace in 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has complained he did not want to wait that long to
implement the Wye land-for-security agreement reached last
October, and Barak replied that this was not his intention.
</P>
<P>
"The president said to Chairman Arafat, hey, he (Barak) is
committed to the peace process... He's serious about achieving a
comprehensive Middle East peace agreement," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said Barak planned to have a meeting with Arafat in the

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Petrol containing alcohol
will be introduced in South Africa next Monday, a statement
jointly made by South African petroleum industrial groups said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The blend, containing a maximum of 12 percent alcohol by
volume, would be distributed through the leaded 93-octane petrol
dispensing network in Gauteng province and parts of Mpumalanga,
said the statement made by South Africa's petrochemical giant,
Sasol, the South African Petroleum Industry Association, the
African Minerals and Energy Forum, and the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Sasol confirms that it accepts responsibility for the quality
of the petrol/alcohol blend that it supplies," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Since the news of the alcohol-petrol was first made public, the
 Automobile Association (AA) has expressed reservations about the
product, saying an alcohol-blended petrol additive containing 65
percent ethanol had caused major problems with vehicles a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sasol said extensive tests over the period of 18 months were
conducted in collaboration with all stake holders and on all
ranges of vehicles including imported ones. No problems were
identified.
</P>
<P>
The blended petrol would be sold at the standard price.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Farmers' Average Land Holding Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The average land holding of
Ethiopian farmers had decreased from 1.8 hectares in 1988 to 0.8
hectares in 1998, a government official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bateno Kabeto, senior official of the Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture, told an expert meeting that the level of production
and productivity in the Horn of Africa country is far below to
meet even the minimum food security standard set by the United
Nations, which is 2,100 kilo calorie per day.
</P>
<P>
Bateno attributed the decrease of land holding to land
degradation and over population.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that future increase in food production must
come primarily from higher yields per unit area rather than from
expansion of land.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, with a population of 62 million, is the third most
populous country in Africa next to Nigeria and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> 3 Chinese Killed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- An autopsy performed
Wednesday on three Chinese men found dead in a locked shop in
Senekal, about 300 km south of Johannesburg showed that all three
were shot in the head at close range, police said.
</P>
<P>
Captain Corlea Herholdt said two of the men were also stabbed
in the chest and neck.
</P>
<P>
The victims, whose bodies were found Tuesday, were named as Fa
Mai Ye, in his 50s, of Senekal, believed to be the owner of the
Family Fashions shop where the bodies were found, and Zhong Quang
Yang and Li Jiang who had came to the shop to help Fa before being
killed.
</P>
<P>
Police were called after two people looked through the shop
window and saw a body on the floor. There were no signs of forced
entry and the shop was locked when police arrived.
</P>
<P>
Herholdt said the motive for the killing appeared to have been
robbery as clothing and blankets were missing from the store.
</P>
<P>
Donald Wong, Chairman of the Chinese Association, said: "These
people are investing in the country to help the people of South
Africa."
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them are already contemplating leaving because of the
crime. It is not only the Chinese community that is affected, but
all members of South African society. The community and government
must work together to help police to curb crime," Wong said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Count-down Free Trade Area Set for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is launching various count-down
activities among its member states towards a free trade area
scheduled for October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jerome Ntibarekerwa, Director of Infrastructure Development of
the COMESA, told Xinhua in Lusaka Wednesday that the special
committee of ministers, which is comprising Kenya, Mauritius,
Zambia, Uganda, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), has agreed on a number of activities
which should be implemented as the count-down to the free trade
area.
</P>
<P>
These activities include: publication of COMESA Tariffs by
member states; organization of a COMESA Trade Fair during the
extraordinary summit in October 2000; governments to encourage
trade missions to partner member states from July 1999 and beyond;
public lectures at universities on the free trade area, investment
and trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Jerome noted that since the first meeting of the officials on
the count- down on the COMESA free trade area, which was held in
Lusaka on June 24, the member states have intensified their
efforts to eliminate non- tariff barriers and other obstacles to
trade.
</P>
<P>
Most member states have made good progress in removal of tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, four countries had published the
90 percent tariff reduction, six countries 80 percent, one country
70 percent and three countries 60 percent, Jerome said.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of the count-down was to publicize the
COMESA as widely as possible so as to ensure that the regional
free trade area would be launched on the due date and to enable
the business community to take advantage of the opportunities
presented by the free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jerome said that member states also committed
themselves to cooperate in the promotion of peace, security and
stability and to this end, the Special Committee of Ministers
attended the peace talks on the Democratic Republic of Congo held
earlier in Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Signing of E. African Community Treaty Might be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The signing of a treaty for
the establishment of the East African Community might be postponed
for weeks, government sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although no official announcements have been made to change the
set date for the signing of the document by the presidents of
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the sources said experts from the
three countries are still holding consultations on a number of
standing issues, including trade tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The East African Community, aims to create a common market
between the three countries, to be followed by monetary union and
ultimately a political federation. The signing of the treaty was
originally set on July 30.
</P>
<P>
The community is to be formed on the basis of the current East
African Cooperation (EAC), which was set up by the three countries
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The highest decision making body of the East African
Cooperation, the Permanent Tripartite Commission, will converge
Friday in north Tanzania's Arusha town in an extraordinary meeting
to decide the date for the signing of the East African Community
treaty, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
According to EAC officials, the commission, made up of
ministers who are responsible for cooperation-related sectors,
will review the revised version of the draft treaty completed by
experts last week.
</P>
<P>
Before the three presidents put their signatures to the
document, the attorneys general of the partner states, are lined
up to give legal consideration to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of the EAC, Francis Muthaura, said the
signing of the treaty depends on how fast the commission would
take to make suggestions on the revisited text.
</P>
<P>
"But it will be just a matter of time, a few days or weeks,
before the signing," he told reporters in Arusha Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Uganda have expressed concern that the quick
reduction of a zero internal tariff and a common market tariff
would lead to a flood of products into their markets from Kenya,
which dominates trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
The former East African Community collapsed in 1977 because of
political and economic divergences.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada is to exempt visa for
visitors from The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Canadian Ambassador
Stuart Modowall said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations for such an agreement is in an advanced stage
and could be finalized soon," the Canadian Ambassador told the the
UAE's official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who is due to complete his tenure in the UAE
soon, said that the accord, when signed, will enable all UAE
nationals to travel to Canada without a visa, and they can stay in
Canada for a maximum of up to six months on each visit.
</P>
<P>
In return, Canadian citizens will be able to obtain entry visas
to travel to the UAE, with a validity of up to ten years and a
maximum stay of three months during each visit.
</P>
<P>
The UAE will be the second country in the Gulf and one of the
few countries worldwide to have such an accord with Canada, the
envoy said. Canada already has a mutual visa exemption agreement
with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Modowall said that all efforts were being made to encourage
more travel by citizens of both countries. The growth in trade and
economic relations also indicates the potential for increased
movement between the two countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti, Sudanese Ties to be Normalized: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
hinted on Wednesday that Kuwait and Sudan will soon resume their
bilateral ties damaged by Khartoum's sympathy with Iraq during
the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Minister will arrive here next Monday to
"hoist his country's flag on the Embassy" building, First Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah told
reporters after attending a session of the Parliament's Foreign
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sabah said bilateral relations between the two countries will
be back to normal "in favor of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Sudan will be the last so-called adversary state to restore
ties with Kuwait since the Gulf war triggered by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since early March this year, foreign ministers of Jordan and
Yemen, also considered to be sympathized with Baghdad, had visited
Kuwait, bringing back to normal their damaged ties.
</P>
<P>
On Kuwait's relations with these countries, Sabah said there
was almost full agreement that "there is no permanent friend or
permanent enemy at the foreign policy level."
</P>
<P>
Expressing his own perspective, he said relations with these
states should be restored, particularly Jordan, irrespective of
the Jordanian government's stance during the Iraq aggression of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is still premature to embark on a tour to the
"adversary" states only if these visits serve the Kuwaiti causes.

ADDIS ABABA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front Wednesday called on the people of
the whole country to remain committed to national defense efforts.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party said in a statement that Ethiopia accepts the
framework agreement put forward by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the modalities for the implementation of the
agreement because they are consistent with the party's principle.
</P>
<P>
The OAU framework agreement on the settlement of the conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean
troops from all occupied Ethiopian territories.
</P>
<P>
The 35th OAU Summit convened in Algiers from July 12 to 14,
1999 also endorsed modalities from the implementation of the OAU
framework.
</P>
<P>
The modalities call for the return to the status quo ante that
had prevailed until May 6, 1998, which witnessed the breakout of
the Ethio- Eritrean war.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian defense forces should preserve their resolve to
defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Council of Ethiopian Ministers also pledged to
implement the OAU framework agreement and to continue seeking a
peaceful resolution to its dispute with Eritrea.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar here on Wednesday urged
Israel to immediately carry out the Wye River Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint conference with Aznar, who was here on a
one-day visit to the Palestinian self-rule area, Arafat also
called on the United States, Europe and the international
community to exert efforts to help revive the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that Israel should immediately and faithfully
carry out all agreements between the two sides, particularly the
United States-brokered interim Wye agreement, which stipulates
that Israel should withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
three phases.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Aznar also stressed the need for Israel to
implement all agreements, signed in the spirit of the
land-for-peace principle and the United Nations 242, 338
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Aznar repledged his support for the Palestinian people's
legitimate right to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders noted that it would not benefit the peace process
to wrap the interim accords into final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has suggested to combine the
Wye accord, which was frozen by former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu after finishing the first stage of pull-out,
into the final status talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has rejected such proposals.

Aznar, who is on a five-day Mideast tour which had already
brought him to Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, will arrive in Tel Aviv
on Thursday to meet Barak.

<HEADLINE> General Motors to Recall 3.5 Million Vehicles for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- General Motors (GM), the
country's largest automobile manufacturer, has agreed to recall
some 3.5 million vehicles to conclude a five-year government
investigation into problems with anti-lock brakes, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government agency said it launched the probe after
receiving reports of performance problems on an array of GM
vehicles manufactured in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the agency has on file 10,861 reports of brake
problems on General Motors S and T trucks, which included reports
of 2,111 crashes and 293 injuries. The agency has also received
but not confirmed 2,400 reports of brake problems in Chevrolet
Suburbans equipped with anti-lock brakes. In both cases, the units
were built by Kelsey-Hayes.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles under investigation include the 1991-97 Chevrolet
Blazer, GMC Jimmy and the Oldsmobile Bravada sport utility
vehicles; the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma, Cyclone and Typhoon
pickup trucks; and the 1992-95 Chevrolet and GMC Suburban sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In the complaints, some customers said they were attempting to
stop at a stop sign or light when the anti-lock brake system
failed to respond or locked up, and their vehicle went through the
intersection. Others said they crashed into the rear of the
vehicle in front of them.
</P>
<P>
Warranty records show at least 6 percent of the vehicles'
brakes were taken in for repair or replacement.
</P>
<P>
According to safety administration documents, General Motors
will attempt to rectify the problems with a safety recall of 1.1
million 1991-1996 Chevrolet and GMC four-wheel-drive sport utility
vehicles and pickups equipped with "EBC4" brake units.
</P>
<P>
GM also plans to conduct a service recall of certain 1993-1996
light trucks equipped with the EBC4 unit. The automaker plans, at
no charge, to modify a computer program governing the units on 1.4
million S and T light trucks and over 1 million 1992-1995
Chevrolet Astro Vans and GMC Safari Vans, and 1993-1996 G-vans.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between the United
States and Vietnam on establishing normal trade relations have
made significant progress, the State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have made significant progress in narrowing the number of
outstanding issues, but there are some issues that do remain,"
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We do hope that these discussions will be sufficient to enable
us to conclude an agreement and will achieve the objectives," he

The agreement the United States is seeking is to require
Vietnam to make commitments on market access for goods and
services, intellectual property and investment.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the agreement once concluded would pave the way for
normalizing trade relations between the two countries. It also
would expedite Vietnam's entry into the World Trade Organization.

substantially narrowed their differences in an eighth round of

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Calls on SPD Party Members to Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on Wednesday sent a personal letter to the 800,000 members of his
Social Democratic Party (SPD), seeking their support on his
austerity reform.
</P>
<P>
The SPD members should "more offensively" advocate cabinet's
austerity policy, at work and at neighborhood, said the letter
publicized by the party's headquarters in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Germans have "no alternative" to a sharp cut on their state
spending, or there won't be any job creation, it continued.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Schroeder said he had taken over a highest state
debt of 1500 billion marks, a highest jobless rate, and a highest
tax rate from his predecessor, Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
And today, Germans must pay one fourth of every mark they have
earned for interest of the debt, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, German Finance Minister Hans Weichel put forward a
major fiscal reform package, aiming to lower government's budget
by 1.5 per cent in year 2000 and more drastically cut corporate
tax rate.
</P>
<P>
Respective sparing will be made in jobless relief, public
healthy insurance, pension and other social welfares under the
pro-business package.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan, though backed by Schroeder and business
leaders, was widely hit by the left-wingers in the SPD. They said
Schroeder, who is also chairman of the party, had betrayed SPD's
traditional line of "social state".

<HEADLINE> No Insurgents Against Burundi Trained in Tanzania: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Kagera Region
in northwest Tanzania has strongly refuted allegations that
insurgents were trained in the region to launch attacks against
the Burundian government.
</P>
<P>
Kagera Regional Commissioner Mohamed Babu said in Bukoba,
capital of Kagera, Wednesday that allegations made by the
Burundian government were baseless and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Babu made it clear that Tanzania has abided by the
international law which does not allow refugees to engage in
political activities, reports from Kagera said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has taken measures against hundreds of
illegal refugees in Kagera, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 96,000 Burundian refugees living in
camps in the Ngara district of the region.
</P>
<P>
Recently, authorities in the region arrested over 200 Burundian
refugees who had escaped from Lukole, a camp in Ngara and were
later prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, seven men who were dressed like soldiers of
Rwandan Patriotic Front were arrested near the Rwanda border and
appropriate steps have been taken against them, Babu said.
</P>
<P>
He said all border districts of Burundi near the Tanzania side
have been peaceful except those bordering the Democratic Republic
of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya was recently quoted by press
reports as saying that Burundi insurgents were under training in
Tanzania's border regions of Kagera and Kigoma, before launching
attacks against his government forces.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Hit By Heavy Sell-Off On Wall St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets closed
firmly in the red Wednesday owing to the previous session's heavy
sell-off on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1 percent to finish at 6,239.8, a
drop of 62 points, with oil stocks contributing a large part of
the fall as the price of crude came under pressure for the second
day running.
</P>
<P>
Shares in BP Amoco, the UK's biggest company, ended down 41
pence, or 3.3 percent, at 1,190, while rival Shell was down 15.75
pence, or 3 percent, at 504 pence.
</P>
<P>
Provisional volume in London was again thin, with a shade under
1 billion shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax endured the worst of the selling to end
down 1.4 percent, or 77 points, at 5,414.17.
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks led the way lower, although a strengthening euro
also unnerved investors worried that it could slow the
export-driven economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
France's CAC 40 suffered a 1 percent drop to close at 4,501.27,
a fall of 47 points, in a very quiet session. The start of the
European holiday season is partly to blame.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Speaker Steps Aside Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of Representatives
remained in confusion Wednesday over allegations of age and
certificate forgeries against Speaker Ibrahim Buhari.
</P>
<P>
The speaker has decided to step aside to allow for full
investigations into the allegations made by The News magazine on
July 11.
</P>
<P>
But his apparent supporters prevented the house from debating a
motion on the allegation, forcing his deputy Chibudom Nwuche to
adjourn Wednesday session.
</P>
<P>
At the resumed session Wednesday, Nwuche read a letter from
Buhari restating his decision to step down as speaker so that the
house could debate the motion on the forgery allegation against
him.
</P>
<P>
The working committee of the ruling People's Democratic Party
(PDP), to which Speaker Buhari belongs, has asked him to stand
aside to allow for a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigeria's Senate, the Upper House of the 469-member
National Assembly, has referred the Buhari case to its committees
on ethnics, judiciary, security and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Buhari say that the speaker is innocent until
proved guilty, and the issue should be allowed to go through the
courts.
</P>
<P>
The magazine alleged that Speaker Buhari lied about his age and
 qualifications in order to secure his position, which ranks
fourth in Nigeria's constitutional hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that he was only 29 year old but he claimed
to be 36 so as be qualified for the speaker's post which is
demanded by the country' s constitution.

<HEADLINE> West African Peace-keeping Force Gets New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Brig. Gen. Gabriel Kpemba
has been appointed as the new commander of the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone, a report reaching here
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The former directorate of operations at the Nigerian Army
Headquarters replaces Maj. Gen. Felix Mujakpero who has been
ECOMOG commander for six months.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the defense headquarters in Lagos,
the change in ECOMOG command is part of a major re-deployment of
some 191 top military officers.
</P>
<P>
Mujakpero is to head the directorate of training and doctrine
command of the Nigerian army.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Nigeria will begin to withdraw
its troops from Sierra Leone from August 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Information Minister Dapo Sarumi was quoted as saying
that a date for the withdrawal from the Nigerian-dominated force,
which had backed Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah
against his former rebel foes, was set during Wednesday's cabinet
meeting presided over by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which has the largest contingent in the 10,000-strong
regional force, announced it would begin a phased withdrawal of
its troops from the war-ravaged west African country after the
Sierra Leone government and rebels signed a peace agreement
earlier this month to end over eight years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
With the peace deal, Nigeria also said its mandate had changed
from defending Kabbah's government to disarmament and
rehabilitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife and sister-in-law have been located off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the United States,
days after Kennedy's plane crashed, government officials announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A dive was under way late Wednesday afternoon to recover the
bodies, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast
Guard said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say exactly where the bodies were found,
except that they were at the "wreckage site of a large portion of
the fuselage."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the wreckage of Kennedy's plane was located
in the waters off Martha's Vineyard with Kennedy's body still
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Following the retrieval of the bodies, divers were to focus on
the recovery of the main fuselage of Kennedy's plane, which
crashed on the night of July 16.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his 33-year-old
wife, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34, on a flight to Martha's
Vineyard from New Jersey State. After dropping Lauren Bessette off,
Kennedy and his wife were to continue to Hyannis Port to attend
the wedding of his cousin.
</P>
<P>
Several experienced pilots have said the hazy skies and
darkness were challenging even for them. Kennedy obtained his
pilot's license in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> New Refugees Pour Across Central African Borders: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 people
have been forced to flee the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) and Congo-Brazzaville over the past three weeks, the United
Nations reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Half of these new refugees have fled fighting in the east and
north of the DRC where the conflict continues despite a peace
agreement signed in Lusaka, Zambia, on July 10, a U.N. spokesman
quoted the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as saying.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner Sadako Ogata said political solutions must be
found urgently for the crises in the area, warning that
contributions to help refugees in the Great Lakes are "not even
meeting the needs of long-time refugees, much less than new
arrivals".
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, talks between parties to the conflict in
the DRC have slowed since the July 10 accord, with some rebel
leaders refusing to endorse the cease-fire deal and continuing
their advance.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fighting between government forces and rebels
in neighboring Congo-Brazzaville has been unrelenting since
December 1998, with thousands of refugees fleeing into another
neighboring country, Gabon.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Condemns Turkish Fighters' Unfriendly Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou late Wednesday condemned the harassment of Greek
Transport Minister Tassos Mantelis' plane and the violation of
Athens Flight Information Region (FIR) by Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Papandreou said that he condemned this
action, which did not aid the de-escalation of tension in the
relations between Greece and Turkey, at a time when the Turkish
government had officially expressed its will for an improvement of
the climate in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The minister had ordered Greece's ambassador to Ankara to
protest strongly to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish F-16 fighter jets had reportedly infringed Athens
FIR rules and harassed the aircraft carrying Mantelis back from
Cyprus to Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas Wednesday also
criticized the Turkish planes' actions, saying that this behavior
was not only military provocation, but a classic political act
with a negative message for the attempted normalization of
relations between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained over
decades for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, senior officials from the foreign ministries of
Greece and Turkey will meet in Ankara to discuss economic and
cultural cooperation between the two countries in order to improve
the strained relations.

<HEADLINE> Voter Registration In East Timor Moves Peacefully: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Voter registration for the
popular consultation in East Timor has proceeded peacefully, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There have been no further incidents in which staff or property
of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNMET) have been
attacked or seriously threatened in the first few days of
registration, he said in his latest report on UNAMET.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET was set up according to an agreement between Indonesia
and Portugal. It has the mandate to organize and conduct a vote to
determine the future of the disputed territory between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, situated north of Australia, was a Portuguese
colony until 1975 when a civil rift led Indonesia to occupy and
annex it in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Since then the United Nations has been seeking a solution to
the issue while regarding it as a non-self-governing territory.
</P>
<P>
The voting date was set for late August, with voter
registration starting on July 16. Those aged above 17 among the
territory's 800,000 inhabitants are eligible to choose wide-range
autonomy within Indonesia or independence of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Indonesian authorities have made serious efforts
to provide the necessary security conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said a large number of East Timorese are internally
displaced and UNAMET is developing plans to help them take part
in the voting process.

<HEADLINE> Former New Zealand PM Gets WTO's Job in Compromise Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Former New Zealand prime
minister Mike Moore is expected to become the next
director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Thursday
night (New Zealand time) when the organization officially endorses
the appointment.
</P>
<P>
Moore and Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi had
been locked in a battle for the coveted position, with neither
prepared to give up.
</P>
<P>
After months of bitter wrangling, an informal meeting of the
WTO's ruling general council has agreed to a compromise under
which the two candidates will split the six-year term with Moore
serving the first three years from September 1 and Supachai taking
over the post for the remaining three years.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1949, Moore joined the New Zealand Labor Party when he
was 17 years old. He entered the Parliament first as Labor MP in
1972. Since then he has been serving in the Parliament with only a
three-year interruption. In Labor governments, Moore held a range
of offices including minister of Overseas Trade and Marketing,
minister of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, minister in charge of
Publicity, and minister of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was once the prime minister for less than two months in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Moore had been a worker before he began his political life. He
advocates free trade and is the author of a number of
publications.
</P>
<P>
He is married to Yvonne and they have no children.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Pact Produces No Tangible Progress: IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army said
Wednesday that Northern Ireland's 15-month-old Good Friday peace
accord had not delivered tangible progress and it blamed the
British government for the province's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to An Phoblact, weekly organ of the IRA's Sinn
Fein political wing, the IRA said current demands for guerrilla
disarmament reflected "the failed agenda which seeks the defeat of
the IRA."
</P>
<P>
"The British government have the power to change that
(political) context and should do so," the IRA was quoted by a
Reuters report filed from Belfast as saying.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group said that over the past five years it had
maintained two lengthy cease-fires to "enhance the peace process
and underline our definitive commitment to its success."
</P>
<P>
The statement was the first by the IRA since the 1998 Good
Friday peace deal, signed by Sinn Fein and pro-British Unionist
politicians, was hit by a crisis last week.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant Unionists rejected plans to set up a coalition
provincial government in the British province before the IRA
disarmed. In recent weeks politicians in Britain and the Irish
Republic have urged the IRA to make a statement committing itself
to disarmament and to declare that its war against British rule in
the province was over.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hopes Ivanov Visit to Mend Ties After Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain hopes a visit to London by
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will mend a rift between the
two countries over NATO's military campaign in Kosovo, British
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who canceled an earlier visit in May after NATO bombs
struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, arrived London Wednesday
and was scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Britain hoped the end of the Kosovo conflict and
the presence of Russian forces alongside NATO peacekeepers in the
Serbian province could mark an end to the tensions which flared
during the crisis, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to move beyond Russia always being an opponent on the
other side of the chess board.... We're making a very serious
effort to signal our wish for dialogue and good relations," the
report quoted a British Foreign Office source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia's relations with NATO were heavily strained during the
Kosovo conflict. Russia was strongly against NATO's bombing
campaign and canceled all its ties with the military alliance
after the air strikes began. Russia later sent troops into the
Kosovo capital Pristina ahead of NATO, a move that surprised and
exasperated the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says Time Right For Israel to Make Peace with Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said here Wednesday that the time was right for his country to
achieve peace with all its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Barak, speaking after holding talks with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, said he had appreciated the "positive signs" from
Syria since he took office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"I do highly appreciate the positive signals that are reaching
us and the external world from Syria," Barak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think the time is right for achieving a peace of the brave
between Israel and all its neighbors including Syria.... Time is
of the essence for the whole process. We cannot sit idly and wait
for the whole process to be solved somehow," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his hopes of major progress towards a comprehensive
Middle East peace within 15 months, he said it should not be too
rigid a time frame.
</P>
<P>
"I won't ask for a medal if it takes nine months, but nor will
I jump from a tower if it takes 24," said the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak told Blair that Britain and its partners in the
European Union could play a key role in reviving the peace process
in the Middle East, both politically and financially.
</P>
<P>
The role of Europe, with Great Britain as a central player,
would create an atmosphere of support for peace efforts, both
politically and financially, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also outlined his peace plans to Blair during a stop-off
in London on his way home following a six-day trip to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Urged to Sign Modalities Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council Wednesday urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to formally sign the
modalities put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
for the implementation of a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both Horn of Africa countries, which have been at war over
disputed frontier territories since May 6, 1998, said they have
accepted the terms of the OAU framework on the settlement of their
border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The modalities, adopted by a three-day OAU summit which ended
Last Wednesday in Algiers, provide that Eritrea commit itself to
redeploy its forces outside the territories they occupied after
May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
While Ethiopia is obliged to commit itself to redeploy its
forces from positions taken after February 6, 1999 and which were
not under Ethiopian administration before May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said its members welcomed the initial
positive responses by both parties to the modalities.
</P>
<P>
The council made the statement after hearing a briefing by
Mohamed Sahnoun, special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Council members commended the efforts of concerned
international organizations, countries and individuals "to secure
this agreement and expressed their hope that this proves to be an
important step towards the resolution of this devastating
conflict," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed their readiness to support
the OAU in the implementation of the framework agreement once the
modalities have been signed," it added.

ULAN BATOR, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's Great Hural, or
parliament, voted 41-22 Thursday to dismiss the government of
Prime Minister Janlaviin Narantsatsralt after two days of debate.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural also decided that acting Minister of External
Relations Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa will act as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The out-going prime minister was pressed to step down after his
private mail to the former First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia,
Yuri Maslyukov, was made public by the parliamentary group of the
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) one week ago.
</P>
<P>
In that mail, Narantsatsralt reportedly leaked crucial
information about the Erdenet Copper and Molybdenum Mine, a very
important joint venture between Mongolia and Russia, to his
Russian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The bill to dismiss the government was initiated by 21
lawmakers from the ruling Mongolian Social Democratic Party and
the opposition MPRP who accused Narantsatsralt of bringing
substantial damage to the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Narantsatsralt was appointed Prime Minister on December 9 last
year.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sensitive index passed 4700 mark
Thursday on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) following fresh buying
from speculators and sustained purchases by Foreign Institutional
Investors (FIIs).
</P>
<P>
Besides continuous FIIs support, the spurt in activity was also

central bank of the country, was likely to cut interest rates by
half a percent.

The BSE sensitive index opened fractionally down at 4656.00 but
later witnessed a rally reflecting the firm trend and closed at
the day's high of 4728.78 as against Wednesday's close of 4659.59.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index rose by 18.28 points to 2047.15 from the
previous close of 2018.87.
</P>
<P>
Dealers anticipated the present rally to continue further till
the Sensex reached the 4868-level which is considered to be the
resistance level.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the Dollex were quoted remarkably up at 467.79
and 180.03 compared with the previous close of 462.22 and 178.66

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Predicting 16 percent reduction
in this year's cereal production in Afghanistan, a recent U.N.
survey said the war-ravaged country is expected to import more
cereals, said U.N. sources here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food
Program of the United Nations conducted a joint Crop and Food
Supply Assessment to Afghanistan in June this year to estimate the
1999 cereal harvest and subsequent cereal import requirements for
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
Results of the assessment indicate that total cereal production
for 1999 will be about 16 percent below that of last year, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan needs to import at least 1.1 million tons of
cereals to meet the food requirements for the year 1999-2000, but
there is expected to be a shortfall of over 200,000 tons,
according the assessment report.

<HEADLINE> Commission in Favor of Britain's Partial Schengen Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
its favorable opinion Thursday on the British request to partially
participate in the Schengen treaty.
</P>
<P>
The executive body of the 15-nation bloc said that the partial
participation related to police and judicial cooperation in
criminal matters, to narcotic drugs and to the Schengen
Information System.
</P>
<P>
The commission believed that the proposed cooperation should in
due course be extended to the aspects of freedom of movement
covered by the Schengen Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen Convention provides for the abolition of checks on
individuals at internal frontiers, plus accompanying measures to
guarantee the security of the citizens of signatory states of the
European Union, including checks at external frontiers, visas,
freedom of movement for third-country citizens, measures to combat
illegal immigration, drugs, and an information exchange system.
</P>
<P>
The convention was signed on June 19, 1990, by France, Germany,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. All EU member states
except for Britain and Ireland have since signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen treaty was incorporated into the framework of the
EU with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam on May 1
this year.

<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor and Social
Security said here today that it has promulgated three new
documents to enhance the supervision of medical services and
effective management of the country's medical insurance funds.
</P>

<P>
The documents followed three others issued by the government in

management and the scope of medicines for the basic medical
insurance package.

<HEADLINE> German Carrier Fined for Code of Conduct Infringement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it had fined the German airline Lufthansa 10,000
euro (9,524 U.S. dollars) for infringing the European Code of
Conduct for Computer Reservation System.
</P>
<P>
The German carrier was fined for its discriminatory practice of
linking the use of a specific computer reservation system with
incentives that are in contravention to the code.
</P>
<P>
The Computer Reservation System is one that enables travel
agents to book airline tickets. The system contains information
about airline schedules, availability, fares and related services.
</P>
<P>
Most large airlines including Lufthansa have a shareholding in
one of the main Computer Reservation Systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Lufthansa introduced incentives linked to the issue of
electronic Lufthansa tickets in Germany and START AMADEUS was the
only Computer Reservation System at the time able to issue
electronic tickets, the incentives therefore could only be earned
by those using the services of the company.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that despite requests, Lufthansa had been
very slow in making its electronic ticketing service available to
other Computer Reservation Systems.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Refute Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences (CASS) stressed here today that Lee Teng-hui's
plot to separate Taiwan from China and split China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The scholars said at a forum that Lee has taken a very
dangerous step by stating that cross-straits relations are "state-
to-state", which exposes his true intention of denying the "one
China" principle.
</P>
<P>
They said that Lee's splittist remarks have seriously distorted
historical facts, and are absurdly groundless.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Weidong, a research fellow at the Institute of Taiwan
Studies of CASS, noted that the People's Republic of China has
long been accepted and recognized by the international community
as the sole legal government of China, and naturally has the legal
right to exert sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yu Heping, a research fellow at the Institute of Modern Chinese
History, said that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and
this has been firmly rooted in the minds of the Chinese people
since the very beginning of Chinese history. The ownership of the
island province has long been beyond dispute, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The scholars present at the forum held that Lee has misjudged
the international situation. His evil intention of splitting the
motherland by relying on foreign forces is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
They said that Lee's splittist remarks have been strongly
criticized and condemned by the entire Chinese people. The
international community has widely reaffirmed the "one China"
principle.
</P>
<P>
Lee and his followers will become sinners against the Chinese
nation if they do not stop at the brink of the precipice and
immediately return to the "one China" principle, the scholars said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Suffering Serious Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics show that
soil erosion is becoming increasingly serious in east China's
Zhejiang Province, with more than 17 percent of the province's
land being affected.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youyu, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress, said today that a total
area of 19,000 sq km is eroded.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province is facing tough challenges from
increasing soil erosion damage, and urged that more attention be
paid to water and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that local leaders be evaluated and promoted
only if they have done a good job of water and soil control.
</P>
<P>
He explained that soil erosion is also one of the factors that
cause local landslides.
</P>
<P>
Last year, local landslides claimed 62 lives in the Lishui area
in the south Zhejiang, he said.

WEASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Free-agnet guard Penny
Hardaway met with Los Angeles Lakers executive Jerry West recently,
fueling speculation the unrestricted free-agnet guard might be
reunited with former teammate Shaquile O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times and Orlando Sentinel reported the team
has considered adding Hardaway, possible through a sign-and-trade
deal with the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
Lakers spokesman John Black confirmed Wednesday that West met
with Hardaway last week, but he wouldn't comment on what was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
"We won't comment on any potential trades or free-agnet
signings as per club policy.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are over the salary cap, meaning the only way they
could pay Hardaway anything close to market value would be with a
sign-and-trade deal with the Magic.
</P>
<P>
One name mentioned as a possibility in that scenario is Glen
Rice. The Lakers recently picked up their $7 million option on
Rice for next season.

<HEADLINE> Spanish PM Delivers Message From Assad to Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar delivered a message from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday on the resumption
of Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Aznar declined to reveal the details of the message but he told
reporters after his meeting with Barak that he is optimistic about
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office said Aznar briefed Barak on
his recent talks with Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Palestinian
leaders during his five-day Middle East tour. Israel is the last
stop of his trip.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Barak outlined his ideas for advancing the
stalled peace process, both on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Barak noted that good intentions by both parties, cooperation,
and discussions on issues as partners will enable a breakthrough
in solving the century-old conflict in the Middle East," it said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel's Army
Radio that Aznar told him that Assad does not want to waste an
opportunity to make peace with Israel's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ousting hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu in the prime ministerial
election in May, Barak has pledged to push forward the peace
process with Syria as well as the Palestinians, which was largely
frozen in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
He promised to resume the peace talks with Damascus under the
framework of United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338, which call
for Israel to relinquish Arab land it occupied in the 1967 Middle
East war, including the strategic plateau of Golan Heights of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Since his election victory, Barak has traded compliments and
trust-building signals with Assad, the former arch-foe in the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Damascus has asked radical
Palestinian groups based in Syria to stop armed struggle against
Israel. Barak welcomed the reports.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army chief admitted Wednesday that Syria is also
taking action to restrain Hezbollah guerrillas, who are fighting
to oust Israel from its occupation zone in southern Lebanon, from
firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, Barak briefed his Spanish counterpart
on his proposal to combine the implementation of the Wye River
Memorandum with the final status talks "in a way that would
increase the chances of reaching the permanent settlement with the
Palestinians and strengthen security," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has rejected Barak's
proposal, calling for the immediate implementation of the interim
agreement, which was signed and then frozen by Netanyahu last
year.

<HEADLINE> Taxation Agencies Told to Sever Links With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's State Taxation
Administration (STA) has ordered all taxation agencies to sever
their links with government taxation offices, as a measure to wipe
out corruption in the taxation field.
</P>
<P>
The STA said today that taxation agencies set up by or
affiliated to taxation bureaus must cut themselves away from the
latter, by establishing their own independent personnel and
financial systems, and functions.
</P>
<P>
They are also not allowed to contain in their names any word
that might lead people to believe that they have any official
affiliation with state bureaus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, illegal taxation agencies must be suppressed.
</P>
<P>
The order is intended to halt some agencies soliciting business
in the name of the government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the STA ordered all taxation agencies who have
offices or desks inside the buildings of taxation bureaus to move
out.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elliott Needs a Kidney Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Forward Sean Elliott of the NBA
champion San Antonio Spurs needs a kidney transplant because of
worsening renal function. But Elliott said he plans to continue
his basketball career.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather go out the way I want to go out," Elliott said
Wednesday. "I think every athlete feels that way. I feel like I am
going to play again." Elliott, 31, added that he is not in pain.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they don't know a precedent for a pro athlete
returning to competition after such an operation and added it
could be three months after the transplant before they would know
about resuming his career.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a great career, and if that's the end of it, so be it.
But I don't really think that's the end of it," Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
The illness affects both his kidneys. The healthy donor kidney
would be placed in Elliott's body along with the two
malfunctioning kidneys, his doctor said. Elliott must have the
transplant to avoid dialysis treatment.
</P>
<P>
Elliott learned of his deteriorating condition with about a
month left in the regular season. He told only teammate Steve Kerr,
who was a college teammate at Arizona, and team management of his
plight.
</P>
<P>
"It's a real difficult situation personally for all of us who
have known each other for a long time," Spurs general manager and
coach Gregg Popovich said. "When you think of it in those terms,
basketball doesn't matter much."
</P>
<P>
Family members underwent blood screening this week to see if
they qualify as kidney donors. If there is no family match,
Elliott will be placed on a transplant waiting list.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 62,000 Americans are awaiting a heart, lung, liver,
kidney or pancreas. Last year, 4,000 people died before they could
get the organ they needed.

BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
made a profit of 220 million yuan during the first half of this
year, despite sliding prices at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The sector completed an output value of 99.4 billion yuan
during the half year, up 10.3 percent over the same period of last
year, according to a national meeting on the sector's development
held here today.
</P>
<P>
The industry had a sales revenue of 138.8 billion yuan, down 1.
69 percent on an annual basis, said Pu Haiqing, director of the
State Bureau of the Metallurgical Industry, at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The bureau plans to cut its steel output by ten percent and
earn a profit of five billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months, prices for major steel products
dropped by 220 yuan per ton from the same period of last year. The
prices are now 50 yuan down from what they were at the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that the output reduction has not achieved the original
planned target, but big companies like the Shougang Group and
Shanghai Baoshan steel group have set examples in cutting down
production.
</P>
<P>
The two companies shrank their production during the six-month
period by 9.61 percent and 7.87 percent, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said Thursday the country's high priority is that
while developing close bilateral relations with its neighbors, it
would continue to adhere to the policy of non-interference in
internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in his address on "Malaysia's
Foreign Policy" at a forum on strategic issues organized by the
Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute here.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid was of the view that globalization and information
technology would impact strongly on Malaysia's foreign policy in
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would continue to push for the strengthening of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as a regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that despite criticisms made against ASEAN,
it's clear that cooperation within ASEAN is now firmly entrenched
and ASEAN is not about to lose its dynamism, viability and
relevance with the inclusion of new member states.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Malaysia and Singapore, he said both
countries should move out of the old mould and mature into what
their ties ought to be -- interdependent, proximate and mutually
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between Malaysia and Singapore should be
premised on a "win-win formula" endorsed by their citizens.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Syed Hamid reiterated Malaysia's "one-China
policy."
</P>
<P>
On the relations with the West, he said there was no
contradiction between Malaysia's justifiable criticisms of the
West on certain issues and its continued acceptance of Western
countries as a market for the country's products and as a source
of investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that while continuing pursuing relations with
traditional economic partners such as Japan, the European Union,
Australia, South Korea as well as other countries, Malaysia would
only consider beginning relations with Israel upon successful
conclusion of a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and
Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Money Growth Increases Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
Thursday said high levels of money growth remain a major threat to
efforts to bring down inflation to levels consistent with
macro-economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its weekly economic highlights for July 16
that the current high levels of money supply growth were
inconsistent with the economy's growth and inflation objectives.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, money supply growth year-on-year
remained high during the first half of 1999, rising from 17
percent in January to 29.3 percent in March and 51.8 percent by
May.
</P>
<P>
"Price stability remains the main task and priority of monetary
policy. The major challenge facing the economy is the all time
high level of inflation, currently at 55.2 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This requires the Reserve Bank to persist with a relatively
restrictive monetary policy in order to bring down inflation,
restore external viability and provide a sustainable basis for a
rebound in economic growth in an environment of low interest
rates," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the high level of monetary growth in May required
it to maintain a tight monetary policy stance if inflation was to
be brought under control.
</P>
<P>
"High production costs across all sectors, including wage
adjustments have tended to generate a self propelling cost-push
inflation spiral," the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
To compliment its tight monetary policy, other measures to
resolve supply constraints would need to be implemented, it said.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Active Fiscal Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China may continue an active
fiscal policy in the next few years, Chinese economists predicted
today.
</P>
<P>
Mi Jianguo, director of the Macro-Economic Research Department
of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said that
an active policy based on increasing public debt and deficits will
be the top choice for the government to stimulate economic growth
over a relatively long period of time.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since effective demand is quite inadequate at
present, and private investment and consumption cannot be
kickstarted over the next one or two years, the Chinese government
has very few macro-economic policy choices.
</P>
<P>
"We should review the idea that fiscal policies are short-term
ones and cannot be used over a long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng announced at a national
meeting on finance work held here today that China will adopt a
series of "powerful macro-economic policies" in the second half of
the year, including greatly increasing the issuance of treasury
bonds, boosting subsidies for low-income people and readjusting
tax policy.
</P>
<P>
China increased the issuance of treasury bonds by 100 billion
yuan-worth to fund infrastructure construction last year, adding 1.
5 percentage points to the economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, since March, China has seen a rapid decrease in
exports and foreign investment due to intensified competition from
other Asia economies that are recovering from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the growth rate of the country's investment
in fixed assets fell by one-half over the end of last December,
and the retail price index went down to score the 21st consecutive
monthly fall. Private consumption and investment have seen slower
growth rates.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's industrial output
increased by 2.8 percent in the first half of the year compared
with the same period of last year, but foreign trade dropped by a
big margin, according to official statistics released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value amounted to 96.6 billion Tughrik
based on the constant prices of 1995. The output of 60 industrial
products including electricity, thermo-power, oil and refined
copper powder registered increases.
</P>
<P>
The number of sheep increased by 558,400, compared with the
same period of last year, hitting an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary revenues increased by 7.2 percent in the first sixth
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's foreign trade in the period under review reached 331.
5 million U.S. dollars, down 10.8 percent from the same period of
last year, with exports amounting to 137.9 million dollars, down 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
Xiang warned today that if effective measures are not taken
promptly, the momentum of economic rebound that emerged in the
second half of last year will disappear and the growth of economy
may see a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
Mi noted that the Chinese economy is now at a historical stage
of changing from shortage to surplus, and the lagging behind of
micro-economic restructuring has effectively reduced the
effectiveness of macro-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said that the government has to further step up
the dimension of the active fiscal policy in order to secure a
rapid economic growth rate, which in turn will give more time and
room for maneuver to economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there is still plenty of room for adopting
a more active fiscal policy both on the demand and supply sides,
noting that Chinese banks now have a deposit-loan surplus of more
than 1,000 billion yuan, and infrastructure construction and
upgrading of state-owned enterprises need a great deal of funds.
He said that this room for maneuver will not disappear in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
Renowned Chinese economist Wu Jinglian said in an article that
since public debts account for less than ten percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), China will be safe from
any serious financial risk for the next two or three years if it
increases the issuance of treasury bonds by some 100 billion yuan
every year.
</P>
<P>
Mi noted that the government has readjusted the way it uses the
money from issuing T-bonds so as to promote economic growth from
various aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said that further increasing public spending on
infrastructure construction will push ahead the production of
relevant industries and have a delayed effect on economic growth
in the future.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Active Fiscal Policy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Finance Xiang
Huaicheng said here today that China will take more powerful
measures to implement its active fiscal policy in the second half
of the year in a bid to promote a sustained, steady development of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He told a national meeting on finance work that the government
is planning to increase the issuance of treasury bonds, raise
subsidies for low-income people and adjust tax policies in the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year, the minister said, these measures
meant for the next half this year include increasing investments
and consumption, supporting exports and adjusting tax policies,
which will be taken at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of these measures will lead to an increase
in the budget deficit and greater expenditure at local governments
as well, he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the first half of the year the Chinese
government had a fiscal revenue of 529.4 billion yuan, an increase
of 24.3 percent from a year earlier, and a fiscal expenditure of
464.8 billion yuan, up 16 percent, with a surplus of 64.6 billion
yuan, 39.7 billion yuan more than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on financial departments to support
the reforms of state-owned enterprises and help them establish a
scientific and rational system for their assets supervision and
management.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Iran to Enhance Measures to Control Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran Thursday
reached an agreement to further their measures to check drug
smuggling in border areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the meeting held here between
Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and a
visiting six-member Iranian delegation led by Muhammad Hossain
Zadeh, secretary of Iran's Drug Control Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held detailed discussions on matters relating to
drug control program. They were also joined by technical experts
at the meeting identifying ways and means to control menace of
drugs, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation was briefed on the steps being taken by
the Pakistani government to reduce poppy cultivation in border
areas with Afghanistan and curb drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Shujaat said both Pakistan and Iran have set up 52 check posts
to control drug smuggling on the Pak-Iran border.
</P>
<P>
All the check posts have started functioning which were
completed with the funds, provided by the United Nations Drug
Control Program (UNDCP), according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The staff of these check posts are not only well trained but
also well equipped with modern communication systems including
latest wireless sets, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement with UNDCP signed in April this year,
UNDCP will provide a grant of 5.25 million rupees (about 110,000
U.S. dollars) for strengthening drug law enforcement agencies,

On the other hand, he said, raising salaries of public servants
and government employees and increasing subsidies for low-income
people will drive consumption. He estimated that more than 80
million people would benefit directly from such policies. He said
that the government should raise the levels of minimum living
allowances for laid-off workers and unemployment relief, and
guarantee the subsistence of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Mi said that the readjustment of tax policies will effectively
reduce the financial burdens of a great number of enterprises and
promote investment and exports.
</P>
<P>
China announced on Monday that it would raise the tax rebate
rates for export-oriented garments, textiles, machinery and
electronic products, increasing the average tax rebate rates of
export goods by 2.95 percentage points to around 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has made a necessary and correct choice
to further strengthen the active fiscal policy so as to promote

HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
emphasized Thursday that July 30 would be the deadline for an
agreement on the proposed merger of the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange and their associated
clearing houses.
</P>
<P>
If the two exchanges could not reach a merger agreement by then,
the government would be duty-bound to proceed immediately with the
reform through other means to make the securities market fully
competitive in a globalized setting of the next century, Donald
Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said at a meeting with chairmen of the two exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The market reform was introduced by the financial secretary in
his budget speech in March.
</P>
<P>
The reform package includes reforming the market environment in
terms of market access for intermediaries and the levy and
commission structure, restructuring the governance of the
exchanges and clearing houses, rationalizing the market regulatory
functions and opening up the markets for more competition.
</P>
<P>
"We will mobilize all possible means at our disposal to
implement these objectives as quickly as possible," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary also pledged that the government would
work further toward the opening up of the cash and futures markets
in Hong Kong to enhance competition.
</P>
<P>
"Much is at stake in our mission to be the Asian premier center
for international finance. And the window of reform is narrow," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the merger and listing proposal would yield
the most winners as it would give existing members of the
exchanges a unique opportunity to reap substantial benefits.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the demutualization and merger of the exchanges
under a commercial deal will benefit all parties concerned
including the brokers, the exchanges, market users, investors as
well as the public at large," said Tsang.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government plans to enact the
Electronic Transaction Bill by the end of the year so as to
provide a favorable environment for electronic commerce to
flourish in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of the Association of Engineers in
Society Thursday evening, Secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting K. C. Kwong said the bill sought to establish a clear
legal framework to enhance certainty and security in the conduct
of electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
"When enacted, the bill will provide legal recognition to
electronic records and digital signatures in electronic
transactions in the same way as the legal recognition given to
their paper-based counterparts," Kwong said, adding that "It will
also provide a framework to facilitate and promote the operation
of certification authorities."
</P>
<P>
To provide a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of
electronic transactions, the government will take the lead and
will, through the Hong Kong Post, provide public certification
services to individuals as well as businesses by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WUHAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.3 million soldiers and
civilians in the central China provinces of Hunan and Hubei have
been organized to battle the surging floodwater in the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei alone, which sits on the middle reaches of the country
's longest river, 340,000 soldiers and civilians are patrolling
the lengthy dikes built along the Yangtze to make sure that the
third flood peak on the river, also the largest this year, can
pass without causing any serious mishaps.
</P>
<P>
The third flood peak formed July 14 when the Yangtze valley was
hit by intensive rainfall, and flood waters are pressing
downstream to this capital of Hubei, after passing the Jingjiang
section, which is most vulnerable to dyke breaches because of its
zigzagging and narrow river courses, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Yueyang, a city on the southern bank of the Yangtze, 300,000
soldiers and civilians have been busy solidifying the main
embankments and building 174 km of new dikes to confront the flood
peak impending. Meanwhile, more than 350,000 people living in the
vicinity of dangerous dikes have been evacuated to safe ground by
local governments at various levels in the city.
</P>
<P>
Some 25,000 local people have been formed into a special team
to deal with possible emergencies in areas around Dongting Lake,
where the water level has been rising at a speed of one centimeter
per hour due to the surging floodwater in the mainstream of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Chenglingji Hydrology Station, located where Dongting Lake
joins the Yangtze, recorded a water level of 35.5 meters at 20:00
hours Wednesday, and is expected to reach 35.7 meters or even 35.
94 meters, a historical record, today.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether one million people in the lake area
patrolling the dikes and embankments and repairing cave-ins daily.
They include 10,000 soldiers drafted from outside Hunan to help
fight floods.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. navy divers recovered the bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr.,
his wife and his sister-in-law from the wreckage of the Kennedy
plane in seas southwest of Martha's Vineyard Wednesday, ending a
period of uncertainty for their families and putting investigators
closer to finding out what caused the fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
-- House Republican leaders agreed Wednesday to make their huge
tax cut proposal conditional on progress in reducing the national
debt, apparently averting a threatened revolt by Republican
moderates as they prepared to try to pass the bill Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Congress says in a new report that the Pentagon defied
the law and the Constitution by spending hundreds of millions of
dollars on military projects that lawmakers never approved,
including a super-secret Air Force program.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians insisted Wednesday that a permanent peace
agreement with Israel be concluded by next May, rejecting a later
target date that has been suggested by the Israeli Prime Minister,
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- United Parcel Service of America (UPS) plans to sell 10
percent of its shares in what is likely to be one of the biggest
IPOs (initial public offerings) ever. Analysts and people
familiar with the UPS's plans say the sale should generate at

to use stock for acquisitions, including electronic-commerce
opportunities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Combats Deadly Forest Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's forestry authorities
Wednesday ordered an urgent mobilization against the American
white moths and pine wood nematode, which have caused severe
damage to forests in several Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to a conference held here by the State Forestry
Administration, American white moths have infested 28,900 ha of
forests around Tianjin City and in Hebei Province, while the pine
wood nematode has spread to 72,400 ha of forests in Jiangsu, Anhui,
Shandong, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, killing nearly 15
million pine trees.
</P>
<P>
The American white moth multiplies very rapidly and can spread
in many ways, hence posing a severe threat to forests, while the
pine wood nematode can kill huge numbers of pine trees in a very
short time, for which it is known as "pine wood cancer", experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao has said that strong measures must be
taken to stop the spread of the deadly pests as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The conference concluded that urgent measures would be taken in
the said provinces to bring the situation under control and
eventually wipe out the diseases.
</P>
<P>
Measures recommended by the conference include the sealing-off
of the affected areas, establishing an effective monitoring system
and the combined use of chemical, physical and biological means.
</P>
<P>
The conference decided that Beijing would also take action to
bar the depredations of the American white moth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Join ASEAN in Opening Farm Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has agreed with other
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to continue liberalizing the agricultural sector, a senior
Commerce Ministry official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thavachai Sophasathianpong, deputy director-general of the
Department of Business Economics, said that Thailand and other
ASEAN members had agreed that the public and private sectors also
cooperate to formulate a common policy and stance at the World
Trade Organization's new round of multilateral trade talks, to be
started in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members also agreed that the common policy and stance be
based on three aspects, including continual liberalization of
agricultural products, ending of local subsidies and ending of
export subsidies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The continual liberalization of the farm sector involves
reduction of import tariffs on agricultural products, both with
and without agreed quota frameworks.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members agreed in principle that they cut local subsidies
with a rate higher than that required by WTO's Uruguay Round of
trade talks, but more discussions were needed to finalize a common
rate of subsidies, said Thavachai.
</P>
<P>
In case of export subsidies, Thailand would not be obliged by
the issue as the country had never introduced any export subsidies
so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Secretary-General Urges Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo
Severino Thursday urged member countries to fulfill their
commitment to greater regional integration, which he said is
"inevitable."
</P>
<P>
In a report to the two-day ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM)
which opens here on Friday, Severino said economic globalization
has brought about profound implications for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Economic interdependence has reached a stage where developments
in some countries have profound implications for the rest of the
region, he said in the report, which was released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Regional integration is inevitable and essential," the report
said. "ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member
countries should not backtrack on their commitment to greater
regional integration."
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative to regional cooperation and
integration. Globalization compels ASEAN member countries to
establish common positions on global issues and to take advantage
of its collective weight," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Regional integration is the only way for countries such as
those in Southeast Asia to make their way in the world," it added.
</P>
<P>
It also said regional integration is being promoted through the
preservation of regional peace and security, increased mutual
trust and confidence and regular consultations on regional and
global security issues.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic integration is being pursued in several
forms, including the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), the ASEAN
Investment Area and the negotiations on trade in services,
tourism, transport and communication, energy, agriculture and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic integration means bringing down barriers to
trade in goods and services, dismantling obstacles to investments,
and building transportation, communications and energy linkages
within ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has decided to further accelerate the implementation of
AFTA, with the six original signatories -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- ready to
advance the completion of AFTA by one year from the year 2003 to
2002. The newer signatories will maximize the number of their
tariff lines subject to tariffs of 0-5 percent, by 2003 for
Vietnam and 2005 for Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Trends in economic globalization need to be matched by reforms
in the global financial system, the secretary-general's report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Asian financial crisis is a result of rapid
financial liberalization without the commensurate strengthening of
regulation and supervision of the sector and the crisis has
exposed the weaknesses in the financial system both at the
national and corporate levels.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should continue to address the dysfunctions resulting
from the interaction of a highly sophisticated global financial
system with the less developed domestic financial systems of
developing economies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Reforms in the financial system are needed to improve corporate
governance toward greater efficiency, transparency and
accountability, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said consultations with China, Japan and South Korea
were held to exchange views on monitoring short-term capital flows
and international financial reform.

<HEADLINE> China Construction Bank Grants Record Loans in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB)
reported today that it had extended a record of more than 1.25
trillion yuan in loans for a half-year period from January to June
this year, which was 78 billion yuan more than at the year's
beginning.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said that, in response to the central
government policy to increase domestic spending, the CCB continued
to grant loans to the sectors of communications, electricity,
telecommunications, and infrastructure, in addition to consumer
credit.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the loan increments went to infrastructure,
while the amount of housing and automobile loans also increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, housing loans to individuals amounted to 35.
7 billion yuan, up 10.7 billion yuan from the beginning of the

million yuan. Deposits for the period also rose to more than 1.59
trillion yuan, up 125.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The bank's integrated financial services ability has largely
improved due to the individual consumer credit available in 23
cities and the individual on-line remittance available in 283
cities, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
CCB President Zhou Xiaochuan has asked the bank to pay greater
attention to getting better clients and projects in the second

<HEADLINE> Manila Optimistic About Peso's Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Thursday voiced its confidence on the peso's stability despite the
currency's depreciation caused by the weakening of the Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview Thursday morning, Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said other Asian currencies also
depreciated as a result of the mild fall of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippine Central Bank won't intervene if this is the
case. The peso did not depreciate because of speculation,"
Espiritu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our dollar reserves are good. The inflow of our capital
investments, as well as the remittances of overseas Filipino
workers have not changed," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the depreciation has been relatively mild,
with the exchange rate going down by 5 to 8 centavos against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the foreign exchange rate does not fall by 50
centavos or one peso, there's nothing to worry about. Our dollar
reserves are fine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also expressed confidence that the government can keep
interest rates down because of its sound financial position.
</P>
<P>
"Our financial position is good. Our cash balance can reach 90
billion pesos ( 2.25 billion dollars) at any given time," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Growth Enterprise Market in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
announced a plan Thursday to launch the Growth Enterprise Market (
GEM) in October to offer a venue of business expansion for small
and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
Alec Tsui, chief executive of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong,
told a news conference here that members of the GEM Listing
Committee will have been appointed by the middle of next month.
</P>
<P>
"GEM will start to accept applications from sponsors once the
Listing Committee is appointed. A sponsor must be registered with
the Securities and Futures Commission as an investment adviser or
securities/exempt dealer," Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it must have two experienced principal supervisors
and two experienced assistant supervisors and capital or reserves
of at least 10 million HK dollars (about 1.28 million U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
"The Exchange expects to announce the first batch of GEM
sponsors in mid-September. Applications for listing are expected
after the sponsor list is published, and the first listing is
expected before the end of the year," Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
K. S. Lo, chairman of the GEM Working Group, stressed that GEM
was of equal standing to the existing stock market, with an
emphasis on growth enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a separate and an alternative market to the existing stock
market, namely the Main Board, the GEM requires lower listing
qualifications than those of the Main Board.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no profit requirement for listing, and GEM
applicants will only have to show a two-year business history," Lo
explained. "However, the reporting accountant will be required to
report on the financial results for the two years prior to listing.
"
</P>
<P>
He said GEM will be run on the basis of "let the buyer beware."
GEM listing applicants will have to give prominent risk warnings
and investors will be required to sign a risk acknowledgment
statement.
</P>
<P>
Companies incorporated in Hong Kong, China, Bermuda and the
Cayman Islands may apply for listing on GEM. They should have a
focused business and have been under substantially the same
management and ownership for two years.
</P>
<P>
"The minimum public float will be the higher of 30 million HK
dollars or 20 to 25 percent of issued share capital depending on
market demand." Lo said.
</P>
<P>
Underwriting will not be compulsory and the issuer will be free
to decide on the offering mechanism. A minimum of 100 public
shareholders are required.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN FMs to Review Progress in Regional Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will review the
progress in the implementation of a regional plan during their
annual meeting here, ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of the 32nd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM)
to be held here, Severino said the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA),
adopted at the ASEAN summit in Hanoi last December, will be an
agenda item in the AMM and following related meetings.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out
to realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for
the region, adopted by ASEAN leaders in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It has a six-year timeframe covering the period from 1999 to
2004. The progress of its implementation is set to be reviewed at
the ASEAN Summit Meetings held every three years.
</P>
<P>
The HPA is "a set of concrete measures intended to place
Southeast Asia's economic recovery on an enduring basis, foster
cooperation and mutual encouragement in financial matters, and
hasten regional economic integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Severino said ASEAN foreign ministers will meet with their
dialogue partners to focus on how the two sides can cooperate in
carrying out the projects prescribed in the HPA.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners include the European Union, Japan,
Russia, China and the United States, among others.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will be preparing for the ASEAN summit
that is taking place in Manila in November, said Severino, adding
that the summit will review the implementation of the HPA and
issue further directives.
</P>
<P>
Following this year's AMM on July 23-24 is the ASEAN Regional
Forum which involves all ASEAN member countries, its 10 dialogue
partners, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary General's
special envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, described the
latest meeting between the warring Afghan factions in Tashkent as
"constructive."
</P>
<P>
Talking to official Afghan news agency Bakhtar in Kabul
Wednesday night upon his arrival from Uzbekistan, Brahimi lauded
the participation by the Taliban militia in the two-day peace
talks this week sponsored by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Kabul Thursday, Brahimi is to hold
talks with Taliban leaders on his peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the opposition Northern Alliance sit with
representatives from Six plus Two (Afghanistan's six immediate
neighbors plus Russia and the United States) countries and
discussed ways to put an end to the long-standing crisis in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban and the Northern Alliance failed to reach
agreement on ending their conflict at the two-day peace talks
winding up Tuesday, saying more diplomacy was needed to stop the
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Team to Inquire Soldier Health Problem in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian team of experts will be
sent to Croatia Thursday to investigate the alleged soldier health
problem caused by contamination, local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) said a board of
inquiry would be set up to look into the matter involving almost 1,
000 Canadian soldiers serving in Croatia in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were alleged to have exposed to hazardous
substances such as PCBs and bauxite used to build bankers and fill
sandbags.
</P>
<P>
A memo written by a Canadian Forces doctor recognized that a
soldier had been "exposed to bauxite and PCBs for six months"
before he suffered severe health problems since returning to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
But when the soldier, former warrant officer Matt Stopford,
later checked his own file, there was no memo, the CBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Further investigation showed the memo had been removed from
almost 1,000 soldiers' files on orders of an unidentified senior
officer and burned, the CBC report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CTV news reported that soil and water samples taken
from bunkers also disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Walter Natynczyk of the Canadian Defense Department told the
CTV that "the board of inquiry will establish: Was the soil
contaminated, who served at the sites and will link, if there is
indeed a link, the liability of the Canadian forces."
</P>
<P>
Stopford, who has decaying joints and only 20 percent vision in
his right eye, received a letter from Veterans Affairs on Tuesday
acknowledging his illness was due to his service in Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Prevent Rightist Group from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Reuters) -- Israeli police Thursday
prevented members of a right-wing Jewish group from visiting the
Temple Mount in Jerusalem, citing "sensitive situation" following
confrontation between rightist Jews and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ra'anan Tal, police commander in charge of the Mount area,
told reporters that he could not permit the Jewish group Temple
Mount Faithful to enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex atop the
mountain, a move could spark conflict between Israeli and
Palestinian worshipers.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made after scuffle broke out between
Palestinians and members of the outlawed Jewish group Kach, who
threw pamphlets onto the site shortly after the beginning of the
Jewish holiday Tisha Be'av Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Jews pray and fast to observe Tisha Be'av, which commemorates
the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC
and the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 AD.
</P>
<P>
Israel's High Court ruled Tuesday that small groups of the
Temple Mount Faithful be allowed in principle to visit the
mountain on condition that they do not pray there on the Jewish
holiday.
</P>
<P>
As they usually do, Muslim authorities at the mosque complex
announced the closing of the Temple Mount to visitors Thursday,
citing "the sensitivity of the situation" following Wednesday's
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount Faithful has attempted to rebuild the Jewish
temple at the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, where they
said the ancient Jewish temples stood.
</P>
<P>
In October 1990, this rightist group tried to lay a
cornerstone for the Third Temple on the mountain, triggering
standoff between thousands of Israeli and Palestinian worshipers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty people were killed and more than 150 others injured in
the ensuing conflict, the bloodiest since Israel seized the Arab
East Jerusalem in 1967.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Falun Gong Ban (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A People's Daily editorial to be
carried on July 23 supports the Chinese government ban on Falun
Gong activities.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that Party members, government officials,
and the people as a whole should understand that this is a serious
ideological and political struggle which has bearing on the
fundamental beliefs of Party members, on the basic ideological
foundation for the Chinese people's cause and unity, and on the
future of the Party and state.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China Central Committee has issued a
circular prohibiting Party members from practicing Falun Gong and
the Ministry of Civil Affairs has outlawed the Research Society of
Falun Dafa. The Ministry of Public Security has issued a notice to
prohibit pro-Falun Gong activities and published an article on the
life of Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, and about how he
made Falun Dafa up to destroy people's minds, disturb public order,
and disrupt social stability, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial emphasizes that priority should be given to
understanding the political nature and serious problems of the
Falun Gong organization. Li Hongzhi has malicious fallacies about
doomsday approaching and himself being the only savior. He managed
to develop Falun Gong into a nationwide organization that
penetrated some of the Party and government organizations and even
attempted to create a political force that challenged the Party
and the government.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong got its practitioners to attack press organizations
and Party and government institutions when stories about the
damage caused by Falun Gong appeared, it says, and if people fail
to see the political nature of Falun Gong and don't take
appropriate steps to deal with the problem, they are bound to make
historic mistakes.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, the overwhelming majority of Falun Gong
practitioners took part in the practice in the hope of improving
physical fitness and don't understand the ulterior motives of Li
and a handful of people. They should be given help to understand
that the government ban on Falun Gong is beneficial to the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people, including themselves.
People who voluntarily separate themselves from the Falun Gong
organization will not be investigated or penalized.
</P>
<P>
It says that a distinction must be made between normal physical
exercises and superstitious activities that are disguised as
physical exercises, between ordinary Falun Gong practitioners and
a few plotters and organizers of activities which violate the law,
and between normal religious belief and legitimate religious
activities and activities organized by Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Passes Flag-Anthem Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives (
lower house) on Thursday approved a bill to legally recognize the
Hinomaru as the country's national flag and "Kimigayo" as the
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which proposes the flag in one article and the anthem
in another, was immediately sent to the House of Councillors (
upper house). It is expected to be enacted within the current Diet
(parliament) session which ends August 13.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), its coalition
partner the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito party supported
the bill, while the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social
Democratic Party (SDP) opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)
submitted to the lower house plenary session an alternative bill
that would only recognize the Hinomaru, but the bill was voted
down.
</P>
<P>
The Hinomaru (the rising sun) and "Kimigayo," unofficially
translated as "his majesty's reign," have served as Japan's de
facto national symbols since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether to legally recognize them has been
sensitive because of their links to Japan's Imperial system and
wartime militarism.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government began studying legislation on the flag
and the anthem in early March, following the suicide February 28
of a high school principal in Hiroshima Prefecture, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
The principal had been ordered by the prefectural board of
education to hoist the flag and have the anthem sung at the school
's graduation ceremony February 29, while teachers at the school
had opposed the idea, especially the singing of "Kimigayo."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuhi has pressed the need to
clearly stipulate the flag and anthem's legal standing before the
21st century.

<P>
It says that an overwhelming majority of Falun Gong followers,
after seeing the true face of Li Hongzhi, will no doubt take steps
to help maintain social stability and will do nothing to harm
unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Those few people who tried to spread superstition and heretical
ideas and deceive the public under the pretext of practicing and
propagating Falun Gong and who deliberately created disturbances
and instigated insurrection must be penalized in accordance with
the law, it says, pointing to the importance of the role of all
Communist Party members and organizations in handling the issue.
</P>
<P>
Party members need to take a firm stand and follow the
guidelines and measures of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee in thoughts and deeds, it says, and the Party members
involved in Falun Gong practices must completely break away from
Falun Gong's ideological influence and quit Falun Gong
organizations and return to the correct stance of the Party.
</P>
<P>
It says that no Communist Party member should practice Falun
Gong, participate in any Falun Gong activities, hold any post in a
Falun Gong organization, distribute any Falun Gong materials, or
provide funds or a site or other facilities for Falun Gong
activities.
</P>
<P>
Party members need to take the lead in exposing Li Hongzhi and
criticizing him and his Falun Dafa and to make an effort to help
Party organizations and government departments explain this to non-
Party members, it says, and asks Party organizations at all levels
to use strict discipline with Party members and to earnestly
shoulder political responsibilities during this serious
ideological and political struggle.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations need to continue to educate Party members
in Marxist materialism and atheism extensively and help them
continue to increase their Party spirit, political awareness, and
ability of judgment, and infuse them with Communist ideals and a
firm belief in the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, it says.
</P>
<P>
With the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core, and with the solidarity of people of all
ethnic groups, and with the scientific truth of Marxism, the Falun
Gong issue can be successfully resolved and the current struggle
won, it concludes.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Plans to Quit COMESA: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has announced that
it plans to pull out of the 20-member Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
"We have done some research and found out that it is best for
us to quit COMESA", said Iddi Simba, Minister of Industries and
Commerce, according to The Guardian newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations on procedures for our pull-out are proceeding,"
Simba said in the central city Dodoma Wednesday while presenting
his ministry's 1999/2000 budget estimates before the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the largest private paper as saying that the
government' s decision to pull out of COMESA was prompted by the
proposal to reduce customs tariffs for member countries by 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the government's decision to withdraw from COMESA,
Tanzania reduced by 80 percent the tariffs through an act in 1998,
he said.
</P>

"Currently, the tariff rate for COMESA member states is on
average seven percent. However, it is expected to fall to four
percent once the 90 percent reduction is implemented," Simba said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from announcing the decision to withdraw from COMESA,
Simba reiterated the government's commitment to intensify economic
cooperation with Kenya and Uganda through the East African
Co-operation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, members of the EAC, are preparing
to sign a treaty this year to upgrade their cooperation level by
establishing the East African Community, which aims to create a
common market between the three countries, to be followed by a
monetary union and ultimately a political federation.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, which was set up in 1994, includes Ethiopia, Angola,
Burundi, Zimbabwe, the Comoros, Kenya, Lesotho, Rwanda, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Swaziland, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda,
Zambia, Congo (K), Eritrea, Madagascar and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Sources told Xinhua Thursday that Tanzania, a member of both
COMESA and Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), has long
considered quitting one of the two because of financial
difficulties in paying membership fees.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that Tanzania, which is the industry
coordinator of the SADC, would continue to push for zero customs
duty tariffs for the 14-member SADC states, through its ambassador
in Geneva, Ali Mchumo, who is the chairman of the World Trade
Organization's General Council.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Listed Top Canadian Growth City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest metropolis Toronto
is estimated to lead other cities of the country in 1999, with a
GDP growth of at least four percent, according to the latest
forecast by the Conference Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa-based agency says that for the third consecutive
year, Toronto keeps the No.1 growth rate as every sector of its
economy is firing.
</P>
<P>
Low taxes are attracting investment and people in demand of
more housing to bring more jobs and greater spending to the city,
the agency says in its study of the economies of nine major
Canadian cities.
</P>
<P>
Southern Ontario's strong links with the booming U.S. economy
is also listed as a key factor for Toronto's economic growth,
especially in the automotive and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly growing high-tech sector is giving rise to a 3.9
percent growth in Ottawa and neighboring Hull, securing the No.2
position for both cities, as illustrated by the study.
</P>
<P>
The downsizing in the federal public service has also
contributed to the economic growth in Ottawa, the study says.
</P>
<P>
The Alberta capital Edmonton ranks third in the study with a
predicted 3.2 percent growth to be fueled in 1999 by strong gains
in the construction sector, along with growing chemical and
industrial investments.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Singapore have
signed an agreement to develop their respective information
technology (IT) sectors, Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed Wednesday by Philippine Science
Undersecretary Rogelio Panlasigui and Michael Yap of the National
Computer Board (NCB) of Singapore, PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was part of the 1998 Philippine-Singapore Action
Plan, a partnership that Panlasigui said "would allow the two
countries to develop and sustain a competitive edge in the
information technology sector."
</P>
<P>
Panlasigui said, "The two countries could jointly develop
products for the world market by combining, for example,
multimedia creative talent in the Philippines with project
management and marketing expertise in Singapore."
</P>
<P>
Panlasigui also hoped that Singapore could also "help in the
Philippines' efforts to establish an Internet backbone by sharing
its experience in setting up SingaporeONE (One Network for
Everyone).
</P>
<P>
SingaporeONE is the world's first nationwide broadband network
that provides easy Internet access to every home, school and
office in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The two countries could also explore the possibility of
establishing a high-speed telecommunications link to ease the flow
of communications, information and transactions between the two
nations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Troops to Phase out S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian troops in the West Africa
Peace Keeping Force or ECOMOG in Sierra Leone will kick off its
gradual withdrawal from August 26, reported a Nigerian news paper
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Federal Executive Council (FEC) made the decision
Wednesday at one of its meetings, according to the Post Express,
a leading Nigerian daily.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Information Minister Dapo Sarumi said after the
meeting that the withdrawal will be in phases.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government is reportedly to have set aside funds in
its supplementary budget for the troops back home. The money will
be used in areas including repairing Nigerian Air force's
Hercules C-130 transporters, which are to be used to fly back the
solders.
</P>
<P>
The gradual phasing out of Nigerian troops from Sierra Leone is
in line with an election promise of President Olusegun Obasanjo,
who played an important role in helping signing a peace accord
between Sierra Leonean government and the rebels on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a share of 11,000 solders in the ECOMOG's 15,000
strong military presence in the war-torn west African country.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Nigeria's withdrawal is primarily
based on economic considerations. Nigeria has in the past urged
international community including the United Nations to pay for
its staying in the country but only got partial assistance.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Speaker Considers Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Speaker of the House of
Representatives Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari was believed to consider
resignation over the allegations of forgery and perjury levelled
against him.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to him said that he decided to resign after his
party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), asked him to step
aside to allow for unfettered investigation into the allegations,
according to media reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1999 Constitution, the Speaker is enjoined to forward
his letter of resignation to the Clerk of the House who will
announce that the post of the Speaker is vacant and election will
then be held to fill the position.
</P>
<P>
With the development of Buhari's decision to resign, meetings
were held Wednesday night by legislators preparatory to the
emergence of a new speaker for the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The sources further said that his parents and some PDP elders
had begun serious lobby of the Federal government against
prosecuting the Speaker.
</P>
<P>
Buhari's parents are appealing to the government to see the
Speaker's resignations as enough humiliation, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Speaker Buhari wrote to the House, saying he was
stepping aside until investigations into allegations against him
have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ruling party to which Buhari belongs said
that "PDP believes that Buhari should step aside from his position
as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to allow for an
unfettered investigation."

<HEADLINE> Lee's "Two-Nations" Theory Slammed in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The "two nations" theory
preached
recently by Lee Teng-hui, leader of Taiwan authorities, was
slammed
here as "dangerous" Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium, more than 40 representatives of overseas
Chinese
and Chinese students strongly denounced Lee's divisive conspiracy
and
expressed their great concern about the cause of China's
reunification. They noted that whoever splits China will stand
condemned through the ages.
</P>
<P>
Geophysicist Hai Zhu, who settled down here from Shanghai 10
years
ago, said Lee Teng-hui's "two nations" theory is a dangerous sign
that Taiwan authorities have taken a great step back from the
reunification of the country. His divisive acts, Zhu added, have
worsened the relations across the Taiwan Straits, causing serious
worries among the Chinese people both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Wong Yok Shee, an overseas Chinese from Hong Kong, condemned
the
"two nations" theory as "very ridiculous." "Taiwan has, since
ancient times, been part of China," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Binh Heng, an overseas Chinese from Cambodia, praised the
concept
of "one country, two systems" with a unified China advocated by
the
Chinese government as the "best principle" to solve the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
All overseas Chinese firmly oppose any attempt to separate
Taiwan
from China, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lei Zhuang, who is studying in Wellington, said he was very
angry
when he heard the separatist remarks made by Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-hui is playing with fire," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Australians Rally Against U.S. Restrictions on Lamb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 farmers and
protesters rallied in central Sydney Thursday to protest against
U.S. trade restrictions on Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
Chefs wearing U.S. President Bill Clinton rubber masks and
others donning Uncle Sam hats served up cuts of lamb to
protesters, billing it as the "tasty meats the White House won't
serve."
</P>
<P>
The rally marks the start of a National Meat and Livestock
Australia Association campaign to encourage Australians to eat
more lamb.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the campaign James Kilmartin described the
protest as a way of drawing attention to what he called a serious
problem -- the "unfair" trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the United States is a big overseas
market, local consumers could help offset the blow dealt by the
new tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile
announced an assistance package of up to 14 million Australian
dollars (9.24 million U.S. dollars) to help Australia's lamb
industry following the U.S. import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Vaile also criticized the U.S. decision on Australian lamb,
saying Australia would not follow "the unjust, myopic and sadly
protectionist move" of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration decided on July 7 to impose a quota
of 31,851 metric tons on lamb imports from Australia, New Zealand
and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tariff of 9 percent for sales within the quota was
claimed and a punishing rate for sales outside that quota was up
to 40 percent.

BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB)
announced today that it will have some major reforms of its
internal supervision and audit system.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said that eight auditing sub-divisions will be
set up in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and five other large cities
for a more vertical, efficient internal audit system.
</P>
<P>
It is the first Chinese bank to use this new supervisory and
audit model and bank analysts say that the new model will help
protect the independence of supervisory and audit work.
</P>
<P>
CCB Vice-President Liu Shulan said that the new model will help
solve problems in the traditional audit system under which the
source and outlay of auditors are closely related to those being
audited, thus affecting the independence of the audit work.

<P>
A detailed plan has been made to implement the new measures,

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Appoints New Chief of Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Thursday appointed former Defense Minister
Mohammad Forouzandeh as the chairman of the state-run Foundation
of the Oppressed and the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
Forouzandeh is replacing Mohsen Rafiqdoost, who has held the
foundation chairmanship for two five-year tenures, Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his decree on the appointment, Khamenei expressed hope
that Forouzandeh would make the optimal use of the public assets
of the foundation in serving the disabled war veterans of the
Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88 and the disadvantaged people.
</P>
<P>
Iran set up the foundation after the 1979 Islamic revolution by
taking over the properties of the former Iranian shah regime and
the Iranians who fled Iran. It has become Iran's largest state-run
industrial and commercial group with more than 100 companies in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
Forouzandeh was born in 1953 in Abadan in Iran's southwestern
Khuzestan province. After the Islamic revolution, he was appointed
the director of the province's administrative-political department
and in 1981 as its governor.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he became chief of the staff of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corp and in 1993 he was appointed by
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani as the defense minister.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN's New Members Urged to Foster Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Newer members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should strengthen their private
sectors, Rodolfo Severino, secretary-general of the regional
grouping, said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of the ASEAN Business Forum, Severino
said the private sector has to play the "primary role" in a "world
of globalization and regionalization."
</P>
<P>
All countries in ASEAN, especially newer ones like Cambodia,
Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, should strengthen their private
sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups all the 10 countries in Southeast Asia --
Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Building up private business in the newer members, he said, is
necessary for the regional business networking that is required by
the growing integration of the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
"If the huge market that is ASEAN Ten is to be exploited to
full advantage," he stressed, "the horizons of ASEAN business must
expand to embrace the newer ASEAN members as well as the old."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN secretary-general was speaking on the eve of the 32nd
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), which is scheduled for Friday and
Saturday and will be attended by all the 10 ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
The AMM will be followed by the ASEAN Regional Forum and Post
Ministerial Conference, at which ASEAN foreign ministers will hold
talks with their counterparts from Russia, the European Union, the
United States, China and Japan, among others.

<HEADLINE> Life And Times Of Li Hongzhi (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 23, the day after he entered China, the number of
Falun Gong practitioners at Tianjin Normal University swelled to
more than 6,300. By the morning of April 24, while Li was still in
Beijing, Falun group exercise sites around Beijing had received
notices that practitioners were to go to Zhongnanhai for a "group
exercise".
</P>
<P>
By the time more than 10,000 exercisers showed up at
Zhongnanhai on April 25, Li was in Hong Kong. He didn't leave Hong
Kong for Brisbane until 10:15 p.m. on April 27.
</P>
<P>
In his book "Zhuanfalun (Turn the Wheel of Law)" and in several
of his "sermons", Li has said that there is a white material
called "de" (morality) with an opposite side that is dark, called
"ye" (evil). By practicing Falun Gong, he says, people can be
helped by the Falun (Wheel of Law) and improve their "de" and
reduce the "ye force" and purify their bodies and achieve
enlightenment and immortality. Practitioners can ultimately attain
"salvation and reach the heavenly kingdom," or paradise.
</P>
<P>
Li also speaks of karma, or predetermination, and says that
illness and other suffering is "retribution for evil deeds one has
done in the past or in a past life, and that by enduring this
suffering one can repay his or her evil debt." He says that anyone
who believes in and practices Falun Gong doesn't need to take
medicine to cure disease.
</P>
<P>
Li has criticized people who try to persuade others not to
practice Falun Gong, calling them "demons" and saying that they
have harmed the Falun Dafa and have prevented people from
attaining "salvation".
</P>
<P>
As a result of Li's malicious fallacies and deceptive behavior,
some Falun practitioners have refused to go to hospital or take
medicine for their diseases, and some have lost their lives
because of a lack of treatment. Some have committed suicide or
lost their sanity after practicing Falun Gong, and a few have
become homicidal.
</P>
<P>
Li is not bringing salvation to practitioners, but is in fact
leading them to a disastrous and miserable end, and Falun Gong is
doing enormous harm to both the mental and physical health of
people.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Assist Small Scale Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has been urged
to assist small scale farmers because they produce about 70
percent of the country's food security requirements.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Daily Mail newspaper Thursday quoted Copperbelt
Minister Matthew Mulanda as saying in a speech at a land workshop
held in Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, that the government assured
Britain's OXFAM and other developmental organizations that it
established a land registry in Ndola, north Zambia, with a view to
addressing problems being faced by the vulnerable farming
community.
</P>
<P>
He implored stake-holders to seriously consider how they could
create an enabling environment for greater agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
OXFAM program manager Mahongo Shibemba said although small
scale farmers produce more food for the nation, the majority
illegally settle on land owned by forestry and absentee landlords.
</P>
<P>
Shibemba said peasant farmers fear to increase production due
to the ever imminent possibility of eviction.
</P>
<P>
She said most of the small scale producers were not squatters
by choice but were relegated to the position by a land acquisition
procedure that is long and expensive.
</P>
<P>
Shibemba complained on behalf of the farming community that it
takes too long for a farmer to get a title to his plot because of
red tape.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the sad development to lack of information on
where to go and how to own land legally.
</P>
<P>
Shibemba appealed to Zambian government to honor their promise
of protecting the poor so that they are able to produce.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Committee Eyes Tougher Penalty for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A special Jordanian committee has
decided to cancel law provisions which reduce or even pardon
alleged honor killings which claimed lives of dozens of young
women in the kingdom every year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the Penal of Code by the special committee
under the Ministry of Justice has yet to be approved by the lower
and upper houses of the parliament and then to be followed by a
Royal decree, Minister of Justice Hamzeh Haddad was quoted as
saying by the semiofficial Jordan Times Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided to cancel the entire article 340 of the
Penal Code which dealt with honor killings, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the committee was apparently a result of
pressure from women`s rights groups which had complained for years
against some clauses in the Penal Code concerning the alleged
honor crimes, which claimed lives of an average of 25 women
annually in the 1990s in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein also intervened after he
took the throne early this year and ordered the government to
amend any laws that discriminate against the rights of women and
inflict injustice on women.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia Launch Aborted Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Bad weather prevented U.S.
space shuttle Columbia from blasting off early Thursday morning in
Cape Canaveral, Florida State, with Eileen Collins, the first
woman to lead a U.S. space flight.
</P>
<P>
After aborting the first scheduled launch with six seconds
remaining just after midnight Tuesday because of a faulty sensor,
launch controllers were forced to scrub it again early Thursday
when a lightning storm moved into the area.
</P>
<P>
Lightning flashed offshore and thunder rumbled as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) held the countdown at
the five-minute mark in hopes that the storms would pass by
quickly.
</P>
<P>
The launch director even added 10 minutes to the launch window,
but it didn't help. He waited until the last possible moment
before radioing the bad news to Collins and her crew: they would
not be lifting off Thursday with the world's most powerful X-ray
telescope.
</P>
<P>
NASA said it would try again early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first launch attempt, on Tuesday, ended six seconds before
liftoff when a dangerous hydrogen buildup was detected in the
engine compartment.

MACAO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Identification Department of the
Macao government has begun preparations for making passports to be
used by local residents after the establishment of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News quoted Director Lai Ieng Kit as saying his
department will have to improve relevant technology to prevent
counterfeit passports.
</P>
<P>
Lai noted that the passports would surely be issued after the
founding of the Macao SAR on December 20 this year, but local
residents can submit applications to the department before that
date.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the SAR establishes, the department will exert great
efforts to publicize the passports so that more countries can
accept them and exempt visas, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, representing the
European Union, is expected in Egypt in early August to discuss
with Egyptian officials the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the first stop of Halonen's regional tour, which
also include Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Wednesday that
all statements made by Egypt are aimed at serving the Middle East
peace process and that Egypt wants to make sure that the peace
process would be revived on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's remarks came in response to Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy's comments on his statements on Tuesday, which Levy
said do not serve the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Presidential Political Advisor Osama al-Baz on
Wednesday reiterated Egypt's keenness on Sudan's unity and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"This is a substantial principle for Egypt in spite of many
differences with the Sudanese government," al-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday met with
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib and chief of the
royal palace Abdul-Karim Kabariti to discuss the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian officials called on Israel to fully implement the
agreements signed with the Palestinians, the Wye peace accord in
particular.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Agency Says Iran Training Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's security service Shin
Bet has found that Iran is training members of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, Israel's Haaretz daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the exclusive training camp is located not far
from the Iranian capital of Tehran and run by Pasdaran Islamic
Revolutionary Guards, which is controlled by Iran's spiritual
leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Shin Bet became aware of the Iranian-Hamas connection several
months ago after it arrested three Hamas members, who admitted
that they had received guerrilla warfare training in Iran, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Israel views Iran as a major regional threat to its national
security. Meanwhile, Hamas, which opposes the Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking, is leading a Palestinian resistance movement against
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority stepped up security measures
in the past few months and succeeded in reining in Hamas and other
radical Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned recently of fresh
Hamas terror attacks as Israel and the Palestinians resume the
peace process, deadlocked in the past three years under the former
hardline Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> WTO Members Meet to Finally Approve Leadership Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling General Council of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) began the formal meeting here
Thursday to formally approve a power-sharing plan to appoint Mike
Moore of New Zealand and Supachai Panithpakdi of Thailand as the
WTO's next two consecutive leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the revised version of the draft plan for approval on
Thursday, the key word "by consensus" has been deleted because
certain WTO members do not fully agree to the wording, according
to trade sources close to the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
During an informal meeting Tuesday at the WTO headquarters,
trade envoys of the WTO's 134 members discussed the draft "3+3"
plan brokered by Bangladesh and Australia.
</P>
<P>
If the plan is approved, Mike Moore of New Zealand will be
appointed as Director-General for three years from September 1,
1999 to August 31, 2002. Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand would
succeed Moore from September 1, 2002 for three years to August 31,
2005.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the candidates should be eligible for re-appointment
as Director-General nor should his period of office be extended,
according to the proposal. It stressed that the special
arrangement for the two candidates should not be the precedent for
future appointments of the WTO chief.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years
like former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has served.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Syria Keeps Sending Positive Signals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said Thursday that Israel had received further signals from
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad that Damascus is interested in
resuming peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy told Israel's Army Radio that he was briefed by visiting
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar that Assad does not want
to waste an opportunity to make peace with Israel's new Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, who is in Israel at the last stop of his five-day
Middle East tour, met Assad Monday. He will hold talks later
Thursday with Barak, who returned from a six-day visit to
Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Assad is apparently convinced of Israel's intentions for
peace and it seems he is determined not to waste the
opportunity," Levy told the radio.
</P>
<P>
Ousting hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu in the prime ministerial
election in May, Barak has pledged to push forward the peace
process with Syria as well as the Palestinians, which was largely
frozen in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
He promised to resume the peace talks with Damascus under the
framework of U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for Israel
to relinquish Arab land it occupied in the 1967 Middle East war,
including the strategic plateau of Golan Heights of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Since his election victory, Barak has traded compliments and
trust-building signals with Assad, the former arch-foe in the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Damascus has asked radical
Palestinian groups based in Syria to stop armed struggle against
Israel. Barak welcomed the reports.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army chief admitted Wednesday that Syria is also
taking action to restrain Hezbollah guerrillas, who are fighting
to oust Israel from its occupation zone in southern Lebanon, from
firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Barak in Washington this week, U.S. President
Bill Clinton called on Assad to seize the current "golden
opportunity" to reach peace with Israel. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is expected to shuttle in the region next
month, likely to include a visit to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Barak's chief of staff Danny Yatom said the Israeli-Syrian
talks might be resumed in a matter of weeks.

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Upon returning to Israel from a visit to the United States
Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak planned to turn
his attention to working with the Palestinians, a source said.
</P>
<P>

connection several months ago, following the arrest of three
Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police and prison service officials will propose to

<HEADLINE> Life And Times Of Li Hongzhi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun
Gong, is not the "highest Buddha" who brings salvation to
suffering people, but an evil person who has had an extremely
disastrous effect on society.
</P>
<P>
Li was born in the city of Gongzhuling in China's Jilin
Province on July 7, 1952. He went to primary and junior high
school in Changchun, the provincial capital, from 1960 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
From 1970 to 1978, he worked on a People's Liberation Army stud
farm and then as a trumpet player in a band. From 1978 to 1982, he
worked as an attendant at a guest house.
</P>
<P>
Li was discharged from military service in 1982 and went to
work in the security department of the Changchun City Cereals And
Oil Company. In 1991, he quit this job and began practicing "
Qigong", a form of martial arts that combines meditation and
breathing techniques and is believed to tap the practitioner's
inner strength. In May, 1992, Li started to teach Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
In a resume he prepared in 1993, Li claimed that he had started
learning a special form of Qigong in childhood from a Buddhist
master, Quanjue, and completed his training at the age of 8, and
that a Taoist immortal, Baji, discovered him when he was 12 and
taught him Taoist practices. Then, in 1972, he learned the essence
of Taoism from a master, Zhendaozi, and in 1974 started to study
Buddhism from another Buddhist master until he entered public life.
</P>
<P>
Li also claims that he has supernatural abilities like the
ability to move objects, control thinking, and make himself
invisible and that he understands the truth of the universe and
has insights into life and can see the past and future.
</P>
<P>
On September 24, 1994, Li changed his date of birth from July 7,
1952 to May 13, 1951 and acquired a new ID card. On the Chinese
lunar calendar, May 13, is the birthday of Sakyamuni, the founder
of Buddhism, so by changing his birthday Li could pretend that he
is a reincarnation of Sakyamuni.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Philadelphia-based, 136-year-
old La Salle University announced Wednesday that it will launch an
e-commerce institute open to any student in any discipline.
</P>
<P>
Starting this fall, all La Salle University students will be
able to obtain a working knowledge of e-commerce and learn how
business in the future will be done on the Web, the Internet and
on computers.
</P>
<P>
La Salle's E-Commerce Institute is a two-year track in which

commerce in high-school and middle-school classes and set up
workshops for business leaders on ways to combine e-commerce with

business.

degrees or minors in e-commerce, La Salle program is open to all
students who desire a working knowledge of this field.

<P>
Since May this year, Falun Gong practitioners in China have
received instructions from Li, who is living abroad, in the form
of "scriptures". Because of the Falun organization, instructions
spread very fast and have an evil influence on a large number of
people.
</P>
<P>
"The Research Society of Falun Dafa" and general instruction
stations organize large-scale activities to "spread the Falun word
and to exchange experiences and hold various celebrations and
commemoration ceremonies". On several occasions, when they were
dissatisfied with news reports and articles that exposed the dark
secrets of Falun Gong or when government departments banned books
and audio-video products preaching the Falun word, they organized
their members to besiege some news organizations, publishers, or
Party and government departments, disrupting the normal work and
social order and undermining the hard-won social stability.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is an illegal organization with no official
registration status, but with a tight system.
</P>
<P>
In spreading the Falun Gong word, Li cast himself up as the "
highest Buddha" who has transcended all secular desires. But, in
real life he displays an enormous greed. In the early years of "
spreading Falun Gong," Li attracted followers by supposedly curing
their ailments and helping them improve their health. There was a
special "donation box" at his home and he instructed with a hint
his assistants to tell every patient to donate at least 100 yuan
for every visit.
</P>
<P>
Li also collected a large amount of money from training classes.
From 1993 to 1994, he was reported to have earned 428,300 yuan in
Changchun from teaching Falun exercises and from book sales. At
the same time, he earned another 789,000 yuan in other parts of
China from classes.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt to Shift Focus to Gem-Stone Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government is embarking on
a program aimed at shifting focus from copper mining to other
minerals in view of the sale of copper mines.
</P>
<P>
Mines and Minerals Deputy Minister Kaunda Lembalemba said in
Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, on Wednesday that after the sale of
the mines, it was important to see how the government would
develop other areas of mining like the gem-stone industry.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Thursday reported that Lembalemba
would soon leave the country for the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) countries to study how those countries have done
to develop their gem-stone industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government wanted to study how the small scale
miners in those countries, including Zimbabwe, are carrying out
their mining activities and what the governments are providing for
them.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government wanted to study what other
governments were getting out of the small scale mining and how the
stones were mined.
</P>
<P>
Lembalemba also assured that the government was taking every
measure to ensure that gem stones were not exported illegally.
</P>
<P>
He said while companies have conducted their auctions in a
transparent manner in Lusaka, those who were importing were
subjected to government scrutiny where they had to declare what
they have.

Li also publishes a large number of books, cassette tapes,
video tapes, and video CDs with his teachings and sells them to
Falun practitioners for 300 yuan a set. He has encouraged people
to believe that his photo and "Falun emblems" with his image can
have a "miraculous and inspirational effect" and encourages people
to buy them.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has come up with new Falun products like
special clothing and cushions for Falun practitioners and has
reissued his books in a deluxe edition that sells at a higher
price.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have found that Li has several luxury houses and
limousines in Beijing and Changchun in his relatives names and,
through the Falun Gong, he has got a large fortune on which he has
not paid taxes.
</P>
<P>
On April 25, more than 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered
outside Zhongnanhai, the government compound in Beijing, seriously
disrupting public order, with a malignant effect. Li told foreign
correspondents that he had known nothing about it in advance and
that he was on his way from the United States to Australia at the
time. He said that he didn't learn about the incident until he was
in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been proven that Li was in Beijing the day
before the incident. On April 19, "Teenager Science-Technology
Outlook", a Tianjin Normal University magazine, contained an
article entitled "I'm Opposed To Qigong Practice By Teenagers" by
Professor He Zuoxiu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Some
Falun Gong practitioners in Tianjin took offense at the article
and staged a silent protest at the university. By April 22, there
were more than 3,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
Li flew back to China on Northwest Airlines Flight 087,
entering Beijing at 5:35 p.m. on April 22, then, after a stay of
44 hours, left in a hurry for Hong Kong at 1:30 p.m. on April 24
on Air China Flight 109.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The preliminary results of Kenya's
1999 national population and housing census will be released
within three months as the census falls on August 24 and 25,
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti has said.
</P>
<P>
This would be possible because the event's national steering
committee had acquired sophisticated scanners which would expedite
the processing of data, he said when addressing the members of
the steering committee Wednesday in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Everything was on schedule for the big count, Saitoti said,
adding the recruitment of census personnel had also taken place
and currently, supervisors and enumerators were undergoing
training, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recruitment had emphasized on taking
personnel from the same localities they would count local people.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee was also putting in place security
measures to ensure criminals do not have a field-day during the
census, he added.
</P>
<P>
The count is expected to cost about two billion shilling (some
30 million U.S. dollars) provided by the government budget and
several donors.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti urged the public to be adequately informed about the
need of participation and given correct information during the
exercise, called on the secretariat to conduct advocacy seminars
in various districts.

BEIRUT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon witnessed a downward trade
deficit in the first half of 1999 as exports rose and imports
declined, the Daily Star newspaper reported on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Lobby in Brunei For 2006 Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is looking to exploit
the arena of the upcoming Southeast Asian (SEA) Games by trying to
lobby the participating countries with regard to its plan to bid
for the 2006 Asian Games, The Indonesian Observer reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Indonesian Sports Council (KONI)
Rudolf Warrow said that Indonesia would plan to invite the top
officials of the participating teams to a cocktail party on August
6, or one day before the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"They may have known over our plan of the 2006 Asian Games but
we'll be pressing ahead to declare officially our intention to bid,
" Rudolf said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia would use the occasion to push ahead
with the aspirations to form a pencak silat federation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf said between 30 and 40 invitees were expected to turn up
in a night of ceremony which would be accompanied by the display
of the items highlighting the hype of the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Indonesia, Malaysia has also announced its intention
along with the United Arab Emirates, India, Kuwait and Hong Kong
of China.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Olympics Committee will decide on the winner in
November 2000. The bidders are expected to submit the
administration requirements at the general assembly in Kuwait in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf said that Indonesia did not have a plan to build other
new venues except for the establishment of an athletes' compound
which should accommodate as many as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
On Indonesia's chance in the bidding given the ongoing economic
condition, Rudolf was left saying: "as a nation we must be
optimistic that the future will be getting better."
</P>
<P>
He said the government's pledge in supporting the plan had
thrown up moral support behind the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia hosted its first and only Asian Games in 1962.

<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) today made public a circular
forbidding Party members to practice Falun Dafa (Falun Gong).
</P>
<P>
The circular asks CPC members who currently practice Falun Dafa
to separate themselves from Falun Gong organizations, and to make
a clean ideological break from it.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the launching of education against Falun Gong
for the entire party.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that the Falun Gong organization has
developed and spread in some places in recent years. Falun Dafa,
concocted by Li Hongzhi, has propagated a set of malicious
fallacies, seriously corroding the minds of some people.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong organization plotted, and instigated, through
deception, some Falong Gong practitioners into holding illegally
gatherings outside the Party and government and media
organizations, the circular says. Such activities have seriously
disturbed public order and jeopardized the stable situation of
reform and development.
</P>
<P>
The circular says the fact that some CPC members have also
taken part in such activities has tarnished the image of the party
and made very bad impression in the society.
</P>
<P>
The circular prohibits all Party members from practicing Falun
Gong, attending any activities organized by the Falun Gong
organization, assuming any positions in the Falun Gong
organization, spreading materials of the Falun Gong organization,
or providing places, funds, or other conveniences for activities
of the Falun Gong organization.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks party members to expose and rebut Li Hongzhi
and his Falun Dafa, and aid party organizations and relevant
departments to help people understand the issue.

The circular says that for those Party members who practiced
Falun Dafa, but can break ties with the Falun Gong organization on
their own and make a clean ideological break with it, no questions
will be raised.
</P>
<P>
Those who have engaged in organizing and publicizing Falun Gong
as key members will not be investigated or held responsible if
they break away from the organizations on their own, and draw a
clear ideological line of demarcation with Falun Gong, and expose
the problems of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Party members who are important key members of the Falun Gong
organization and have committed serious mistakes will be given
disciplinary punishment according to Party discipline, the
circular says. But those who repent or render meritorious service
will have their disciplinary punishment reduced or not be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
Those who refuse to correct their mistakes after repeated
education will be asked to give up their Party membership, the
circular says, and those who refuse to give up their Party
membership will be expelled from the Party.
</P>
<P>
Those few behind-the-scenes figures, plotters, and organizers
who caused disturbances on purpose with political intentions will
resolutely be cleared out of the Party, it says.

<P>
The circular says that "exposing and refuting Li Hongzhi and
his Falun Dafa is a serious political struggle," and every Party
member should have a deep understanding of the political nature
and severe harm of the Falun Gong organization.
</P>
<P>
Falun Dafa, also called Falun Gong, was pieced together in
northeast China's Changchun City by Li Hongzhi, now aged 47, on
the basis of two Chinese Qigong forms, and incorporates some dance
movements.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of people's desire to rid themselves of
illness and achieve physical fitness, Li first disguised himself
as someone skilled at "curing sickness with Qigong." He then began
enlisting disciples and circulating malicious fallacies to confuse
and cheat people.
</P>
<P>
Li propagated the idea, among others, that the end of the world
is approaching and that mankind will soon be exterminated, and
that he would be the sole savior.
</P>
<P>
The CPC circular calls for educating Party members in Marxist
materialism and atheism, enhancing their political sensitivity and
their political capabilities to differentiate right from wrong in
order to consolidate a correct world outlook and concept of values,
and reinforcing their belief in communism to strengthen the
cohesiveness and combat strength of Party organizations.
</P>
<P>
The notice points out that this education focuses on
transformation and is based on the principle of learning from past
mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the disease to save the
patient.
</P>
<P>
The circular expresses the belief that most of the Party
members who practice Falun Gong will follow the Party's
instructions and correct their mistakes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Security
today issued a notice prohibiting all activities in support of
Falun Gong, which was termed illegal and has been banned.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a decision
banning the Research Society of Falun Dafa and the Falun Gong
organization under its control after judging them to be illegal.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security in its notice prohibits anyone
from hanging up or posting any scrolls, pictures, insignias or
other signs in any place that publicize Falun Dafa or Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The notice says that no one is allowed to distribute books and
other publications, audiovisual materials or any other propaganda
products in any place publicizing Falun Dafa.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also prohibits anyone from rallying people to "
practice Falun Gong in groups," "publicize Falun Dafa," or carry
out any other activities to propagate Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The ministry prohibits activities that support or publicize
Falun Dafa such as holding gatherings, parades, or demonstrations
in the form of sit-ins, or by appealing to higher authorities for
help.

public order by creating fabrications and distortions of fact,
intentionally spreading rumors, or by any other means.

The circular says that Marxist dialectic materialism and
historical materialism represent the world outlook and methodology
of the proletariat, and that the scientific theories of Marxism
established on the basis of this world view should serve as the
spiritual pillar of communists.
</P>
<P>
Falun Dafa as created by Li Hongzhi preaches idealism and
theism and denies all scientific truth, and thus is absolutely
contradictory to the fundamental theories and principles of
Marxism, says the circular.
</P>
<P>
It points to the fact that any CPC member practicing Falun Dafa
has completely gone against the Party's nature and tenets, and
therefore shall not be tolerated by Party discipline.
</P>
<P>
In the face of this significant issue which involves the
fundamental beliefs of the communists, concerns the ideological
foundation for people across the country to unite behind and
strive together with, and has a bearing on the future and destiny
of the Party and the state, every CPC member must take a clear and

<HEADLINE> True Face of Li Hongzhi Exposed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Facts have demonstrated that Li
Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, is in fact an evil figure who,
by deceiving, has been seriously disrupting social order and
sabotaging the hard-earned social stability.
</P>
<P>
Li, 47, is also accused of establishing illegal organizations
to erode and harm people in body and soul using fraudulent methods.
</P>
<P>
Li was born on July 7, 1952 in the city of Gongzhuling (
formerly Gongzhuling Town of Huaide County) in northeast China's
Jilin Province. He studied at primary and junior high middle
schools in Changchun, the provincial capital, between 1960 and
1969.
</P>
<P>
From 1970 to 1978, he first worked at an army stud farm, and
then acted as a trumpet player at a forest police unit in Jilin
Province and afterwards served as an attendant at a hotel attached
to the same police unit. In 1982 he was transferred to civilian
work and became a worker at the security department of the
Changchun Cereals Company. In 1991 he quit this job and became
involved in the practice of Qi Gong. In May 1992 he began teaching
and propagating Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
On his fabricated resume, Li proclaimed that he was enlightened
by Buddhist and Taoist masters when he was a child, and that they
had raised his power to a high level. He also claimed that he
possesses supernatural power. He even changed his date of birth to
make it coincide with the birthday of Sakyamuni, the founder of
Buddhism, in an attempt to show that he was the "reincarnation of
Sakyamuni."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Li didn't begin learning Qi Gong until 1988. Based on
the doctrines of two Qi Gong forms, and by emulating certain
styles of foreign dances, Li pieced together Falun Gong. The "
experiences" he has boasted of are sheer fabrications and
outrageous lies.
</P>
<P>
Li set up the Research Society of Falun Dafa in Beijing and
proclaimed himself as the "president", shortly after the
concoction of Falun Gong in 1992. Since then, he has established
39 general teaching centers with more than 1,900 instruction
stations and more than 28,000 exercise spots in different
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Thus, a
complete and systematic organization was formed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he drew up a series of rules and regulations
which standardized and institutionalized Falun Gong and its
activities. This tightly constructed system has enabled Li to
enforce his orders and instructions in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
The Research Society of Falun Dafa and its teaching stations
periodically or irregularly held various mass activities, and they
have several times created plots and instigated a certain number
of Falun Gong followers to besiege and attack some media and
publication units and Party and government departments, seriously
affecting people's normal activities and social order in these
institutions, and disrupting the country's hard-won stability. (

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Deal with Israel over Arrested Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied reports that it was
seeking a deal with Israel over the release of the 13 Iranian Jews
arrested on charge of spying for Israel, Iran's Tehran Times daily
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is like a bad joke and carries no truth," Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said in an interview with the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Asefi was responding to a report carried by the Israeli Yedioth
Ahronoth daily on Wednesday that Israel has rejected a proposal
made by Iran for a deal over the 13 arrested Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Israel rejects any link between the 13
Iranian Jews, of whom Israel is trying to seek the release, and
any other disputes between the two countries, including Iran's
claim that Israel owes it 1 billion U.S. dollars from the days
before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
"In general, from our point of view, the Zionist (Israeli)
regime lacks legitimacy," Asefi said. "We do not officially
recognize it, therefore, such rumors are published for propaganda
purposes."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said the Israeli anti-Iran propaganda
would not have any impact on the international public opinion on
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tehran Times said an Iranian informed source has
confirmed Iran's claim on Israel's debts, but saying that "the
principles and sanctities of the Islamic revolution are more
important than dollars."
</P>
<P>
Israel and western countries have urged Iran to release the 13
Iranian Jews as both Israel and the United States have denied any
links between their intelligence services and the arrested Jews.
</P>
<P>
Iran has turned down the calls for the release of the Jews, but
promised to give them a fair trial according to Iranian laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
All these facts show that Falun Gong is a highly organized,
fully functional, and unregistered illegal organization headed by
Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi has taken advantage of Falun Gong to amass huge
amount of money and evaded large sum of taxes. When he began to "
spread Falun Gong", Li collected "benevolent money" from his
followers in the name of curing diseases. In 1993 and 1994 alone,
Li Hongzhi collected 1.217 million yuan by giving courses and
selling books, according to incomplete statistics. With this money
Li purchased luxury residences and expensive cars in Beijing and
Changchun under the names of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
On April 25 this year, more than 10,000 Falun Gong followers
gathered outside Zhongnanhai, the compound housing the
headquarters of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in
downtown Beijing, seriously disrupting social order and affecting
people's daily lives in this area, and creating an extremely
harmful impact at home and abroad. After this incident, Li lied to
the international media when he said, "I knew nothing about it
beforehand."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Li Hongzhi flew into China on April 22 and stayed in
Beijing for 44 hours. On the second day of his entry, the
gathering of Falun Gong followers at the Tianjin Normal University
escalated. On the morning of April 24, while Li was still in China,
many Falun Gong centers received a notice calling on followers to
"collectively practice Falun Gong" outside Zhongnanhai. When the "
April 25 Incident" took place, Li Hongzhi was in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li's evil instructions and fallacious ideas are extremely
harmful. According to Li, practicing Falun Gong will enable the
human spirit to exist forever and help people enter a heavenly
paradise. He has proclaimed that diseases are punishments for the
debts a person owed in his previous life, and those who oppose
Falun Gong are "demons."
</P>
<P>
Cheated and hoodwinked by Li's malicious fallacy, some
followers refused to go to the hospital for medical treatment when
they became ill, and a number of them died as a result. Some
people committed suicide or became psychopathic after practicing
Falun Gong, and others even turned into cold-blood killers. There
are numerous cases demonstrating the disastrous effects of Falun
Gong.

BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Cases of dire consequences caused
by Falun Gong to the psychological and physical health of people
are innumerable, according to facts collected by certain
departments.
</P>
<P>
Serious results have been reported, including sickness,
handicaps, and even death from the practice of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Since beginning the practice of Falun Gong, many people have
lost their appetites, some appeared to be disorganized in words
and behavior, and some became paranoid. Still others found
themselves suffering from hallucinations. A number of people
jumped into rivers or off buildings, or killed themselves in other
ways. Some even cruelly injured or killed relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jianmin, a retired worker from the Huabei Oilfield in north
China, was often in a trance and became distraught after two years
of practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Ma insisted that he had a "wheel of law" in his stomach. Then,
one day in 1998, Ma died at home after he cut his abdomen with a
pair of scissors to look for the so-called wheel of law.
</P>
<P>
Official Gao Encheng, who became a leader of a Falun Gong
practicing group in Kaixian County of Chongqing Municipality in
southwest China, got the idea that he had become an "immortal."
Gao killed himself by jumping off a building while holding his son
in his arms.
</P>
<P>
Bai Changyu, a section chief geologist at a coal mine in
northeast China's Fushun City, refused to see doctor or take any
medicine when he was sick after he began practicing Falun Gong in
1997.
</P>

Bai became seriously ill in April 1999, but still refused

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Puts Off Myanmar Minister's Visit to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has asked Myanmar
Commerce Minister Kyaw Than postpone his scheduled August 3-7
visit to Dhaka till December, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting competent sources, a front-paged report in the
newspaper said Dhaka's decision was communicated to Yangon on
Wednesday, which was seen as a diplomatic response to Myanmar's
non-committal stance on the issue of refugee repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The date of the Myanmar commerce minister's visit was confirmed
by Foreign Minister U Win Aung when he was on a trip here earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Yangon's failure to give a concrete assurance for the return of
some 21,000 stranded Rohingya refugees during the Myanmar foreign
minister's visit may have prompted Dhaka to ask for the
postponement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But officials from the Commerce Ministry denied that the
postponement was linked with the refugee issue, saying that
Bangladeshi Commerce Minister Tonal Ahmed would be unavailable in
Dhaka during the period.
</P>
<P>
They said Ahmed would have to leave for Male, the Maldives
early next month to attend a SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) commerce ministers' meeting, and would visit
some other countries in the capacity as the spokesperson of the
Least Developed Countries for WTO-related issues.
</P>
<P>
The report said it was a big disappointment for Bangladesh that
the Myanmar foreign minister did not give any concrete assurance
regarding that fate of the large number of Rohingya refugees who
have been staying in two UNHCR camps in Cox's Bazar, southeastern
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka was expecting that the stalled repatriation process would
resume after the visit of the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has taken back some 230,000 refugees out of more than
250,000 since the Rohingya refugees crossed the Bangladeshi border
in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China today increased its cellular
phone number digits to 11 from the previous 10, expanding its
network capacity by 10-fold, according to the Ministry of
Information Industry (MII).
</P>
<P>
This is the largest mobile phone network upgrade in the world,
and also the first time China has increased phone numbers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
By upgrading, the country's mobile phone network is now able to
serve 250 million to 280 million users, said an official of the
MII.
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, all existing cellular phone numbers will have
a "0" inserted between their third and fourth digits. All current
phone operations and functions will otherwise remain unchanged,
said the MII official, adding that the upgrading will not affect
international roaming operations.
</P>
<P>
The number of cellular phone users in China has snowballed
during the past decade. For example, the number of China Telecom
users has increased on average by 70 percent annually since it
started the service in 1987.
</P>
<P>
With some 28 million users so far, China boasts the third
largest cellular phone network after the United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Letters Express Support for Japanese Veteran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,700 letters and wall
scrolls from China and other countries have been sent here since
early December in 1998 expressing support for Shiro Azuma, the
Japanese veteran who published his wartime diary recording the
atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in China during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
The letters and scrolls also express strong protests against
the Tokyo Higher Court's ruling against Shiro Azuma.
</P>
<P>
These letters and scrolls have come from all over China, the
United States, Denmark, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Thailand
and Malaysia, and were signed by 55,110 people.
</P>
<P>
Most of them extend a firm support to Shiro Azuma, and urge the
Tokyo Higher Court to respect history and judge justly.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangdongmen Memorial Hall here in east China's Jiangsu
Province, which was built to commemorate the victims of the
Nanjing Massacre that claimed the lives of 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians in 1937, is now processing these letters
and scrolls.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese association supporting Shiro Azuma has decided to
take some of these letters to Japan as evidence to be presented to
the Japanese Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma, recruited into the Japanese army and sent to China
in 1937, was engaged in intruding battles to occupy major Chinese
cities including Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuhan,
and recorded all this in his diary.
</P>
<P>
He published part of the diary in Japan in 1987, but was later
sued by a former soldier who was described in the diary as a war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made known or any action taken against
him.

<HEADLINE> State Sector Enjoys Better Performance in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Intensified reform and industrial
restructuring has enabled the state sector in northern China's
Tianjin Municipality to reverse a declining trend and begin to
enjoy an upturn.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the city show that state industrial
output increased by 6.4 percent during the first six months this
year, with the output of the large- and medium-sized enterprises
rising 6.62 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Technological renovation of the state sector is the major
reason behind the upturn. The municipal government has accelerated
these renovations in recent years, initiating high-tech projects
in the sector and introducing overseas capital into them to
upgrade their technological level.
</P>
<P>
A total of 352 million US dollars in overseas investment has
come into 21 technological renovations projects in the state
enterprises in Tianjin during the first five months this year.
</P>
<P>
Competitive products with good market prospects were developed
as a result of the technological renovations, which have become a
new growth point for the state sector. Statistics showed that
Tianjin achieved 9.8 billion yuan (1.18 billion US dollars) in
output value from 850 items of newly developed products during the
first half this year.
</P>
<P>
Large state enterprise groups also received support from the
municipal government to increase economic efficiency, and the ten
largest enterprises in electronics, light industry, and machinery
in Tianjin realized nearly 50 percent of their industrial added
value during the January-May period.
</P>
<P>
To pull the state sector out of difficulties, Tianjin has
turned 114 large- and medium-sized state enterprises into joint-
stock companies, merging 17 inefficient enterprises during the
first six months this year. Of the 38 deficit-ridden state
enterprises, the municipal government has helped seven erase their
deficits and achieve profits, with 23 reducing deficits by wide
margins.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Biggest Economic Hub to Boost Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ho Chi Minh City People's
Committee has decided to spend 5,335 billion Vietnamese dong (384
million U.S. dollars) to develop socio-economic infrastructure to
boost the local production, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Money will be used to upgrade major inner city roads,
bridges, water supply systems, residential housing, hospitals,
schools, and to buy new equipment in an effort to stimulate demand
for consumption.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City is Vietnam's biggest economic hub. In the
first six months of the year, However, the city's economy grew
slowly with the gross domestic product increasing by only 5.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
A report of the People's Committee of the city said that
although significant improvement was recorded in the second
quarter of the year, economic obstacles remained numerous, with
little hope of a return to the previous high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
A number of outstanding social problems also hinder economic
growth, such as unemployment, a population explosion caused by
immigration, a shortage of hospitals, homelessness, begging,
rampant breaches of the law, corruption and other social evils.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of this year, about 1,000 billion Vietnamese
dong (about 72 million U.S. dollars) will be invested in major
projects already approved by the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
The city government will also provide more incentives to
encourage all economic sectors to invest in developing
infrastructure, purchasing advanced machinery and technology as
well as expanding markets and boosting the local production.

million dollar global environment facility grant for Bangladesh's
fisheries project, according to a WB press release reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The credit, which will be provided by the International
Development Association, will be used for the implementation of
Bangladesh's 4th fisheries project to increase
environmentally-friendly and sustainable fish and shrimp
production.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the project is to support
environmentally-friendly and sustainable fish and shrimp
production for domestic consumption and exports, and to help fight
poverty in Bangladesh by improving the livelihood of people who
depend on fishing," Benson Ateng, project task leader for WB's
South Asia Rural Development Unit, said.
</P>
<P>
"At full operation, the project will account for about 22,000
tons in incremental fish production and an additional 2,500 tons
of shrimp each year. The project will also provide about 440,000
additional jobs in the fishing industry, especially for the poor
and women," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries is a vital industry in Bangladesh, and it accounts
for about 10 percent of agricultural GDP (gross domestic product),
three percent of GDP, eight percent of the total export earnings,
and a major source of the country's protein intake. The sector now
employs nearly two million full-time fishermen and 12 million
people working part-time.

COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Customs have seized
57 kilograms of 17th century Dutch coins that were being attempted
to be smuggled to Singapore, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The coins were seized by the Customs recently when a man from
Puttalam in Sri Lanka's northwest attempted to smuggle them on a
flight to Singapore, the Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
The Archaeological Department has confirmed that these coins
belong to the 17th century.

However, the department said it is unable to estimate the value
of the coins which are classified as antique goods.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had been ruled by colonizing powers for more than 400
years until 1948 when it gained independence. The Netherlands
ruled Sri Lanka during the 16-17 century.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Presidents Join Appeal To Hollywood On Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. presidents Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter Wednesday joined a group of prominent
Americans in an appeal to the entertainment industry to
voluntarily reduce violence and sex for the protection of children.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon industry leaders in all media, television, film,
music video and electronic games, to band together to develop a
new voluntary code of conduct," wrote the signatories of "An
Appeal to Hollywood."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to those who are reaping great profits to give
something back," said the appeal, which was released at a Capitol
Hill news conference by a bipartisan group of senators.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two former presidents, the 56 signatories
included Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, retired generals
Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell, and entertainer Steve Allen.
</P>
<P>
"American parents today are deeply worried about their children
's exposure to an increasingly toxic popular culture, "the
signatories said.
</P>
<P>
The school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, three months ago
and elsewhere have rekindled efforts in Congress to pressure the
entertainment industry to curtail violence and explicit sexual
content. Fifteen people were killed in the Colorado campus
shooting.
</P>
<P>
Last month President Bill Clinton ordered a study on the
advertising of movies, music and video games to children and a
stricter enforcement of movie ratings.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Theater Owners, in response to
Clinton's requests, agreed to check their photo identification
cards before youths are admitted into cinemas to see R-rated films.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Avoid Clash with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jose Ortiz scored 23 points,
including the final seven in the last 95 seconds, to lift Puerto
Rico a 80-75 triumph over Canada in Olympic men's basketball
qualifying match in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The triumph means that Puerto Rico, 5-1 in round-robin play,
will be able to qualify for the Tournament of Americas in at least
the third place and avoid joining the path with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Steve Nash of the NBA Dallas Mavericks gave Canada a 73-70 lead
on a three-point basket with 2:30 to play, but Ortiz, who would
not be denied in the final minutes, finished with 11 rebounds in
addition to game high scoring honors.
</P>
<P>
Rowan Barret led Canada with 17 points and Todd MacCullouch
added 16.
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico faces an almost certain defeat in Thursday's final
game of round-robin play and could be equaled at 5-2 by Canada and
Argentina if they win Thursday. But tie-breaker rules would not
allow both to move ahead of them in the standings and send them
against the US team.
</P>
<P>
A loss here Wednesday to Canada would have ensured the
Tournament of the Americas hosts a date Saturday against the US
National Basketball Association stars unless they managed to upset
them two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians fell to 4-2 but still control their own fate. A
victory over Venezuela on Thursday will give them no worse than
third place. A loss could drop them into the path of the "Dream
Team."
</P>
<P>
Venezuela must beat Canada by 16 points to play for an Olympic
berth Saturday and must defeat Canada by 42 and have Argentina
lose to advance and avoid the US team.

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt Unveils Assistance Package for Lamb Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Thursday announced an assistance package of up to 14 million
Australian dollars (9.24 million U.S. dollars) to help Australia's
lamb industry following U.S. import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed Trade Minister Mark Vaile made the announcement
at the New South Wales Farmers Association conference in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The government will also establish a lamb industry development
program which costs up to 3 million Australian dollars (1.98
million U.S. dollars) a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
This funding comes on top of the 14-million-Australian dollar
package announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vaile said Australia would not follow the unjust, myopic and
sadly protectionist move of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Vaile's announcement was made on the day the new U.S. tariffs
come into effect and the Australian lamb producers are to hold a
"barbie with Bill" protest.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide assistance to lamb producers by
paying for up to two years the equivalent of half the transaction
levy applying to all lamb sold in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"As the prime minister (John Howard) said very directly to the
president (Bill Clinton) in Washington, no trade issue in recent
memory has galvanized our farmers, an indeed ordinary Australians,
like the lamb dispute," Vaile said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. decision is without a rational basis, unjust and
hypocritical," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan Funds Six Major Sri Lankan Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan has pledged to grant Sri
Lanka 23,476 million Japanese yen (190 million U.S. dollars) as
soft loans for six development projects, Finance Ministry sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of letters for the six loans were signed here
Wednesday by officials on behalf of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the 32nd of the such packages extended on an annual
basis. The yen loans, granted by Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF) of Japan, are extended on very concessionary terms,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates on the loans are in the range of 0.75 to 1.8
percent and are repayable in 30 to 40-year periods with a 10-year
grace period.
</P>
<P>
The largest loan is for the expansion of the Bandaranaike
International Airport in suburbs north of Colombo which includes
provision for a new passenger terminal, cargo terminal, taxi way,
apron and air navigational facilities.
</P>
<P>
Two loans have been provided for road improvement and another
for the Poverty Alleviation Micro Finance Project implemented by
the Rural Credit Department of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Yet another loan has been allocated for a water supply project
to reduce wastage of water in the greater Colombo area.
</P>
<P>
The sixth loan is to finance the dredging of the north channel
of the Colombo port to open it for bigger vessels.

<HEADLINE> WHO Awards Chinese Anti-Smoking Campaigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese became this year's
winners of an anti-smoking award presented by the World Health
Organization (WHO) for their devotion to anti-smoking campaigns in
the world's largest tobacco-consuming country.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairwoman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, and Zhang Yifang, vice-president of the
Chinese Association on Smoking and Health, received the WHO award
in Beijing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
WHO has granted the honor to seven Chinese people and five
Chinese organizations since 1989, including renowned medical
expert Wu Jieping and former Health Minister Chen Minzhang, and
the China Central Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang acknowledged that health risks
from tobacco use "remain serious," despite Chinese government
efforts to control smoking since 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Tougher measures should be taken to increase health education
and curb the rising rate of smoking among teenagers," Zhang said
at the award ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A total of 320 million smokers in China makes it the world's
biggest consumer of tobacco products. Statistics from the Ministry
of Health show that the rate of smokers in China's population
increased 3.74 percentage points in the 1984-1996 period, and the
mortality rate from lung cancer, which is believed to be one
result of smoking, has risen 4.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry and the Chinese Association on Smoking and Health,
the country's leading anti-smoking organization, have encouraged
85 cities to ban smoking in public places. The advertising of
tobacco products now is being phased out in major Chinese cities.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China has begun setting up its
first marine environment monitoring system in the East China Sea
off Shanghai, the country's leading industrial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
The system, scheduled to be operational next year, will consist
of satellites, platforms on the sea, radar, underwater instruments,
and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The system is jointly funded by China's Ministry of Science and
Technology, the State Oceanic Administration, and the Shanghai
Municipal People's Government, and will be connected to local
information networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Experts have referred to this system as a new step toward a
standard global oceanic environment monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
They note that, by providing information on the environment of
the seas, the new system will greatly help raise China's
capability to combat ocean-related disasters and pollution, and
better develop marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of China's ocean disasters occur in the East
China Sea, causing huge economic losses each year.

<HEADLINE> Agronomy Improving Lives Of China's Ethnic Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- More developed agronomy has been
used on the Pamir Plateau where members of the Tajik ethnic group
live, in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The majority of them live in the Tajik Autonomous County 4,000
meters above sea level, where there are only some 70 frost-free
days a year and an annual average of 69 mm of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the county began experimenting with growing wheat
under plastic sheeting and they began getting yields of 4,500 kg.
per ha, three times the previous highest output of highland barley.
The technique was then applied to elsewhere in China last year and
grain outputs reached 5,300 tons, 1,300 tons more than for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
This relatively poor county produced more than enough food
grain for the first time in history last year, greatly increasing
farmers' enthusiasm for more modern agronomy, says an official in
charge the county's agriculture and forestry.
</P>
<P>
The county has trained 60 technicians who show farmers how to
grow vegetables in greenhouses and how to improve the breeds of
animals. Artificial insemination and other forms of breeding have
helped local farmers improve 80 percent of their 90,000 big-tail
sheep and experiment with crossing cattle and yaks.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Retains No.33 in 1999 Global Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has retained a rank
of No. 33 in the World Economic Forum's 1999 Global
Competitiveness Report, the newspaper Today said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, which rates 59 countries around the world in terms
of the factors that allow economies to compete in the global
market, is made up of eight factors of competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines ranked 38th in finance, 41st in technology,
24th in management, 42nd in openness, 12th in government, 46th in
infrastructure, 28th in labor, and 49th in the strength of its
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The country's rankings for openness, government,
infrastructure, labor and strength of institutions all dropped in
the past year while it showed improvement in the finance,
technology, and management factors.
</P>
<P>
In terms of microeconomic competitiveness factors, the
Philippines improved marginally from 45th in 1998 to 44th this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said staff training programs, marketing expertise,
customer orientation, quality of business education, and financial
market sophistication gave the Philippines some additional
competitive edge. But the country continues to be pulled back by
handicaps in its air transport infrastructure, telephone/fax
infrastructure, and the extent of "irregular payments," or
corruption.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday called for the definite
elimination of the use of children and minors, below the age of 18,

At a press conference held at the U.N. body's Colombian

Citing statistics from Colombia's Defense Council, Adorno said
there were 6,000 minors linked to the country's armed groups
between 1996 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Expanded Enrollment to Bolster Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An increase in the number of
students enrolling in college this year is expected to give a shot
in the arm to sluggish domestic consumption, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) and the
Ministry of Education announced in the middle of last month that
the country will enroll 331,000 college students more than
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
This means that 1.53 million of the 3.4 million students who
took part in this month's entrance examination will be admitted to
college.
</P>
<P>
"The average college student spends about 10,000 yuan (1,200 U.
S. dollars) a year on tuition fees, accommodation and living
expenses, so the expansion will raise consumption by another 3
billion yuan (360 million U.S. dollars)," said Li Shouxin, deputy
director of the SDPC's Social Development Department.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks are holding a record 6 trillion yuan (725 billion
U.S. dollars) in individual deposits and more people are willing
to splash out on their children's education, especially in the
higher education sector.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said that, if people spend 10 percent of their savings on
education, that will release 600 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of enrollment will also spur on the construction
of educational infrastructure, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion will give more high school students access to
higher education.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.67 percent of Chinese have received higher education,
compared with 3 percent in India and Thailand and 21 percent in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The expansion in enrollment will force universities to exploit
their potential fully, in both the teaching and logistical sectors,
so that they can accommodate more students.
</P>
<P>
Wu Qidi, president of Tongji University in Shanghai, said that
in most Chinese universities, the teacher: student ratio is about
1:8, compared with 1:14 in developed countries, so there is scope
for adjustment, the paper reports.

<HEADLINE> Chile Says Argentina Backs It on Whether to Attend Ibero-American Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes said Wednesday that Argentine President Carlos
Menem would follow Chile's suit concerning the Ibero-American
Summit, to be held in Cuba at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said this after returning from a visit to Argentina at
the beginning of the week, when Menem said he would do the same if
Chilean President Eduardo Frei does not attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Frei has suspended any decision related to his participation in
the summit, because of the way Spain has interpreted a document
which limits the extra-territorial law signed at the last Ibero-
American summit in Portugal, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Spain, to be present at the meeting, detained Chile's lifetime
senator Augusto Pinochet last year in a London hospital and has
not initiated an extradition process.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said Chile's reluctance to attend the summit has nothing
to do with the summit itself, adding his country has been a highly
active participant in such gatherings.

<HEADLINE> China Economic Zone to Take Environment into GDP Account (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic zone, the
southernmost island province of Hainan, will become the country's
"ecological avant-garde" in bringing environment considerations
into accounts of local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to a proposal sent by Hainan to the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), an environment
index will be added to other economic figures when calculating the
province's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is under official appraisal and is expected to go
into effect.
</P>
<P>
"China is pinning high hopes on Hainan to avoid conflict
between development and the environment, something which has
become serious in many of the country's fledgling urban areas,"
said Cui Shuhong, an official with SEPA's Ecological Department.
</P>
<P>
In a detailed plan for protecting the environment of this
tropical island, the forest coverage will be extended from 50
percent or 600,000 hectares to 65 percent of the total area in 30
years, and the use of clean energy such as solar, wind, natural
gas and methane, will be greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Hainan have created a blueprint for the rapidly
growing economic zone with agriculture, tourism, and high-tech
industries as the backbone, and in which industrial pollution is
forbidden and the quality of air, rivers, and sea water is assured.
</P>
<P>
"A sound ecological environment is the most valuable resource
for Hainan, appealing to both investors and tourists. It is
worthwhile to sustain this advantage at the expense of one to two
percentage points of GDP growth rate in the short run," said Lin
Shunkun, vice director of the environment department at the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than one hundred sugar and rubber mills will
be closed down in line with the environmental protection project.

<P>
Jin Jianming, a scholar with the Chinese Academy of Engineering
and one of the experts in charge of the project appraisal, called
Hainan's initiative a "creative breakthrough," changing the old
concept rooted in people's minds that ecological resources are
cheap and communal.
</P>
<P>
Jin pointed out that this obsolete idea is a driving force
behind the common mistake of accelerating economic development at
the expense of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Most enterprises would feel reluctant to take the
environmental cost into business accounting, and would regard it
as a burden," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hainan's plan is an advanced method for
coordinating the development of the economy with environmental
concerns.
</P>
<P>
China has been investing heavily in environmental protection
projects, with appropriations in this area accounting for one
percent of the GDP last year, a figure first among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The effect of these efforts, however, has not been obvious, as
many places in China are faced with deteriorating environments,
partly attributable to the ravages of human activities, according
to the SEPA's report for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is expecting Hainan to set an example by
stimulating environmental protection efforts by economic means,
Jin noted.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province in the northeast and Yunnan in the southwest
have both moved to follow suit by introducing higher
environmental protection standards, according to SEPA sources.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to avert the further deterioration of its
environment by year 2000 and bring soil erosion and
desertification under control by 2010. This goal is readily
achievable with the installation of additional measures such as
those planned for Hainan Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted Wednesday to pay for strengthening security
at U.S. embassies around the world one year after the bomb attacks
on two U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed easily by a voice vote, authorized 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars to protect U.S. diplomatic missions from the threat
of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The bill noted that security at half the 250 U.S. facilities
abroad is considered inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"American facilities abroad are under threat as they never have
been before," said Republican lawmaker Benjamin Gilman, chairman
of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also addressed concern over the response of U.S.
law enforcement units to crisis abroad.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is
authorized to immediately lease an aircraft for sending agents to
the site of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
At least 224 people, including 12 Americans, were killed and
thousands injured as U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were
bombed by terrorists last August.
</P>
<P>
Several embassies have been closed for brief periods in recent
weeks because of security lapses or new threats.

<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Noah Ngeny continued to
challenge the middle-distance records at the Paris Golden League
athletics meeting on Wednesday, clocking the fastest 1,500 meters
this season.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny, who pushed Hicham El Guerrouj to the mile world record
in Rome two weeks ago and narrowly missed breaking Sebastian Coe's
1,000m mark at the weekend in Nice, has been the revelation this
season, having also clocked the top four 1,500m times this year.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Ngeny powered past reigning Olympic and three-
time world champion Noureddine Morceli in the final 300 meters,
storming home in three minutes 28.84 seconds which was the seventh
fastest 1,500m ever run and a new Kenyan national record.
</P>
<P>
The meet began with seven athletes chasing a share of the 1
million U.S. dollars Golden League jackpot and finished with only
four, American sprint queen Marion Jones, Romania's Gabriela Szabo,
Denmark's Wilson Kipketer and Kenya's Bernard Barmasai still in
the hunt for a big payday.
</P>
<P>
Jones enjoyed her 18 consecutive 200m victory in a time of 21.
00, beating France's European champion Christine Arron, the 100m
European champion and record holder, to a distant fourth in 22.47.
</P>
<P>
Szabo claimed a season's best time in the 3,000m in 8:25.59
with a powerful last 100 meters, shaving almost two seconds off
the previous best time of the season.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Kipketer produced his third 800m Golden
League victory of the season in 1:44.89 after losing a shoe in the
final sprint.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai, the 3,000m steeplechase world record holder, was also
an easy winner, clocking a comfortable 8:05.71, almost two seconds
clear of Morocco's Ali Ezzine.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia finished
a distant fourth in the 800m with a time of 1:59.25 to stop her
chance of athletics' biggest payday.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's James Beckford brought American Erik Walder's Golden
League dreams to an end with a victory in the long jump of 8.42m
while Walder flew 7.78m.

JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar Wednesday inaugurated
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games contingent at the Senayan
Indoor Tennis Stadium here, The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The contingent consists of 238 male and 112 female athletes
from 20 sports, 162 coaches and 82 officials. They will leave the
country on August 3 using national carrier Garuda Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
KONI's official in charge of athlete development Mochammad
Hindarto said that of 235 events to be featured at Bandar Seri
Begawan from August 7 to 15, Indonesia would not compete in 36
events: 19 events in the track and field, one hockey event, eight
shooting events, two squash and six lawn bowls events.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wismoyo urged athletes to contribute their best
to the country in order to retain the overall title.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Taekwondo Association has a target of three
golds in the SEA Games. But the association secretary-general
Ahmad Zarkasih Hamid was optimistic that the national taekwodoins
would be able to win three golds in the men's sector and two in
the women's sector.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Table Tennis Association has set its sight on
two of the seven golds on offer in the Games. The association's
official R.M.Noeryanto said the country's strongest chances for
gold were in the men's doubles and team events.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Tennis Association has targeted three golds. Two
years ago, national players won golds in the women's singles,
doubles and team event and men's doubles and team.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Basketball Association Chairman Sutiyoso
expressed hope that the national team could grab the silver medal
in the Games.

<HEADLINE> Italian Officials Close Pantani Test Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian sports officials decided on
Wednesday to stop their inquiries into a blood test failure by
national cycling hero Marco Pantani.
</P>
<P>
The anti-doping department of the national Olympic committee (
CONI), which in Italy doubles as the sports ministry, ordered its
inquisition after Pantani was kicked off the Tour of Italy last
month.
</P>
<P>
Pantani had been leading the race but was banned from starting
the penultimate stage at Madonna di Campiglio on June 5 after a
test showed his red corpuscles count to be 52 percent, above the
safety limit of 50.
</P>
<P>
A high count suggests the use of Erythropoietin (EPO), which
boosts the number of red blood cells which carry oxygen around the
body, and markedly improves endurance. However, failing a test
does not prove EPO use.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of investigations, the CONI officials decided no
further inquiry of the athlete which meant the case is now closed.
</P>
<P>
Pantania plans to return in time for the world championship in
Italy in October.

CARACAS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan anti-narcotic
authorities have seized 1.6 tons of marihuana hidden in a boat in
a village on the Margarita Island of the country, a newspaper

</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the National Guard has seized over
one ton of drugs this year, chief of the coast guard Luis Felipe
Montilla was quoted by el Nacional daily as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Montilla said the boat, which came from Maracaibo, might
transport drugs from Colombia and smuggle them to Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Margarita Island is used by drug cartels as a transfer point
since it has 325 kilometers of coast lines, which make the control

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
reiterated the one-China policy on Wednesday as Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of the cross-strait relationship was refuted on both
sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is clear. We favor the one-China policy. We favor
the cross-strait dialogues," Clinton told a White House press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui claimed on July 9 that the cross-straits
relationship should be "state-to-state" or at least "special state-
to-state."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government believes that Lee's flagrant
redefinition of the cross-straits relationship exposed his
political malice and intention to undermine the Chinese
territorial integrity and sovereignty and his attempt to separate
Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the one-China policy is not a "puzzling fiction."
And although Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are not unified today,
the Chinese take a long view, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese tend to take a long view of these things and have
made clear a sensitivity to the different system that exists on
Taiwan and a willingness to find ways to accommodate it, as they
did in working with Hong Kong, and perhaps even going beyond that,
" Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the important thing is ...they need to take the
time necessary to work this out between themselves in a peaceful
way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason on the delay of a Pentagon mission to
Taiwan, Clinton said, "I didn't think this was the best time to do
something which might excite either one side or the other."

<HEADLINE> Brazil Reports 2 Billion U.S. Dollar Surplus for June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
registered a primary surplus of some 2.04 billion U.S. dollars in
June, the Finance Ministry said in a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the positive results recorded in June, the government has
accumulated a primary surplus of 7.22 billion dollars in the first
half of the year, compared with only 1.70 billion dollars in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The favorable balance in June was a result of a surplus of 2.24
billion dollars in the National Treasury and deficits of 184.3
million dollars and 11.2 million dollars in the Social Provision
and the Central Bank respectively.
</P>
<P>
The surplus accounted for 2.6 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP), compared with 0.4 percent in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Also in the report, the Finance Ministry said Brazil's total
debt amounted to 102 billion dollars in June, with more than one
third being internal debt.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 19.3 percent of the GDP, up 3.3
percentage points from that of the same month in 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Set Up Anti-Drug Center in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Ecuador have
completed the first phase of an agreement on the establishment of
an anti-narcotics center in a military base in northeastern
Ecuador, the Ecuadorian military authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A P3 Orion plane of the U.S. air force will land constantly at
the Manta base, in the province of Manabi, and in the future,
another two planes will be added to the electronic vigilance or
counter-measures, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to Ecuador, Charles Wilhelm, chief of
the U.S. South Command, inspected the runway and parking area, in
addition to the elimination of undergrowth at the head of the take-
off platform and runway of the base.
</P>
<P>
An office for the installation of U.S. computers and
communication equipment has already been built on the base.
</P>
<P>
If the United States reaches an accord with the Ecuadorian
authorities, it plans to invest between 20 and 40 million dollars
in improvements to the base, thus permitting the landing and take-
off of radar planes and fuel supply aircraft.
</P>
<P>
An official from the U.S. air force will be resident at the
base to work alongside his Ecuadorian counterpart for the
coordination of planes and to perform the necessary logistical
actions.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Celebrates Hemingway Centenary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cultural circles in Cuba launched a
variety of activities on Wednesday to celebrate the 100th birthday
of late U.S. writer Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
Lectures, conferences and book presentations are among the
events dedicated to the life and work of Hemingway, who lived in
Cuba for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954,
was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, and died on July
2, 1961, in Ketchum, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. writer was at the forefront of cultural circles in
Cuba, because some of his novels were inspired by his life
experiences on the island.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway is described by book critics as an author whose
novels have a strong sense of realism in a concise and direct
style.
</P>
<P>
Among his works are "The Old Man and the Sea" (1952), "For Whom
the Bells Toll" (1940), "To Have and Have Not" (1937), and "
Islands in the Gulf", a posthumous edition published in 1970.
</P>
<P>
According to critics, Hemingway is the second most popular
English-writing author to have his books translated into other
languages, after British authoress Agatha Christie.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. author went to Cuba at the age of 28, in April of the
year 1928. For nine years, he lived in the Hotel "Ambos Mundos" in
Havana, in room 511. The hotel was later converted into a museum.
</P>
<P>
The author, known in Cuba as "Papa," later moved to live in San
Francisco de Paula, on the outskirts of Havana.

<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said yesterday that China
has to step up the pursuit of an active fiscal policy in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech read to a national conference on China's
finance work, Li said that China has decided to take a series of
major measures to step up the active fiscal policy in the second
half of the year, all of which are designed to promote consumption,
investment and exports, accelerate economic restructuring, and
maintain a rapid, healthy and sustainable growth of the national
economy
</P>
<P>
-- The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (
ARATS) Wednesday condemned Lee Teng-hui's separatist remarks and
urged some leaders of its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits
Exchanges Foundation (SEF), to stop attempts to split the
motherland and return to the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Council members of ARATS convened a meeting in Beijing
yesterday and stressed that the "one China" principle is the
foundation for the mutual development of cross-Straits relations
and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
 Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin has signed an order for implementation
of the "Regulations Governing Nonmilitary Cadres Serving in the
People's Liberation Army".
</P>
<P>
The 9-chapter regulations stipulate explicitly the function,
management, training and fixed time of service for nonmilitary
cadres serving in the PLA, as well as policies for selecting
cadres, uniforms, and ranking.
</P>
<P>
-- The separatist forces and the handful of "independence for
Taiwan" activists on China's island province of Taiwan are doomed
to be pilloried by history, along with Lee Teng-hui, says a Xinhua
commentary entitled "Separatism Is A Dead End" yesterday.
</P>
<P>
As is well known, Lee is to blame for the trumpeting of "
independence for Taiwan" because he has gone all out to discourage
and suppress those on the island who advocate the reunification of
the motherland and oppose separatism, the article says, referring
to a saying widespread there that it is Lee Teng-hui who has
breast fed the "independence for Taiwan" forces.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The long-brewing telecom service reorganization, which
targets ending the monopoly of China Telecom and introduces
competition will be completed in the next few months.
</P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Urged to Treat Cigars Like Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal regulators on
Wednesday urged the Congress to mandate tough new health warnings
on cigar labels and place them on the same regulatory footing as
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the government's chief
consumer protection agency, required a ban on television and radio
cigar advertising to dispel the notion that cigars are a safe
alternative to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Total advertising and promotional expenditures for cigars
increased 32 percent to reach 41 million dollars in 1997 from 30.9
million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
After a 20-year decline, cigar consumption in the United States
increased to 5.4 billion in 1998 from 3.4 billion in 1993,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
"Regular cigar smokers are at risk of mouth and throat cancer
similar to that of cigarette smokers," said FTC Chairman Robert
Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
There may be people under the misimpression that if they switch
to cigars they are in safe harbors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The commission reported a 15 percent increase in cigar unit
sales and a 43 percent increase in dollar sales from 1996 to 1997,
based on information from the five leading domestic cigar
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Cigar makers said sales, based on wholesale price, rose from
613 million dollars to 876 million dollars from 1996 to 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Recovery Far From Assured: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank warned Indonesia
that its economic recovery was far from assured, despite
heartening progress in economic stabilization efforts, The Jakarta
Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank cited the huge unresolved debts of the private sector,
widespread corporate distress, continuing difficulties in the
banking sector, an unacceptably low level of output, and
increasing poverty as the most pressing problems facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is no time for complacency," said World Bank country
director for Indonesia Mark Baird when releasing the bank's annual
country report on Indonesia here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended three policy priorities to consolidate
stabilization gains in the short term, including pressing ahead
with bank and corporate restructuring, protecting the poor, and
careful management of fiscal balances.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Indonesia From Crisis to Opportunity", will
serve as a briefing report for the upcoming July 27-28
Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) donors meeting in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The report said the proximate cause of the country's economic
crisis, the large amount of short-term private sector unhedged
external debt, remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these debts are owed by distressed corporates, many of
which are insolvent or have ceased operations," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's private sector has some 72 billion U.S. dollars in
overseas debts.
</P>
<P>
The bank said public (government) debt had jumped from 24
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of June, 1997,
to 60 percent at the end of June, 1998, and was expected to reach
102 percent by end-1999, or a fourfold increase from the
pre-crisis period. Official foreign debts alone are now estimated
at almost 70 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the economy was still operating at 15 to 20
percent below capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Resolving these challenges will require steady and determined
economic reforms, placing a premium on policy continuity as the
country goes through political transition," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank stressed that in the banking sector the main focus
should be on restructuring state banks, strengthening bank
supervision, and accelerating the recovery of various assets under
the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency.
</P>
<P>
The bank also stressed the need for Indonesia to manage fiscal
balances carefully by placing greater emphasis on domestic
resource mobilization and reduced borrowing, especially from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The report identifies three medium-term policy priorities:
develop and deepen institutions, especially the legal and judicial
system and the civil service; strengthen markets and market
institutions; and ensure growth is environmentally sustainable.

<HEADLINE> Experts Help Court to Deal With New Type of Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A court in the Chinese capital is
seeking more expert assistance to deal with cases in new areas
such as intellectual property and computer technology, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court (BMHPC) formed an
expert consultation commission Wednesday that includes 48 legal
experts joined by others with special expertise in areas such as
intellectual property and computer technology.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a quickly developing knowledge-based
economy is forcing the court to seek more expert assistance.
</P>
<P>
An intellectual property court under the BMHPC invited experts
to help them with some complicated technical problems encountered
during trials in 1996. But this time, the system will be made
permanent.
</P>
<P>
"Although our judges are experienced and well trained, you can
not expect them to be experts in every high-tech field," said the
court president Zhang Lumin.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Rpt with correction in last two paragraphs Cuba Celebrates Hemingway Centenary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Cultural circles in Cuba launched a
variety of activities on Wednesday to celebrate the 100th birthday
of late U.S. writer Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
Lectures, conferences and book presentations are among the
events dedicated to the life and work of Hemingway, who lived in
Cuba for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954,
was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, and died on July
2, 1961, in Ketchum, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. writer was at the forefront of cultural circles in
Cuba, because some of his novels were inspired by his life
experiences on the island.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway is described by book critics as an author whose
novels have a strong sense of realism in a concise and direct
style.
</P>
<P>
Among his works are "The Old Man and the Sea" (1952), "For Whom
the Bells Toll" (1940), "To Have and Have Not" (1937), and "
Islands in the Gulf", a posthumous edition published in 1970.
</P>
<P>
According to critics, Hemingway is the second most popular
English-writing author to have his books translated into other
languages, after British authoress Agatha Christie.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. author went to Cuba at the age of 28, in April of the
year 1928. For nine years, he occupied room 511 at the Ambos
Mundos Hotel in Havana. The room has been refurbished and opened
to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The author, known in Cuba as "Papa," later moved to live in San
Francisco de Paula, on the outskirts of Havana. His home, called
La Vigia (the watch tower), has been converted into a museum.
