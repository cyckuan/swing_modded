FINE DOESN'T BOTHER SHAQ

   BOSTON _ The NBA took another $10,000 out of Shaquille O'Neal's
pocket Monday, but he hardly winced at the news. In fact, he
danced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got fined 10!'' he said in mock glee, then smiled and
did a little jig for the benefit of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal earned the dock in pay for calling officials ``(bleeping)
idiots'' after he fouled out of Thursday's win at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about the NBA tax,'' he said Monday. ``I
don't complain about FICA, I don't complain about income tax, I
don't complain about the NBA tax. It is what it is. What can you
do? Can't do nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score at home, that's $20,000 O'Neal has lost
this season to what he also termed ``The D.S. tax _ the David Stern
tax.'' He previously was fined by the commissioner's office for his
Nov. 10 melee with Houston's Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he got his money's worth or not,'' quipped
Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who paid his own $5,000 fine for
criticizing officials earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson lightly chided reporters for ``baiting'' O'Neal into the
remarks, but said he's not worried about his center's attitude
toward officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Shaq really on the court berate an official.
He seems to keep that pretty much inside,'' Jackson said.
``Sometimes I wish he'd be more vocal with officials, on the court,
on the spot, when the call happens, if it's a bad call.... He keeps
that stuff inside, and sometimes I think it just bubbles up (after
the game), and I wish he would get rid of some of that emotion
while he's there (on the court).''
</P>
<P>
   Dribbles: Monday's game against the Boston Celtics was the next
to last to be played on the FleetCenter's old parquet floor. The
Celtics play their final game on the half-century-old floor
Wednesday, then unveil a new floor, a replica of the original, on
Jan. 3....
</P>
<P>
   Lakers forward Travis Knight became a father last Wednesday,
when his girlfriend gave birth to a 7-pound, 15-ounce, 19{-inch
girl, named Natasha. Knight, 25, said both mother and baby are
doing fine.

SPORTS COLUMN: SILAS REFUSES VAN GUNDY'S HANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The young man's name is Eddie Robinson, out of Flint,
Mich., and off a trail of small-college basketball outposts not
likely to appear on Dick Vitale's itinerary any time soon. He is 6
feet 8 inches, with a 43-inch vertical leap and a jump shot that
belies the general state of bricklaying in the modern game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A special talent,'' Paul Silas said on Monday, leaving a
morning rehearsal for Monday night's 112-109 overtime loss at
Madison Square Garden to the Knicks. ``But he's just a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie raw, in other words, but another potential superstar for
Jeff Van Gundy to marvel over during his weekly homage to
Charlotte's budding dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets didn't make the playoffs last spring but Van Gundy,
coach of the defending Eastern Conference champs, has been touting
Silas' team as the most talented in the East. Silas, whose Hornets
had been living up to Van Gundy's expectations until their
eight-game winning streak was snapped on Monday night, has not been
flattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to talk to him about it,'' Silas said with
the same steeliness that led him to more than 12,000 career
rebounds. ``What Jeff's been saying is a whole lot of. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   He edited himself, letting us fill in the blank.
</P>
<P>
   What Silas was saying was that coaching a National Basketball
Association team is difficult enough without having a peer publicly
inflate the quality of a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he thinks if we do well, it'll make people think that's
the way it was supposed to be,'' Silas said. ``Jeff keeps talking
about all our talent, but I could ask him, would he trade a bunch
of his players for mine? Would he trade Houston, Sprewell and Camby
for a bunch of my guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not after Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston _ finally
paired in the backcourt _ put 61 points on the board, Marcus
Camby's defense helped shut down the lane and the Knicks recovered
from 17.9 percent first-quarter shooting with a 57-38 domination of
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to use Paul's team for motivational
purposes,'' Van Gundy said afterward. ``I have too much respect for
him. When I first came in the league, he looked out for me. I've
only been saying that I believe he has a good club and he's done a
great job.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying issue here is that six years after Van Gundy
joined the organization in 1989, as a walk-on with no pro
experience, he became head coach. One of sport's most fierce and
respected players, Silas' first head coaching job was with the old
San Diego Clippers, as inept a franchise as Los Angeles' new
Clippers. His three-year run ended in 1983. For 16 years, he sat as
an assistant on numerous NBA benches, including New York's, and
watched other men pass him by for the league's choice jobs.
</P>
<P>
   From Pat Riley to Van Gundy, Rick Adelman to Mike Dunleavy, Paul
Westphal to Danny Ainge. A white player _ Scott Skiles last week in
Phoenix _ can dream of building his reputation with first-class
talent. A black player _ Lionel Hollins last week in Vancouver _
can hope to be named interim coach of a desperate team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed much,'' Silas said. ``You look at Lionel up
in Vancouver. Hopefully, he'll do better than the other guy but
what are the chances?''
</P>
<P>
   Silas, at 56, replaced Dave Cowens last season, before the
slumping Hornets traded for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones. Under
Silas, they won 22 of 35. Only then did he have the interim collar
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Perception of coaches is part of an NBA mythology that is old as
Red Auerbach. When Riley won big with the 1980s Lakers, he was
hailed as a well-groomed genius. Over with the Celtics, K.C. Jones
was credited for sitting back and letting Larry Bird run the show.
It's hard to believe that Van Gundy would try to set Silas, or
intentionally use him as a motivational prop. But, given the way
things work and the way Silas waited, it is understandable why he'd
be sensitive to the hint of the old stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I have known each other long enough to not even go
there,'' Silas said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Van Gundy, Silas doesn't go to work in paradise. The
Hornets' owner, George Shinn, was recently involved in a sordid
public fiasco. Van Gundy, meanwhile, has a pretty good idea what
it's like to coach Anthony Mason. Charlotte's other starting
forward is the always endearing Derrick Coleman, who strolled into
Monday's shoot-around 30 minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I said, they are the most talented team in the
East,'' an unsmiling Silas said after the game. Van Gundy may not
want to argue this point anymore.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He's back.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that has been woefully short on highlights,
tonight's game has likely been circled in red on many a Rockets
fan's calendar.
</P>
<P>
   That's because former Rocket (for however brief a period)
Scottie Pippen returns to town with his new team, the Portland
Trail Blazers, who meet the Rockets tonight at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's exit from Houston has been pretty well-documented _ a
calculated barrage of insults directed at teammate Charles Barkley
designed to hasten Pippen's departure. His intended landing spot
was Los Angeles, where Pippen had hoped to be reunited with former
Bulls coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pippen wound up in Portland, where the Blazers were
immediately dubbed the NBA's next juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   But in an apparent case of ``that was then, this is now,''
Pippen now regrets how he left town. He admits that he had a
personality conflict with Barkley, but
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a little bit of everything,'' Pippen said of
his disagreements with Barkley. ``We didn't handle things _ and
maybe myself more than anybody _ the way we should have. We
probably should have spoken person-to-person and handled it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally like Charles, and I enjoyed being around him.
He's a character. He's like being with a comedian or something. But
he's a good-hearted person. I hate that things got ticked off like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And suffice it to say that things got very ``ticked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way he left town, the Pippen story has taken on
the proportions of a Shakespearean tragedy. Or at least a soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   But it's probably more like the Dr. Seuss tale How the Grinch
Stole Christmas. And all the Hous here in Hou-ville are still
crying boohoo over the departure of Pippen, who was dealt to
Portland in the offeseason for six players, among whom were keepers
like Carlos Rogers and Kelvin Cato.
</P>
<P>
   And very much like the Grinch, many Rockets fans studied
Pippen's play and figured that his heart was two sizes too small.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though Pippen's heart has grown in the past couple
of months, though. Perhaps seeing Barkley's career end with a torn
quadriceps tendon has mellowed Pippen somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said that whatever his disagreements with Barkley,
watching him being carried off the court in Philadelphia was no way
for such a great career to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're human, and things like that can be very emotional, not
being able to walk away from the game,'' Pippen said. ``Charles was
looking forward to playing this season. No matter how you look at
it, he was looking forward to going around and being taunted (by
the fans) _ all those things he's really going to miss. People hate
him so much that everybody loves (to taunt) him. Everybody loves to
hear what he has to say, get a laugh from him or get him talking
about whatever. It would be tough for any athlete to go that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wanted to walk away from the game (on his own
terms). I think he's been put in a tough situation right now where
he has to go out and rehab and all those things, knowing that he's
not coming back to the game, which sort of brings the challenge
down a little bit for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really have to fight to bring himself back to where
he's been competitive, like he has his whole life. So I'm sure it's
pretty tough for him. You hate to see that happen to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   What Houstonians hate is that Pippen so nicely landed on his
feet in Portland. The Los Angeles Clippers would have been nice. Or
Vancouver. Chicago would have been perfect, even though there was
no way that was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   And if the reaction last Saturday is any indication, the
Rockets' marketing people missed out on a great opportunity for a
corporate tie-in by not getting the folks at Sucrets to sponsor
some sort of giveaway tonight. Saturday's announcement of the
Rockets' next home game, against the Trail Blazers, drew a
protracted round of boos from the 15,000-plus who attended that
game.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be worse tonight, and Pippen is expecting just
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look forward to it,'' Pippen said. ``That's just part of
the game. It's going to be an incentive for me to just go out and
do the things that I know I can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the game. It always has been, and it always
will be part of the game. The only game they don't allow that in is
golf. So you have to be able to deal with the fans and just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said he doesn't expect a reception similar to what Steve
Francis received in Vancouver, where fans hurled tomatoes, lemons
and eggs at the rookie point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they need to be throwing anything on the
court,'' Pippen said. ``If it's that personal, then they need to
come down on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have already played the Blazers once, losing in
overtime at the Rose Garden (91-88 on Nov. 26), but Pippen doesn't
think that, or the fact Barkley and Olajuwon will be out, takes the
edge off tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going out there and competing against Charles and
Hakeem anyway,'' Pippen said. ``It's about me beating the Rockets.
We still feel like we're a better team. I don't think that takes
any edge off it. I think they still feel like they should have won
the game when they came to our building, so it's going to make
(today's) game that much tougher for us because they're going to
come out with the mindset that they can beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Which seems to be a pretty prevalent sentiment these days when
the Blazers take the floor. After starting the season 13-2, the
Blazers have since gone 5-5 and have won three of those games by a
total of 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done some great things, but we've had some slippage here
of late and not played very consistently,'' Pippen said. ``But our
ballclub is still learning each other, and we're still trying to
better ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night that we go out on the court, we're capable of
beating some people. But we haven't hit that dominance that we need
to be the good team that people are saying that we are. It hasn't
come together yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither have he and Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen admits he hasn't contacted Barkley since the
career-ending injury, and isn't sure if such a move is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Pippen said. ``I'm sure we'll run across each
other somewhere in life. Maybe I'll get invited to his retirement
party.''

 Woman who used `Viagra defense' sentenced in man's death   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At her sentencing Monday, Mary Frost
recounted for a Jackson County Circuit Court judge the night in
June 1998 that she says her 77-year-old housemate went from asking
for sex to trying to rape her.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Fingers' use of Viagra had made him increasingly
aggressive, her defense attorney had argued in trial, and Frost was
defending herself when she killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I protected myself,'' Frost, 33, told the judge Monday after
spending about 20 minutes explaining how Fingers chased her
throughout the house during their struggle. ``This man wouldn't be
dead if he hadn't done this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, Judge Jay A. Daugherty sentenced Frost to 18
years in prison, less than the 20 years prosecutors had requested
but more than the 10 to 13 years her attorney had sought.
</P>
<P>
   In October a jury convicted Frost of second-degree murder and
armed criminal action after deciding that, even if Frost's story
was true, she could have escaped without stabbing Fingers to death.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Kate Mahoney argued that Frost should receive a long
sentence because her criminal record showed a pattern of
increasingly violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said Frost pleaded guilty to second-degree assault in
1996. When Fingers was killed, Frost was on probation stemming from
an aggravated assault charge in a February 1998 stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   While on probation, Frost was supposed to attend anger control
classes and maintain steady employment. She did neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think, as we've seen here today,'' Mahoney concluded,
``she shows no remorse for her actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost's attorney argued that the jury was not allowed to hear
about her background.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jarrett Johnson said a family member raped Frost
repeatedly when Frost was a child. She also was the victim of a
random abduction and rape and domestic abuse, he said.
Nevertheless, Frost was able to get a technical degree in the
nursing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried to become a productive member of society,'' Johnson
said. ``I think Mary Frost is a person who has repeatedly found
herself in a situation where she is a victim.''

 Don't blame every techno-glitch on Y2K, White House Y2K czar says (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ For about 12 hours, U.S. Army Maj. Eric Van
Vliet was a computer-glitch multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics instructor at Fort Leavenworth's Army Command and
General Staff College, in Kansas, moved $18,950 into a Charles
Schwab Roth IRA account and found that his investment had
done...well, pretty darn good.
</P>
<P>
   When Van Vliet received the Dec. 8 letter confirming the new
account, his ``credit cash balance'' was $84,281,186.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck, major. A clerical mistake caused a computer
glitch. Your $18,950 transfer was worth...well, about $18,950.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month until 2000, Van Vliet assumed it was a
Y2K problem. It wasn't. And that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   For those dealing with technology, stuff just happens, says John
Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar. And stuff will happen, as
usual, this New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So don't assume every techno-glitch is sparked by Y2K, Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glitches at electric generating plants knock out power to an
average American home for about 13 hours every year _ in addition
to longer outages every year caused by major storms.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad accident happens somewhere in the United States every
5 hours on a typical New Year's Day. On average, low-level
emergencies involving nuclear power plants happen more than twice a
day between Dec. 28 and Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   And about 8 percent to 10 percent of all ATM transactions fail
the first time _ most often because people hit a wrong key when
typing in a pass code or try to take out more money than they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day things go wrong, and nobody pays much attention to
them, nobody thinks twice about it,'' Koskinen said in a news
release. ``But any of those things that happen on Jan. 1st will
immediately be presumed to be the indication of a Y2K problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In short? Sure, have a little extra food, cash and even water on
hand Jan. 1. But don't worry. Go party.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen's comments last week were the latest attempt by the
Clinton administration to make sure undue panic does not cause more
problems than Y2K itself.
</P>
<P>
   A ``fact sheet'' put together by Koskinen's office shows how a
variety of problems go unnoticed by consumers every day:
</P>
<P>
   - On a bad day, 1 percent of the nation's traffic signals
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   - More than 400 commercial flights are delayed by 15 minutes or
more on a normal New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   - An average, large 911 emergency system experiences one
disruption every week.
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Vliet, well, he knew when he received the letter that
he was not a multimillionaire. But it makes for a good tale.
</P>
<P>
   Van Vliet had moved some Roth IRA funds from another brokerage
to Schwab. The Dec. 8 letter confirming the transaction was
straightforward enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer...to your Charles Schwab account is now
complete....Below is a listing of the assets that have been
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit cash balance...$84,281,186.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for moving your assets to Charles Schwab,'' the
letter concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A responsible investor, Van Vliet called Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was kind of speechless. He kind of chuckled and said,
`Just don't do anything until we call you back,' '' Van Vliet said.
``They basically said they had some problems with automation.''
</P>
<P>
   The $84 million mistake was all on paper. A Schwab spokesman
said the money was never really in Van Vliet's account. It was an
error in a letter that did not affect the account.
</P>
<P>
   How does Van Vliet feel about Schwab?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely pleased with my initial balance,'' Van Vliet
said. ``The gains over that period were like an Internet IPO,'' he
said, referring to the hot-market dot-com stocks that skyrocket
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a prelude, I'm extremely excited about Y2K,'' Van
Vliet said. ``I can't wait for the beginning of the new year.''

INVESTIGATION SHOWS KEMPER MUSEUM'S WATERCOLORS NOT O'KEEFFE'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE THORSON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A collection of watercolors bought for $5
million by Kansas City banker and philanthropist R. Crosby Kemper
Jr. are not the work of noted American artist Georgia O'Keeffe.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper purchased 24 watercolors thought to be early works by
O'Keeffe in 1993. In 1994, he presided over a much-publicized
showing of the paintings as an inaugural exhibit at the Kemper
Museum of Contemporary Art, which he founded and presented with the
watercolors as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit featured 28 watercolors in all, including four
valued at $500,000 that were a gift to the museum from Gerald
Peters, the well-known New York art dealer who sold the 24 works to
Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Kemper learned that the paintings, known as ``The
Canyon Suite'' and most recently shown at the museum in 1997, are
not the work of O'Keeffe.
</P>
<P>
   In an all-day meeting last Wednesday with Kemper Museum
officials, experts from the National Gallery of Art shared
information that caused them to conclude that the ``Canyon Suite''
watercolors are not authentic. The age of the paper on which the
works were painted was not consistent with the 1916-18 dates
attributed to the watercolors; moreover, the types of paper were
different from those O'Keeffe normally used.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the works' authenticity have swirled since early
November, when it became known that they were among 210 works on
paper omitted from a new scholarly catalog of the artist's complete
works written by Barbara Buhler Lynes.
</P>
<P>
   Lynes, an O'Keeffe scholar, was one of the experts who traveled
to the Kemper Museum last week. Joining her were Ruth Fine, curator
at the National Gallery; Judith Walsh, the National Gallery's
senior paper conservator; and Elizabeth Glassman of the O'Keeffe
Foundation. They presented their findings to Kemper at a meeting
also attended by the Kemper Museum's director, Dan Keegan, whom
Kemper has designated as his spokesman in ``The Canyon Suite''
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance were the museum's deputy director, Walter
Dietrich, and a conservator, Mark Stevenson, whom the museum hired
to look into the matter when doubts first surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Keegan said that the museum has accepted the experts'
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've concluded that these works are not authentic, '' Keegan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Ziska, National Gallery press officer, said Monday her
museum would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the works belong to the Kemper, they're the ones making
the statements,'' Ziska said. ``We provided the information to them
and we're leaving it in their hands to discuss specifics about the
works of art.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kemper bought the works from Peters, he was told that they
were created by O'Keeffe from 1916 to 1918, while she was living in
Canyon, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Research for the scholarly catalog, called a catalogue raisonne,
showed that some of the papers dated from the 1930s and some as
late as the 1960s, which threw into question just when the works
were made.
</P>
<P>
   The later dating of the papers also raised doubts about the
works' provenance, the chain of possession after they left
O'Keeffe's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently it was thought she had given the works to her
friend and lover, Ted Reid, in 1918 and that Reid held onto them
until 1975, when he gave them to a friend. The friend, Emilio
Caballero, reportedly accepted the gift in a packet, not knowing
what it contained.
</P>
<P>
   Caballero supposedly forgot about the packet until 1987, when he
rediscovered the works and gave them to his son, who was married to
Reid's granddaughter, Terry Lee Caballero. After O'Keeffe's
assistant, Juan Hamilton, authenticated the rediscovered
watercolors, the couple sold them to Gerald Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown at the time, Keegan said, was that O'Keeffe did not use
a wide variety of papers, a fact which emerged during research for
the catalogue raisonne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they realized this,'' Keegan said, ``they understood they
had a really good baseline to judge all of O'Keeffe's works on
paper and to judge their authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper used in the ``Canyon Suite'' watercolors was compared
by researchers with vintage sample books from paper manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Facts about the age and types of paper were unknown in 1993 when
Kemper bought ``The Canyon Suite,'' Keegan stressed. In fact,
Kemper did so partly at the urging of some of the very experts who
have declared the works unauthentic.
</P>
<P>
   After the works surfaced in the late 1980s, Ruth Fine and
National Gallery directors J. Carter Brown and Rusty Powell
declared them a ``national treasure'' and urged Kemper to buy them
and donate them to the National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years the works were accepted by leading O'Keeffe
scholars. Now, Keegan said, the ``five million dollar question'' is
whether the watercolors were deliberately forged or were mistakenly
attributed to the artist.
</P>
<P>
   When questions about the watercolors surfaced in November,
Gerald Peters promised he would buy them back, but he could not be
reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting a full refund,'' Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum plans to use the refunded money to create a $5
million permanent collection endowment for the purchase of new art.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan expects the endowment to generate $300,000 to $400,000
per year for the purchase of art created within the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is glad, he said, to have closure on ``The Canyon Suite''
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the outcome we would have hoped for,'' he said, ``but
one we were prepared for, after having done our own research.''

 Hot market for new technology stocks provides benefits for KC  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new generation of wealth in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, the hot market for new technology stocks
has created vast fortunes for entrepreneurs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A few Kansas Citians jumped on that golden road this year and
have brought some of the nation's technology riches to town.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Fraser, chairman of National Information Consortium
Inc., for example, has seen his personal stake in the Internet
company grow in value from $364.8 million to $976.6 million in just
five months.
</P>
<P>
   National Information Consortium, based in Overland Park, helps
state and local governments set up Internet pages to provide
services to businesses and citizens.
</P>
<P>
   National Information Consortium is one of three local companies
that offer a peek at how going public can have a profound effect on
the operations of a company and on the finances of the people who
work there.
</P>
<P>
   Management Network Group Inc., also based in Overland Park, has
been another star performer in the stock market. The company sold
stock to the public in late November, and already the stock's price
is 74 percent higher than the offering price.
</P>
<P>
   That performance has boosted the net worth of Chief Executive
Richard Nespola's stock from $83.2 million to $144.3 million in
less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Not every technology company is a way for executives to get rich
quick, especially biotechnology companies, where ``overnight
successes'' can take years to develop. But when a biotech company's
time comes, as it apparently has for Avax Technologies Inc. of
Kansas City, the results are similarly sweet.
</P>
<P>
   At Avax, which develops cancer-treatment therapies, Jeffrey
Jonas has 372,205 shares. In December 1998, those shares were worth
$837,461. Last week, the stock was worth $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at National Information Consortium, Avax Technologies
and Management Network Group described what it's like to manage
companies with so many people knocking at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a vice president at Upjohn, it would be unthinkable to take
calls from the public,'' said Jonas, who is Avax's president and
chief executive officer and who previously worked at the
pharmaceutical giant.
</P>
<P>
   At Avax, Jonas has taken hundreds of calls from shareholders who
want to know more about the company.
</P>
<P>
   For Avax, going public has been about raising awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop a treatment for cancer and you can't
open a Web site and sell ads to make money,'' Jonas said.
``Although I'd be delighted if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Avax has been a public company for three years, and its stock
has recently regained ground it had lost since the original public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   When a biotechnology company offers its stock in an initial
public offering, the company usually still has a long road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a company like ours, an IPO is really a tool,'' Jonas
said. ``I think most people have the idea that you issue stock, you
get rich.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jonas, his stock holdings in Avax are relatively modest
compared with executives at some other companies. Jonas owns about
2.26 percent of the company's stock, according to filings with
federal securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of going public is to raise awareness about the
company's research, to give the company credibility with its
research partners and to give Avax a currency it can use to buy
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 29, the company announced results that its vaccine,
called M-Vax, had a high long-term success rate.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, BusinessWeek noted that Avax would start
marketing its vaccine in Australia early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price jumped from 2 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has yet to turn a profit, executives are
still in the early stages of building the company through research
and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be conscious of the fact that you are there to
increase the value of the company,'' Jonas said. ``And you can't do
that by watching the stock go up and down every day.''
 &LR; brk:Management Network Group
</P>
<P>
   Watching that stock price can be a gratifying distraction,
conceded Nespola.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not all it's hyped up to be,'' he added. ``You think,
`Wow.' But you know what? It's all paper.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not be money in the bank, but people still notice.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Nespola's paper _ his stock in Management Network
Group _ was worth as much as $171.8 million when the stock hit a
per-share peak of 35. The company, which provides management
consulting to telecommunications companies, went public less than a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nespola said his 22-year-old son was shopping at Hall's
department store when a clerk cornered him with this greeting:
``That's a great IPO your dad had. You must be able to get anything
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not anything.
</P>
<P>
   Nespola, a former Sprint Corp. executive, said he hasn't traded
in his car and he hasn't noticed any co-workers showing up to the
office in fancier clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But Nespola is proud that the stock offering has spread the
wealth throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many consultants have stock options, so I am sharing the
equity upside with the people who work for the company,'' Nespola
said. ``In this particular case, a full 10 percent of the company
is dedicated to the employees.''

9 IN TEXAS FAMILY KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT IN MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REBECA RODRIGUEZ and MARISA TAYLOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six children and three adults from the same Fort Worth family
were killed in a traffic accident last weekend while traveling to
visit family in Mexico for the Christmas holidays, Mexican
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A 10th relative survived the accident, which Mexican police said
was caused by a truck driver who was speeding. The truck driver
fled after the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The family members, with the last names Carvajal and Delgadillo,
ranged in age from 1 to 30 and had been living in Fort Worth for at
least two years, friends said. They lived in three different homes
in south Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good people and we will remember them that way,''
relative Patricia Delgadillo said Monday night at a rosary inside
one of the homes.
</P>
<P>
   The dead children were identified as Javier Delgadillo, 1;
Cecilia Delgadillo, 4; Cindy Delgadillo, 6; Maria Carvajal, 11;
Silvano Carvajal, 13; and Eva Carvajal, 16. Also killed were Noel
Carvajal, 21; Sofia Carvajal, 30; and Filiberta Carvajal
Delgadillo, 26. All of the Carvajals were siblings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as a chilly December wind blew outside, about 40
people gathered inside a small, sparsely decorated house on
Laughton Street, home to five of the dead. They propped photographs
of some of the victims on a small wooden coffee table and burned
five religious candles in a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, school teachers and the family priest, the Rev. Francis
X. Fernandez, pastor of Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, described
the family as respectful, hard-working and reserved.
</P>
<P>
   The family was originally from a town in the state of Zacatecas,
in northern Mexico, and were making the 10-hour trip from Fort
Worth to share the holidays with relatives. Jose Carvajal, 24, had
driven a Chevrolet Suburban from Zacatecas to Fort Worth to pick
them up. He survived the crash with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Suburban was hit by a truck owned by a steel mill as it
traveled on Highway 54 about six miles north of Concepcion del Oro,
said Fernando Lugo Martinez, an investigator with the district
attorney's office in Zacatecas.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the accident was reported at 5:30 a.m. Sunday, but
family members in Fort Worth said it occurred about 10 a.m.
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, who reportedly works in Monclova, Coahuila,
could face manslaughter charges, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a horrible tragedy,'' said Gloria Sandoval, a
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths have devastated family and friends in Fort Worth, and
last night the mourners remembered the victims in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer this rosary in honor of the Carvajal and Delgadillo
families,'' said Carmen Avila as she clasped a turquoise-colored
string of rosary beads.
</P>
<P>
   Children fussed in their mothers' arms, and many kneeled
somberly on the hard wooden floor, heads bowed, while Avila
murmured traditional Roman Catholic prayers. After the hourlong
prayer session ended, teary-eyed mourners hugged one another,
shaking their heads in apparent disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Next-door neighbor Rosa Murguia said the Carvajal family kept to
themselves. But Murguia said she always knew when they were home,
because the music of Juan Gabriel, a Mexican singer, would blare
from the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I thought about telling them to lower the music,''
Murguia recalled in Spanish. ``Now I'm glad I never told them
anything. I would feel too guilty now.''
</P>
<P>
   Murguia said the loss of nine people in one family is too
devastating to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel awful when you lose one or two,'' she said. ``But
nine? I can't even imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Murguia's 9-year-old son, Osvaldo, said the news came as a shock
to him because he used to play Pokemon with Silvano Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad,'' Osvaldo said quietly. ``I was sad when I heard
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Moreno, who was Cecilia's prekindergarten teacher at
Worth Heights Elementary, said that on Friday, the day the family
left, Cecilia was ``so excited because they were going to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very quiet. But when something would interest her, she
would just light up,'' Moreno said. ``She couldn't wait for me to
open the present she brought me. It was a really nice address book
with a pen and an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave her a big hug and said thank you,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia was supposed to be an angel in the school play, but she
got sick and had to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Filiberta Delgadillo would bring Javier with her to eat lunch
regularly with Cecilia at school.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Fuentes, a teacher at Worth Heights, said Maria was a quiet
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an excellent student, very hard worker. She had a lot
of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Irma Flores-Brothers, the principal of Richard J. Wilson
Elementary, said Cindy Delgadillo was a bright first-grader who had
just been referred to the gifted and talented program. She was in
bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school is such a close-knit community. We'll do everything
we can for that family,'' Flores-Brothers said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the victims were turned over to relatives in
Mexico Monday, officials said. Family members said a burial service
is planned for Tuesday in the Mexican state of Jalisco.

LAKERS GET A WEARY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tired legs met hyper bodies Monday night, and the
results were predictably chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' fourth game in their fourth city in five nights _
against a frantic, full-court Boston Celtics attack _ looked a lot
like a coach's classroom videotape, the one with all the oddball
mishaps that make players cover their eyes on second viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Loopy inbounds passes were picked off. Inbounds passers were
called for five-second violations. Simple drives up the court
became adventures in ballhandling as the Celtics applied their
collegiate full-court pressure and drove the weary Lakers to the
edge of insanity. And to a season-high 24 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   And to the edge of a streak-stopping loss. But only to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers pulled back, relaxed and calmly pushed through
their own fatigue and the Celtics' frenzy to pull out a 99-90
victory at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Four games in five nights became four wins and no losses. And no
doubt the Lakers will be a holly, jolly bunch on the flight back to
Los Angeles this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a good feeling,'' Derek Fisher said after the
Lakers extended their winning streak to seven by coming back from a
13-point second-half deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much we should read into it. We've been in
these situations before... but I think the only other time was in
Sacramento, and we failed to come back and get that one. To close a
trip out in this fashion, with a win, really feels good. We felt
like this would be a test road trip, and we finished up 4-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The last piece fell into place behind an impressive tag-team
effort from Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, who played 46 and 45
minutes respectively, defying any notion of road-trip fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal powered through the Celtics' frontcourt for 34 points and
20 rebounds, his performance marred only by a season-high eight
turnovers. Bryant skipped and glided to 27 points, four rebounds,
four assists and four steals.
</P>
<P>
   With Glen Rice (nine points) held back by early fouls and
limited minutes (23), Fisher provided a lift off the bench with 13
points.
</P>
<P>
   It was another measure of the Lakers' newfound resilience and
confidence as they won for the 14th time in 15 games and improved
their league-best record to 22-5.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Celtics' press _ which O'Neal derided as ``(coach) Rick
Pitino's `Outbreak' monkey defense'' _ made the Lakers ever appear
road-weary. Otherwise, they played sharply, shooting 52.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were more mentally tired than physically tired,''
coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Celtics cashed in the turnovers for 26 easy points
and could have had much more.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored 12 unanswered points to open the second half and
took a 55-44 lead _ ``We got completely out of whack there for
about two minutes,'' Jackson said. Then the Lakers, with Fisher and
Rick Fox subbing for Ron Harper and Rice, settled down and went on
an 11-0 run, leaving them down by two to start the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant did the rest, combining for 21 points on
7-of-10 shooting in the final period, while Celtics stars Antoine
Walker (24 points), Kenny Anderson (21 points) and Adrian Griffin
all fouled out trying to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had called this trip, the Lakers' longest of the season
so far, a big test. He's still reserving a final grade after
watching his team dispatch with Atlanta, Minnesota, Toronto and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be pleased with what we've done,'' he said. ``We
didn't beat the top teams in the East, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the defending champion San Antonio Spurs await
the Lakers on Christmas night, no one was overly impressed with
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we're a good basketball team,'' Fisher said,
``but I think there's still some mystery, even amongst ourselves,
as far as how good we can be. I believe that's a good thing,
because we really don't know. So each night we just have to go out
there and try to do it, and tonight was an example of that. Since
we really still don't know exactly who we are, we just continue to
just play, fight and try and win. And we did.''

 Hot market for new technology stocks provides benefits for KC  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That means about 90 people share about $80 million worth of the
company as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of smiles on people's faces,'' Nespola said.
``I've had a few employees say, `Other people may not tell you
this, but I take out my calculator at night and add up the value of
my stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Nespola said he doesn't focus on the day-to-day value of his
holdings. In fact, on the first day of trading, he was on a plane
and didn't check the opening performance until he was on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was elated at the positive market response,'' Nespola said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hard work begins. Management Network is in a competitive
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I don't see the stock offering as an end,'' Nespola
said. ``I think my job has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Management Network Group raised about $78 million in its stock
offering, giving it money to pay off debt, expand overseas and
establish a Web site.  &LR; brk:National Information Consortium
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that make this work are companies that are focused
on making a great company, not watching the daily movements of the
stock,'' said James Dodd, chief executive of National Information
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   For National Information Consortium, that means expanding a
niche that has enormous growth potential. NIC designs and operates
Web pages for state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are a convenience for citizens and government
officials. The Web pages aim to improve government efficiency and
reduce the hassle for citizens trying to renew licenses, apply for
permits or obtain other government services.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow focus of the company was a huge benefit when the
company went on the road to raise money through an initial stock
offering, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an Internet company that was 9 years old,'' Dodd said.
``That gets you down to about 5 percent of the Internet companies
out there. And we had a management team that was all over 40 years
old. Now you're down to 1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NIC team would stop at a potential investor's office,
it wasn't unusual to see ``seven limos waiting in front of the
building and several groups of three in the office lobby, all
waiting'' their turn.
</P>
<P>
   NIC executives could explain, simply, that their company
provides Internet services for eight states, including Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The hard work and the focus paid off.
</P>
<P>
   When NIC went public in July, it offered 13 million shares at
$12 apiece. Last Friday, the stock was 32. The stock hit a peak of
44 earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   That ride has created a fortune for Fraser, the company's
founder. Forbes ASAP magazine pegged Fraser's wealth at $526.2
million, ranking him 53rd on a list of technology's 100 richest
people.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees also are basking in the stock's glow.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, who left a 15-year career at Sprint to join NIC, holds
shares that are now worth $9.4 million, up from $3.5 million in
July. He also received options in December 1998 that would be worth
in excess of $40 million based on Friday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said the experience of taking a company public has been
exhilarating, but the celebration doesn't end with a successful
sale of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great because we've built a great company and the
market was ripe for us,'' Dodd said. ``It was not built by a bunch
of folks who wanted to make a lot of money, but by people who
wanted to improve the quality of government services.'' (30)

LITTLE ILLUSION TO DISTRACT FANS GOING INTO 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   SEATTLE _ Maybe this is OK, the Seahawks presenting a sobering
picture for these final weeks of the year, of the century, of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in some cosmic way this December swoon is a public
service.
</P>
<P>
   There is no promise of a month-long bout of giddiness to
distract us from what is really important.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, there is something excruciatingly human about what
keeps happening to the Hawks _ a reminder that we can't depend on
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us could not stand to have this lesson reinforced?
</P>
<P>
   With their dramatic loss to the Broncos in Denver Sunday, it now
appears the Seahawks could be playing their final game in the
Kingdome this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Hawks, with four consecutive losses, vs. the Kansas
City Chiefs, with four consecutive victories, in an AFC West
showdown for all the marbles.
</P>
<P>
   What an ending for the concrete cave, where professional
football and baseball were born in the Pacific Northwest. Yet, the
do-or-die, regular-season game is not the finale originally
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were supposed to deliver bigger and better things
than this, especially after all the money, hype and grand illusion
pumped into the team. Mike Holmgren was courted to Seattle by one
of sports' richest owners to rescue a flailing franchise. The new
coach and a new attitude were supposed to set the Hawks on a
winning course just in time to swell public sentiment in
anticipation of the Seahawks' move to its
soon-to-be-under-construction outdoor palace.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Seattle was supposed to be a football town.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, despite a move to their alleged franchise
re-invigorating designer ballpark, the Mariners were swooning and
Ken Griffey Jr. was batting .255 and the funk around the M's was
thick as fog. That's when, short on patience for the way baseball
was making us feel, thoughts turned to the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on the new coach and the new football
stadium and the need for this team to be a juggernaut to justify
its new money/power base, the Hawks were hyped to be on the verge
of being better than ever, even superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who watched Sunday and witnessed the Hawks
looking as meekly human as Tiny Tim, almost all hope for that
one-season transformation is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Any November anger from season ticket-holders over the steep
price of playoff seats now seems to have been premature. So was our
nutty euphoria over an 8-2 record that made it appear the Seahawks
would fulfill their prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, Hawks success seemed as easy and inevitable as
closing your eyes and having your dot-com stock options split three
times. Dreaming of instant wealth is a sign of our times.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a lesson in all of this losing, one would have to
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   As Seattle approaches the end of '99, reality has been harsh
from all corners. From the violence surrounding the World Trade
Organization protest marches to the arrest last week of a suspected
terrorist attempting to smuggle explosives into Port Angeles, the
action in Seattle has been monumentally sobering.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, has been the realization that sports does not always
serve as some sort of great unifier. And no matter how much hope we
heap on high-paid athletes and price-gouging teams to supply us
with a steady roll of good tidings, the system can't deliver with
nearly the regularity promised.
</P>
<P>
   As this year, this century, this millennium comes to a close,
Seattle has two new sports stadiums. Safeco Field already sits on
the city's skyline, and the football stadium is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Both were in part sold on the expectation that with bigger and
better and more expensive venues, the actions of the players and
the results of the seasons would mirror the enormous investments _
both financial and emotional.
</P>
<P>
   The new-era, big-spending Hawks were going to go out in '99 with
a bang, just before the Kingdome went down in a bang of dynamite.
Instead, the Hawks are not much different from last year or the
year before, nor are they much different from most other NFL teams
mired in expansion-era mediocrity. That's reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were going to turn from small-market, small-focus,
perennial underachievers into boys of summer, basking in the
natural light of an outdoor wonder well suited for a World Series
contender. Instead, the M's are starting a new Safeco Field era
with the tearing down of the franchise's most enduring and
important star. Griffey, now vilified in many corners, wants out of
town because the new ballpark is too far away from where he chooses
to live and is too big for his brand of home run hitting.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the best of times. But that's OK. At least, we
perhaps can face this holiday season with a bit more clarity.
</P>
<P>
   There are few distractions. There are no instant highs in our
sports palaces. The tension-fraught game that the Hawks will play
Sunday won't be the gushing, gonzo going-away party we thought the
Seahawks would give the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   But this reality seems fitting for these times.

LACKADAISICAL SONICS DOWN BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ That they have a key player, Rusty LaRue, whose first
name basically describes his game tells all you need to know about
the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the bottom of a tin NBA barrel and you will certainly
find corrosion in a team formerly known as champions throughout
most of the Michael Jordan era.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently the Sonics either forgot or did not bother to read the
current scouting report. They also took their time before deciding
to play Monday night. It took three twilight zone quarters before
the Sonics woke up and beat the Bulls, 93-84, at United Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at their record and said, `Ah, we don't have to play
defense tonight,''' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``In the
fourth quarter everybody got mad and we shut the Bulls down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics actually trailed 72-71 heading into the final period.
Then, Gary Payton took over, attacked the basket and scored 9 of
his 22 points in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Payton also led the defense. The Sonics knocked an otherwise
hot-shooting Bulls team off balance. Chicago (2-20) missed 16 of
their 18 shots in the final frame and the Sonics (18-7) ended the
game with a 22-12 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an excuse for that,'' Payton said of the Sonics'
performance. ``We're supposed to get up for any team. For us to go
through that was ridiculous. If we do that (Tuesday against
Indiana) we're looking at another blowout (loss).''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were mortified, then pulled out the victory. The
Bulls had just nine players available because of a rash of
injuries. Still, the Sonics allowed the Bulls to shoot 52 percent
through three quarters. Chicago entered the game shooting just 40
percent while allowing opponents to make 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they talked about taking the game seriously, the
Sonics' effort spoke volumes. The Sonics were careless and
lackadaisical. They settled for outside shots and gave the Bulls
the advantage in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago trailed the Sonics 57-53 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics center Horace Grant did not have a single point or
rebound at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very scrappy team even though their record is
poor,'' said Grant, who finished with two points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were ever in a situation where we were
worried about the game,'' said Vin Baker, whose 25 points on
7-of-12 shooting led the Sonics. ``They played hard. But all we had
to do was play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he gave the team his shortest halftime speech
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `They haven't scored 100 points all season. They have
53. You do the math,''' Westphal said. ``Then, I threw something.
... I think it was a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls even impressed themselves by staying with a team with
one of the league's best records.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we're hanging around in a position to win games,''
said Bulls forward Elton Brand, the NBA's No. 1 draft pick this
year. ``We have a lot of young guys out there getting run down. We
are definitely undermanned physically so it's great to see us
hanging around.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having Brand and rookie Ron Artest, the Bulls are still
the same hapless team Sonics guard Brent Barry played for last
season. Barry actually was part of a subplot to the game because of
comments he made upon arriving in Seattle after the Bulls swapped
him for Hersey Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Barry basically said the Chicago team he played on could not
chew gum and walk at the same time. Bulls starting center Dickey
Simpkins took offense and was quoted in yesterday's Chicago
Sun-Times that Barry should be careful driving the lane
</P>
<P>
   So Barry did not hesitate. He went hard to the basket a couple
of times early in the first quarter. On one play Simpkins whacked
Barry across the chest with a hard foul.
</P>
<P>
   Both players bumped into each other after the contact but did
not get into a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was my dad (Rick), I would have gotten kicked out,''
Barry said. ``He did it. The referee probably should have taken a
longer look at it. ... Off the court, I don't have a problem with
Dickey. On the court, it's kind of nonsense. But I was going to see
what he was going to bring at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 17-12, the Sonics had to fight off the energy the Bulls
brought.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Patterson took off after a Sonic rebound and beat everyone
down court for an uncontested dunk. That ignited a 14-0 run. The
Sonics led by as many as 13 points in the first half before the
Bulls made the game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they're going to compete,'' Barry said. ``The two
games they won, they won at home. I was on the other side last
year. You want to come out and play as hard as you can. Sometimes
the talent doesn't match up but the effort is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics learned that lesson Monday night.

HOPE FLOATS: IF COWBOYS WIN 2, THEY'RE IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys know about the gift that
keeps on giving.
</P>
<P>
   They just received it.
</P>
<P>
   It showed up on their Valley Ranch doorstep Monday in the form
of an interpretation of the NFL's convoluted tiebreaker system
which favors _ or rather ``resuscitates'' _ the Cowboys in their
quest to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league office, the Cowboys are assured of
making the playoffs simply by winning their remaining two games to
finish 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what anyone else does, no matter how many NFC teams
also finish 9-7 ... if the Cowboys win, they're in.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many times they keep shooting themselves in the
foot, i.e., Sunday when they blew a fourth-quarter lead for the
fifth time this season and lost at home to the already
playoff-eliminated New York Jets, the Cowboys still control their
own destiny, albeit a complicated destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Tampa Bay and Washington go on to join St. Louis as
division champions, that would leave six teams vying to finish 9-7
or better and secure one of the three remaining wild card spots.
</P>
<P>
   But:
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys finish 9-7, the Giants won't because they finish
the season at Texas Stadium, where a loss would eliminate them from
that six-team hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina can finish 9-7, but if the Panthers and the Cowboys
both finish 9-7, the Cowboys will have a better conference record,
which would be the tiebreaker between those two teams.
</P>
<P>
   If Detroit, Minnesota and Green Bay each finish 9-7 or any two
of them finish 9-7, teams within the same division tied for a
wild-card spot must break that tie before breaking ties with teams
from other divisions. That would leave the Cowboys and two NFC
Central teams as the wild-card teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys still have a chance to defend their NFC East crown,
although Washington, 8-6, holds a one-game lead over the Cowboys,
7-7, and New York Giants, 7-7, with two games to go. Dallas does
hold the tiebreaker edge against the Redskins because of
head-to-head (2-0) results.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys learned Monday is that they're still assured of
getting at least an NFC wild-card berth by winning their remaining
two games, although that would mean putting together their first
two-game winning streak since opening the season 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   They play at New Orleans on Christmas Eve. And while the Saints
are 2-12, the Cowboys will be taking a six-game road losing streak
this season into the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys then come home for a Jan. 2 game against the Giants
at Texas Stadium. And while the Cowboys are 6-1 at home this
season, they lost to the Giants two months ago, 13-10, at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hurt now,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Monday,
``but if we sit around feeling sorry for ourselves (at 7-7) rather
than go out and play these last two games (to win), just think how
bad we'd feel later knowing that 9-7 would've gotten us in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd really be sick then.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a computer inside the league office in New York on
Monday, the Cowboys have been assured a chance of feeling ``really
sick.'' All they have to do is stub their toe one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective now is to go fight,'' said Gailey. ``OK, it
hurt. OK, it's over. Now let's go fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Both remaining games for Dallas are against NFC opponents, which
plays into the Cowboys' favor of controlling their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Giants, the Saints defeated the Cowboys in their
last meeting, 22-3, just over 12 months ago. In that game, the
Cowboys were held to 182 yards total offense. Emmitt Smith finished
with 15 carries for 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets actually have a lower-ranked offense (25th) and defense
(23rd) in the NFL than either the Saints (20th in offensive, 21st
in defensive) or the Giants (17th in offensive, 11th in defensive).
So there are no easy opponents for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made too many penalties at critical times,'' said Gailey,
whose team made four of their eight penalties in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But while mistakes and penalties cost the Cowboys the Jets game,
Gailey stopped short of putting his players on notice that some of
them are playing for their jobs next season in these final two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily think it's a big deal to make that a point
with them, or with anybody,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year coach was asked how he justifies some so-called
``questionable'' penalties, such as Sunday's pass interference
against cornerback Kevin Smith, which led to a Jets touchdown, or
tripping on center Mark Stepnoski, which wiped out a first-down run
by Emmitt Smith and led to a Dallas punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to justify it to the team because there's no way
you can justify it,'' said Gailey. ``The way you justify it to
yourself is to say (that) all that evens out, if you stay employed
long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he allows himself to think about his own job
security, Gailey replied, ``No, I don't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey emphasized that the focus is on beating the Saints, then
beating the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are fortunate enough that they still can.
</P>
<P>
   And, more important, it still matters. nn

VIKINGS DEFEAT PACKERS, 24-20

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Randy Moss loves big games and, with the exception
of the postseason, none is bigger than the stage on ``Monday Night
Football.'' As he has done many times in his short career, Moss
stole the show on Monday night, as only a great thespian can do.
</P>
<P>
   It began late in the second quarter, when quarterback Jeff
George sold a great run fake to running back Robert Smith, freezing
the Green Bay cornerback Tyrone Williams, who was guarding Moss on
the right side. Moss executed the subterfuge brilliantly, jogging
like a disinterested tourist, then sprinting and galloping past
Williams for the 57-yard touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Big game. Big play. Big man.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown tied the score at 10. Moss finished the day with
two touchdown catches and was the biggest reason Minnesota beat the
Packers, 24-20, before 64,203 at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's record is 8-6 and tied with Detroit for first place
in the National Football Conference Central Division. The Packers'
playoff chances were dealt a serious blow as they fell to 7-7. They
will visit Tampa Bay on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Moss' second touchdown came with just under two minutes left in
the third quarter. George, despite some risky throws that could
have been intercepted, engineered a solid 59-yard drive to the
Green Bay 1-yard line. The Vikings love to go to Moss near the goal
line because he can use his 6-feet-4-inch frame and post-up
defensive backs like it is basketball instead of football.
</P>
<P>
   Moss' second victim was safety Darren Sharper. It was no
contest. Moss ran maybe a half-yard inside the goal line. George
delivered a strike to him, and the Vikings led, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a perfect day for the star wide receiver. His
sophomore season has had its highs and lows, with dropped passes,
and in this game he fumbled a punt return. Moss was hit hard by
Basil Mitchell, and the ball was recovered by Tod McBride.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers were stopped on third down at Minnesota's 9-yard
line and lined up for the field goal. Then Green Bay Coach Ray
Rhodes made a great call. The Packers ran a fake field goal, with
holder and backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck picking up the
football and throwing it to tight end Jeff Thomason. Green Bay led,
20-17, with 12 minutes 19 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But Moss, who finished with five catches for 131 yards, made up
for his mistake. He outran double-coverage, getting behind both
safeties, for a 36-yard completion to the Green Bay 1-yard line.
Leroy Hoard ran it in and the Vikings again led, 24-20, with just
under nine minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre (18 of 32 for 178 yards), still the most dangerous
comeback quarterback in football, got the ball back but was
intercepted on third-and-20 with 3:19 left. Favre got another shot
with 45 seconds remaining at his own 22-yard line, and worked his
way to Minnesota's 28-yard line, but was intercepted in the end
zone with no time left on the clock by Robert Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   This game was the most important of the season for both teams.
Griffith put it best when he said that the loser, realistically,
would miss the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   For the Vikings, that would be rare. Dennis Green's teams have
missed the postseason only twice in his eight years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has struggled, but it is not a team in turmoil, which
might have described the Packers this week. Defensive coordinator
Emmitt Thomas has come under fire for not finding ways to put
pressure on opposing quarterbacks. What the Packers did against
Carolina was an embarrassment to a proud organization. The Panthers
scored on all four of their second-half possessions and Steve
Beuerlein threw for 373 total yards, the most Green Bay has given
up in two years. That forced the Packers defensive coaches to
rethink their defensive schemes, especially against the powerful
offense of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Green Bay coaching brain trust did worked. The
Packers were much more aggressive, blitzing from the corners, and
constantly putting pressure on George, who was rattled early.
</P>
<P>
   Both Favre and George struggled until late in the second half.
The Packers' first three possessions were a fumble followed by two
punts, and the Vikings were plagued by a George fumble and blown
blocking assignments by the line. The first quarter was scoreless;
early in the second Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson connected from
43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A 1-yard run by Dorsey Levens and a 26-yard field goal by Ryan
Longwell gave Green Bay a 10-3 lead in the second quarter. Then
came Moss's first touchdown catch. When he went streaking down the
field and into the end zone, it was still early in the game and
there were more fireworks to come from Favre. But watching Moss is
like seeing a young Jim Brown or Jordan or Gretzky perform.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Moss makes it look too easy. &QL;

BOND-MARKET ANXIETY HELPS DRAGS DOWN THE DOW

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bad day in the bond market hurt some segments of
the stock market Monday as concerns mounted about what Federal
Reserve policy-makers might do about interest rates at a meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks seen as sensitive to rising interest rates, like
financial-services companies, suffered after bond traders lifted
the yield on the 30-year Treasury to 6.44 percent, its highest in
27 months, from 6.37 percent on Friday. The bond's price, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell 25/32, to 95 29/32.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in stocks like J.P. Morgan and Citigroup helped to
pull down the Dow Jones industrial average by 113.16 points, or 1
percent, to 11,144.27.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy continuing to be quite strong, the assumption
is that the Fed will definitely move, and possibly on Tuesday'' to
raise short-term interest rates, said David Mead, chief investment
officer at Harris Bank in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt they will move that rapidly,'' he added, ``but the
fear is they may tighten by half a percentage point at their
meeting in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand for technology stocks remained intense, and
the Nasdaq composite index set a third consecutive record and its
55th of the year. It rose 30.81 points, or 0.8 percent, to
3,783.87.
</P>
<P>
   The continued rise in technology and Internet stocks ``is very
frustrating for anyone who has any sort of value orientation,''
said Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at Fleet Boston
Investment Advisors. ``This is a market that is driving anyone who
wants to do old-fashioned analysis to question their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The other main market gauges were narrowly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,418.09, down
2.94 points, or 0.2 percent. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies gained 0.98 point, or 0.2 percent, to 467.19.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among analysts is that the central bank will leave
short-term rates unchanged Tuesday and continue with its neutral
stance toward any future rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, that view is based on the fact that the Fed,
which has been injecting liquidity into the banking system as a
precautionary measure before the turn of the century, does not want
to roil financial markets because of the uncertainty about how
potential Year 2000 computer problems will affect the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, a move to raise rates would come as a
definite, negative surprise, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they tightened again and said they are not afraid of Y2K,
then that could set the stage for a big year-end sell-off,'' said
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Although financial-services stocks were losers, Honeywell
International was the biggest single contributor to the decline in
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell 7 1/8, to 56 5/8, after Honeywell said it had
agreed to buy Pittway, the maker of burglar alarms, for $2.2
billion, a 57 percent premium to its closing price on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial-services company stocks, J.P. Morgan was down 2
9/16, to 125 9/16. Citigroup closed at 53 7/16, down 1 1/16. And
Chase Manhattan dropped 1/8, to 72 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, share prices of both Monsanto and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn
both fell after the rival drug makers agreed to merge. Monsanto
closed at 36 5/8, down 5 1/8, while Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn fell 3 1/8,
to 47 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies did better after announcing stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle gained 5 5/8, to 96 5/16, after the world's largest maker
of database software said it would split its shares 2 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat, a developer of a computer operating system that
competes with Microsoft's Windows, gained 15 1/16, to 267 15/16,
after it said it would split its stock 2 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's stock also gained after the
financial- services company announced fourth-quarter earnings that
were well above Wall Street estimates, as well as a 2-for-1 stock
split. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter stock closed at 128 5/16, up
15/16.

CELESTIAL EVENTS LINE UP TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Robert Monroe  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Look to the skies tonight to witness a trio of
celestial events that haven't taken place so close to each other in
more than 133 years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will the moon be full, but it will be at its closest
point to Earth just hours after the maximum point of winter
solstice, the shortest day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be amore, but the moon will hit your eye like a big
pizza pie shining 25 percent brighter than an average full moon and
appearing some 14 percent larger than it did Dec. 8., at its
farthest point from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have an event like this that reminds us of the
rest of the universe, I think that's very healthy.'' said Ed Krupp,
director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. ``We always
welcome the full moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the three events takes place at 11:44 p.m., when
the Earth is at maximum solstice, when the tilt of the Earth shifts
the Northern Hemisphere to its farthest point from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Around 3 a.m., the moon reaches perigee, coming within 221,662
miles of Earth. At 9:31 a.m., the moon is at its fullest.
</P>
<P>
   This troika of celestial events will occur within a 10-hour
span, even closer together than the last time they took place in
close proximity, in 1866, when the three events occurred within 20
hours of each other. It was bright that night 133 years ago, and
American Indians use evening to launch a devastating ambush on U.S.
troops.
</P>
<P>
   At no time since have the three astronomical events happened as
close together. In fact, they haven't taken place in such proximity
since at least 1850, the earliest year for which Sky and Telescope
magazine's computers give accurate estimates, said Roger Sinnott,
an associate editor at Sky and Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 70 years since the moon came this close to
Earth. On Jan. 15, 1930, it was a mere 221,502 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Krupp's research has found ties between moon phases and
ceremonial rites of the Pueblo Indians of the Southwest and even
evidence of possible links between full moons and winter solstice
and the arrangement of Stonehenge. But while people might look for
primal connections between the moon and human behavior, this event
should touch no deeper chord than passing curiosity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take it for what it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers trying to keep the public down to Earth have taken
exception to exaggerated claims about what will be taking place.
Alan MacRobert, an associate editor at Sky and Telescope, blames it
on a misreading of an entry in the 1999 ``Farmer's Almanac'' that
became the basis of a chain e-mail sent to Internet users around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of the power to turn a tiny kernel of truth
into a mighty oak of exaggeration,'' MacRobert said.
</P>
<P>
   But to those who believe in the spiritual significance of all
full moons, including Wiccans and neo-pagans, the event could be a
chance to reap positive energy from the confluence to carry into
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magically, there will be a lot of energy happening,'' said Pat
Devin, a Van Nuys resident and public information officer for
Covenant of the Goddess, one of the largest Wiccan organizations in
the country. ``I think there will be a heightened sense of
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society in
Pasadena, said he hopes to get to a place far away from city lights
to view the intense moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coincidence of four celestial events has really intrigued
people,'' said Friedman, who counts an impending perihelion, the
point at which Earth is closest to the sun, coming up on Jan. 3.
``The interest is just to know a little more about our (celestial)
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   This event will actually be overshadowed by an arguably bigger
lunar spectacle on Jan. 20. On that day, there will be a total
eclipse of the full moon, Sinnott noted. The last total eclipse
visible in its entirety at night in California took place on Nov.
29, 1993, and the next total eclipse won't happen until Aug. 28,
2007, Sinnott said.

   EARNINGS-REPORTS (Undated) _ A penny is not worth much nowadays
except on Wall Street. There, a penny a share in company earnings
can mean the difference between a stock that soars and one that
skids. The punishment that stocks regularly endure from investors
disappointed over the tiniest earnings misses has put managements

   PERSONAL-GENOMICS (Undated) _ Biochips look like the integrated
circuits in a personal computer, but instead of containing tiny
semiconductors, they are loaded with bits of actual DNA that make
up genes or fragments of genes. Biochips will bring genomics, the
study of all the genes in a living organism, out of the research
laboratory and into the daily practice of medicine. If genomics
delivers on its promise, health care will shift from a focus on
detection and treatment to a process of prediction and prevention.

account, in the book of Matthew, of the star and how it caused the
wise men to come to Judea in search of the newborn Jesus, exactly
what it was, if indeed it was anything at all, remains an open
question. That question has attracted yet another answer, one that
is gaining attention from historians of astronomy for its unique
approach. Dr. Michael R. Molnar, an astronomer and physicist and
former teacher at Rutgers University, proposes that the star was

his baby daughter, Katie, while she was still in the womb. But
doctors say there is a good chance that they may have saved Katie's
vision with a bold new procedure: delivering her prematurely, then
treating the affected eye before the cancer had a chance to grow

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PRAIRIE VIEW _ Before Davey Whitney coached at Alcorn State, he
replaced Ernie Banks at shortstop, employed Wilma Rudolph as his
children's baby sitter and, as a teen-ager, sneaked into University
of Kentucky basketball practices to watch Adolph Rupp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's a lifetime of conversation pieces right there, but
there's also the matter of his 500 coaching victories.
</P>
<P>
   No. 500 came Monday night as Alcorn State defeated Prairie View
A&AMP;M 91-72 at the William Nicks Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real ride,'' said Whitney, in his 29th season of
college coaching. ``Being a poor black kid coming from a small
(Kentucky) town, nothing better could have happened to me except
what has happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching basketball is only part of what has happened for
Whitney, who has amassed a 500-307 record in two stints covering 24
years at Alcorn State plus five years at Texas Southern. His Alcorn
teams have won 10 Southwestern Athletic Conference regular-season
championships and five conference tournament titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to coach. I never wanted to teach school,''
said Whitney, the SWAC's winningest coach, who as a player earned
more athletic letters than anyone in Kentucky State history.
</P>
<P>
   What Whitney, who turns 70 on Jan. 8, wanted to do was play
baseball. He was able to do that for a time in 1952 for the Kansas
City Monarchs of the Negro League. With the Monarchs, he replaced
future Hall of Famer Banks, who was en route to the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pretty good baseball player,'' said Whitney, who began
his college coaching career at TSU (1964-69) and, while at Alcorn,
has won SWAC Coach of the Year honors nine times. His record with
the Braves is 446-235. ``Things didn't pan out like they should.
Like I would have liked. That's when I went into coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   And went on to become a coaching legend.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there 500 victories and five NCAA Tournament
appearances, but some of the wins have had historic significance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Alcorn State became the first historically black
institution to compete in the National Invitation Tournament. The
Braves beat Mississippi State 80-78 in Starkville, Miss., before
losing in the second round to eventual champion Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn State also became the first historically black
institution to win an NCAA Tournament game, beating South Alabama
70-62 in 1980, a season in which the Braves finished 28-2.
</P>
<P>
   Under Whitney, the Braves have won three NCAA Tournament games
and had some memorable, close losses _ to Kansas in 1984 by one
point and to Georgetown in 1983 by three.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney is still going strong: The Braves are the defending SWAC
regular-season and conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win,'' said Whitney. ``I never had any idea,
any thought of winning awards. Never thought about them.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly wasn't thinking of being a college coach when, in
his teen years from 1944-48 while attending high school in
Lexington, Ky., he and a friend would slip into Kentucky practices
and watch Rupp in action.
</P>
<P>
   Rupp didn't sign a black player until 1971 and had a reputation
as a racist in his 41-year Kentucky tenure. But Whitney said he had
no problem with Rupp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Rupp let us come in,'' said Whitney, who grew up in tiny
Midway, Ky. (population 547). ``I'd watch (Ralph) Beard, Wah Wah
Jones (two of Kentucky's stars).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a learning experience for me because he (Rupp) did
everything by the stopwatch. Everything was planned meticulously,
and I realized that when I was 14, 15 years old out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the all-time great coaches. I don't care about the
other stuff. I know what I got from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney's coaching career began in 1955. His teams compiled a
217-72 record with two state championships at Burt High School in
Clarksville, Tenn. It was there that he met Rudolph, who gained
fame by winning three gold medals in the 1960 Summer Olympics in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three girls, and we needed a baby sitter,'' said
Whitney. ``We stuck with her all through her career and when she
went to Rome. Everywhere. Even after she stopped running, we kept
in contact all the years. We went to her funeral (in 1994). We were
pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the coaching milestones, it hasn't all been a bed of
roses for Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 seasons from 1973 to 1985, the Braves won 20 games or
more 12 times. But after winning the SWAC championship in 1986, the
Braves stumbled to 5-23, 8-21 and 5-23 records.
</P>
<P>
   And a change was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got fired,'' said Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   But Alcorn was 57-135 in six years under two head coaches, so
the school brought Whitney back for the 1996-97 season. The Braves
have gone 11-17, 12-15 and 23-7 since.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn State is 4-5 following Monday's SWAC-opening blowout of
Prairie View.
</P>
<P>
   Six Braves scored in double figures with Walter Harper getting
12 points and 12 rebounds. Terrance Cameron and Marcus Fleming also
had 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic part about the whole situation: The guy that fired
me named the building after me,'' said Whitney, whose Braves play
at Texas Southern on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Also ironic is that Prairie View coach Elwood Plummer was
recruited by Whitney when Whitney was coaching at TSU and Plummer
was the leading scorer in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known coach Whitney since he was coaching at Texas
Southern,'' said Plummer. ``I was coming out of high school, but I
had already made up my mind to go to Jackson State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been around a long time. He's been an asset and credit to
the conference.''
</P>

USC WINS, BUT BIBBY ISN'T HAPPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ A 33-point USC victory over anybody seems a minor
cause for celebration, so what was coach Henry Bibby doing keeping
his team in the locker room for more than 20 minutes after the game
Monday night?
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't to congratulate each of the Trojans
individually after their 87-54 rout of lowly San Diego State before
3,402 at Cox Arena.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat disturbed Bibby instead lectured USC about its
uncanny ability to let a team back into a game.
</P>
<P>
   USC seemed to put the Aztecs away by taking a 28-9 lead 11
minutes into the contest. But then the Trojans went to sleep, and
San Diego State scored 23 of the next 33 points and trailed 38-32
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   USC (6-5) got hot again, as point guard Brandon Granville hit
four 3-pointers in the second half en route to a career-high 24
points. But the final score didn't do much to soothe Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a win,'' Bibby said. ``I thought we turned the ball
over. We were careless and unorganized. The second half, we got
organized. One player played in the first half, Brian Scalabrine.
In the second half, Sam Clancy and Granville stepped it up. But we
need to have four to five guys play every night.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no argument from the Trojans, who realized that they
won't see many teams like San Diego State (2-5) when Pacific-10
Conference play begins next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him,'' said Scalabrine, who scored 21 points.
``If we play like this, these eight-minute lulls where we don't do
anything, that's what makes it hard. It can kill you in the
Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine had just four points in a loss to Long Beach last
week, but against San Diego State he decided the answer was to
shoot more frequently, taking 15 shots and making eight. He also
grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of redemption after obsessing over the loss to Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough,'' Scalabrine said. ``I was still thinking
about it until the game started. It was a devastating loss, losing
to a rival. They wanted to win more than us, and it was on ESPN.
That was a tough game to bounce back from.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Two-sport star quarterback/forward Teyo Johnson of Mira
Mesa High in San Diego attended the game. ``I'm really high on
USC,'' Johnson said. ``I had a great visit. I still need to visit
Stanford and Miami.'' Johnson said he is also considering UCLA, and
may not make a decision until after the prep basketball season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ In a classic confrontation between bitter NFC
Central rivals, Minnesota and Green Bay provided Monday Night
Football with one of its best and most exciting games of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   There were enough lead changes and mood swings to satisfy even
the most casual fan. When time ran out in the Vikings' 24-20
victory, players and coaches on both sidelines were mentally and
physically drained.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's victory before a Metrodome crowd of 64,203 wasn't
secured until safety Robert Griffith made an end-zone interception
of quarterback Brett Favre's desperation pass as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to make the playoffs, and this win puts us
closer to it,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said. ``Our guys were
put in a tough situation at the end, but Robert made the big
interception.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings snapped a two-game losing streak to improve their
record to 8-6, leaving them one game behind Tampa Bay. Minnesota
visits the New York Giants and hosts Detroit in its last two games.
The Packers fell to 7-7, but they aren't out of wild-card
contention. They travel to Tampa Bay and host Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay had no answer for the Minnesota combination of
quarterback Jeff George and receiver Randy Moss. George completed
16 of 29 passes for 258 yards and two touchdowns, both to Moss. He
wasn't intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moss made some great plays,'' Packers coach Ray Rhodes said.
``I thought we blitzed them a little too much at times. There were
a couple of situations where Randy got some room and made some
plays. And we missed some tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not surprising that Favre, who completed 22 of 39 passes
for 229 yards and no touchdowns, lost at the Metrodome. His record
here dropped to 1-7, but the Vikings had to earn every yard and
point to win the game and split the season series.
</P>
<P>
   After losing its last two games, Minnesota was desperate for a
victory. After a scoreless first quarter, the Vikings and Packers
exchanged leads in the second, which ended with Green Bay leading
13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Anderson's 42-yard field goal gave the Vikings a 3-0 lead
that lasted until the Packers moved 75 yards in nine plays. Running
back Dorsey Levens, returning to Green Bay's lineup after missing
two games because of a cracked rib, scored on a one-yard run, and
Ryan Longwell kicked the extra point for a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Longwell's 26-yard field goal boosted the Green Bay lead to
10-3, but Minnesota tied it when George found Moss for a 57-yard
touchdown pass. Moss got behind cornerback Tyrone Williams with
4:17 left in the first half. Anderson's extra point tied it.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers retaliated by going 69 yards to set up Longwell's
22-yard field goal with three seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   There were four punts in the third quarter before the Vikings
regained the lead with a 10-play, 60-yard drive. With
second-and-goal at the Green Bay one, George and Moss collaborated
for their second touchdown, which provided Minnesota with a 17-13
lead that lasted into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With Green Bay's offense unable to get untracked in the second
half, the Packers had to resort to trickery to score their other
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   When Longwell lined up for a 26-yard field goal early in the
fourth quarter, holder Matt Hasselbeck threw a nine-yard touchdown
pass to backup tight end Jeff Thomason. Longwell added the extra
point to give Green Bay a 20-17 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' much-maligned defense played about as well as it
could, but the Vikings' offense was just too good. Once again, it
was the George-to-Moss combination that did most of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   George threw deep over the middle to Moss, who made an
outstanding 36-yard catch. It appeared to be a touchdown, but the
officials called him down at the one, further delaying the Packers'
agony.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Leroy Hoard scored what proved to be the winning
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   With Green Bay trailing by four, Favre led the Packers into
Minnesota territory. His pass for Antonio Freeman was intercepted
by rookie cornerback Kenny Wright at the Minnesota 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings used all but the last 45 seconds. The Packers got
the ball back at their 22. With no timeouts remaining, Favre took
them to the Minnesota 28 with six seconds to go. With time for one
last play, Favre threw for the end zone, where Griffith made a
leaping interception.

 A COUPLE OF REAL SWINGERS WHO DESERVE A RAZE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the movie I'm writing about a psychotic
wrecking-ball operator, titled ``Swing Shift,'' the bad guy's reign
of terror ends (if you plan to see the movie, don't read the rest
of this paragraph) when he tries to knock down an occupied
children's hospital, but the good-guy scientist places a giant
magnet behind the crane and the wrecking ball swings right back
through the cab.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe nobody's made this movie yet. Nothing is quite
as cool as a wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half tons of steel in the shape of a teardrop, swung
with the lazy arc of a hypnotist's watch fob, bringing mighty
structures to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Bob Sparks, who is not a deranged maniac, is swinging
a wrecking ball at a large office building at Third and Howard. As
fast as Willie Brown builds the city, Bob and his ball-swinging
brother Bill knock it down.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sparks seems like a good name for a wrecking-ball operator,
but in my movie his name is Buster Downs. Announcer's voice in the
preview: ``Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So
don't blame Buster Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sparks says his father wanted him to become a doctor, and I
think maybe Bob is pulling my leg, but that is what he became _ a
doctor of destruction. A master of structural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Bob's father was a wrecking-ball operator. As a kid, Bob would
sit on his dad's knee as William Sparks turned buildings to
tangled, smoking rubble.
</P>
<P>
   You might say Bob took a crash course at Wreck U.
</P>
<P>
   When a kid is raised in the cab of a wrecking-ball crane, he
does not say to himself, ``When I grow up, I want to be a computer
software management consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Bob if his job is as fun as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be fun,'' he says. ``Now it's just a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing my disappointment, he adds, ``It's got its moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the time a couple years ago when he dropped his 8,600-pound
ball from its 160-foot-high boom onto a couple of junk cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gave 'em a sunroof pretty quick,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're talkin'.
</P>
<P>
   I see a TV show, called ``Wreck This.'' A wrecking ball can be
dropped straight down, or swung. Viewers send in requests. ``My
ex-husband's beach cottage.'' ``An above-ground swimming pool
filled with Pokemon toys.'' ``A 50-foot-high pyramid of paint
cans.''
</P>
<P>
   I see a civic fund-raiser. Donate $100, take a swing of the ball
at a Muni bus. Empty, of course.
</P>
<P>
   I see an ESPN event to replace the boring Lumberjack Games.
``The Wreckin' Games.''
</P>
<P>
   I see me climbing into the cab to take a couple swings at the
office building at Third and Howard. The demolition company does
not share my vision. Insurance problems and blah blah blah.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the kind of modern b.s. that attracted me to the
wrecking ball in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   THERE IS something primitively satisfying about a wrecking ball.
Even the name. It's so bad that even the bureaucrats can't mess
with its name. It is not called a ``kinetic spheroid disassembly
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world grown increasingly delicate and fragile and
technical, the wrecking ball is a throwback to the days when men
arranged high-speed, head-on locomotive crashes for sport.
</P>
<P>
   There is an awesome, Grim Reaper aspect to the ball's work.
Watching Bob break buildings is like watching Mark McGwire take
batting practice, only with better sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   Bob swings the boom to the right, stops it on a dime and starts
it back left. Lazily, like a kid in a park swing, seemingly in slow
motion, the ball-on-chain stops, hangs in the air, then begins to
swing slo-o-o-wly back to the left.
</P>
<P>
   What damage can it do, moving so slowly? And it's not that big,
about the size of Danny DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   The ball slams into the sixth-floor wall, chunks of debris
clatter down with an enormous roar, the entire side of the building
sways and wobbles like a prizefighter battling to stay on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   With each blow, the wall wobbles more. Finally, blam, there it
goes, six stories of offices collapsing helplessly, a 50-foot-long
steel girder flying through the air like a matchstick, sticking
point-first into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the artist,'' says demolition company president Wayne
Evans, watching Bob Sparks work. ``He and his brother are about the
best I've seen. It really is an art form, not a lot of guys can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob works four stick-like levers and two brake pedals, a
puppeteer in a hard hat.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bob's target is a free-standing, upright steel beam.
Precision is required. He nestles the wrecking ball softly against
the beam, like a golfer addressing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The backswing, and whammo, direct hit. The beam topples.
</P>
<P>
   I ASK BOB about the therapeutic aspects of his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this takes out pretty much all my frustration,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell if he's joking. Bob is a friendly, easygoing guy.
Of course, so was Buster Downs when he first walked onto the
demolition site and asked for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing Shift,'' by the way, opens with Buster doing his thing,
making the ball dance, to the sound of Emmylou Harris singing a
Neil Young song, ``Wrecking Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, I'll wear something pretty and
white, and we'll go dancing tonight. . .''
</P>
<P>
   BOOM!

REDESIGNED GLOBE TO DEBUT NEXT YEAR, PUBLISHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Globe's publisher, Richard H. Gilman,
announced Monday that the newspaper will undertake a complete
redesign next year that will include printing the paper on a
slightly narrower page.
</P>
<P>
   The one-inch reduction in the width of the page, from 13 1/2
inches to 12 1/2 inches, will be introduced in some papers in
January. The Globe will convert each of its seven presses to a
50-inch web to accommodate the new format, a process expected to
take one month per press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use less newsprint and ink,'' Gilman said, ``and thus
reduce our expenses as well as be more gentle on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also aim to be more appealing to readers, in an
easier-to-handle size with a more attractive design and graphic
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers, including The Washington Post, The
(Cleveland) Plain Dealer, and The Denver Post, have converted to
the smaller size in recent years, and others are in the process of
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign, to be introduced in September, is the first
significant change in the Globe's look in a decade. It's expected
to feature updated typography and graphics and some reorganization
of the content of the paper. The redesign, Gilman said, will offer
``an improved product with the editorial quality that readers have
come to expect from the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe is a wholly owned subsidiary of The New York Times Co.

RED SOX OFFER GOODEN ONE-YEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox, who already boast two Cy Young Award
winners in Pedro Martinez and Bret Saberhagen, have made an offer
to another, though one whose best days are long past.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight ``Doc'' Gooden, who in 1985 became the youngest pitcher
to win a Cy Young Award, at the age of 20, but this season was left
off Cleveland's postseason roster when the Indians met the Sox in
an American League division series in October, has been offered a
contract by the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox proposal was a one-year deal with a modest base
salary and performance bonuses that could lift the total value in
excess of $2 million. There also would be a club option for a
second year.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's agent, Lee Rosenblum, has sent the Sox a counteroffer
asking for a higher base salary and total package, but he was
confident the sides could reach an agreement this week. Rosenblum
was awaiting a response Monay night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dwight is very enthusiastic about pitching for the Red Sox,
especially since they are a contender,'' said Rosenblum, who also
has been in contact with a couple of other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who turned 35 Nov. 16, became a free agent when the
Indians decided not to exercise the $3 million option they held on
his contract for 2000, electing to give him a $400,000 buyout
instead. Gooden had signed a two-year deal for $5.6 million with
the Indians in 1997 but won a total of just 11 games in two
seasons. He was just 3-4 with a career-worst 6.26 ERA for Cleveland
this past season, when he made 22 starts but gave up 127 hits and
67 walks in 115 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox battered Gooden in his three starts against them in
1999, scoring 12 earned runs in 13 1/3 innings and beating him
twice, with one no-decision. Gooden also faced the Sox in Game 2 of
the 1998 division series, when he was ejected after just a third of
an inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox, with Saberhagen out until at least midseason after
undergoing shoulder surgery, are scrambling for some veteran help
in the rotation and apparently feel Gooden has something left.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1996, when he made a comeback with the Yankees
after being suspended for the 1995 season because he violated the
terms of his drug aftercare program, Gooden tossed a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He would join Saberhagen and Ramon Martinez as Sox pitchers who
have thrown a no-hitter in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden ranks fourth among all active pitchers in wins with 188,
one more than Tom Glavine, though the last time he won as many as
13 games in a season was 1991, when he went 13-7 for the Mets. He
also ranks fifth in career strikeouts among active pitchers with
2,238.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also are talking to lefthander Jeff Fassero, as general
manager Dan Duquette has indicated he'd like to add at least one
starter and a reliever to the staff entering the 2000 season.

 &HT;    Compulsion to clean cost me plenty o' green
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're feeling a little down in the
mouth because you didn't win the big lottery last Wednesday, for
heaven's sake set aside your selfish worries for just one minute
and start obsessing about something that actually matters in this
wild, whacked-out world of ours.
</P>
<P>
   Me.
</P>
<P>
   I think I won $6.3 million in the lottery back in 1993 and never
collected.
</P>
<P>
   I can't be sure, and laugh if you must, but I have this really
bad feeling and it began this week when I read about all these
winning lottery tickets that were never cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   $9 million in 1997. $2.8 million in 1995. And a single ticket
worth $6.34 million back in September of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   How could I, or anyone, hit the Lotto and not know it? Well,
these tickets don't exactly have the shelf life of Spam. They're
only good for 180 days. And I distinctly _ OK, vaguely _ remember
driving through Broward County in the early 1990s and buying a
ticket. Then I cleaned out my wallet in 1994 or '95 or '96, and I
found that Lotto ticket and I thought, What's this old thing? And I
threw it out.
</P>
<P>
   I do that.
</P>
<P>
   Throw things out.
</P>
<P>
   My husband has part of a wooden railing from his Ohio college
days. I don't have the letter I got yesterday from Ed McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Leftover pork roast, broken toys, love letters, newspapers,
resumes from pathetic job searches. Who needs that stuff? Catalogs,
birthday cards, half-done craft projects, an old bag of corn in the
freezer. In the trash.
</P>
<P>
   This obsession I have for tidiness _ pause a moment and let my
family and friends chuckle _ has gotten me into a heap of trouble
even before this $6.34 million debacle. I've been known to throw
away outgoing mail, story ideas, even my wedding hat. Once I even
threw out an old Sports Illustrated magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Now this.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I can't be certain. But when I close my eyes, I have this
very vivid image of the following sequence of numbers:
1-17-29-36-37-39. I'm pretty sure I remember them as the numbers
printed on the ticket that I'm pretty sure I bought seven years ago
at a little store that I believe could have been in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or I just copied them directly from the newspaper
clipping that happens to be right here on my desk.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering how I can be so chipper. WELL I'M NOT!
I'm schlepping children and carrying in my own groceries when _ in
the name of all that is fair in this world _ I should be soaking in
a bathtub, calling out, Calgon, take me away, in a voice as lovely
as the late Miss Madeline Kahn's.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, here I sit, not a box of Calgon in sight, waiting for
that no-good Jerry Springer to call. They're talking about booking
me for their Money in the Millennium show. It's called, How her
tidiness cost him millions.
</P>
<P>
   It's always about the man, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Wait just a darn a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Somebody called yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Where's that message?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for Pete's sake.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was from Jerry Seinfeld, and I just threw it away.

 &HT;    Heller was a well-loved grumpy guy
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Joseph Heller is my favorite living
author,'' I began a 1980 column about the author of Catch-22. This
was 19 years before his death last week at 76. ``If he were dead,
he'd be among my top five or six dead authors.''
</P>
<P>
   In that column I went on to explain that far from looking
forward to meeting Heller, who was in South Florida visiting family
and publicizing his recently released paperback ``Good as Gold,'' I
dreaded the meeting. For one thing, Heller was my hero, and I was
afraid I wouldn't like him. Second, his publicist had gotten his
book to me only a day before Heller's visit, and I had barely
cracked it.
</P>
<P>
   When I begged to postpone our interview until I finished the
book, he wouldn't hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on page 80?'' he asked. ``It'll go so fast from now on,
you won't be able to put it down.''
</P>
<P>
   That relaxed me. And when he further assured me that it was a
great book and that I would love it, I correctly guessed that a guy
with that kind of ego was going to be a loosey-goosey interview.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw when we met at the Holiday Inn was a 56-year-old
novelist ``of medium height, slender, with coils of unruly gray
hair good for wrecking combs. If he were any more collegiate, ivy
would grow on him. He looks like your English Lit prof should have
looked, and indeed has taught at New York City College long enough
to know he doesn't particularly care for it.''
</P>
<P>
   I told Heller up front that I had read ``Catch-22'' three times
and still didn't know whether it was anti-war or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me either,'' said Heller. ``I still can't tell anybody what
``Catch-22'' is about. People ask me if Yossarian got away. I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a chance and tell Heller that his second
novel, ``Something Happened,'' depressed me and that I probably
wouldn't have finished it if it weren't for his recurring teenage
flashback of a ravishing older woman who used to take him to the
stock room.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about writing a depressing, serious novel when
people are expecting ironic slapstick is that people take you
seriously as a writer. The downside is that his long-awaited second
novel, 12 years in the writing, took some of the anticipation out
of his third novel, four years in the incubator.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Good as Gold' was just awaited,'' he noted dryly.
</P>
<P>
   And it also proved the mother lode for zaniness fans looking for
more nuggets from the author who gave the language ``Catch-22,''
the notion of a loophole that self-destructs the second you ask for
it. In ``Gold,'' the insanity built into bureaucracy blooms anew
when author Bruce Gold gets a job as a White House flack for the
Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   When I pointed out that in ``Gold,'' he dealt very kindly with
an abrasive father who gave him nothing but grief, Heller shrugged
and insisted that ``I almost never offer answers. I don't have a
solution for these family problems. I put my own mother in a
nursing home and I didn't feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller wrote that medical science had created something terribly
portentous, ``a long life span, with a larger and larger number of
old people who were unneeded by society, had nothing to do and were
not revered. How much longer would grown children hope their
parents going into surgery would come out alive?''
</P>
<P>
   Within five years of asking that question, Heller himself was
stricken with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a nerve disease that left
him paralyzed and bedridden. For a year, he could not change
position, swallow or clear his throat, although he could talk with
slurred speech. His recovery was almost complete, leaving him with
a slight speech impairment, immense gratitude, and the makings of a
book, ``No Laughing Matter,'' co-authored with his friend, Speed
Vogel, a sculptor and herring taster who managed his personal
affairs during his convalescence.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed Heller after his recovery, again at a Holiday Inn,
where he told me that if you're going to be laid up in a hospital
for a year, you had better have friends and money. He was $250,000
in the hole when his health returned, and learned through his
co-author that Vogel and friends such as Dustin Hoffman and Mel
Brooks loved Heller despite the fact that they often commiserated
with one another about his ``impatience, rudeness, insensitivity,
selfishness, arrogance, duplicity, obstinacy, malevolence,
insincerity, negativity and general unpleasantness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked him,'' Vogel wrote, ``but we were extremely hard-put
to explain why.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vogel reflected, Heller came out of his illness ``so
much nicer in every way that we, his friends, pondered how we could
manage to give him another foreign ailment _ I am still working on
it, for my sake as well as humanity's.''
</P>
<P>
   One day when Heller was at his lowest, Mel Brooks strode to the
novelist's side, placed his hand on the patient's head, rolled his
eyes toward the ceiling and screamed:
</P>
<P>
   ``For Jesus! Stand! Walk!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Heller was unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks shrugged and said: ``I thought I'd give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without people,'' said Heller, No. 2 after Mark Twain on my
list of dead authors, ``I would have been in an awful situation.''

 &HT;    One of AIDS' biggest tragedies is all who remain nameless
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ They call it the NAMES Project, but it can't
always be true to that.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of hand-made sections make up the immense AIDS quilt
that travels the country. Most have names. Then there are squares
like the one dedicated to John Doe, or to many of them _ ``actor,''
``artist,'' ``teacher,'' ``nurse.'' It signifies death certificates
falsified to protect someone's identity.
</P>
<P>
   We must ask ourselves why it is that our society has made it
necessary for people with such an important story to need
anonymity. We must realize that people's need to remain nameless
compounds the AIDS tragedy in more than one way.
</P>
<P>
   On the NAMES quilt is a square dedicated to ``Raymond,'' a gay
man who would not have allowed even this much information out while
alive, not even his first name, ``because his family would have
been deeply disturbed to have Raymond identified publicly in a gay
context . . . Ray himself never came out of the closet. Ray was
alone in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Family. Friends. Alone. Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way people die in a society that cherishes life.
</P>
<P>
   But dwell not on Raymond, and not on the closet that confined
him. By now everyone should know that AIDS is not a ``gay
disease.'' Certainly the sample in today's paper will attest as
much.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it strikes people in all walks of life. Unfortunately
almost all get routed into a common canyon _ity, secrecy,
shame, stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Allen, former president of the Southern Baptist
Convention, is one with no shortage of family or friends, but one
who found himself harboring a terrible secret through his darkest
days.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's daughter-in-law contracted HIV from a transfusion in the
early days when AIDS lurked in the blood supply. Her two sons got
it. All three died. In the early stages of this tragedy, Allen's
son, a pastor in a Colorado church, lost his job because the
congregation feared rubbing elbows with his family.
</P>
<P>
   One of Allen's biggest challenges was, sadly, finding a church
where his grandchildren could go to Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me hard when I realized that the church as an
institution has so failed that it could not summon the cleansing
touch of Jesus for a 4-year-old child,'' he wrote in his memoir,
``The Burden of a Secret.'' Allen tells of the years when this
terrible family secret was known only to a few.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we want to perceive AIDS as someone else's problem, so
too do we deceive ourselves that keeping such secrets is a burden
only on those who suffer. In fact, it is an impediment to curbing
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Valdiserri, a medical pathologist who lost his twin
brother to AIDS, writes in his book ``Gardening in Clay:
Reflections on AIDS,'' ``When we look at HIV infection as a threat
to our own, we accept as valid the prevention needs of those of us
who are at risk, and we willingly share our resources to meet their
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But when we see AIDS as someone else's problem, we limit
ourselves to preaching ``don't do this'' and ``don't do that.'' We
wouldn't consider for a moment something that might save lives like
needle exchanges for drug abusers who might risk their lives for a
high. Because they're faceless. They're ``them.''
</P>
<P>
   The shame is ours in their anonymity.

 &HT;    Focused funds depend on manager
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Suppose you could pick an accomplished mutual fund
manager and concentrate your investment on his very best stock
selections.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about index funds and giant funds, those familiar names
that spread your money among hundreds of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   You can indeed take the first option by picking from a growing
number of mutual funds that invest in 30 or fewer stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They are called focused funds, or concentrated funds, and there
are scores of them. The number is growing now, as mutual fund
families elbow their way into yet one more investment niche.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is easy to understand: The fund manager can
concentrate on a handful of companies, and you get the benefit of
his very best work.
</P>
<P>
   The chart at right shows how attractive the returns can be, at
least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shows that focused funds are not a
one-decision-for-all-time way to beat the market. Among the
longest-lived funds, not a single one did as well as the S&AMP;P 500
index over a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is the volatility that goes with
owning fewer stocks. If one goes bad, the impact is greater on a
less-diversified portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're giving the manager more freedom and making stock
picking more important,'' explained analyst Russ Kinnel of
Morningstar, a leading fund research company. ``That's great if you
have a great stock picker. But in the hands of an average stock
picker, it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Focused funds tend to cluster among the best performers _ and
the worst. ``What happens is that people notice the ones at the
top,'' Kinnel said.
</P>
<P>
   You can get some very good years with a focused fund. But if the
market has a bad year, a focused fund may well have a very bad
year. That suggests that risk-averse investors probably ought to
stay away from focused funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a focused fund may be interesting for investors who
already own larger, more diversified funds. ``If you've got a
couple of those, a focused fund isn't really taking on much risk,''
Kinnel said. ``And if you're going to bet on active management
rather than indexing, why not really do it? Why not tack on a
focused fund, where stock picking really does matter?''
</P>
<P>
   If you're picking a focused fund, there are plenty of choices.
Morningstar now follows 132 focused funds that specialize in stocks
and that have been around for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   There are two selection techniques: Stick with established funds
that have a long track record, or go for the top performers in the
last year or two.
</P>
<P>
   I favor the old hands. Like Kinnel, I don't believe short-term
results mean much. If you go for the hot hands, it's important to
examine the fund manager carefully. Look for past performance at
other funds. Check out the manager's investment strategies and his
or her reputation. Don't forget to check the fund's investment
criteria _ large or small companies, growth or value companies,
U.S. or foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnel cites Tom Marsico and Bill Nygren as managers with good
records. Marsico runs the 2-year-old Marsico Focus Fund (46.1
percent return over the last year, 1-888-860-8686). Nygren is boss
of the 3-year-old Oakmark Select Fund (19.5 percent,
1-800-625-6275).
</P>
<P>
   Those two didn't make the chart below because it focuses on
one-year returns.
</P>
<P>
   Does that matter? Probably not. Remember, the best choices here
are the best managers.

 &HT;    A healthy divorce? Approach minimizes anger, costs
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Remember the 1989 black comedy that
pitted a determined and irate Kathleen Turner against a brutal
Michael Douglas in a near-battle to the death?
</P>
<P>
   ``War of the Roses'' told the tale of a couple who became locked
in such a ruinous divorce that they thought nothing of destroying
their belongings and, eventually, each other.
</P>
<P>
   Time out.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to come out punching when a divorce is on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that never leaves you,'' says Boca Raton lawyer
Valerie Kanouse of her own difficult divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage ended in 1987, two years after her husband left
her, but years before custody battles and appeals ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't understand the psychic damage that you
suffer going through this trauma. I thought there has to be a
better way.''
</P>
<P>
   She found it, she says, in an emerging movement toward a kinder,
gentler divorce.
</P>
<P>
   It's called collaborative divorce, and it means that lawyers for
both parties sign a contract promising not to go to court, but to
try to settle amicably.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no settlement, the lawyers withdraw from the case.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, which binds the lawyers through the agreement, was
developed in 1996 by Stuart Webb, a Minneapolis lawyer who tired of
seeing clients pull each other apart, especially during divorces.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're suggesting is, let's not file anything in the
courts. Let's start working on the agreement right off. When we
come up with an agreement, than we file a dissolution with the
agreement attached. Both sides file that,'' Kanouse said.
</P>
<P>
   The object is to minimize anger and save money by avoiding a
prolonged court battle. Initially, you eliminate ``the psychic
satisfaction out of filing for divorce,'' Kanouse said, but you
also eliminate _ or at least postpone _ the vitriolic war that can
scar both the couple and any children involved.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is this approach won't work for everyone.
Certainly, it doesn't work for people who want revenge, where
assets are thought to be buried by a spouse, or where there is
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   And failure to get an agreement would mean starting over with
new lawyers for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   But those supporting this approach say it's worth a try for
couples who are motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can kick butt like you never saw it kicked,'' says Don
Dowling, a Delray Beach lawyer who is one of two male attorneys to
join the fledgling Collaborative Divorce Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not the approach to take in all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wouldn't ``push it'' on anyone seeking a divorce, but
would offer it as an option.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach lawyer Robin Roshkind says, ``Psychologically,
it makes the parties more committed to settle. The couple has said
they don't want to fight about it, get it over with. There's a
spirit of cooperation because they have the same goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the process is new, none of the 16 lawyers who has so
far joined the association has handled such a case yet.
</P>
<P>
   Kanouse, however, sees it increasing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to encourage you to get a Rambo lawyer. The whole
family gets hurt, but the lawyers make money. With this, clients
and attorneys should be aligned.''

 &HT;    Fat cat's my aspiration
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLIS, Fla. _ Just in case reincarnation is an option, I've
made up my mind to come back as a fish-camp cat because from what
I've seen lately, it's a pretty good life. In exchange for racking
up an occasional mouse, there is the promise of warm nights and
endless fresh fish. Best of all, there are tourists to shmooz.
</P>
<P>
   Fish camp, for the benefit of those who have never experienced
it, is a place where folks go to get away from their comfortable
beds and user-friendly plumbing. It's a place with roach motels
under the sink and Red Dog beer bottle caps under the sofa. There
are bare bulbs overhead, no closets, and the showers are straight
out of Bates Motel.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I go, I wonder why. I don't enjoy fishing because I'd
feel lousy about killing a perfectly healthy fish when I could buy
one that's already in the can. And I find the great outdoors most
appealing when I'm on the inside looking out at it.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason that has not yet made itself clear to me,
about twice a year I wind up in a fish-camp cabin on the edge of a
lake in central Florida, frying bacon, boiling grits, and catering
three squares a day for Big Tom, the fish-camp cat.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tom, as his name indicates, is an oversize beauty built like
maybe he's just recently retired from the Packers starting lineup.
He moved into my cabin the same night I did. All I had to offer him
was some half-and-half that I'd picked up for my morning coffee. I
poured two fingers in a bowl and set it beside the door.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tom sniffed the cream then looked up at me with that ``Is
this the best you can do?'' look cats do so well. I found myself
making excuses, late flight, closed stores, and promising to do
better in the morning. Big Tom thought it over and then, just to be
polite I guess, lapped enough cream to coat his whiskers. While I
unpacked, he sat on the sofa washing up.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Big Tom stayed long enough to help me make the bed
and check out the bathroom. I let him go in first, just in case.
While I showered, Big Tom sat on the toilet lid and talked to me of
the cabbages and kings of the fish-camp kitty world. He told me of
the granddaddy gator who lives in the boat inlet, and filled me in
on a family of pileated woodpeckers who hang out in the cypress
tree beside the dock. I paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   While I dried, Big Tom preened and purred and stretched out on
the carpet to be admired. He even let me stroke his lush black coat
a couple of times before wandering out into the night. I asked if
he'd be coming back to sleep. He didn't answer so I closed the door
and turned in.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning fog muffled the slapping of the waves against
the dock as the fishing boats churned down the inlet and headed for
the lake. Big Tom wandered in from his nightly prowl and while I
rustled us up some bacon and grits, he fell into a deep sleep on
the sofa. Pretty soon he was dreaming _ whiskers twitching, paws
waggling. Guess maybe the gator was chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, Big Tom curled up on my pillow as I dressed to
go to the store. He never stirred when I tiptoed out the open front
door or when I came back in.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it went for the week. In exchange for kitty treats
and cozy napping places, Big Tom allowed me to scratch behind his
ears and tell him what a fine fellow he was. Once I even asked who
he might have been in his previous life. Of course, he didn't
answer. All he did was break into one of those enigmatic grins that
cats do so well and blink several times, quite deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tom, I suspect, has been around for many moons. I just wish
I could figure out how to get his job when we both move on.

 &HT;    Face of Jesus a 2,000-year-old mystery
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Christ is worshiped as the human
incarnation of the son of God, and his likeness has been reproduced
for hundreds of years by thousands of artists.
</P>
<P>
   But they've all been making it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostles were assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but
no one bothered to write about his appearance. We know some things
he said, but not at all how he sounded.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bible readers are given vague hints about the visage
of the Prince of Peace, even those are contradictory. It was
written that Jesus was handsome, and it was written that he was
not.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries European Renaissance painters gave him the benefit
of the doubt. Jesus was portrayed as tall and fair and, well,
angelic, but archeologists and historians say the evidence points
otherwise. By the standards of white America today, the son of God
was probably short, dark and lithe. ``He was probably about
5-feet-4, and 135 pounds with tanned olive skin,'' said the Rev J.
Brabban, chairman of the religion and philosophy department at Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jesus was a carpenter and a construction worker he
probably had calluses on his hands. In all likelihood he had brown
or black hair, perhaps curly, and an aquiline, Semitic nose. In
short, Jesus looked like a Middle Eastern Jew who worked hard for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   But did he have a beard and long hair like he did on Broadway in
``Jesus Christ Superstar?'' Maybe. Men of that day wore their hair
both long and short, but most of the styles archeologists are
familiar with from the first century come from portraits of rich
people who lived in big cities, hardly a category Jesus fell into.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition of Jesus having long hair and a beard is from
the Middle Ages,'' said Michael White, a professor of religious
studies at the University of Texas at Austin. ``They romanticized
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make things up and then they get passed down as fact.
It's like the camels in the story of the Magi. There is no evidence
that there were camels and they were not typical domestic animals,
but everybody thinks they were there because that's how the story
is presented.''
</P>
<P>
   What historians are confident of is that Jesus was probably
familiar with four languages. His native tongue would have been
Aramaic, a cousin to Hebrew; the language spoken at the marketplace
was Greek; the formal language of the government was Latin. Jesus
would have both read and written ancient Hebrew, the language of
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   By our standards, Jesus would have been considered, materially
at least, dirt poor. He might have eaten meat _ lamb or goat _ once
every two weeks but he survived largely on grains. Except for the
time he spent near the Sea of Galilee all the fish he ate was
probably salted.
</P>
<P>
   And he was not well-traveled. With the exception of his family's
exile to Egypt after his birth, he probably never ventured more
than 100 miles away from his home town of Nazareth. But because he
lived in the Middle East, the crossroads of the world, he probably
saw people from several different countries who came through the
Holy Land to trade their merchandise, and their slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Besides persecution, he probably feared leprosy and knew a few
people with tuberculosis. Since even rudimentary dental care or
optometry was still centuries away, most of the people around him
were missing teeth and suffered from poor vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all speculation,'' said White. ``From all we know he
looked like any ordinary Jewish person of the first century. But we
can't really be sure.''

 &HT;    Recipe for happiness: good neighbors, time, energy
 &HT;    By Mara Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's not quantity of dates that does it. It's not
money, or education, or even the boyfriend or girlfriend of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The single people who are happiest with Dayton, Ohio, and with
their lives, find these things: a neighborhood where they have
friends, not just vaguely familiar faces; the time to follow their
interests; and the energy to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mahan, 33, loves his neighborhood. He moved there with his
former partner, with grand plans to renovate a Victorian home and
only a small hammer for hanging pictures and no clue of how to
start.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the architecture that captured his heart. It's the
friendships in historic McPherson Town that keep him tethered to
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton's not the largest, most cosmopolitan city we know,'' he
said. ``You seek out the people that you have things in common with
and the things you like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To newcomers having trouble finding their place, he advised
moving into a historic neighborhood. ``I think all of the historic
neighborhoods, you just have an immediate sense of camaraderie, and
they truly are neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied singles make peace with their past, which makes them
open to the present's possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Caren Ostendorf is a woman at ease in her own skin. You'd know
that if you saw her out salsa dancing this summer or fall, her
heels rapping against the dance floor, her hips rocking in time.
She had tiny brown braids all over her head and a delighted smile.
</P>
<P>
   She's 35, but sort of feels like she's 25 and could easily pass
for twentysomething. She wears swoopy scarves, clunky heels and
short skirts, and her nieces _ she's from a six-kid Catholic family
and is the last single left _ ask why their moms can't dress as
cool as she does.
</P>
<P>
   She pokes fun at her dating track record _ frequently with
foreigners, people of different faiths and one boyfriend 20 years
older. ``My mother says I date people that I cannot marry,'' she
said. She thinks her mother might be right.
</P>
<P>
   It's been several years since she's had a serious relationship,
and she's only had a handful in the last 15 years. She'd like to
find a husband and have children, but it's mostly on her mind when
she's dating again. Is he the one? Can I imagine 40 years with him?
Would he be a good dad?
</P>
<P>
   A year or two ago, she put an ad in the personals and loaded it
with humor, touting her great teeth (like a thoroughbred's) and
good genes. The calls just didn't stop. For six months, response
after response. Many she didn't even bother to meet. And those she
did, she said she wished she hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met so many guys _ so many times I thought I'd rather be
home reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``That taught me a lot. I realized that I was just really happy
with my life. An addition would be great. (But) the energy and time
you take to look for somebody _ you feel like it's such a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbor just down the block in St. Anne's Hill became her
latest boyfriend. He's a foreign graduate student, studying
biology. They've only been seeing each other a few months, and
she's not sure where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   That uncertainty defines single life and has to be accepted to
feel OK about being single.
</P>
<P>
   Rick figures he'll have a life partner at some point. Since he
and his boyfriend of eight years split a year ago, dating hasn't
become serious, and he doesn't mind. He has a friendly face, a
confident manner, a sense of style _ he's rarely at a loss for
companionship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at myself as eligible and not single,'' he said.
``Single sounds so lonely, and I'm far from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does he meet men? Where doesn't he, is more like it. At
the gas station, (''We had good eye contact''), at a restaurant
(his waiter), through friends, at bars. ...
</P>
<P>
   He won't meet them through the antique/architectural salvage
store he owns. ``There's business and there's pleasure, and never
the two shall meet.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hates matchmaking. ``I don't want my mother choosing
partners for me, and I don't want you choosing my partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he laughs at some of the flaky things dates have
said to him, he said he gets something out of every date and
doesn't regret any of his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ju-an Norvell, 27, of Trotwood, also easily meets new
acquaintances everywhere _ at stoplights, in grocery stores. ``I
cannot look at someone in your face and not speak,'' he said. ``I
just enjoy people, period. I guess I have a friendly spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ju-an said the hardest thing about dating isn't finding dates _
with an impish grin, he said the longest he's gone without a date
might be three weeks, maybe a month. It's finding women who are
secure in themselves so they can be secure with you.
</P>
<P>
   While Ju-an also describes himself as very happy with his single
life, he's still a little uncertain about the future and the
relationships it may hold. His parents are divorced, his divorced
sister just moved back in with their mom, and many of the married
couples he sees don't seem too happy.
</P>
<P>
   When his girlfriend Monica got pregnant two years ago, after
four months of dating, he refused to marry her _ and she was not
pleased, he said. They're moving toward marriage now, he said, but
he's still anxious _ even with an adorable daughter in the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone goes into it with some kind of fear,'' he
said. ``How are things going to turn out?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all these happy singles were always pleased with the Dayton
area as a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Rick hated Dayton when he moved here eight years ago from
Cincinnati, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I whined about Dayton being too small of a town, that it was
too blue-collar of a city,'' he said. ``It was a culture shock for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neighbors he met introduced him to more people, and he
found his comfort zone. Meeting people builds on itself. Networking
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Keller, 34, moved here from Charlotte, N.C., in 1989 to
work at Emery Worldwide, and he likes Dayton much better than that
fast-growing city. In Dayton, he said, ``you meet a lot of people
through other people. Decent people, anyway.'' In Charlotte,
``There are so many people that you can't even get around.''

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're feeling a
little down in the mouth because you didn't win the big lottery
last Wednesday, for heaven's sake set aside your selfish worries
for just one minute and start obsessing about something that
actually matters in this wild, whacked-out world of ours. Me. I
think I won $6.3 million in the lottery back in 1993 and never
collected. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The United Nations has no standing in the
Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-Palestinian peace talks but there's a way
the U.N. could be helpful even so. It could get off Israel's back.
In more diplomatic but still firm language, that was the message
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a recent speech. (Teepen,
Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ This subject is, in the coinage of the
recently late Joseph Heller, a Catch-22. It is about where in
automobiles children ought to be sitting _ or, rather, where they
should not be sitting. For some time, it was judged that children
should not be sitting in the front seat because of erupting air
bags in an accident. Now, according to a study done by the Los
Angeles Times, they also should not be sitting in the back seat,
this based on unsubstantial front seats that pitch backwards.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ INGLIS, Fla. _ Just in case reincarnation is an
option, I've made up my mind to come back as a fish-camp cat
because from what I've seen lately, it's a pretty good life. In
exchange for racking up an occasional mouse, there is the promise
of warm nights and endless fresh fish. Best of all, there are
tourists to shmooz. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Joseph Heller is my
favorite living author,'' I began a 1980 column about the author of
Catch-22. This was 19 years before his death last week at 76. ``If
he were dead, he'd be among my top five or six dead authors.''
(Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ They call it the NAMES Project, but
it can't always be true to that. Thousands of hand-made sections
make up the immense AIDS quilt that travels the country. Most have
names. Then there are squares like the one dedicated to John Doe,
or to many of them _ ``actor,'' ``artist,'' ``teacher,'' ``nurse.''
It signifies death certificates falsified to protect someone's
identity. We must ask ourselves why it is that our society has made
it necessary for people with such an important story to need
anonymity. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   CIVIL-DIVORCE _ It's called collaborative divorce, and it means
that lawyers for both parties sign a contract promising not to go
to court, but to try to settle amicably. If there is no settlement,
the lawyers withdraw from the case. The concept, which binds the
lawyers through the agreement, was developed in 1996 by Stuart
Webb, a Minneapolis lawyer who tired of seeing clients pull each
other apart, especially during divorces. The object is to minimize
anger and save money by avoiding a prolonged court battle.
Initially, you eliminate ``the psychic satisfaction out of filing
for divorce,'' Kanouse said, but you also eliminate _ or at least
postpone _ the vitriolic war that can scar both the couple and any
children involved. (Susman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but no one bothered to

avalanche of clutter that leaves homeowners like her chronically

   DISHWASHER _ If you have a dishwasher, do you know where its
owner's manual is? As with any appliance, you can get the most out

   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ Suppose you could pick an accomplished

fewer stocks. They are called focused funds, or concentrated funds,

   ETOUR _ ATLANTA _ Chat with Roger Barnett, president and CEO of
Atlanta-based eTour on the occasion of completion of a second round

he was a one man band at Internet World in 1998 and look at him
now. Cell phone, huge offices, NYC public relations firm, offices
in three states, and a slew of magazine covers. Still, people

   CIVIL-DIVORCE _ It's called collaborative divorce, and it means
that lawyers for both parties sign a contract promising not to go
to court, but to try to settle amicably. If there is no settlement,
the lawyers withdraw from the case. The concept, which binds the
lawyers through the agreement, was developed in 1996 by Stuart
Webb, a Minneapolis lawyer who tired of seeing clients pull each
other apart, especially during divorces. The object is to minimize
anger and save money by avoiding a prolonged court battle.
Initially, you eliminate ``the psychic satisfaction out of filing
for divorce,'' Kanouse said, but you also eliminate _ or at least
postpone _ the vitriolic war that can scar both the couple and any
children involved. (Susman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE-BUT-HAPPY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It's not quantity of dates
that does it. It's not money, or education, or even the boyfriend
or girlfriend of the moment. The single people who are happiest
with Dayton, Ohio, and with their lives, find these things: a
neighborhood where they have friends, not just vaguely familiar
faces; the time to follow their interests; and the energy to do it.

<P>
   JESUS-APPEARANCE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Christ is
worshiped as the human incarnation of the son of God, and his
likeness has been reproduced for hundreds of years by thousands of
artists. But they've all been making it up. The Apostles were
assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but no one bothered to
write about his appearance. We know some things he said, but not at
all how he sounded. And though Bible readers are given vague hints
about the visage of the Prince of Peace, even those are
contradictory. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

avalanche of clutter that leaves homeowners like her chronically

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're feeling a
little down in the mouth because you didn't win the big lottery
last Wednesday, for heaven's sake set aside your selfish worries
for just one minute and start obsessing about something that
actually matters in this wild, whacked-out world of ours. Me. I
think I won $6.3 million in the lottery back in 1993 and never
collected. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The United Nations has no standing in the
Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-Palestinian peace talks but there's a way
the U.N. could be helpful even so. It could get off Israel's back.
In more diplomatic but still firm language, that was the message
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a recent speech. (Teepen,
Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ This subject is, in the coinage of the
recently late Joseph Heller, a Catch-22. It is about where in
automobiles children ought to be sitting _ or, rather, where they
should not be sitting. For some time, it was judged that children
should not be sitting in the front seat because of erupting air
bags in an accident. Now, according to a study done by the Los
Angeles Times, they also should not be sitting in the back seat,
this based on unsubstantial front seats that pitch backwards.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ INGLIS, Fla. _ Just in case reincarnation is an
option, I've made up my mind to come back as a fish-camp cat
because from what I've seen lately, it's a pretty good life. In
exchange for racking up an occasional mouse, there is the promise
of warm nights and endless fresh fish. Best of all, there are
tourists to shmooz. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Joseph Heller is my
favorite living author,'' I began a 1980 column about the author of
Catch-22. This was 19 years before his death last week at 76. ``If
he were dead, he'd be among my top five or six dead authors.''
(Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ They call it the NAMES Project, but
it can't always be true to that. Thousands of hand-made sections
make up the immense AIDS quilt that travels the country. Most have
names. Then there are squares like the one dedicated to John Doe,
or to many of them _ ``actor,'' ``artist,'' ``teacher,'' ``nurse.''
It signifies death certificates falsified to protect someone's
identity. We must ask ourselves why it is that our society has made
it necessary for people with such an important story to need
anonymity. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   The final installment of Cox's Christianity at 2000 series is
now available. The series, written by Gayle White of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and edited by Ron Feinberg with feeds from Cox
religion writers and foreign correspondents, has run since January.
</P>
<P>
   This package looks at the present state of Christianity and its
growth areas in South America, Russia, Africa and Asia. Art
includes charts/maps from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on
Christianity's growth.
</P>
<P>
   This package is available as a CoxNet Focus page for the weekend
of Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   A final article, on the future of Christianity, will move the
week of Dec. 27 for Jan. 1 publication.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the stories. All have moved, in the (l) Lifestyle and
(i) International categories.

   For the weekend of Sunday, Dec. 26
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-WORLD _ The spread of Christianity transformed the
Western world. As the third millennium approaches, the movement is
far removed from what it was as its inception. Today, almost one
third of the world's population is Christian. For believers, Jesus
is the hinge of history. But even by secular standards, Jesus is
the dominant figure of Western culture. In this last installment of
a yearlong project, we explore the growth of Christianity around
the world, especially its impact in Asia and Africa and
re-emergence in Russia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50.
WITH PHOTOS AND GRAPHICS .
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Across Moscow and the rest of
Russia, sparkling new onion-domed churches are rising from the
rubble of Communism. The Russian Orthodox Church is back, though in
Soviet times it never really went away. The church was a survivor,
and some say collaborator, that has now emerged as a powerful
political and economic force in the new Russia. (Holmes, Cox News
Service). 45.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-ASIA _ SEOUL, South Korea _ This region of the
world has been one of the more painful ones for Christians and
their beliefs. They face persecution everywhere. Vietnamese police
have raided a number of Christian gatherings across the country in
recent months, detaining and harassing scores of worshipers.
Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of
79 million has 8 million Catholics, the largest community in
Southeast Asia outside the Philippines. But in secular South Korea,
the number is growing and becoming one of the most active churches
in East Asia. (Kirk, Cox News Service) 40.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-LATIN _ MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic
country, they build shrines by the thousands and crawl on their
knees to honor the Virgin Mary at her own special basilica. The
main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico earlier this year _ his
fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the second-most visited Catholic sanctuary in the world
after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).
40.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-AFRICA _ KUMASI, Ghana _ Christian missionaries
began pouring into Africa in the late 19th century, saving souls
and offering a Western worldview that dramatically changed the
ideas that shaped this continent in the last century. Today
Christians are part of the fabric of this land. And missionaries
continue to come. Mike Mozley, a missionary from Marietta, Ga.,
moved his wife and three children to Ghana this year. We take a
look at the growth of Christianity through his mission. (Melvin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday, Jan 1
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-FUTURE _ For thousands of years, Christians in
Europe and the Americas have led the faithful. In coming years
there's a chance that the growth of the religion will be centered
in Asia and Africa. In fact, the largest Christian church in the
world today is in Korea, not the Bible belt of America. In this
last installment of our yearlong report on the millennium and
Christianity, we look into the future and explore the direction the
church seems headed in the next century. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 50.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walk into any church in metro Atlanta at Christmastime
and you're likely to hear the same carols _ the wistful strains of
``O Come, O Come Emmanuel,'' the invitational ``O Come, Let Us
Adore Him'' and the effusive ``Joy to the World.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the tunes are familiar at the chapel at Shallowford
Presbyterian Church, you probably won't recognize the words. The
chapel is the home of Hanbit Korean Presbyterian Church, one of the
fastest-growing congregations in the Presbytery of Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hanbit (a transliteration of the Korean words for ``one light'')
represents the completion of a circle that began more than 110
years ago when Presbyterian men and women from America traveled to
the mission fields of Korea. Today, there are almost twice as many
Presbyterians in Korea as in the United States, and South Korean
Presbyterian churches are sending out more missionaries than their
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States now is a mission field for the Korean
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Korean churches, we first received the gospel
through American missionaries,'' said the Rev. Sung Joo Park,
Hanbit's pastor. ``Now the case is reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all major Christian denominations talk in similar
terms as they survey the Christian world today: the ``center of
gravity'' has shifted from Western Europe and North America, and
the future of the faith is in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some evidence:
</P>
<P>
   _ One in three Roman Catholic cardinals is from the so-called
Third World, and both Asia and Africa have more members of the
College of Cardinals (15 and 14, respectively) than the United
States (12). An African cardinal is considered one of the top
contenders to be the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Archbishop of Canterbury, presiding cleric of Anglicanism,
opened the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference in England last year by
greeting the congregation in Swahili. Of the 736 bishops
registered, only 316 _ less than half _ were from the United
States, Canada and Europe combined. Africa sent 224 and Asia 95.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today, 58 percent of Protestants and two-thirdsistians
in Charismatic and Pentecostal churches _ a movement that began in
the United States in the early 20th century _ live in Africa, Asia
and Latin America. ``The gospel is no longer in western
captivity,'' says David Garrison, a vice president at the
International Mission Board of the 15.9 million-member Southern
Baptist Convention. ``It's every bit as at home in Beijing or
Shanghai as in Atlanta or Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   As Christians from China, Korea, Nigeria and Kenya relocate,
they are changing the face of the church in the United States and
sustaining some traditional denominations. In Georgia, for
instance, Southern Baptists have services in 37 languages, from
Arabic to Urdu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally for Southern Baptists, without the growth of the
ethnic and African-American congregations in the last number of
years, we would not have seen the positive growth we have been able
to report,'' said Jerry Baker, a specialist in non-English
ministries with the Georgia Baptist Convention. Until a slight loss
in 1998, the Southern Baptist Convention had increased in
membership every year since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   If the 2.6 million-member Presbyterian Church (USA) successfully
adapts to Asian and African immigrants, it will have a
``significant racial-ethnic majority'' by 2050, predicts Edwin
Albright, executive presbyter of the Presbytery of Greater Atlanta,
where the fastest-growing churches are international. ``If we
don't, I think the consequences are severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptizing the nations
</P>
<P>
   According to the gospel of Matthew, Jesus told his disciples,
``Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   Christians through the ages have regarded the verses, known as
the ``Great Commission,'' as their marching orders. They have
spread the faith _ sometimes through violence, as during the
Crusades, but often through compassionate work. Church history is
full of accounts of martyrs who gave their lives telling others
about Jesus, beginning with St. Paul, whose epistles make up much
of the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   From the Middle East to the Roman Empire to the New World,
Christianity spread.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20th century, North Americans represented about
two-thirds of all Protestant foreign missionaries. Many spent years
in the field, establishing hospitals and schools, drilling wells
and building dams, and taking part in every phase of life from
delivering babies to caring for the dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who gave their lives to mission work and were
greatly revered by the people who were there,'' said Stephen
Gunter, professor of evangelism at Emory University's Candler
School of Theology. ``Some died while they were in their late 20s
and early 30s. Other people lived all their lives in another
cultural context, spending only a few years back in North America.
You look at the economic levels at which those people retire, and
people with 30, 40 or 50 years in missionary service could not
afford to buy a house in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, their efforts generated academic disciplines such as
anthropology and linguistics, said Darrell Guder,
secretary-treasurer of the American Society of Missiology and
professor of evangelism and church growth at Columbia Theological
Seminary in Decatur. ``Scholarship in these areas was profoundly
shaped by the missionary enterprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the United States, missionary efforts proved to be an
outlet for the creative energies of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women medical doctors were not accepted in America,'' said
Dana Robert, professor of world mission at Boston University.
``They went way out of proportion to their numbers as missionaries.
For years, women couldn't be ministers in most churches, but they
could be missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Through correspondence from missionaries, American women began
to care about the spiritual and physical welfare of women in other
countries and raise money to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to work for the upward lift of women in other
lands, American women also liberated themselves, tested their
skills and proved their competence,'' said Catherine Allen, a
25-year veteran of the Women's Missionary Union of the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, women took the lead in funding mission work. The
Lottie Moon Christmas Offering of the Southern Baptist Convention
is a case in point. In 1888, Southern Baptist women initiated the
gift campaign in honor of a pioneer female missionary to China to
send more women to do mission work there. ``It didn't take but
about 10 years before even Lottie herself was saying the money
could be used for outreach to men, too,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is still a Southern Baptist tradition. This year it
will bring in more than $100 million to help support missions in
150 countries that have helped make Christianity the global
religion it is today.
</P>
<P>
   In the churches that grow out of mission efforts, women are the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see in African indigenous churches at least 70 percent of
the members are women,'' Robert said. ``In China, 80 percent of the
house church members are women. In Korea, most leaders of cell
groups in the largest church in the world are women. In Latin
America, over 70 percent of the new Pentecostals are women. It's a
global phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who have flocked to those churches are taking
responsiblity for their missionary efforts at a time when the role
of women in missions in traditional American denominations is
diminishing, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is going to be different as leadership emerges from
other places,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sojourning missionaries
</P>
<P>
   With the end of colonialism and the development of indigenous
churches in the far reaches of the globe, international ecumenical
relationships have changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Christianity and Western culture sometimes became
intertwined on the mission field, at times perpetuating the image
of the ``Ugly American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain process of deculturation that happens to
the local people when they, because of the power, wealth and status
of western Christians, tend to devalue their culture and take upon
western ways of doing things,'' said Thomas Thangaraj, professor of
world Christianity at Emory University's Candler School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   Although it still occurs, that is less likely to happen today,
experts say. And, in many areas where local communities establish
churches in their own cultures, Christianity is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the way Africans are adapting rituals and customs
to their local culture, I think can encourage people in the United
States to think about how we should adapt rituals and customs to
our culture today,'' said Thomas Reese, a Jesuit scholar and editor
of America, a national weekly Catholic magazine. ``When we see
Africans dancing up the middle aisle of St. Peter's in Rome to
bring up the gifts at Mass, and hear them using drums and African
music, it shows us that, well, maybe we could do something from
American culture in our liturgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern American missionaries are more likely to serve as
consultants to native church leaders than to set up institutions
and run them. And while every major denomination still has career
missionaries, many groups now also have Peace Corps-like programs
that allow people to serve for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much different than it used to be,'' said Bonnie Jensen,
executive director of the division for global missions of the 3.8
million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
``Missionaries are much more likely to be sojourners. They stay for
a time until they're not needed any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, American denominations fund the education of
natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, we have had 350 international
scholarship recipients who have worked on master's or doctoral
degrees,'' Jensen said. ``They've gone back to their churches and
filled positions that decades ago would have been filled by
missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   More American congregations are also sponsoring mission trips or
funding individual mission volunteers. Among United Methodists in
the Southeast, for example, more than 25,000 people traveled last
year to mission sites, most outside the United States, for periods
of a few days to two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a phenomenal thing,'' said Allan Kirtin, director of
the Mission Resource Center for the 8.5 million-member United
Methodist Church. ``It's happening without too much structure. It's
happening as the spirit moves.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have worked abroad are likely to gain a new
appreciation for the global scope of the faith. In metro Atlanta,
having Christian neighbors who speak other languages and worship in
different styles also sharpens awareness.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta's Roman Catholic Archbishop John F. Donoghue
traveled to Nigeria last year, he came home with enthusiasm for the
worship and commitment of poverty-stricken Catholics there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The churches on Sunday are packed with people,'' he said.
``The homilies go on forever. The music is great. They have a lot
of joyful celebration. It's really humbling to go to a place like
that and see so much faith despite the conditions in which they
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop traveled with the Rev. Martin Kalu, a Nigerian
priest whose mother's family was converted to Christianity by
missionaries who entered Nigeria in 1885. Now Kalu has been
assigned by his Nigerian bishop to be a missionary to the Atlanta
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Here on his own mission field in April, Kalu was one of hundreds
of Catholics of all colors and nationalities who filled the
Cathedral of Christ the King to see Cardinal Francis Arinze, the
Nigerian priest many people think may be the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican visitor's prominence speaks well of the coming of
age of African Christianity, Kalu said, ``but whether they pick him
or not, the church in Africa will be flourishing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCRA, Ghana _ The Rev. Mathias Forson has prepared a special
sermon for Christmas, one that celebrates not only that special day
but his special congregation.
</P>
<P>
   To the 400 or so residents of Accra who manage to squeeze their
way into the Bethany Methodist Church in the Dzorlu area of Ghana's
capital, Forson will try to explain the meaning of Christmas in the
context of Africa. He will take as his text John 1:14 _ ``And the
Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Forson, a native Ghanaian who earned a master's degree from
Emory University in Atlanta 10 years ago, believes that, contrary
to the teachings of some early missionaries, Christianity and
Africanism are complementary and not at all at odds. One need not
expunge from people all traces of native culture for them to become
Christians, he says. Instead, the word of Christ can dwell among
the people of Africa and find the culture to be very fertile soil
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The facts bear him out. Africa, which had 9.9 million Christians
at the beginning of this century, has 203 million as the century
ends. Each year, the continent has 6 million more Christians than
it had the year before, and 1.5 million of those are converts,
according to a new study by David Barret, a British clergyman who
edited the first-ever world Christian encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   And the rate of growth seems only to be increasing. In 1970,
about 12 percent of Africans were Christian. Now, nearly half are.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, in 1970, one-tenth of all the Christians in the
world were Africans. Now the continent is home to more than a fifth
of the world's Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is growing faster in Africa now than
anywhere else. In 1968, there were about 29 million Catholics in
Africa; by last year the number had nearly quadrupled, to 114
million.
</P>
<P>
   And the total number of Protestants during that period grew much
faster, from 8 million to nearly 108 million _ a 13-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenal growth is reflected in Forson's church. Two
years ago, when he became pastor at Bethany Methodist, the
congregation numbered about 200 members. Now, though the church
seats only 350 people comfortably, the congregation has swelled to
700. Forson must hold two services each Sunday and sometimes he
must broadcast the service through loudspeakers to those sitting
outside.
</P>
<P>
   He is building a new church next door. When it is finished the
new church will seat as many as 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Faces of faith
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Mathias Forson exemplifies the new African
Christians. Not only is he making converts, he is one. He wears the
collar of a cleric, but his face bears the scars of traditional
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Now 49, Forson grew up in central Ghana in a family whose
spiritual relationship to the world was based not on Christianity
but on beliefs native to Africa. His parents believed strongly in
evil spirits that cause everything from disaster to disease,
spirits from whom potent protection was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Forson was a year old, a practitioner of traditional
medicine cut inch-long diagonal slices in his cheeks. Medicine was
rubbed into cuts to ward off the spirits and protect the child.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached high school, where he was a boarding
student, Forson was drinking, smoking and chasing girls _ and his
efforts to reform had come to naught. Then a British missionary
came to the school to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that someone would come all this way to share this
message with us, that meant a lot to me,'' Forson said.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted Christ, he said, and joy flooded into his life. He
dropped his old habits and found a better way to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started sharing with my friends, who were really
surprised,'' he said. ``I made quite a number of converts, because
my life was a testament. They knew me.''
</P>
<P>
   But if his friends were accepting, his family was not. When
Forson refused to go to a practitioner of traditional medicine, his
father became angry. Forson was practicing the religion of
outsiders, the religion of Westerners, his father complained.
</P>
<P>
   We have our own religion, his father, Kweku Seidu, argued. Let's
not give up what we have.
</P>
<P>
   Forson persisted in his Christianity, and, after several years,
his father changed his mind and converted to Christianity, changing
his name to Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Forson eventually traveled to Atlanta, where in 1989 he earned a
master's degree in theology at Emory, followed by a Ph.D. at Asbury
Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw the lifestyle lived by many people in the United
States _ opulent, compared to that of many Ghanaians _ he
appreciated even more what Western missionaries left behind when
they came to Ghana to preach the word. And that made their message
even more meaningful to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a missionary to my own people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch export
</P>
<P>
   Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa dates from 1652, when
officials of the Dutch East India Co. arrived in Table Bay, on the
southern tip of the continent, near the current site of Cape Town,
South Africa. They brought with them plans to found a settlement _
and Dutch Reformed beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist faith was introduced to the continent 141 years
later, in 1792, when David George, a former slave from South
Carolina, reached Sierra Leone on Africa's west coast.
</P>
<P>
   But for many more years, Christianity remained limited to the
fringes of the continent. It was not until the latter part of the
19th century that the religion began to penetrate the interior of
Africa, following the call by the explorer David Livingstone to
stamp out the slave trade inside Africa by opening the continent to
the three C's _ civilization, commerce and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 126 years since Livingstone died, frozen in prayer at his
bedside near Lake Bangweulu in what is now Zambia, thousands of
missionaries have worked this vast territory with, overall,
considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for that success, though, can sometimes be difficult
to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Joseph, a professor of political science at Emory
University, attributes much of the growth to the ``prolonged period
of economic difficulties that most people in the continent have
been experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph spent time this year in Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa, where he witnessed ``phenomenal'' growth in
revivalist-style sects _ growth that has paralleled the country's
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is plain is the churches are really becoming a very
public sanctuary for many people,'' Joseph said. ``You can't help
but sense that the churches are providing some meaning for lives
that on the face of it are pretty desolate.''
</P>
<P>
   And many people see yet another reason for the recent remarkable
growth of Christianity in Africa. In many cases, Africans are no
longer being told that they have to deny their Africanism in order
to be good Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is major work going on by Africans in
interpreting Christianity against an African background, and that's
something that Westerners are not going to be able to help with
very much,'' said Mark Noll, the author of ``Turning Points:
Decisive Moments in the History of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern missionaries
</P>
<P>
   Some of that work is being done by Mathias Forson. He deeply
believes, contrary to early missionaries, that African culture and
Christianity can co-exist, and even complement each other, in the
same person.
</P>
<P>
   But Westerners can still help somewhat. Forson, for example,
receives help from Mike Mozley, with the Mission Society for United
Methodists, who moved his family from suburban Atlanta to Kumasi,
Ghana, this summer to work with Ghanaian Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques many modern missionaries bring to Africa differ
from those of earlier Christians, who would sometimes go so far as
to set up villages in which they could isolate potential converts
from all African influences.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Mozley favors ministries that attend to all
people's needs, that work to improve their physical as well as
their spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
   And he is spending his first year doing little besides settling
in, acclimating himself and his family to the culture, and doing
more learning than teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Ghanaians I came with big ears and big eyes and a
small mouth,'' Mozley said. ``I affirm the African people.''
</P>
<P>
   A sermon in three languages
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly of God church in Gueckedou, Guinea, has a dirt
floor, mud-brick walls and a tin roof. But it vibrates with music,
singing and joy.
</P>
<P>
   The church is packed to overflowing, and here, as at Forson's
church in Accra, church leaders are building a new, larger church
to accommodate the growth in the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Gueckedou is dominated by the green minarets of a hilltop
mosque. The streets are crowded with men in boubous, the
shimmering, ankle-length robes worn by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Religions are spread not only by missionaries but by the
movement of people. The neighboring country of Sierra Leone, where
freed slaves from the new world introduced Christianity, has been
racked by civil war. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled
across the border to Guinea, adding a dollop of Christianity to the
heavily Muslim city.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation is made up largely of those refugees, but some
Guineans have been attracted to the church, too. The service is
conducted in three languages simultaneously _ English, the language
of Sierra Leone; French, the national language of Guinea; and
Kissi, the local tribal language.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims here argue bitterly that Christianity is a western
religion, not one for Africans, but Pastor David Kondiano
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the church is not only for white men,'' Kondiano
said. ``We believe that the Bible is for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Forson's central belief. Christianity is growing so fast
in Africa, he said, in part because Africans begin as very
spiritual people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African by nature is religious,'' Forson said. ``Atheism
is the belief that there is no God. That is not an African problem.
An African is born with a knowledge of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My major thesis has been: How can we become truly African and
truly Christian?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Forson will not tell his congregation in his sermon today
that the evil spirits in which they believe do not exist. He will
say instead that the church offers more powerful protection against
those spirits.
</P>
<P>
   He will say that Christmas reminds us that God is no longer to
be seen as transcendent and far removed. He has come down in the
person of Jesus Christ to be involved in our struggles, to identify
with our needs and bring  peace to our world.
</P>
<P>
   Forson will discuss what the message of Christmas means for
people who live on a continent rife with ethnic conflicts, wars and
rumors of war. And he will appeal passionately, he said, for
Africans to allow Christ to rule in their hearts so that they can
experience his peace and the protection he offers from the forces
of the evil one who fights against them.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Special to the Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, Korea _ Parents awake early to pray at churches
throughout the country for the success of their sons and daughters
in college entrance exams. Labor activists camp out in tents in the
sanctuary of the driveway leading to the Myongdong Cathedral, the
center of the Catholic Church in Korea. Protestants stage services
for people still held in prison on charges of violating the
national security law.
</P>
<P>
   These separate scenes dramatize the p roles of
Christianity in a country where more than 10,000 people were
executed in the 19th century for refusing to abandon the faith
inculcated in them by French Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn of the third millennium after the birth of
Christ, Christianity is not only fully accepted in South Korea but
flourishes as a social force unrivaled in any country in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea is unique,'' says Horace G. Underwood, grandson of
Presbyterian missionary Horace Underwood. The elder Underwood
arrived in Korea in 1885 and founded the college that formed the
basis for Yonsei University, one of Korea's leading educational
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rest of Asia, the church was tainted as the religion of
colonialists, but in Korea the colonialists were the Japanese'' who
wound up ruling Korea as a colony for 35 years until their defeat
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Christianity is the basic faith of roughly 12 million of
the country's 46 million people. Nine million are Protestant,
including 5 million Presbyterians splintered into several different
sub-groupings. Three million are Catholic, including the country's
president Kim Dae Jung, who succeeded a Presbyterian, Kim Young
Sam. Buddhists rank as the second largest overall grouping with
more than 10 million adherents, while nearly half of Koreans claim
no formal faith at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity before World War II was the religion of the poor
people,'' says Underwood, still active as a Presbyterian lay
leader, ``but the Christian community has prospered more than the
rest of the country. It's now upper-middle class and middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has confidence in Christianity's role in the rest of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity is growing in all countries,'' said Underwood.
``Militants are anti-Christian because it's growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The foothold that Christianity gained in Korea in the waning
days of the Lee dynasty more than 100 years ago contrasts with the
problems confronting Christians in almost every other country in
Asia. The only real exception is the Philippines. There, explorer
Ferdinand Magellan planted the Christian cross in 1521.
</P>
<P>
   While Christianity in the Philippines is not as diverse as in
Korea, Catholicism may penetrate deeper into society. Nine out of
every 10 Filipinos are Catholic. And Cardinal Jaimie Sin, who loves
to pun on his last name, is a dominant figure whose influence
helped to bring down Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 _ and prevented Fidel
Ramos from running for a second six-year term as president last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Catholicism exerts a similar but far less pervasive influence in
Vietnam, where nearly five million Catholics among a population of
78 million practice a faith introduced during the era of French
colonialism. The Catholics were some of the staunchest fighters
against the Vietnamese communists before the communist defeat of
the French in 1954, and again before the communist government in
North Vietnam gained control over all of South Vietnam in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Vietnamese Catholics, along with members of other faiths _
notably the Hoa Hao, who worship God but not Christ, and the Cao
Dai, who worship figures including Christ, Buddha, Confucius and
Victor Hugo _ face stringent controls. Police have raided places of
worship in a campaign to force members of all faiths to join
government-sanctioned organizations of Catholics, Hoa Hao and Cao
Dai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now worshippers are protesting against these organizations,''
said Duong The Tu, a Vietnamese refugee living in California. ``The
religious movement is very tense now. Catholics, Hoa Hao and Cao
Dai are uniting to strike against the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians face problems of different sorts in the two most
populous countries of Asia _ China and India _ as well as the
richest country in Asia, Japan. Since the communist authorities
authorized worship at state-approved churches in the early 1980s,
millions of Chinese have flocked to worship in a reaction to
oppressive communist rule under former leader Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
   The regime, however, has cracked down on worship at ``house
churches,'' homes where underground services are held. In early
November, the police arrested Li Dexian and six of his followers
near the southern city of Guangzhou, according to the British
group, Christian Solidarity Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In India, where Christians compose 2.3 percent of a population
of nearly 1 billion, Hindus have attacked Christians in the capital
of New Delhi and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The World Hindu Council, based in New Delhi, accused Pope John
Paul II of a breach of hospitality for praising missionary work in
Asia during a visit to India last month. Hindu fanatics killed four
members of a Christian family in the eastern state of Bihar and
have staged a series of attacks in the state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where Christians make up less than one percent of a
population of 124 million, church groups criticized the government
for ordering schools and offices to fly the rising sun flag on the
10th anniversary in November of the reign of Emperor Akihito.
Religious leaders said they feared a renaissance of the nationalism
that led Japan into World War II while Akihito's father, Hirohito,
was emperor.
</P>
<P>
   For many Japanese, Christian as well as non-Christian, the
rising sun flag evoked memories of the days when the emperor
himself was viewed as a god _ a state that Hirohito specifically
renounced after surrendering at the end of World War II.

   MEXICO CITY _ Nearly 500 years ago, fervently Catholic priests
captured the spirit of this country and the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Vatican is trying to reconquer this hemisphere by
fighting the spread of secularism and Protestantism in a region
that now represents the largest bloc of Catholics in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is a 90-percent Catholic nation that has been bloodied by
civil war over the power and influence of religion. Earlier this
year, during a visit here Pope John Paul II bestowed Mexico a
special role in cementing Catholic faith in this hemisphere for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is sort of like Poland for the Pope,'' said Bernardo
Barranco, president of the Center for Studies of Religion in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Catholic Poland gnawed at the communist Soviet Union,
Barranco said, Pope John Paul II considers Mexico a bulwark against
the secularism and Protestant influence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is also a country where Catholicism has sunk deep roots
in popular culture. Everyone in Mexico from traditional village
housewives to gay activists embrace the brown-skinned figure of
Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   The church in Mexico has thrived despite more than a century of
laws that conflict with Vatican doctrine. Limited divorce was
available in the late 1800s and was offered in full in 1917. With
the exception of abortion, the government has eagerly pushed birth
control since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mexico re-established diplomatic relations with the
Vatican, which had been severed in 1861 by reformist President
Benito Juarez. In the wake of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the
church was stripped of vast land holdings and relegated to
non-legal status. Priests, who were viewed as allies of an
oppressive upper-class, were barred from voting or even wearing
vestments publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, devout rebels attempted to defend the church by
waging a civil war in central Mexico. It wasn't until 1991,
however, that Mexico restored the church's legal status.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Catholic Church has gained political ground this
decade. Politicians feel freer to profess their faith and meet with
clergy, and the church is attempting to overturn bans on church
access to television and public education.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mexico, Chile and Argentina only recently began
to dismantle some laws based on a conservative Catholic identity.
Until 1994 Argentina's constitution required that the president be
Catholic. In Chile, divorce is still outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic concern shared throughout the Americas is the advance
of Protestantism, including evangelical faiths. Some rough
estimates put the Protestant population in Latin America at 12 or
13 percent, up from 4 percent in 1960 and 1 percent in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala might be as much as 20 percent Protestant. Protestant
missionaries have made inroads into the Mexican state of Chiapas,
where poor indigenous women especially have embraced teachings that
eschew spending money on alcohol and village festivities. Brazil,
the biggest Catholic country in the world, is also seeing a surge
in Protestantism and beliefs rooted in African traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has tried to stem desertions by
incorporating Indian or other local cultural practices into
services. A trend called ``renovation,'' which includes speaking in
tongues and spirit possession, is also ``a shot in the arm for
Catholicism in Latin America,'' said Virginia Burnett, a religious
studies expert at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Vatican punished some priests for practicing
so-called liberation theology, which borrowed from Marxism and was
strong in Brazil and Central America. Since the collapse of
communism, the church has tried to show concern for Latin America
by condemning a widening gap between rich and poor and calling for
a mass forgiveness on the region's huge foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is an institution that finds it hard to be
dynamic,'' said sociologist and religion specialist Oscar Aguilar
of Mexico's Iberoamericana University. ``The challenge of the
church is to find its place in modernity and democracy.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Golden-domed and imposing, the lavishly reconstructed
19th-century Christ the Savior Cathedral, near the Kremlin, stands
as a striking symbol of just how far religion has come since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolsheviks blew up the original church and built a swimming
pool in its place in their effort to demean the Russian Orthodox
Church and its imperial past.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the nation's new post-Soviet royalty _ powerful
politicians and capitalists _ resurrected the church on the same
site, with the help of small contributions from countless
churchgoers across Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Moscow and the rest of Russia, sparkling new
onion-domed churches are rising from the rubble of the Soviet Union
_ some 9,000 new parishes since Communist rule fell in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As Christianity enters its third millennium, the Russian
Orthodox Church is back, though in Soviet times it never really
went away. The church was a survivor and, evidence suggests, a
Soviet collaborator that has now emerged as a powerful political
and economic force in the new Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism collapsed and there was nothing there to replace
it,'' said Vladimir Pravotorov, editor of Science and Religion, a
scholarly journal, explaining the sudden surge of popular interest
in the church in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-long taboo lifted, it was cool to be religious.
President Boris Yeltsin publicly embraced the church's Patriarch
Alexy II. A parade of politicians, writers and rock stars became
churchgoers, along with crowds of ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Even godless Communists found religion. Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov looked for photo ops with the church hierarchy in
the 1996 national elections, and his party two years ago pushed
major legislation bestowing special status on the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church remains among the most trusted
institutions in Russia, no small feat in a country battered by
economic problems and apathetic toward their corruption-riddled
government.
</P>
<P>
   But the allure of churchgoing has worn off. The church remains
an important symbol of nationalism and new church buildings are
going up, but attendance is down.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to recover properties it lost during Soviet times,
the church has diversified in the new free-market economy, dabbling
in banking, oil and tobacco imports among other enterprises it
operates tax-free. The church does not disclose its finances.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians view the church as just another powerful and
wealthy institution not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Orthodox Church would like to play the role of state
church in the same way Islam operates in Iran,'' said Katya
Smyslova, an attorney for the non-profit Institute of Religion and
Law. The group has challenged a 1997 law pushed by the Orthodox
Church, which restricts the activities of other religions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw the law as an attempt to enshrine Orthodoxy as the
national religion, a status it held for nearly a millennium under
royalty that ruled Russia until the revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Russian Orthodox and other major Christian
churches have been rocky for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox leader, Alexy, has rejected repeated
proposals for a papal visit to Russia, frustrating the efforts of
John Paul II. The Roman Catholic leader made improving relations
among Christians a key goal of the papacy in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Russian church lent its qualified support to
Russia's war in Chechnya, disappointing international and Russian
human rights groups who had hoped the church would use its moral
authority to denounce the war.
</P>
<P>
   But controversy has never been the church's strong suit. In
imperial Russia, the church acted at the whim of the tsars. In
Soviet times, some priests were persecuted, while others served the
KGB and the church quietly survived.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the church is a national icon, representing continuity
and stability in a country that has lived through a century of
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is an important symbol, but does not have a
practical influence on daily life,'' said Yuri Levada, director of
the Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Research.

   For the weekend of Sunday, Dec. 26
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-WORLD _ The spread of Christianity transformed the
Western world. As the third millennium approaches, the movement is
far removed from what it was as its inception. Today, almost one
third of the world's population is Christian. For believers, Jesus
is the hinge of history. But even by secular standards, Jesus is
the dominant figure of Western culture. In this last installment of
a yearlong project, we explore the growth of Christianity around
the world, especially its impact in Asia and Africa and
re-emergence in Russia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50.
WITH PHOTOS AND GRAPHICS .
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Across Moscow and the rest of
Russia, sparkling new onion-domed churches are rising from the
rubble of Communism. The Russian Orthodox Church is back, though in
Soviet times it never really went away. The church was a survivor,
and some say collaborator, that has now emerged as a powerful
political and economic force in the new Russia. (Holmes, Cox News
Service). 45.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-ASIA _ SEOUL, South Korea _ This region of the
world has been one of the more painful ones for Christians and
their beliefs. They face persecution everywhere. Vietnamese police
have raided a number of Christian gatherings across the country in
recent months, detaining and harassing scores of worshipers.
Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of
79 million has 8 million Catholics, the largest community in
Southeast Asia outside the Philippines. But in secular South Korea,
the number is growing and becoming one of the most active churches
in East Asia. (Kirk, Cox News Service) 40.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-LATIN _ MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic
country, they build shrines by the thousands and crawl on their
knees to honor the Virgin Mary at her own special basilica. The
main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico earlier this year _ his
fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the second-most visited Catholic sanctuary in the world
after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).
40.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-AFRICA _ KUMASI, Ghana _ Christian missionaries
began pouring into Africa in the late 19th century, saving souls
and offering a Western worldview that dramatically changed the
ideas that shaped this continent in the last century. Today
Christians are part of the fabric of this land. And missionaries
continue to come. Mike Mozley, a missionary from Marietta, Ga.,
moved his wife and three children to Ghana this year. We take a
look at the growth of Christianity through his mission. (Melvin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday, Jan 1
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-FUTURE _ For thousands of years, Christians in
Europe and the Americas have led the faithful. In coming years
there's a chance that the growth of the religion will be centered
in Asia and Africa. In fact, the largest Christian church in the
world today is in Korea, not the Bible belt of America. In this
last installment of our yearlong report on the millennium and
Christianity, we look into the future and explore the direction the
church seems headed in the next century. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 50.

   ATLANTA _ Walk into any church in metro Atlanta at Christmastime
and you're likely to hear the same carols _ the wistful strains of
``O Come, O Come Emmanuel,'' the invitational ``O Come, Let Us
Adore Him'' and the effusive ``Joy to the World.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the tunes are familiar at the chapel at Shallowford
Presbyterian Church, you probably won't recognize the words. The
chapel is the home of Hanbit Korean Presbyterian Church, one of the
fastest-growing congregations in the Presbytery of Greater Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hanbit (a transliteration of the Korean words for ``one light'')
represents the completion of a circle that began more than 110
years ago when Presbyterian men and women from America traveled to
the mission fields of Korea. Today, there are almost twice as many
Presbyterians in Korea as in the United States, and South Korean
Presbyterian churches are sending out more missionaries than their
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States now is a mission field for the Korean
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Korean churches, we first received the gospel
through American missionaries,'' said the Rev. Sung Joo Park,
Hanbit's pastor. ``Now the case is reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all major Christian denominations talk in similar
terms as they survey the Christian world today: the ``center of
gravity'' has shifted from Western Europe and North America, and
the future of the faith is in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some evidence:
</P>
<P>
   _ One in three Roman Catholic cardinals is from the so-called
Third World, and both Asia and Africa have more members of the
College of Cardinals (15 and 14, respectively) than the United
States (12). An African cardinal is considered one of the top
contenders to be the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Archbishop of Canterbury, presiding cleric of Anglicanism,
opened the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference in England last year by
greeting the congregation in Swahili. Of the 736 bishops
registered, only 316 _ less than half _ were from the United
States, Canada and Europe combined. Africa sent 224 and Asia 95.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today, 58 percent of Protestants and two-thirds of Christians
in Charismatic and Pentecostal churches _ a movement that began in
the United States in the early 20th century _ live in Africa, Asia
and Latin America. ``The gospel is no longer in western
captivity,'' says David Garrison, a vice president at the
International Mission Board of the 15.9 million-member Southern
Baptist Convention. ``It's every bit as at home in Beijing or
Shanghai as in Atlanta or Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   As Christians from China, Korea, Nigeria and Kenya relocate,
they are changing the face of the church in the United States and
sustaining some traditional denominations. In Georgia, for
instance, Southern Baptists have services in 37 languages, from
Arabic to Urdu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally for Southern Baptists, without the growth of the
ethnic and African-American congregations in the last number of
years, we would not have seen the positive growth we have been able
to report,'' said Jerry Baker, a specialist in non-English
ministries with the Georgia Baptist Convention. Until a slight loss
in 1998, the Southern Baptist Convention had increased in
membership every year since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   If the 2.6 million-member Presbyterian Church (USA) successfully
adapts to Asian and African immigrants, it will have a
``significant racial-ethnic majority'' by 2050, predicts Edwin
Albright, executive presbyter of the Presbytery of Greater Atlanta,
where the fastest-growing churches are international. ``If we
don't, I think the consequences are severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptizing the nations
</P>
<P>
   According to the gospel of Matthew, Jesus told his disciples,
``Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   Christians through the ages have regarded the verses, known as
the ``Great Commission,'' as their marching orders. They have
spread the faith _ sometimes through violence, as during the
Crusades, but often through compassionate work. Church history is
full of accounts of martyrs who gave their lives telling others
about Jesus, beginning with St. Paul, whose epistles make up much
of the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   From the Middle East to the Roman Empire to the New World,
Christianity spread.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20th century, North Americans represented about
two-thirds of all Protestant foreign missionaries. Many spent years
in the field, establishing hospitals and schools, drilling wells
and building dams, and taking part in every phase of life from
delivering babies to caring for the dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who gave their lives to mission work and were
greatly revered by the people who were there,'' said Stephen
Gunter, professor of evangelism at Emory University's Candler
School of Theology. ``Some died while they were in their late 20s
and early 30s. Other people lived all their lives in another
cultural context, spending only a few years back in North America.
You look at the economic levels at which those people retire, and
people with 30, 40 or 50 years in missionary service could not
afford to buy a house in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, their efforts generated academic disciplines such as
anthropology and linguistics, said Darrell Guder,
secretary-treasurer of the American Society of Missiology and
professor of evangelism and church growth at Columbia Theological
Seminary in Decatur. ``Scholarship in these areas was profoundly
shaped by the missionary enterprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the United States, missionary efforts proved to be an
outlet for the creative energies of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women medical doctors were not accepted in America,'' said
Dana Robert, professor of world mission at Boston University.
``They went way out of proportion to their numbers as missionaries.
For years, women couldn't be ministers in most churches, but they
could be missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Through correspondence from missionaries, American women began
to care about the spiritual and physical welfare of women in other
countries and raise money to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to work for the upward lift of women in other
lands, American women also liberated themselves, tested their
skills and proved their competence,'' said Catherine Allen, a
25-year veteran of the Women's Missionary Union of the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, women took the lead in funding mission work. The
Lottie Moon Christmas Offering of the Southern Baptist Convention
is a case in point. In 1888, Southern Baptist women initiated the
gift campaign in honor of a pioneer female missionary to China to
send more women to do mission work there. ``It didn't take but
about 10 years before even Lottie herself was saying the money
could be used for outreach to men, too,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is still a Southern Baptist tradition. This year it
will bring in more than $100 million to help support missions in
150 countries that have helped make Christianity the global
religion it is today.
</P>
<P>
   In the churches that grow out of mission efforts, women are the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see in African indigenous churches at least 70 percent of
the members are women,'' Robert said. ``In China, 80 percent of the
house church members are women. In Korea, most leaders of cell
groups in the largest church in the world are women. In Latin
America, over 70 percent of the new Pentecostals are women. It's a
global phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who have flocked to those churches are taking
responsiblity for their missionary efforts at a time when the role
of women in missions in traditional American denominations is
diminishing, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is going to be different as leadership emerges from
other places,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sojourning missionaries
</P>
<P>
   With the end of colonialism and the development of indigenous
churches in the far reaches of the globe, international ecumenical
relationships have changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Christianity and Western culture sometimes became
intertwined on the mission field, at times perpetuating the image
of the ``Ugly American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain process of deculturation that happens to
the local people when they, because of the power, wealth and status
of western Christians, tend to devalue their culture and take upon
western ways of doing things,'' said Thomas Thangaraj, professor of
world Christianity at Emory University's Candler School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   Although it still occurs, that is less likely to happen today,
experts say. And, in many areas where local communities establish
churches in their own cultures, Christianity is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the way Africans are adapting rituals and customs
to their local culture, I think can encourage people in the United
States to think about how we should adapt rituals and customs to
our culture today,'' said Thomas Reese, a Jesuit scholar and editor
of America, a national weekly Catholic magazine. ``When we see
Africans dancing up the middle aisle of St. Peter's in Rome to
bring up the gifts at Mass, and hear them using drums and African
music, it shows us that, well, maybe we could do something from
American culture in our liturgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern American missionaries are more likely to serve as
consultants to native church leaders than to set up institutions
and run them. And while every major denomination still has career
missionaries, many groups now also have Peace Corps-like programs
that allow people to serve for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much different than it used to be,'' said Bonnie Jensen,
executive director of the division for global missions of the 3.8
million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
``Missionaries are much more likely to be sojourners. They stay for
a time until they're not needed any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, American denominations fund the education of
natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, we have had 350 international
scholarship recipients who have worked on master's or doctoral
degrees,'' Jensen said. ``They've gone back to their churches and
filled positions that decades ago would have been filled by
missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   More American congregations are also sponsoring mission trips or
funding individual mission volunteers. Among United Methodists in
the Southeast, for example, more than 25,000 people traveled last
year to mission sites, most outside the United States, for periods
of a few days to two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a phenomenal thing,'' said Allan Kirtin, director of
the Mission Resource Center for the 8.5 million-member United
Methodist Church. ``It's happening without too much structure. It's
happening as the spirit moves.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have worked abroad are likely to gain a new
appreciation for the global scope of the faith. In metro Atlanta,
having Christian neighbors who speak other languages and worship in
different styles also sharpens awareness.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta's Roman Catholic Archbishop John F. Donoghue
traveled to Nigeria last year, he came home with enthusiasm for the
worship and commitment of poverty-stricken Catholics there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The churches on Sunday are packed with people,'' he said.
``The homilies go on forever. The music is great. They have a lot
of joyful celebration. It's really humbling to go to a place like
that and see so much faith despite the conditions in which they
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop traveled with the Rev. Martin Kalu, a Nigerian
priest whose mother's family was converted to Christianity by
missionaries who entered Nigeria in 1885. Now Kalu has been
assigned by his Nigerian bishop to be a missionary to the Atlanta
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Here on his own mission field in April, Kalu was one of hundreds
of Catholics of all colors and nationalities who filled the
Cathedral of Christ the King to see Cardinal Francis Arinze, the
Nigerian priest many people think may be the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican visitor's prominence speaks well of the coming of
age of African Christianity, Kalu said, ``but whether they pick him
or not, the church in Africa will be flourishing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCRA, Ghana _ The Rev. Mathias Forson has prepared a special
sermon for Christmas, one that celebrates not only that special day
but his special congregation.
</P>
<P>
   To the 400 or so residents of Accra who manage to squeeze their
way into the Bethany Methodist Church in the Dzorlu area of Ghana's
capital, Forson will try to explain the meaning of Christmas in the
context of Africa. He will take as his text John 1:14 _ ``And the
Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Forson, a native Ghanaian who earned a master's degree from
Emory University in Atlanta 10 years ago, believes that, contrary
to the teachings of some early missionaries, Christianity and
Africanism are complementary and not at all at odds. One need not
expunge from people all traces of native culture for them to become
Christians, he says. Instead, the word of Christ can dwell among
the people of Africa and find the culture to be very fertile soil
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The facts bear him out. Africa, which had 9.9 million Christians
at the beginning of this century, has 203 million as the century
ends. Each year, the continent has 6 million more Christians than
it had the year before, and 1.5 million of those are converts,
according to a new study by David Barret, a British clergyman who
edited the first-ever world Christian encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   And the rate of growth seems only to be increasing. In 1970,
about 12 percent of Africans were Christian. Now, nearly half are.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, in 1970, one-tenth of all the Christians in the
world were Africans. Now the continent is home to more than a fifth
of the world's Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is growing faster in Africa now than
anywhere else. In 1968, there were about 29 million Catholics in
Africa; by last year the number had nearly quadrupled, to 114
million.
</P>
<P>
   And the total number of Protestants during that period grew much
faster, from 8 million to nearly 108 million _ a 13-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenal growth is reflected in Forson's church. Two
years ago, when he became pastor at Bethany Methodist, the
congregation numbered about 200 members. Now, though the church
seats only 350 people comfortably, the congregation has swelled to
700. Forson must hold two services each Sunday and sometimes he
must broadcast the service through loudspeakers to those sitting
outside.
</P>
<P>
   He is building a new church next door. When it is finished the
new church will seat as many as 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Faces of faith
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Mathias Forson exemplifies the new African
Christians. Not only is he making converts, he is one. He wears the
collar of a cleric, but his face bears the scars of traditional
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Now 49, Forson grew up in central Ghana in a family whose
spiritual relationship to the world was based not on Christianity
but on beliefs native to Africa. His parents believed strongly in
evil spirits that cause everything from disaster to disease,
spirits from whom potent protection was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Forson was a year old, a practitioner of traditional
medicine cut inch-long diagonal slices in his cheeks. Medicine was
rubbed into cuts to ward off the spirits and protect the child.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached high school, where he was a boarding
student, Forson was drinking, smoking and chasing girls _ and his
efforts to reform had come to naught. Then a British missionary
came to the school to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that someone would come all this way to share this
message with us, that meant a lot to me,'' Forson said.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted Christ, he said, and joy flooded into his life. He
dropped his old habits and found a better way to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started sharing with my friends, who were really
surprised,'' he said. ``I made quite a number of converts, because
my life was a testament. They knew me.''
</P>
<P>
   But if his friends were accepting, his family was not. When
Forson refused to go to a practitioner of traditional medicine, his
father became angry. Forson was practicing the religion of
outsiders, the religion of Westerners, his father complained.
</P>
<P>
   We have our own religion, his father, Kweku Seidu, argued. Let's
not give up what we have.
</P>
<P>
   Forson persisted in his Christianity, and, after several years,
his father changed his mind and converted to Christianity, changing
his name to Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Forson eventually traveled to Atlanta, where in 1989 he earned a
master's degree in theology at Emory, followed by a Ph.D. at Asbury
Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw the lifestyle lived by many people in the United
States _ opulent, compared to that of many Ghanaians _ he
appreciated even more what Western missionaries left behind when
they came to Ghana to preach the word. And that made their message
even more meaningful to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a missionary to my own people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch export
</P>
<P>
   Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa dates from 1652, when
officials of the Dutch East India Co. arrived in Table Bay, on the
southern tip of the continent, near the current site of Cape Town,
South Africa. They brought with them plans to found a settlement _
and Dutch Reformed beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist faith was introduced to the continent 141 years
later, in 1792, when David George, a former slave from South
Carolina, reached Sierra Leone on Africa's west coast.
</P>
<P>
   But for many more years, Christianity remained limited to the
fringes of the continent. It was not until the latter part of the
19th century that the religion began to penetrate the interior of
Africa, following the call by the explorer David Livingstone to
stamp out the slave trade inside Africa by opening the continent to
the three C's _ civilization, commerce and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 126 years since Livingstone died, frozen in prayer at his
bedside near Lake Bangweulu in what is now Zambia, thousands of
missionaries have worked this vast territory with, overall,
considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for that success, though, can sometimes be difficult
to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Joseph, a professor of political science at Emory
University, attributes much of the growth to the ``prolonged period
of economic difficulties that most people in the continent have
been experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph spent time this year in Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa, where he witnessed ``phenomenal'' growth in
revivalist-style sects _ growth that has paralleled the country's
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is plain is the churches are really becoming a very
public sanctuary for many people,'' Joseph said. ``You can't help
but sense that the churches are providing some meaning for lives
that on the face of it are pretty desolate.''
</P>
<P>
   And many people see yet another reason for the recent remarkable
growth of Christianity in Africa. In many cases, Africans are no
longer being told that they have to deny their Africanism in order
to be good Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is major work going on by Africans in
interpreting Christianity against an African background, and that's
something that Westerners are not going to be able to help with
very much,'' said Mark Noll, the author of ``Turning Points:
Decisive Moments in the History of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern missionaries
</P>
<P>
   Some of that work is being done by Mathias Forson. He deeply
believes, contrary to early missionaries, that African culture and
Christianity can co-exist, and even complement each other, in the
same person.
</P>
<P>
   But Westerners can still help somewhat. Forson, for example,
receives help from Mike Mozley, with the Mission Society for United
Methodists, who moved his family from suburban Atlanta to Kumasi,
Ghana, this summer to work with Ghanaian Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques many modern missionaries bring to Africa differ
from those of earlier Christians, who would sometimes go so far as
to set up villages in which they could isolate potential converts
from all African influences.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Mozley favors ministries that attend to all
people's needs, that work to improve their physical as well as
their spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
   And he is spending his first year doing little besides settling
in, acclimating himself and his family to the culture, and doing
more learning than teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Ghanaians I came with big ears and big eyes and a
small mouth,'' Mozley said. ``I affirm the African people.''
</P>
<P>
   A sermon in three languages
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly of God church in Gueckedou, Guinea, has a dirt
floor, mud-brick walls and a tin roof. But it vibrates with music,
singing and joy.
</P>
<P>
   The church is packed to overflowing, and here, as at Forson's
church in Accra, church leaders are building a new, larger church
to accommodate the growth in the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Gueckedou is dominated by the green minarets of a hilltop
mosque. The streets are crowded with men in boubous, the
shimmering, ankle-length robes worn by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Religions are spread not only by missionaries but by the
movement of people. The neighboring country of Sierra Leone, where
freed slaves from the new world introduced Christianity, has been
racked by civil war. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled
across the border to Guinea, adding a dollop of Christianity to the
heavily Muslim city.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation is made up largely of those refugees, but some
Guineans have been attracted to the church, too. The service is
conducted in three languages simultaneously _ English, the language
of Sierra Leone; French, the national language of Guinea; and
Kissi, the local tribal language.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims here argue bitterly that Christianity is a western
religion, not one for Africans, but Pastor David Kondiano
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the church is not only for white men,'' Kondiano
said. ``We believe that the Bible is for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Forson's central belief. Christianity is growing so fast
in Africa, he said, in part because Africans begin as very
spiritual people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African by nature is religious,'' Forson said. ``Atheism
is the belief that there is no God. That is not an African problem.
An African is born with a knowledge of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My major thesis has been: How can we become truly African and
truly Christian?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Forson will not tell his congregation in his sermon today
that the evil spirits in which they believe do not exist. He will
say instead that the church offers more powerful protection against
those spirits.
</P>
<P>
   He will say that Christmas reminds us that God is no longer to
be seen as transcendent and far removed. He has come down in the
person of Jesus Christ to be involved in our struggles, to identify
with our needs and bring joy and peace to our world.
</P>
<P>
   Forson will discuss what the message of Christmas means for
people who live on a continent rife with ethnic conflicts, wars and
rumors of war. And he will appeal passionately, he said, for
Africans to allow Christ to rule in their hearts so that they can
experience his peace and the protection he offers from the forces
of the evil one who fights against them.

<P>
   SEOUL, Korea _ Parents awake early to pray at churches
throughout the country for the success of their sons and daughters
in college entrance exams. Labor activists camp out in tents in the
sanctuary of the driveway leading to the Myongdong Cathedral, the
center of the Catholic Church in Korea. Protestants stage services
for people still held in prison on charges of violating the
national security law.
</P>
<P>
   These separate scenes dramatize the powerful roles of
Christianity in a country where more than 10,000 people were
executed in the 19th century for refusing to abandon the faith
inculcated in them by French Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn of the third millennium after the birth of
Christ, Christianity is not only fully accepted in South Korea but
flourishes as a social force unrivaled in any country in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea is unique,'' says Horace G. Underwood, grandson of
Presbyterian missionary Horace Underwood. The elder Underwood
arrived in Korea in 1885 and founded the college that formed the
basis for Yonsei University, one of Korea's leading educational
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rest of Asia, the church was tainted as the religion of
colonialists, but in Korea the colonialists were the Japanese'' who
wound up ruling Korea as a colony for 35 years until their defeat
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Christianity is the basic faith of roughly 12 million of
the country's 46 million people. Nine million are Protestant,
including 5 million Presbyterians splintered into several different
sub-groupings. Three million are Catholic, including the country's
president Kim Dae Jung, who succeeded a Presbyterian, Kim Young
Sam. Buddhists rank as the second largest overall grouping with
more than 10 million adherents, while nearly half of Koreans claim
no formal faith at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity before World War II was the religion of the poor
people,'' says Underwood, still active as a Presbyterian lay
leader, ``but the Christian community has prospered more than the
rest of the country. It's now upper-middle class and middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has confidence in Christianity's role in the rest of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity is growing in all countries,'' said Underwood.
``Militants are anti-Christian because it's growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The foothold that Christianity gained in Korea in the waning
days of the Lee dynasty more than 100 years ago contrasts with the
problems confronting Christians in almost every other country in
Asia. The only real exception is the Philippines. There, explorer
Ferdinand Magellan planted the Christian cross in 1521.
</P>
<P>
   While Christianity in the Philippines is not as diverse as in
Korea, Catholicism may penetrate deeper into society. Nine out of
every 10 Filipinos are Catholic. And Cardinal Jaimie Sin, who loves
to pun on his last name, is a dominant figure whose influence
helped to bring down Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 _ and prevented Fidel
Ramos from running for a second six-year term as president last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Catholicism exerts a similar but far less pervasive influence in
Vietnam, where nearly five million Catholics among a population of
78 million practice a faith introduced during the era of French
colonialism. The Catholics were some of the staunchest fighters
against the Vietnamese communists before the communist defeat of
the French in 1954, and again before the communist government in
North Vietnam gained control over all of South Vietnam in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Vietnamese Catholics, along with members of other faiths _
notably the Hoa Hao, who worship God but not Christ, and the Cao
Dai, who worship figures including Christ, Buddha, Confucius and
Victor Hugo _ face stringent controls. Police have raided places of
worship in a campaign to force members of all faiths to join
government-sanctioned organizations of Catholics, Hoa Hao and Cao
Dai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now worshippers are protesting against these organizations,''
said Duong The Tu, a Vietnamese refugee living in California. ``The
religious movement is very tense now. Catholics, Hoa Hao and Cao
Dai are uniting to strike against the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians face problems of different sorts in the two most
populous countries of Asia _ China and India _ as well as the
richest country in Asia, Japan. Since the communist authorities
authorized worship at state-approved churches in the early 1980s,
millions of Chinese have flocked to worship in a reaction to
oppressive communist rule under former leader Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
   The regime, however, has cracked down on worship at ``house
churches,'' homes where underground services are held. In early
November, the police arrested Li Dexian and six of his followers
near the southern city of Guangzhou, according to the British
group, Christian Solidarity Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In India, where Christians compose 2.3 percent of a population
of nearly 1 billion, Hindus have attacked Christians in the capital
of New Delhi and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The World Hindu Council, based in New Delhi, accused Pope John
Paul II of a breach of hospitality for praising missionary work in
Asia during a visit to India last month. Hindu fanatics killed four
members of a Christian family in the eastern state of Bihar and
have staged a series of attacks in the state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where Christians make up less than one percent of a
population of 124 million, church groups criticized the government
for ordering schools and offices to fly the rising sun flag on the
10th anniversary in November of the reign of Emperor Akihito.
Religious leaders said they feared a renaissance of the nationalism
that led Japan into World War II while Akihito's father, Hirohito,
was emperor.
</P>
<P>
   For many Japanese, Christian as well as non-Christian, the
rising sun flag evoked memories of the days when the emperor
himself was viewed as a god _ a state that Hirohito specifically
renounced after surrendering at the end of World War II.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Nearly 500 years ago, fervently Catholic priests
captured the spirit of this country and the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Vatican is trying to reconquer this hemisphere by
fighting the spread of secularism and Protestantism in a region
that now represents the largest bloc of Catholics in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is a 90-percent Catholic nation that has been bloodied by
civil war over the power and influence of religion. Earlier this
year, during a visit here Pope John Paul II bestowed Mexico a
special role in cementing Catholic faith in this hemisphere for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is sort of like Poland for the Pope,'' said Bernardo
Barranco, president of the Center for Studies of Religion in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Catholic Poland gnawed at the communist Soviet Union,
Barranco said, Pope John Paul II considers Mexico a bulwark against
the secularism and Protestant influence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is also a country where Catholicism has sunk deep roots
in popular culture. Everyone in Mexico from traditional village
housewives to gay activists embrace the brown-skinned figure of
Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   The church in Mexico has thrived despite more than a century of
laws that conflict with Vatican doctrine. Limited divorce was
available in the late 1800s and was offered in full in 1917. With
the exception of abortion, the government has eagerly pushed birth
control since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mexico re-established diplomatic relations with the
Vatican, which had been severed in 1861 by reformist President
Benito Juarez. In the wake of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the
church was stripped of vast land holdings and relegated to
non-legal status. Priests, who were viewed as allies of an
oppressive upper-class, were barred from voting or even wearing
vestments publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, devout rebels attempted to defend the church by
waging a civil war in central Mexico. It wasn't until 1991,
however, that Mexico restored the church's legal status.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Catholic Church has gained political ground this
decade. Politicians feel freer to profess their faith and meet with
clergy, and the church is attempting to overturn bans on church
access to television and public education.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mexico, Chile and Argentina only recently began
to dismantle some laws based on a conservative Catholic identity.
Until 1994 Argentina's constitution required that the president be
Catholic. In Chile, divorce is still outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic concern shared throughout the Americas is the advance
of Protestantism, including evangelical faiths. Some rough
estimates put the Protestant population in Latin America at 12 or
13 percent, up from 4 percent in 1960 and 1 percent in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala might be as much as 20 percent Protestant. Protestant
missionaries have made inroads into the Mexican state of Chiapas,
where poor indigenous women especially have embraced teachings that
eschew spending money on alcohol and village festivities. Brazil,
the biggest Catholic country in the world, is also seeing a surge
in Protestantism and beliefs rooted in African traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has tried to stem desertions by
incorporating Indian or other local cultural practices into
services. A trend called ``renovation,'' which includes speaking in
tongues and spirit possession, is also ``a shot in the arm for
Catholicism in Latin America,'' said Virginia Burnett, a religious
studies expert at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Vatican punished some priests for practicing
so-called liberation theology, which borrowed from Marxism and was
strong in Brazil and Central America. Since the collapse of
communism, the church has tried to show concern for Latin America
by condemning a widening gap between rich and poor and calling for
a mass forgiveness on the region's huge foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is an institution that finds it hard to be
dynamic,'' said sociologist and religion specialist Oscar Aguilar
of Mexico's Iberoamericana University. ``The challenge of the
church is to find its place in modernity and democracy.''

   MOSCOW _ Golden-domed and imposing, the lavishly reconstructed
19th-century Christ the Savior Cathedral, near the Kremlin, stands
as a striking symbol of just how far religion has come since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolsheviks blew up the original church and built a swimming
pool in its place in their effort to demean the Russian Orthodox
Church and its imperial past.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the nation's new post-Soviet royalty _ powerful
politicians and capitalists _ resurrected the church on the same
site, with the help of small contributions from countless
churchgoers across Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Moscow and the rest of Russia, sparkling new
onion-domed churches are rising from the rubble of the Soviet Union
_ some 9,000 new parishes since Communist rule fell in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As Christianity enters its third millennium, the Russian
Orthodox Church is back, though in Soviet times it never really
went away. The church was a survivor and, evidence suggests, a
Soviet collaborator that has now emerged as a powerful political
and economic force in the new Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism collapsed and there was nothing there to replace
it,'' said Vladimir Pravotorov, editor of Science and Religion, a
scholarly journal, explaining the sudden surge of popular interest
in the church in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-long taboo lifted, it was cool to be religious.
President Boris Yeltsin publicly embraced the church's Patriarch
Alexy II. A parade of politicians, writers and rock stars became
churchgoers, along with crowds of ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Even godless Communists found religion. Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov looked for photo ops with the church hierarchy in
the 1996 national elections, and his party two years ago pushed
major legislation bestowing special status on the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church remains among the most trusted
institutions in Russia, no small feat in a country battered by
economic problems and apathetic toward their corruption-riddled
government.
</P>
<P>
   But the allure of churchgoing has worn off. The church remains
an important symbol of nationalism and new church buildings are
going up, but attendance is down.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to recover properties it lost during Soviet times,
the church has diversified in the new free-market economy, dabbling
in banking, oil and tobacco imports among other enterprises it
operates tax-free. The church does not disclose its finances.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians view the church as just another powerful and
wealthy institution not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Orthodox Church would like to play the role of state
church in the same way Islam operates in Iran,'' said Katya
Smyslova, an attorney for the non-profit Institute of Religion and
Law. The group has challenged a 1997 law pushed by the Orthodox
Church, which restricts the activities of other religions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw the law as an attempt to enshrine Orthodoxy as the
national religion, a status it held for nearly a millennium under
royalty that ruled Russia until the revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Russian Orthodox and other major Christian
churches have been rocky for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox leader, Alexy, has rejected repeated
proposals for a papal visit to Russia, frustrating the efforts of
John Paul II. The Roman Catholic leader made improving relations
among Christians a key goal of the papacy in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Russian church lent its qualified support to
Russia's war in Chechnya, disappointing international and Russian
human rights groups who had hoped the church would use its moral
authority to denounce the war.
</P>
<P>
   But controversy has never been the church's strong suit. In
imperial Russia, the church acted at the whim of the tsars. In
Soviet times, some priests were persecuted, while others served the
KGB and the church quietly survived.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the church is a national icon, representing continuity
and stability in a country that has lived through a century of
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is an important symbol, but does not have a
practical influence on daily life,'' said Yuri Levada, director of
the Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Research.

</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-WORLD _ The spread of Christianity transformed the
Western world. As the third millennium approaches, the movement is
far removed from what it was as its inception. Today, almost one
third of the world's population is Christian. For believers, Jesus
is the hinge of history. But even by secular standards, Jesus is
the dominant figure of Western culture. In this last installment of
a yearlong project, we explore the growth of Christianity around
the world, especially its impact in Asia and Africa and
re-emergence in Russia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50.
WITH PHOTOS AND GRAPHICS .
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Across Moscow and the rest of
Russia, sparkling new onion-domed churches are rising from the
rubble of Communism. The Russian Orthodox Church is back, though in
Soviet times it never really went away. The church was a survivor,
and some say collaborator, that has now emerged as a powerful
political and economic force in the new Russia. (Holmes, Cox News
Service). 45.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-ASIA _ SEOUL, South Korea _ This region of the
world has been one of the more painful ones for Christians and
their beliefs. They face persecution everywhere. Vietnamese police
have raided a number of Christian gatherings across the country in
recent months, detaining and harassing scores of worshipers.
Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of
79 million has 8 million Catholics, the largest community in
Southeast Asia outside the Philippines. But in secular South Korea,
the number is growing and becoming one of the most active churches
in East Asia. (Kirk, Cox News Service) 40.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-LATIN _ MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic
country, they build shrines by the thousands and crawl on their
knees to honor the Virgin Mary at her own special basilica. The
main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico earlier this year _ his
fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the second-most visited Catholic sanctuary in the world
after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-AFRICA _ KUMASI, Ghana _ Christian missionaries
began pouring into Africa in the late 19th century, saving souls
and offering a Western worldview that dramatically changed the
ideas that shaped this continent in the last century. Today
Christians are part of the fabric of this land. And missionaries
continue to come. Mike Mozley, a missionary from Marietta, Ga.,
moved his wife and three children to Ghana this year. We take a
look at the growth of Christianity through his mission. (Melvin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday, Jan 1
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIANITY-FUTURE _ For thousands of years, Christians in
Europe and the Americas have led the faithful. In coming years
there's a chance that the growth of the religion will be centered
in Asia and Africa. In fact, the largest Christian church in the
world today is in Korea, not the Bible belt of America. In this
last installment of our yearlong report on the millennium and
Christianity, we look into the future and explore the direction the
church seems headed in the next century. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 50.

 &HT;    SOME SAY PANAMA CANAL REMAINS VULNERABLE TO TERRORISM
 &HT;    With PANAMA-CANAL and CANAL-WORKERS
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Dec. 26
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ It's a glorious sight: huge freighters dot
the Pacific horizon, waiting their turn to slip into the giant
locks that will lift them through one of the world's greatest
shipping short-cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the awe it inspires as an engineering achievement,
the Panama Canal is also notably vulnerable, especially in this day
of globe-trotting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   American conservatives warn that a couple of bad guys armed with
a suitcase of explosives could probably put the canal out of
business for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few places where you could have a more dramatic
impact on U.S. military and commercial interests than the Isthmus
of Panama,'' said Frank Gaffney(cq) of the Center for Security
Policy, who noted that the Panamanian army was disbanded after the
U.S. invasion of 1989 and the country now boasts only an
18,000-member police force.
</P>
<P>
   Canal administrators and Pentagon officials insist the canal is
in safe hands despite the closure of the dozen U.S. military bases
that once defended it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, U.S. soldiers haven't been the primary security force
for the canal since World War II, said Deputy Canal Administrator
Joseph W. Cornelison(cq), a retired U.S. Army officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary responsibility has always been that of the canal
commission,'' he said. ``We have an adequate security force
augmented by the very sophisticated use of the latest technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelison declined to discuss specifics, but said a recent
review by a top Pentagon official drew praise for the canal
security set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the assurances, concerns remain because the canal is so
clearly vital to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Although it handles only 4 percent of world shipping, about 12
percent of U.S. shipping passes through the waterway. Some 65
percent of the canal's traffic is bound to or from U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives say the canal is simply too important to be left
in the hands of another country _ especially one with Panama's
spotty record for honest, democratic government. They were appalled
when talks on retaining a U.S. military presence in Panama
collapsed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that Colombian drug lords or leftist guerrillas could
make the canal a target, and point to several recent attacks along
the Panamanian-Colombian border. While the U.S. retains the right
to intervene if there is a threat, that's not enough, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll do us damn little good to send in the Marines after some
terrorist has already blown the thing up,'' said Howard Phillips of
the Conservative Caucus, who opposed the canal hand-over.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also fume over a contract allowing
Hutchinson-Whampoa (cq), a Hong Kong company they allege has close
ties to the Chinese military, to run ports at either end of the
canal. The Chinese could use the facilities for spying, smuggling
or as a base for sabotage, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pentagon officials and Cornelison dismiss the worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no relation between the operation of those ports and
the operation of the canal,'' said Cornelison, who will retire soon
after the canal is turned over to Panama. ``As a retired military
officer and the senior U.S. official on the ground in Panama, I
know a national security threat when I see one and would be
obligated to report it.''

 &HT;    AMERICA GETS CREDIT, BUT BLACK WEST INDIANS BUILT THE CANAL
 &HT;    With PANAMA-CANAL and CANAL-SECURITY
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Dec. 26
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ School children are still taught that the
Panama Canal is one of America's greatest achievements, an
engineering marvel that signaled the dawn of what historians now
call ``the American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   But while American money, determination and engineering prowess
led the massive effort, it was the muscle, sinew and blood of
thousands of black West Indian workers that did most of the
backbreaking labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built the canal with picks and shovels and brawn,'' said
Cecil Haynes, 86, who has worked at the canal for 71 years,
following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. ``Many of
them died from explosions and slides. It was very dangerous work,
but they were hard-working, honest people who loved this canal.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Haynes has received widespread attention for his
remarkable work record at the canal. He started as an office clerk
in 1928 at the age of 14, working his way up to inventory
specialist in a career that has spanned seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   But as proud as he feels about the photographs on his modest
office walls that show him posing with presidents and distinguished
officials, Haynes says his greatest desire is for the world to
remember the sacrifice and effort put forth by the black canal
builders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get respect for the old-time workers,'' he said.
``I'm glad that people are starting to realize the contributions
made by these black people who came here to build the canal, but
there's still no monuments to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The original effort to build a Panama Canal began in the 1880s
under the French, who imported thousands of Jamaican laborers to do
the work. Shoddy finances and the deaths of some 20,000 workers due
to malaria and yellow fever doomed the French effort.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans took over in 1903, they turned again to the
Caribbean for the bulk of the labor force, focusing on Barbados.
Still haunted by the horrors of the French effort, the Jamaican
government discouraged American recruiters on their island.
</P>
<P>
   For the islanders, the work was hard and dangerous, but provided
a tremendous opportunity. For most, the only alternative was
seasonal farming labor, which paid as little as a few pennies a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather came here from Barbados because he wanted a
better life,'' Haynes said. ``The salaries were low, but it was a
real opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The black workers earned about 10 cents an hour, and were
subjected to the indignities and injustices of the segregation that
was standard for the day. American workers were kept in comfortable
barracks, were paid in gold and had access to low-cost imported
goods, recreational activities and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The black workers mostly lived in shanties or even tents, and
were paid in silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to struggle to get what you got,'' said Edgar Bruce,
85, a West Indian who worked for three decades at a U.S. military
base and whose grandfather helped build the canal. ``Uncle Sam was
good to us, but sometimes some of the men working for him weren't
so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of the job were immense. Hundreds of workers died in
accidents of all sorts _ crushed by railroad cars, blown up by
dynamite, buried in massive earth slides. Others were felled by
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 5,000 who died during the American effort between 1904
and 1914, about 4,500 were black West Indians. The numbers would've
been higher if American doctors had not wiped out the malaria and
yellow fever that decimated the French effort.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships, most of the black workers felt tremendous
pride in their work, Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this canal and you would think it would be impossible
to build something like this,'' he said. ``But it was made by men
with sweat and blood and tears. They loved it. They always felt
they were part of making one of the wonders of the world.''

   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haynes feels that same pride himself. He still rides the bus to
work, arriving each morning by 5:30 a.m., doing a job he says has
been ``my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   He pulls out a poem written by Juan G. Fagette(cq), another
descendant of black Caribbean canal workers, scanning the lines
that pay homage to the black men who died creating the giant
waterway:
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are those men/ Whose naked sun-baked backs/ Were bent in
making the earth move?
</P>
<P>
   Whose muscles strained/ To get that form in place?....
</P>
<P>
   Where are those men/ Whose sweat and tears/ The Atlantic and
Pacific Ocean drank?
</P>
<P>
   Whose blood/ Baptized all the waters of the world/ Whose
contribution to this day/
</P>
<P>
   Has never been fully praised nor recorded?''

 &HT;    STORMY RELATIONSHIP UNDERLIES PEACEFUL U.S.-PANAMA CANAL
TRANSFER
 &HT;    With CANAL-SECURITY and CANAL-WORKERS
 &HT;    EDS NOTE TIME ELEMENT: Panama Canal will officially change hands
on Dec. 31
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Dec. 26
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Marcos Vargas(cq) wheels his taxi toward
his nation's most famous landmark, passing on the way through
Chorrillo(cq), a poor but teeming district of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his countrymen, the 25-year-old taxi driver is
proud that on Dec. 31, Panama will finally take full possession of
the canal that has been so closely tied to his nation's identity.
</P>
<P>
   But the stormy nature of Panama's relationship with the canal's
builder, the United States, underlies everything here, even on a
simple taxi ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the invasion of 1989, many buildings in Chorrillo were
destroyed,'' Vargas said, referring to the U.S. incursion that
ousted Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. ``Many people here
don't like the Americans because they lost their houses or their
relatives were killed. And they feel the Americans have never
respected us at the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Military intervention, secret deals, coups and wounded pride
have checkered the U.S.-Panamanian relationship from the very
beginning. It started out something like a shotgun wedding, and
produced plenty of fireworks over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the union also produced one of the marvels of the 20th
Century, a 50-mile-long canal slicing across a low mountain range
to connect the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Opened in 1914,
the waterway became a powerful symbol of American ingenuity and
might, ushering in ``the American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   At 85 years old, the canal is still an awe-inspiring sight:
massive locks and gigantic steel doors mesh with the intricacy of a
Swiss watch.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely why American conservatives are so outraged
that the U.S. is giving the canal to the Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built it. We paid for it. It's ours and we're going to keep
it,'' Ronald Reagan said in 1976, summing up the view of opponents
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But President Jimmy Carter felt the turnover was only fair, and
in 1978 managed to get the U.S. Senate to approve the transfer _ by
a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline for the turnover approached this fall, critics
insisted the U.S. must keep a military presence in Panama to
protect the canal. They fear the Panamanians will forsake the
waterway's upkeep, jack up ship tolls or allow it to fall victim to
corrupt internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates say the turnover does more than anything to
counterbalance a tradition of U.S. domination of its smaller Latin
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing to do,'' Carter said at a Dec. 14
ceremony marking the transition. ``Americans didn't understand
clearly enough the feelings of the Panamanian people, that (the
original canal treaty) implied an element of colonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   History does much to explain the intense feelings surrounding
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Panama in 1903 when a U.S. warship just happened to
steam over the horizon right as a band of rebels declared their
independence from Colombia. The rebels had sent an envoy to
Washington before the uprising, obtaining American promises to
block any Colombian counter-offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, a representative of the fledgling government signed
a treaty granting the Americans the right to build the canal, and
to occupy ``in perpetuity'' a 10-mile-wide canal zone.

   But the document that would shape Panama's destiny wasn't signed
by a Panamanian.

<P>
   Instead, Philippe Bunau-Varilla(cq), a French engineer who had
been part of a failed effort to build a canal in the 1880s _ and
who had a large financial stake in the effort's revival _
frantically pushed through a deal before an official Panamanian
delegation arrived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady time for the young United States. Having just won
the Spanish American War, the canal was seen as a vital trade and
military link that would expand U.S. power. Succeeding where the
French had failed would also prove U.S. superiority over the
European colonial powers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But success was far from assured. The 10-year French effort to
dig a canal _ led by Ferdinand de Lesseps(cq), builder of the Suez
Canal _ collapsed in scandal in 1889 after finances faltered and
tropical diseases killed 20,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The engineering challenges facing the Americans were extreme.
They had to deal with 20-foot tidal surges in the Pacific and 10
feet of annual rainfall that triggered frequent floods and
mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   But the American engineers proved equal to the task. Giant new
steam shovels were imported, and engineers designed an ingenious
system for hauling away the unbelievable amounts of excavated dirt.
</P>
<P>
   They also came up with innovative systems for mixing and pouring
the massive amounts of cement needed for the gigantic locks, which
at 1000 feet long, 110 feet wide and 80 feet deep dwarfed any
previous construction project.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge was cutting through the spine of the
500-foot-tall continental divide. Working nonstop, the giant
shovels tore away the earth, filling enough railroad cars to circle
the globe several times.
</P>
<P>
   A huge dam was built across the Chagres(cq) River, creating the
world's largest man-made lake, which controlled the torrential
rains and provided enough water that the locks could run on gravity
flow, without pumps to move the ships.
</P>
<P>
   The medical challenges were just as severe as the engineering
ones. At the turn of the century, malaria and yellow fever were
terrifying diseases that could sweep through a community, killing
thousands within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Following the groundbreaking work of others, U.S. Army Dr.
William Gorgas proposed killing the mosquitoes suspected of
spreading the diseases. His bosses scoffed, but eventually his
sanitation and hygiene programs proved successful and enabled the
canal to be built.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those programs, some 5,000 workers died from accidents
and disease. About 4,500 of the victims were black West Indians,
who did the backbreaking hand labor needed to keep the giant
shovels working.
</P>
<P>
   The canal opened in 1914, its untested systems quickly working
perfectly. Soon the massive construction force was replaced by
thousands of Americans running the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   They lived separated from the Panamanians by fences surrounding
the canal zone, enjoying subsidized housing, low-cost imported
goods and the protection of American troops at a dozen U.S.
military bases within the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Their work was hard and far from home, but their lives were
rich. There were social clubs, recreation leagues, dances, scout
troops, American schools, a July 4 celebration.
</P>
<P>
   All of which stuck in the throats of the Panamanians, who were
paid less, kept out of the American stores and banned from the
canal zone except for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a country within a country,'' historian David
McCullough said in a televised C-SPAN forum. ``It had its own
police force, laws, courts and stores which the Panamanians didn't
have access to. That was very difficult for the Panamanians to
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocky relationship spawned violence in 1964. American
officials, mindful of the tension, ordered the Panamanian flag
flown beside the U.S. flag at all installations. American students
in the canal zone protested, triggering a counter-protest by
Panamanian students.
</P>
<P>
   Riots broke out, leaving three U.S. Marines and 24 Panamanians
dead.
</P>
<P>
   A succession of U.S. presidents promised to renegotiate the
canal treaty, but nothing was done until Carter took office in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood...that of all the issues that I could possibly
address as president, the relationship between the United States
and Latin America would be predicated on...whether or not we had a
(new) Panama Canal treaty,'' Carter said in a 1998 interview. ``It
was a moral issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The final deal phased out the U.S. presence over a 22-year
period. Along with the waterway operations, the U.S. agreed to turn
over the 360,000 acres within the canal zone _ including all U.S.
military bases. America retains the right to intervene if the
canal's security is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two decades, Panamanians gradually took control
of the canal's day-to-day operations. Today, about 97 percent of
the 9,000 canal workers are Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several military coups, the scandalous Noriega years and
the 1989 U.S. invasion, the Panamanian government passed a
succession of laws designed to insulate the canal from domestic
politics. An independent board now runs it, with a blue-chip
international advisory panel overseeing the operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama understands extremely well the responsibility we have
with this waterway,'' said Alberto Aleman(cq), the canal's
administrator. ``We understand that we are in the marketplace, that
we have to compete, and that we must maintain the confidence of our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanians have already begun a $1 billion modernization
program, and hope to turn the canal zone into a bustling center of
trade, tourism and international investment. Cruise ship terminals,
shopping complexes and an eco-tourism resort are going up.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody acknowledges the Panamanians must still prove
themselves. Skeptics will be watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be proud of the economic development the canal can
bring,'' Carter said. ``We want to see Panama become the Singapore
of the region.''

&HT;     A VETERAN SANTA FINDS THE NORTH POLE NEEDS YOUNGER BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN WECHSLER

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.Y. _ Bob Reiss, owner of the North Pole village
near Lake Placid, had trouble walking through the park on a recent
Sunday. Visitors to the tourist attraction kept stopping him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, are you Mr. Reiss?`` asked Jerry Devoe, from Lake
George. ``I've been coming here since I was a little boy. I respect
you a great deal for sticking to your convictions and not just
looking for the almighty buck.`` Reiss just smiled, as the sleigh
bells that hung from his red hat jingled, and shook his hand. He
had been hearing words like that a lot recently. It was only a
month ago that the 73-year-old businessman announced he was selling
the village. Asking price: $650,000, including the reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   He had been running the North Pole, fictitious home of Santa
Claus, only a few years after his father built it in 1949. For five
decades, Reiss has been at the helm of what some say is the
nation's first theme park. And while similar attractions in the
Adirondack Mountains have been largely abandoned, the North Pole is
still going.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, it will be going without him. That prospect
saddens some visitors. Melissa Giesin, who also stopped Reiss to
thank him, said she felt bad he was leaving. Reiss told her not to
worry. He sees his departure as a way for someone to take a
struggling park and make it thrive, at a time when Santa Claus has
to compete with PlayStation, Pokemon and the Internet for a child's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be sad. Be glad,`` he said. ``For the park to continue,
someone else has to take over.`` When Julian J. Reiss opened the
North Pole in the summer of 1949, the idea was so unique it made
headlines around the country. The story told to children was that
Santa Claus knew the children wanted to visit him, so he had some
Adirondack businessmen build a second home for him on the shoulder
of Whiteface Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Julian Reiss, who bought a home in the Adirondacks
after living here to recover from tuberculosis, got the idea while
driving his daughter to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened, the North Pole attracted more adults than
children. It consisted of eight colorful log buildings where
visitors met with Santa, fed reindeer and looked at an actual North
Pole (coolant was pumped through a vertical pipe, causing it to ice
over year-round). There was even a post office branch, where
visitors could have their letters postmarked ``North Pole.`` In
1951, two years after the park opened, more than 14,000 attended on
the Sunday of Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Walt Disney, which sent a team to visit the North Pole
before he opened Disneyland, forever changed the world's definition
of a ``theme park.`` These days, places with roller coasters
flourish while places like the North Pole _ where the closest thing
to a ``thrill ride`` is the merry-go-round _ struggle to stay
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Adirondacks of upstate New York, similar parks have all
fallen into ruin. ``Tourist-traps`` like Land of Make-Believe, Home
of 1,000 Animals and
</P>
<P>
   Gaslight Village have all closed. The owners of Frontier Village
hung up their coonskin caps for the last time a year ago.
Meanwhile, the former Storytown in Lake George has ditched its
fantasy-land mystique, put up roller coaster rides and is now known
as The Great Escape.
</P>
<P>
   The North Pole did well until the early 1970s, attracting an
average of around 180,000 people every year. Then came the problems
_ first the oil embargo, when the high cost of gasoline kept people
from making long trips, then another gas crisis in 1979, then the
recession of the 1980s. By the time the economy improved, visits
were down to about 65,000 to 70,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Reiss was sure that, once times got better, people would start
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Times got better. Business didn't. A lot had changed since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now your children grow up so much faster,`` Reiss said.
``Twelve-year-olds are not into Santa Claus like they used to be.
It's been a challenge for us to live with that.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reiss willingly admits the park needs someone with younger ideas
_ and younger blood _ to take over. But when he was ready to sell
(he says his wife said it was time to grow up and get a real job)
he did it in a rather unique way.
</P>
<P>
   He invited the QVC home shopping channel to do a broadcast from
his village. ``It's not everyday you get to purchase your very own
theme park,`` the announcer said as they toured the park. A window
on the left-hand side of the screen advertised the price: $650,000,
with no shipping charge. From the dozens of calls, Reiss narrowed
it down to eight people who were serious about running a park. He
hopes the deal will go through as early as March, so he can start
on his hobbies of sailing and being with his grandchildren. But it
may not be so easy for him to leave. ``Even though I live half my
life in a fantasy, I think I'm a realist,`` he said. ``When you
have a business like this, you don't just walk away and forget
it.``

   GLENS FALLS, N.Y. _ Holidays are a time for creating new
traditions and carrying on old ones. For 30-plus years, Louis and
Carol Whitney have celebrated their family Christmas with three or
more Christmas trees among their holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the holidays and started this tree tradition when we
were first married,'' said Carol Whitney, as she wiped artificial
snow from her tailored brown trousers and matching Chanel shoes.
``Our children continue to love it. It's a lot of work, but we
wouldn't dream of using an artificial tree. The trees, greens and
flowers always have to be fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the public rooms in their gracious
French-chateau-style residence feature a tree, but so does the
billiard/home theater room and their master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the ceiling-high trees features ornaments that the
couple has collected over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The tree in the walnut-paneled living room is
traditional-looking, with the feeling of a sparkling jewel box.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one has loads of tinsel on it and colored lights,''
Whitney said. ``Many of the glass ornaments are new, several that
we have collected over the years and several from family and
friends. Almost every ornament has a memory attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornaments vary in size from jumbo orbs to tiny glass figurines.
There also is a collection of mouth-blown and hand-painted
ornaments done in the Old World, European tradition of the 19th
century designed by Christopher Radko. Each is produced in a
limited edition.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney decorates the living room tree with friends at a party
she and her husband give after Thanksgiving but she puts the
ornaments on the other three trees in the following weeks herself.
</P>
<P>
   The large evergreen in the foyer is decked out with white
lights, bows and ornaments and a crown of blue bows with matching
streamers down to the gaily wrapped presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first one you see when you enter the house,''
Whitney said. ``It also picks up the colors of the foyer and cloak
and powder room.''
</P>
<P>
   Since purchasing the house nearly eight years ago, the Whitneys
have been slowly and carefully bringing harmony to the interior of
this eye-catching home with its 16 rooms, seven baths and former
maids' quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Set on 15 acres in upstate New York, the 8,400-square-foot
creamy stucco-and-brick house was built in the 1960s by attorney
Louis P. Brown, who was also a president of the Glens Falls
National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Brown incorporated many unique features into the house, from
four French marble fireplace mantles to antique French fruitwood
doors that enclose the built-in home entertainment equipment and
television set; Rococo paneling in the formal dining room with
fireplace; elegant French door windows; slate and red Spanish tile
floors; fountains in many of the rooms and a working faience stove.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also had a large depression in back of the house where he
kept his pet bears and other animals. It has since been filled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually the pond, which runs into Halfway Brook, and
the walkway through the woods that attracted me to the house,''
recalled Carol Whitney, who is a native of Pennsylvania. ``Then
when I saw the large gourmet kitchen, I was really sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Whitney is the grandson of Charlotte Pruyn Hyde, the
founder of the Hyde Collection art museum in Glens Falls and
daughter of one of the founders of the Finch, Pruyn &AMP; Co. paper
mill in Glens Falls. Although Carol Whitney tackled some of the
projects herself, such as wallpapering the powder room, she has
been working with interior designer Edmond DeRocker of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house basically decorates itself by demanding period
furnishings,'' DeRocker said. ``Carol has achieved a warm mostly
Country French look with fun touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabric and tents and ornate brass coat hooks decorate the cloak
room. Pieces from her former home have been reupholstered and
incorporated into the house. ``Carol has a very good eye and knows
what she likes when she sees it,'' DeRocker said.
</P>
<P>
   The first project Carol Whitney tackled was the den. It has a
rich palette of
</P>
<P>
   forest green plaid wallpaper, built-in bookcases, comfortable
burgundy leather furnishings and a fireplace. According to Whitney,
it is her favorite room in the house, where she does most of her
reading, knitting and needlepoint.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the color scheme, Whitney adds only decorative
touches here, such as placing fresh greens and candles on the
fireplace mantle and an arrangement of fresh boughs beside it. A
decorated tree sits outside the floor-to-ceiling French doors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the interior fountains have been removed except the one
in the main hallway, which is a classical three-tiered
cream-colored marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to landscape the fountain with poinsettia plants and
candles,'' Whitney said. ``We like to entertain during the holidays
and so the dining room is often set up buffet-style.''
</P>
<P>
   For a festive and dramatic centerpiece, she uses an antique
child's sleigh in the center, filled with fresh flowers. Greens,
flowers and candles are arranged formally over the fireplace
mantle.
</P>
<P>
   The tree in the second-floor home theater room ``has inherited a
lot of old odds-and-ends ornaments,'' she said. ``I've used campy,
colorful bubble lights on the tree, which seem to fit better than
solid-colored lights.''
</P>
<P>
   The master bedroom tree adorns the cream-and-peach-colored room
with its fireplace and pale mint carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fingers are sore from spraying the tree with artificial
white snow,'' Whitney said. ``It took a couple of days and 24 cans
of spray to get it covered before the pale gold ornaments could be
put on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and son put the lights on all the trees, but they
draw the
</P>
<P>
   line there when it comes to putting on all the ornaments,'' said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Come Christmas morning, all of the packages are rounded up from
beneath the other trees and brought to the living room, where they
spill out into the room beyond the abundance of wrapped presents
already under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't open them now until around 10 a.m. or later in the
morning,'' Whitney said, as she rid her trousers of the last few
flecks of artificial snow. ``It was always at the crack of dawn,
before the children grew up.''

lights, bows and ornaments and a crown of blue bows with matching
streamers down to the gaily wrapped presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first one you see when you enter the house,''
Whitney said. ``It also picks up the colors of the foyer and cloak
and powder room.''
</P>
<P>
   Since purchasing the house nearly eight years ago, the Whitneys
have been slowly and carefully bringing harmony to the interior of
this eye-catching home with its 16 rooms, seven baths and former
maids' quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Set on 15 acres in upstate New York, the 8,400-square-foot
creamy stucco-and-brick house was built in the 1960s by attorney
Louis P. Brown, who was also a president of the Glens Falls
National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Brown incorporated many unique features into the house, from
four French marble fireplace mantles to antique French fruitwood
doors that enclose the built-in home entertainment equipment and
television set; Rococo paneling in the formal dining room with
fireplace; elegant French door windows; slate and red Spanish tile
floors; fountains in many of the rooms and a working faience stove.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also had a large depression in back of the house where he
kept his pet bears and other animals. It has since been filled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually the pond, which runs into Halfway Brook, and
the walkway through the woods that attracted me to the house,''
recalled Carol Whitney, who is a native of Pennsylvania. ``Then
when I saw the large gourmet kitchen, I was really sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Whitney is the grandson of Charlotte Pruyn Hyde, the
founder of the Hyde Collection art museum in Glens Falls and
daughter of one of the founders of the Finch, Pruyn &AMP; Co. paper
mill in Glens Falls. Although Carol Whitney tackled some of the
projects herself, such as wallpapering the powder room, she has
been working with interior designer Edmond DeRocker of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house basically decorates itself by demanding period
furnishings,'' DeRocker said. ``Carol has achieved a warm mostly
Country French look with fun touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabric and tents and ornate brass coat hooks decorate the cloak
room. Pieces from her former home have been reupholstered and
incorporated into the house. ``Carol has a very good eye and knows
what she likes when she sees it,'' DeRocker said.
</P>
<P>
   The first project Carol Whitney tackled was the den. It has a
rich palette of
</P>
<P>
   forest green plaid wallpaper, built-in bookcases, comfortable
burgundy leather furnishings and a fireplace. According to Whitney,
it is her favorite room in the house, where she does most of her
reading, knitting and needlepoint.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the color scheme, Whitney adds only decorative
touches here, such as placing fresh greens and candles on the
fireplace mantle and an arrangement of fresh boughs beside it. A
decorated tree sits outside the floor-to-ceiling French doors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the interior fountains have been removed except the one
in the main hallway, which is a classical three-tiered
cream-colored marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to landscape the fountain with poinsettia plants and
candles,'' Whitney said. ``We like to entertain during the holidays
and so the dining room is often set up buffet-style.''
</P>
<P>
   For a festive and dramatic centerpiece, she uses an antique
child's sleigh in the center, filled with fresh flowers. Greens,
flowers and candles are arranged formally over the fireplace
mantle.
</P>
<P>
   The tree in the second-floor home theater room ``has inherited a
lot of old odds-and-ends ornaments,'' she said. ``I've used campy,
colorful bubble lights on the tree, which seem to fit better than
solid-colored lights.''
</P>
<P>
   The master bedroom tree adorns the cream-and-peach-colored room
with its fireplace and pale mint carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fingers are sore from spraying the tree with artificial
white snow,'' Whitney said. ``It took a couple of days and 24 cans
of spray to get it covered before the pale gold ornaments could be
put on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and son put the lights on all the trees, but they
draw the
</P>
<P>
   line there when it comes to putting on all the ornaments,'' said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Come Christmas morning, all of the packages are rounded up from
beneath the other trees and brought to the living room, where they
spill out into the room beyond the abundance of wrapped presents
already under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't open them now until around 10 a.m. or later in the
morning,'' Whitney said, as she rid her trousers of the last few
flecks of artificial snow. ``It was always at the crack of dawn,
before the children grew up.''

REVOLUTION'S HURTADO BRINGS IT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eduardo Hurtado went from the MetroStars, the worst team in
Major League Soccer, to the Revolution, another team more known for
floundering than flourishing. But in between stops, Hurtado has
found success in Ecuador, his home country.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado scored two goals as Liga Deportiva Universitaria
defeated Nacional, 3-1, in the championship game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Hurtado was especially convenient for Ecuadoran
headline writers, since his nickname is ``El Tanque'' (The Tank)
and the vanquished opposition represented the nation's armed
forces. The victory also gave residents of Quito a diversion from
the effects of Guagua, the volcano ``which is still raining ashes
onto the city,'' according to a wire service account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eduardo is very fit, at the top of his game,'' said his agent,
Eric Manasse. ``He is playing at 2,700 meters above sea level and
it is hard to breathe, so it is a real test of fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado's good form has made him a certain candidate for the
national team. Coach Hernan Dario Gomez has called in Hurtado and
former Revolution striker Ariel Graziani for training camp next
month, and hopes to use them for three preparation games before the
start of World Cup qualifying March 28. Revolution coach Fernando
Clavijo could also lose Giovanni Savarese, who could join Venezuela
for qualifying games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was being interviewed all the time,'' Manasse said of
Hurtado, ``and said he is very content with going to the Revolution
because of his rapport with Fernando, plus going to a new city
after the problems he had in New York. He is really into it and he
wants to win with the Revolution. He likes playing with Giovanni
Savarese, and he knows if they get an expert central defender, they
can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, whose wife is expecting their third child, will likely
arrive in Boston early next month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Central casting
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manasse is offering the Revolution three experienced central
defenders: Stefano Nava, a member of two European Championship
teams with Milan, who is on a free transfer; Colombian Evereth
Palacios; and Byron Tenorio, who is from Hurtado's hometown,
Esmeraldas, and has been a regular on Ecuador's national team. Nava
and Tenorio are tall and bring a strong physical presence _ Tenorio
was also a member of Ecuador's national team in basketball. All
three are 30 years old. Clavijo has been scouting in Portugal for a
central defender . . . If the Revolution want to start laying the
foundation for the future, they should consider local prospects
Ebbie Kodiat, 20, and Bruno Schneider, 17. Kodiat has a chance to
be invited to spring training in Florida, and Schneider could be a
Project 40 candidate, according to Clavijo. Kodiat has performed
well at recent tryout camps, but Schneider was prohibited from
attending because of his age. But Schneider, a 6-foot-1-inch,
160-pound striker, is among the most ambitious young players in the
area. He scored 74 goals in 48 games at Winthrop and Dom Savio high
schools but believes he must move to the professional level to
develop his talent. He plans to skip his senior year in high school
to pursue opportunities either in Europe or MLS. Meanwhile, he is
with Juventus of Worcester and playing in indoor leagues. The last
Massachusetts product to play for a US national team was Matt
Thompson, of Roxbury Latin High and Wellesley, with the Under-17
team. Thompson, 21, a central defender, performed briefly at
Indiana University and transferred to Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His home fires still burn
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Francis Okaroh, the Revolution's defensive player of the year in
1996 and '97 before being claimed by the Chicago Fire, said he
hopes to conclude his career playing for New England. But Chicago
coach Bob Bradley does not seem eager to let Okaroh depart. Bradley
quickly moved to change the Fire's foreign flavor, waiving Polish
veterans Roman Kosecki and Jerzy Podbrozny, and now must reinforce
the midfield. Okaroh, who is recovering at his Woburn home after
hernia surgery, missed the Fire's final playoff game and his team
squandered a two-goal advantage in being eliminated by Dallas.
``You have to have that fire and some of our guys didn't have it
last year,'' Okaroh said. ``We are ready to start over. We have the
nucleus. The key thing is we still have the defense, and if you
have your defense set you can plug guys into the offensive roles.''
. . . Javier Pedro Saviola has become the youngest player to lead
Argentina's first division in scoring since Diego Maradona in 1978.
Saviola converted his 15th goal of the Apertura season in River
Plate's 2-2 tie with San Lorenzo, just eight days after his 18th
birthday. Maradona was 17 when he scored 22 goals in '78. River
Plate's other goal went to 19-year-old Guillermo Pereyra. It was
River Plate's 28th Argentine championship . . . Nottingham Forest's
purchase of Stern John paid off almost immediately as he scored in
the sixth minute of his first game in England last month. John, 23,
who led the MLS in scoring in his two years with the Columbus Crew,
converted an even more important goal Saturday. This time, John's
goal was the game's only score as Nottingham Forest edged Crewe
Alexandra to take over 19th place. Coach David Platt's position was
becoming precarious as Forest was slipping toward the relegation
zone . . . Pachuca, Mexico's oldest club, won its first
professional league championship Sunday. Los Tuzos had to travel to
Mexico City for the second leg of the final, and took the victory
over Cruz Azul two minutes into overtime as Argentine Alejandro
Glaria scored the only goal of the game. Glaria had converted twice
in a 2-2 tie in the first leg at Estadio Hidalgo. Pachuca coach
Javier Aguirre had assembled a team of mostly anonymous players.
The squad included Mexican national team veteran Marcelino Bernal,
Baltimore-born Gerardo Mascareno, and Argentine goalkeeper Nacho
Gonzalez. Cruz Azul's season concludes Tuesday when it meets CD
Guadalajara in Los Angeles in the final of the Copa Estrella . . .
In century rankings of the world's best players, the International
Federation of Football History and Statistics listed Fall River's
Billy Gonsalves sixth in the CONCACAF region. Gonsalves, who played
in the 1930 and '34 World Cup finals, was the only US player in the
top 10. The top-ranked player was Hugo Sanchez, a five-time scoring
champion in Spain. The top goalkeepers were: Antonio Carbajal
(Mexico), Luis Conejo (Costa Rica), Kasey Keller (US), Jorge Campos
(Mexico), and Henri Francillon (Haiti), who is now head coach at
Emerson College. Joe Kennaway, who played for the Fall River
Marksmen and Glasgow Celtic, ranked seventh among goalkeepers.

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A game of 20 Questions with the Pro Football
Coroner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, what caused the death of the 1999 New England Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there were a lot of factors involved. I'll tell you,
this has been one of the most bizarre autopsies I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Initially, I examined this team and didn't find a heart. So I
thought that was the cause. But I changed my diagnosis when I
leaned closer to the corpse and found scant remains of something.
Now there is no doubt that blood once coursed through these
lifeless veins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're crazy. This highly paid, 7-7 team was whipped _
literally and metaphorically _ by a third-string quarterback named
Koy Detmer. Did you see what he did to them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep. Saw everything. I saw his suggestive, 25-cent Peep Show
dance and I saw his three touchdown passes. But if you think their
problems began with Detmer and the Philadelphia Eagles, you
probably also think Michael Bishop should have played earlier in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You play dirty. We'll talk about Bishop later. But let me ask
you: If the Patriots had heart _ which I doubt _ what didn't they
have?
</P>
<P>
   A: Organizational honesty. From the owner, to the personnel
department, to the coaching staff, to the players. They didn't know
whom they were and it killed them. They were delusional and it
affected the way they managed, the way they drafted, the way they
dealt with their free agents, the way they viewed the competition,
the way they disciplined themselves, the way they held themselves
accountable, the way their fans talked about them . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hold on. One at a time. Who was most at fault for all this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Throw out some names and I'll tell you where they went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   A: Forget about all this Bill Parcells hysteria. That wasn't the
mistake. The big fella is from New Jersey and there was no way he
was going to retire here. Kraft's biggest error was that he and the
men who work for him thought more like football guys than baseball
guys. In baseball, most people go for veterans over untested
prospects. They also go for ``locker room presence'' guys. Kraft
did the opposite. He picked prospects over veterans and _
unintenionally or not _ sacrificed the soul of his team. Ever
notice that every major league baseball team has one or two guys
who aren't really that good? Those are your ``presence'' guys.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did Kraft allow this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: He made the mistake a lot of executives make: he thought the
people who worked for him were replaceable. They may have been on
paper, but there were some distinct quirks about Curtis Martin, Sam
Gash, and even Corwin Brown that endeared them to teammates. All of
them were effective players and terrific people. Brown and Gash
used to keep the locker room pulsing by playing chess. They were
thinkers. Martin, one of the most sincere men you'll ever meet,
used to shadowbox with Jimmy Hitchcock (also traded for a
third-round pick). They were good guys who didn't easily accept
losing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Kraft make a mistake by hiring Pete Carroll?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope. You've got the order reversed. Carroll made the mistake
of choosing the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Huh?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pay attention. Didn't I tell you this team died because it
didn't know itself? Carroll thought he was taking over a thriving
Super Bowl team when he took the job in 1997. He wasn't. He was
taking over an enigma. He took over the second- or third-best team
in the AFC, a team that lost the Super Bowl by 14 points. He took
over a team that was 11-5 in '96 and 6-10 in '95. He took over a
team that was in transition, shifting its personnel power from
Charley Armey to Bobby Grier. He took over a team in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And that was a mistake?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, because he should have known that if things went wrong
_ and they did _ he was going to be the public face of the
collapse. That's what happened. He'll lose his job soon. He'll find
another one because he is respected by coaches such as Mike
Shanahan and George Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You feel sorry for him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. He was too polite with these guys. Just
yesterday, he said he was ``on the verge'' of saying something
nasty about his team in Philly but resisted. Hey, Pete. Get nasty,
my brother. These players have disrespected you all season and
you're holding back? Terry Glenn didn't hold back when he was late
for those team meetings and team buses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think Glenn is one of the finest receivers in the league.
Wouldn't trade him for anyone. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A: What, did you go to Ohio State or something? If I ran the
Patriots when they were alive, I would have called the Cleveland
Browns and offered them Glenn for their first pick. I'd call
Philadelphia, too. Glenn is, maybe, the fifth best receiver in the
AFC. I'd rather have Keyshawn Johnson, Marvin Harrison, Jimmy
Smith, and Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused. Weren't the Patriots supposed to be talented?
</P>
<P>
   A: They were. But they didn't have enough warrior in them. They
always gave you the feeling that they were relaxing in the
Carribbean, even when they were in Foxborough. I told you: They
were delusional. And soft. Kraft and Grier tinkered with this team
when they should have been overhauling it, especially on the
offensive and defensive lines. Max Lane is my boy (we once did a
show together) but he shouldn't have been given big money. Same
with Todd Rucci.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   A: Will never make the Pro Bowl again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ex-Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   A: I heard that he is not ready to run the offense and that he
doesn't do so well in the team's weekly quarterback quizzes. Looks
like he needs to do his homework.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Bruce Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   A: He criticized the Carroll/Ernie Zampese play-calling on
Sunday. Whoa. I've learned that if you criticize a man's music,
religion, shoes, or play-calling, you're in for a fight. My
goodness. Death from delusion. Wait until I tell my assistant about
this one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wait, wait. Before you go. One more thing. Please?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're planning a Patriots funeral and need the perfect
selection for the dirge. Any recommendations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Certainly. These Patriots should be buried to the sounds
of one of my favorite groups, a group that is _ appropriately _
from Philly. They are called the Roots. The essential song?
``Things Fall Apart.''

<P>
   LONGBOAT KEY, Fla. _ What's Christmas without a tree?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a palm tree,'' says my crony, Murray the Wrench, the
Buffalo, N.Y., orthodontist, who once more has snatched victory _
escape to a balmy, palmy Florida shore _ from the jaws of
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yessir, their teeth puts bite in my bankroll, and here we are
again. A mini-wrench is my Yule tool. The only white I dream of for
Christmas is this sand,'' he says, rearranging himself in the rays
beside the blue-and-green splattered Gulf of Mexico at the Colony
Beach &AMP; Tennis Resort. ``Forget Bing Crosby and sleigh bells. I'll
take buoy bells.'' So will his lady, Susie, a refugee from the pale
perils of Canadian winter.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and I have been meeting at the Colony for a couple of
decades to admire the pelicans, egrets, and other birds, wash the
bah-humbug out of our systems with salt water and Wild Horse pinot
noir, as well as ponder the passing and coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're big losers this time,'' he says. ``We're dropping not
just a year but a millennium plus my 20th century _ three for the
price of one jug of . . . champagne at midnight the 31st. I hate to
see them go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you said about rumble seats, boogie-woogie, white
bucks, nickel phone calls, and doctors' house calls,'' Susie
reminds him. ``But you got past it. And why is this your century?
Because you've been around for most of it? The champagne will ease
your sense of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no sense of loss about travel because you keep the
memories. Sometimes expensive, usually priceless. At a distance in
time I can even admire the artistry of a double-teaming Ecuadorian
pickpocket team that nailed me in a Quito cathedral. One bumped me
on the left, apologizing profusely while his partner on the right
dipped profitably with a claw as educated as a Florida stone
crab's.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch beckons. We move in the direction of the dining room where
adroit maitre d'hotel Alberto Mastromano and venerable waiter Ron
Craze deliver stone crab, the succulent creature from these Gulf
waters that sacrifices regenerative claws but not its life.
Intriguing beasts, they're the stars of the Colony's annual October
Stone Crab Festival presided over by chef John Dutton. Put together
by Katie and Michael Moulton, the hotel's respective general
manager and food manager, it's a cookout for chefs who descend from
numerous pots of call to try their hands with crabs and other
native seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Among the yummy treats were: crab fried in seaweed by Paul
Albrecht, once king of numerous superb kitchens in Atlanta, who has
opened a new restaurant, Chez Paul's, up the West Coast at Panama
City Beach; corn and oyster fritters with tamatillo avocado sauce
by Melissa Kelly from Primo in Rockland, Maine; sauteed shrimp and
sausage with stone-ground grits by Don Barickman of Magnolia's in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   As we munch, Murray says he's returning in February and March
``to treat myself to more crab and the Sarasota Opera across the
bay.'' Seafood and sopranos, a satisfying blend, especially since
that fine company's 2000 season will include Bizet's ``The Pearl
Fishers'' and Wagner's salty ``The Flying Dutchman'' as well as
Rossini's ``Barber of Seville'' and Verdi's ``Alzira.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he asks me, the road-tripper, to distill from all the
millennial etcmileage and baggage those 20th-century journeys that
pop quickly to the surface of my neural mush. So I give him this
dozen, chronologically:
</P>
<P>
   --Hello Florida _ First visit as a summer-vacationing
schoolchild with my parents and sister in a cramped 1937 Chevy. It
took days on two-lane roads from northern Ohio, but we were in no
hurry. Burma Shave signs provided roadside doggerel, and the
mountains of Tennessee loomed strange and thrilling. Tourist cabins
(predecessors of motels) with outhouses were a novelty away from
our accustomed beds. Harsh revelations of a different country
called Dixie were the chain gangs in zebra-striped outfits working
Georgia roads, chaperoned by shotgun-carrying guards. And Jim Crow:
separate drinking fountains, toilets, and, we learned, everything
else for ``white'' and ``colored.'' The Atlantic was a grand new
sight along Florida's east coast. ``Whoa, we're going in!'' said my
grinning father, pulling over next to a deserted beach. We changed
in the car, then delighted in a salt-water baptism.
</P>
<P>
   --Niagara Falls, 1938 _ It was a prize, and I felt like I'd won
a million on a quiz show. Nothing that enriching, but I had
outlasted the field in a third graders' spelling contest for the
Cleveland area, sponsored by a newspaper, the doomed Press.
All-expenses-paid for two over a weekend. As the Depression raged,
it seemed all the more unimaginably plush: a Pullman sleeper from
Cleveland to Buffalo, then a limo with driver and guide taking my
mother and me to the falls, depositing us in a ritzy hotel. All
that rushing water was overwhelming, especially up close in a boat
called Maid of the Mist, and, I assume, still is. For me the
toughest words in the spell-down were ``faucet'' and ``chauffeur,''
seeming appropriate in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   --Europe Ho! _ A college boy's rookie look was taken at the end
of a nine-day New York-England voyage on an ex-troop ship. Why did
those people talk so funny? But it was English. Sort of. French was
tougher. In that pre-TV-saturation day, everything my friend, Bob
Beach, and I had read about _ Westminster Abbey, Stratford, Notre
Dame, Dutch windmills and canals, Brig o' Doon _ stood out as
though newly minted (in a pre-aged motif, of course). With
stringent food rationing yet austerely enforced in an England
unrecovered from World War II, we were always famished. It was
different on the Continent, victuals abundant. And as francs were
numerous at 300 to the dollar, staying well fed in France was easy,
even on a tight budget.
</P>
<P>
   --Tanzanian Safari _ A Hemingway mystique blanketed this
movement through the Great Rift Valley, plotted and led by Papa's
youngest son, Dr. Greg Hemingway, who had apprenticed as a
professional hunter. It was a big game looking for big game. Though
I wouldn't go on a gunning safari again _ the concept is passe _
the stalking of dangerous beasts is undeniably exciting (is that
elephant tooting at me?). Tramping and camping in lush terrain
abounding with them was exhilarating. Hamisi, a professional
tracker, initiated us in the art of palming a tall mound of
elephant dung: If it's warm, the depositor is in the neighborhood.
Hard to beat rising at 4:30 amid showers of stars, walking most of
the blue-sky day, dining wearily at the campfire with good company.
When my hardy pal, Bwana Jack, won out after hand-to-paw combat
with a husky lion, he casually reported, ``Leo had bad breath.''
</P>
<P>
   --Vietnam, Parts I and II _ Scared to death every minute the
first time, covering the war for a couple of months. The reprise 25
years later was an improvement from mindlessness to mildness: a
beautiful country with beautiful, congenial people pleased to see
Americans. Hanoi is a beguiling city surrounding a lake into which
John McCain crashed. Beaches are waiting to be resortified. A side
trip into a Cambodian jungle revealed the haunting temples and
overpowering sculpture of Angkor Wat and Angkor Tom.
</P>
<P>
   --The Taj Mahal _ No building can live up to such a spectacular
reputation, I thought. Wrong. India's Taj does, and it should be
seen at various times of day and night (moonlight's terrific) to
get the full effect. My first visit, our driver roared nonstop the
50 miles from New Delhi to Agra, never releasing the horn. ``I have
to keep blowing to warn people,'' he said. ``I don't want to hit
anybody. But if I do, we don't stop. They would kill us.'' The
second visit was coupled to the mystically compelling Varanasi,
where Hindus go to die, if they are lucky. Or their bodies are
carried there for cremation, the ashes spread across the sacred,
teeming River Ganghes.
</P>
<P>
   --China '77 _ So rare were Westerners then that we were followed
_ quietly, politely _ by gatherings of curious in Shanghai and
Beijing. The citizenry blended together, dressed similarly in
Maoist drab. However, young children somehow were allowed to flaunt
colors. The Wall was indeed great, although it may be plastered
with advertising now. Nobody had a car. Life was primitive and
hard, extremely laborious, but the people fascinating, friendly. I
need to take another look one of these days.
</P>
<P>
   --Senami Onsen, Japan _ Picked it by chance off a map because
it's on the Sea of Japan, connected by excellent trains to Tokyo.
(Why oh why does the United States lag so far behind Japan and
Europe in the best form of transportation, rail?) Swimming in the
sea was splendid, the rural vistas pleasant. Food at the inn was
fine except that there was no way to order. It just arrived at the
room. The catch was that only one man in town spoke English. After
the embarrassed innkeeper produced that guy, life got better, more
understandable _ even if we were the lone non-wearers of kimonos.
</P>
<P>
   --Tibetan Trek _ Because the Chinese guides were so secretive
and unprepared, nobody knew where the hell we were, other than it
was marvelous mountainous country where yaks moved surer than we.
Because the cook, fittingly named Pan, was a star we didn't starve
though caught in a blizzard. Sleeping bags prescribed by the
Globe's Tony Chamberlain saved our skins, and yak herders shared
their fires. When it stopped snowing, we found ourselves at the
foot of a handsome peak in the Da Wa Range, Mount Siguniang _ I
think. Uncertainty ruled. Eventually we walked back to a village
where a van awaited for a springs-threatening drive over
rut-and-roll mud to Chengdu in China.
</P>
<P>
   --Across Australia _ With my friend, Aurelio, at the wheel, we
drove west-east, transcontinental, from Perth to Melbourne, close
to 3,000 miles. Few do. It's not so hazardous as a few years ago
when the road was unpaved. There were few roadhouses, and running
out of water probably meant death. Aussies thought we were bonkers,
rating the Nullarbor Plain as must-miss barren, monotonous. Not
really. Meeting so many interesting, resourceful folks in tiny
settlements and on vast ranches along the way, we thought it
restful and amusing. Like finding the entire population, 28, in the
lively pub at Salmon Gums, Western Australia.

ON FOOTBALL FIELD AND IN POLITICS, LEADERSHIP'S THE KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After his players shut down rather than compete during their
costly loss Sunday to the Philadelphia Eagles, Pete Carroll, the
New England Patriots head football coach, was asked the obvious:
What happened?
</P>
<P>
   They ``squatted,'' he replied. The analogy has a sexist tinge to
it _ it seems crudely to imply something along the lines of ``they
played like girls.'' But at this point, feminist concerns are the
least of Carroll's problems. I bring them up because this debacle
of a Patriots season raises interesting issues beyond football.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is not what happened, but why? Why did this
team quit? Why does one group of athletes or workers rally and pull
together to achieve greatness and another group give up?
</P>
<P>
   The answer involves that elusive quality we call leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to sports talk shows, Carroll's leadership
deficiency is largely attributed to a general feeling that he is
``too nice.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the jock crowd, he's too California and too mellow,
which seems to be male code for saying he isn't macho enough.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier during his tenure in New England, Carroll had to deny he
surfed, as if surfing somehow signals a lack of manliness. But
leadership, I think, means more than being ``manly,'' even to a
professional football player.
</P>
<P>
   A nice person can be a leader, when sometimes even the toughest
guy in a crowd will never be one. Women clearly can be leaders. Why
else do all those big, bulky football players say ``Hi, Mom,'' when
they get into camera range?
</P>
<P>
   Fear alone does not inspire people to excel _ on a football
field or in a newsroom. The strength of a coach like Bill Parcells
is not just his ability to scare professional athletes, but to
scare them into being the best they can be.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, coaching athletes takes a nasty and, again, decidedly
sexist turn. Remember when Parcells referred to Patriots wide
receiver Terry Glenn as a ``she''?
</P>
<P>
   Yet nastiness in itself doesn't motivate, either. A coach like
Parcells is at the height of his leadership potential when he is
able to make a player confront his weaknesses in order to build
upon his strengths and then work not just for individual glory but
for the glory of the team. (Parcells' style didn't work well with
Drew Bledsoe, although the quarterback might appreciate it more now
than he did in the past.)
</P>
<P>
   Carroll lacks that basic ability to motivate, at least with this
specific football team. It is true that he is not the one dropping
the passes. The athletes are making the actual on-field mistakes.
But Carroll, a seemingly nice man, is not succeeding at his job,
which is this: to make the players believe they can win, to inspire
them to try, and to care if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, that is what leadership is all about, whatever the
playing field. And in politics, business, or sports, leadership is
a know-it-when-you-see-it kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people simply exude it _ Arizona Senator John McCain is an
example. Some people have it and lose it, because they lose moral
authority _ President Clinton comes to mind. Some people never have
it, despite prestigious job titles and other accoutrements of
power, such as money. The jury is still out, for example, on Texas
Governor George W. Bush and, for that matter, Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders execute a plan in one place, then decide to take it
somewhere else, like New York. That's what Parcells did and what
former Governor Bill Weld is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are leaders without portfolio. They have no titles
or trappings, but when they speak, others listen and instinctively
follow. Some people yell, scream, rant, and rave. But no one will
ever follow them anywhere, because they know there is nothing
behind the noise. Some people are more public in their leadership,
while others make things happen quietly, in their churches,
schools, or in their own back yards.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot lead without a plan people consider worth following.
That is a problem for someone like Governor Paul Cellucci, who has
chosen to take a stand on too many things people consider
irrelevant while taking a pass on more important matters.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad to see a leader fail. But when it happens, it's over.
Voters won't vote for you. Employees won't work for you. Football
players won't play for you. You just can't get anywhere, because no
one understands where you want to go or how to get there.
</P>

DISTANT THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee met this week in Washington.
Nobody expected anything more than a furrowed brow from Alan
Greenspan, in the form of one sort of cryptic statement or another,
addressing bond-buyers' fears of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term rates were raised slightly in November. Raise them
again? ``They have done everything but promise they won't,'' said
Frederick Breimyer, chief economist for State Street Bank and
Trust. The Fed policy-makers will wait at least until their next
meeting in early February to see whether that tap on the brakes was
enough. It probably wasn't, he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the century, the American economy is ticking along
very nicely indeed _ soon to become the longest business expansion
ever. The holiday spending season is contributing solidly but not
spectacularly, said David Wyss, an economist who narrates the
economy like a play-by-play announcer for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a
subsidiary of McGraw Hill.
</P>
<P>
   At least three factors are now at work, Wyss said. Wealth is not
growing as quickly this year as in the recent past; the S&AMP;P 500
index is up only 19 percent this year _ compared with an annual
rise of 27 percent for each of the past four years. The slowdown
may have a dampening effect. ``As long as Americans consider
themselves rich, they feel they do not need to save more for
retirement or other purposes,'' Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, consumers have learned that store prices fall as Dec.
25 approaches. ``Retailers have trained customers to wait for the
last minute before buying their gifts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest shopping day last year was the Saturday before
Christmas, he said. The Friday after Thankgiving ranked a lowly
eighth in sales volume. Electronic commerce may reinforce this
trend, Wyss said. Internet purchases are growing phenomenonally.
They roughly tripled last holiday season; they may have doubled
again this year _ maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet _ and this is the point _ Internet shopping is still a tiny
fraction of all consumer spending _ 0.1 percent, according to DRI,
perhaps as much as half a percent of retail. Throw in catalog sales
and it may be 1 percent, and growing. Americans may be strapped for
time and tired of looking for a parking place. But they're still
going to the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce boom is clearly in its infancy. No wonder, then,
that the Congressional Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce
is hearing from a growing chorus of store owners and their
political representatives that tax-free status of e-commerce could
become an unfair edge in the battle for consumers' dollars, with
traditional shops that pay sales taxes that vary widely depending
on the state and city. The commission has been holding hearings in
different cities around the country. It is charged with analyzing
the issues surrounding the taxation of Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real problem,'' Wyss said. ``Retailers are worried. So
are politicians. They are worrying about it on fiscal committees of
state legislatures, too, because it's a revenue leak.''
</P>
<P>
   There are limits to the power of the Internet to evade taxation,
of course. Commodities that are delivered locally are still taxed
easily when the owner takes possession. Automobiles, fuel oil, food
_ all will remain comfortably within the power of the tax
collector, even though they may be ordered on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alchoholic beverages are a special problem. I know because I
just tried to order wine to send to a niece. They are not permitted
to deliver to Indiana. You can't ship alcohol into Massachusetts,
either. It is something the liquor wholesalers arranged,'' Wyss
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few tax economists think that e-commerce should be taxed
differently than retail. But many think that the Internet should be
permitted to grow unfettered for a time. Prominent is Austan
Goolsbee, professor of economics at the graduate School of Business
at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons, he said, why the Internet should be
exempted while it grows: compliance costs, information problems,
bandwagon effects. At first, the revenue losses to states and
cities would be small.
</P>
<P>
   But these factors are becoming less important over time. And
once the Internet becomes an established retail channel, it
shouldn't be treated differently than anyone else. The distant
thunder you hear is coming from the bricks-and-mortar merchants who
agree.

MILLENNIAL GOAL: PROSPERITY FOR ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America created prosperity for 30 years after World War II, and
the federal government should repeat many of those same policies
for at least the first 30 years of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, America maintains the same economic polices of the
last 20 years, the new millennium will not be for everyone to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The rich will get richer. The poor will get poorer. And
middle-class incomes will continue a backward slide.
</P>
<P>
   This is what folks are saying at United For A Fair Economy, a
Boston-based think tank that focuses on economic inequality.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the U.S. economy boomed, and so did people's
incomes. From 1945 to 1979, all Americans saw their incomes
virtually double. Almost everyone, except most African-Americans
before the civil rights movement began, benefited from the new
prosperity, said Betsy Leondar-Wright, of United for A Fair
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   As she explained it, so many Americans prospered because it was
``the deliberate policy of the US Government to create a middle
class'' by implementing programs such as the GI Bill of Rights,
home-buying plans, antipoverty programs, civil rights legislation,
and other programs dsigned to put more money into the hands of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that this was good for American business,''
said Leondar-Wright, giving consumers the ability to buy new homes,
new cars, new appliances. This is what the government wanted, what
business wanted, and what returning GIs wanted.
</P>
<P>
   And until the last 20 years, that is what most Americans got.
</P>
<P>
   From around 1979 to 1999, the richest Americans gained
enormously from a robust economy. Meanwhile, for middle class to
poor Americans, things got worse. Net income of the top fifth of
Americans increased by 38 percent, but the bottom fifth lost 5
percent of their incomes, when corrected for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, for example, the United States had 66 billionaires,
while 31.5 million Americans lived below the poverty line. In 1999,
the number of billionaires rose to 268, while 34.5 million people
lived in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the middle class continued to slide.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the median household, after adjusting for
inflation, had a net worth of $54,600. In 1997, according to the
latest available statistics, the median household had a net worth
of $49,900, a drop of almost $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why this occurred, Leondar-Wright said, ``It's no
mystery.'' In the 1980s and '90s, she said, the government pursued
a policy of supply-side economics, putting a lot more money into
the hands of the wealthy on the theory it would ``trickle down'' to
the rest of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part happened,'' she said. The policies put money in
the hands of major corporations and wealthy individuals. But the
second part, ``the `trickle down' part, never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, she said, the supply-side policy was more of
``a reward to major campaign contributors'' than sound economics.
</P>
<P>
   But as the millennium approaches, the government can begin to
change these policies to benefit the middle class and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it coul raise the minimum wage, as Democrats in
Congress are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government also needs to do something to directly give
people assets,'' she added, such as implementing
government-sponsored individual development accounts for low- and
middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The government can also get back into home building programs and
educational funding, to help give people a savings cushion,
something to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government needs, '' said Leondar-Wright, ``is the will to
do it.''

AT DIZZYING SPEED, OLD YIELDS TO NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we come to the end of the century and the decade, a great
deal is being written about how much the world has changed in the
last 100 years or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the stock market, what is remarkable is how
much has changed in just the past year. It is not an exaggeration
to say there has been a revolution, as a new order has overthrown
the old one with breathtaking speed. The barbarians are not just at
the gate. They are inside the palace.
</P>
<P>
   One need look no further than Massachusetts to prove the point.
Consider: At the end of the first quarter, less than nine months
ago, we published a list of the 10 Massachusetts public companies
with the greatest market value. The list had a lot of familiar
names.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette ranked first, as it had for most of the decade,
although it was already being challenged for the lead by EMC, the
data storage company in Hopinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list were Raytheon, Fleet Financial Group,
BankBoston, State Street, the retailer TJX, and Boston Scientific,
which makes medical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to today and take another look.
</P>
<P>
   EMC is number one, having left Gillette in the dust. EMC is
worth $98 billion, compared to $43 billion for Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   More amazing are the changes a little further down the list. In
fourth, fifth, and sixth place, respectively, are CMGI, Akamai
Technologies, and Sycamore Networks.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, of Andover, operates and invests in Internet companies. At
the end of March, its stock was worth $8.5 billion; today it is
worth $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai and Sycamore weren't even public companies in March.
Akamai, the Cambridge company whose technology eases bottlenecks on
the Internet, had its initial public offering in October; Sycamore,
a Chelmsford maker of telecommunications gear, went public in
October. Neither makes money. Neither has much in the way of sales.
Together, they have a market value of $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI loses money, too. In its most recent quarter, it reported a
loss of $117 million. Even so, CMGI's stock is worth nearly as much
as Fleet's. Fleet earned $430 million in the most recent quarter.
Fleet purchased BankBoston earlier this year, bringing the state's
fourth- and eighth-largest companies together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have no profits, you have no way to measure,'' says
Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Corp. ``There
simply isn't an established way of coming up with a value.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently have no such problem. They see great things
ahead for these companies. How else do you explain the astounding
market capitalizations?
</P>
<P>
   The traditional companies on our list _ those not fortunate
enough to be in the Internet business _ have not fared as well.
Nearly all of them have lost value since March. In some cases, the
losses have been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's value has gone from $65 billion to $43 billion;
Raytheon's from $33 billion to $9 billion. Boston Scientific was
$16 billion; now it's $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State Street went from $13 billion to $11 billion, Staples from
$15 billion to $9 billion, and TJX from $11 billion to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the new world, the winners win big _ and the losers lose big.
</P>
<P>
   ``The divergence between the haves and have-nots is as extreme
as it has ever been,'' says Thomas O'Neill, chief investment
officer at FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the momentum in the market feeds on itself. In
other words, the better tech stocks do, the more money they
attract. Conversely, the worse traditional stocks do, the faster
money flows out of them.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, O'Neill says, there has to be a day of reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies with strong franchises will get recognized,'' he
predicts. And those speculative enterprises that don't live up to
the hype? ``There will be some massive shakeouts,'' O'Neill saysd.
</P>
<P>
   When will this happen? Will it happen? Stay tuned.

   Breakaway Solutions, a Boston e-consulting firm, has become the
latest company to enter the venture capital business.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway says its new venture fund, Breakaway Capital LLC, will
invest primarily in the firm's clients, many of them emerging
dot.com businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way of aligning our goals with our customers,'' said
Gordon Brooks, chief executive. Breakaway was already working on
four deals, he said, none of which have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway also said it made an equity investment in Katalyst, a
Philadelphia company that provides management services to
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway had its initial public offering in October.

 LONGBOAT KEY, Fla.: ... Western Australia.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   --New Zealand _ You might paraphrase Gertrude Stein's acerbic
line about Oakland (``There's no there there'') and transpose it to
New Zealand as ``There's nobody there there.'' But it wouldn't be
uncomplimentary. Wherever you can find the slight-of-number and
widely distributed people who call themselves Kiwis, they will be
as welcoming as the lovely countryside and coastlines. North
Island, South Island _ it doesn't matter. NZ is just a relaxing
nice zone. You'll find any number of beaches filled with privacy.
Strip and dip. Matai Bay, a double horseshoe at the north end of
the north is my peach of a beach.
</P>
<P>
   --Italy's Feet-challenging Five _ Along Italy's Ligurian coast
in the northwest they lie: Cinque Terre (five lands). Although but
a few miles apart, these remote high-and-low mountain villages _ at
seaside, on crags _ seemed five different, almost inaccessible
countries in the Middle Ages when they could be reached only by
boat or scaling steep, twisty paths. Now a train connects
Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso with
each other and the nearest city, Levanto. The right idea is to do
one of them per day. But, of course, friend Aurelio, whose family
tree undoubtedly harbored mountain goats, insisted we de-train at
Riomaggiore and clamber, clomp, and cloud-bust through all five in
a 12-mile, 10-hour strain back to Levanto.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived that recital, Murray the Wrench exclaims,
disappointed, ``You didn't mention Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the next century, or the next life,'' I reply about
the town that Doug Flutie made semifamous. And recalling that a
runaway, the artist Jeremiah Goodman, has described it as ``a place
where both sides of the tracks are the wrong side.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the season of good will to most, and I shouldn't let
another 60 years go by before dropping in on Buffalo again to
devour a singular roast beef sandwich at Charlie the Butcher's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love buffalo,'' cries Aurelio. ``But I mean the East African
kind. Meanest of African critters. Good to shoot _ but with a
camera. Not a gun,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, ever the gallant, says she deserves equal time for her
century's dozen-to-die-for. Absolutely. Aurelio's choices:
</P>
<P>
   --Tibet and Nepal _ ``A gorgeous mountainous journey over land,
by vehicle and foot, through primitive, sparsely inhabited country,
past silent, virginal peaks from Lhasa through Shigatse to
Katmandu, included an Everest trek up the Tibetan north face to
Base Camp I. But a strip search at the Tibet border by obnoxious
Chinese guards _ crude, bored guys amusing themselves _ did not
endear the People's Republic to me.''
</P>
<P>
   --Cambodia _ ``Angkor Wat is truly magnificent, haunting, but I
was charmed by a neighborhood gem, Ta Prohm, a small temple
fighting for its existence against rogue invaders _ persistent
strangler fig trees. They are locked in a timeless grapple.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula _ ``Dramatic Uxmal, an 8th- century
Mayan city sequestered in deep jungle. What I relished _of course _
was climbing the steep-sided pyramid on precipitous steps. The
nearby city, Chichen Itza, is wonderful, too, with its deep well
into which virgins were dropped as sacrifices to the gods. I left
before the custom was revived.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mount Kilimanjaro _ ``Tanzania's attic, the highest mountain
in Africa (19,340 feet) is a sturdy climb made by many. However,
few go beyond Gilman's Point, the rim of the crater. The summit,
Uhuru Peak, is another mile and a half and 700 feet in altitude
farther. That's the hard part. I kept remembering David Breashears,
the mountaineer, counseling me, `You'll be mad at yourself if you
get as close as Gilman's and don't go all the way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Great Barrier Island _ ``An unspoiled New Zealand dot 50 miles
from Auckland. It has everything for a getaway: sensational
beaches, mountains, bush walks, views, hot springs. Not many
people. No electricity or running water, but there are generators,
rain-catchers, and limited places to stay. It has my favorite
airport of all at Claris. The terminal is a shack, the landing
strip grass. You just walk to the plane and get on. What a soothing
departure from the huge malls-with-runways and lines of passengers
we encounter in most cities.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tasmania _ ``Australia's almost-forgotten island state. Plenty
of wilderness. Endless untrammeled beaches from which penguins
march to their maritime dining rooms. Hobart, a bottom-of-the-world
city, is up high in friendliness, restaurants, nice places to hang
out, and a mountain called Wellington.''
</P>
<P>
   --Rome _ ``OK, so it's old and decrepit. It has been for
millennia. But you can't beat experience. That's what Rome's got _
and it's a wondrous experience to experience that experience,
wrapped in so much history. Regardless of how many times you visit,
there's always something new to the eyes of a walking explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   --Monument Valley, Utah _ ``The Western movie couldn't exist
without this monumental cowboys-and-Indians desert playground of
pinnacles, peaks, mesas, boulders, sagebrush, cactus. You've seen
it innumerable times on the screen, but . . . surrounded by it . .
. you're as overwhelmed as John Wayne by Claire Trevor in the
original `Stagecoach.' Sunrise and sunset, enlivening the rock
formations, are dramas of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ha Long Bay, Vietnam _ ``Off Haiphong, this stretch of sea is
punctured by rocky cones, magical uninhabited islands that seem
sculpted by angels, each different and beguiling. These sights
required a long boat trip and a night on Cat Ba island at a hotel
unbeatable in its standards of grunginess _ but worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tanzanian camping _ ``Too bad they don't allow overnights at
Ngorongoro Crater anymore. We were lucky to tent there in '88 as
elephants, lions, zebras, and tree hyrax wandered about us in the
moonlight. On the same trip, the Serengeti Plain, a majestic herd
of 70 elephants emerged from a grove of acacias to hospitably
parade for us, not even prompted by the local chamber of
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   --New Mexican pueblos _ ``The Indians have tried to preserve a
distinguished culture, and it hasn't been easy. To me the seasonal
dances are very spiritual. Especially the Corn Dance _ in the hope
of a good harvest _ at Santo Domingo Pueblo, not far from Santa Fe.
As a girl I danced with the tribe there, and I cherish the memories
of the ritual beneath vast skies and continents of clouds. An
outsider wouldn't be permitted to participate now, other than as a
spectator, but we were neighbors and my father was a friend of
tribal leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   --Angel Falls _ ``It's a heavenly spigot all right. Except for
rain, no water drops straight down from higher, about 3,000 feet
into a Venezuelan jungle. You can get up close in a small plane as
we did. But most of my Venezuelan time in the Peace Corps was spent
in Caracas where home-sweet-homes for way too many folks were
wooden crates in the barrio.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray says, ``My room is an improvement on that. I think we're
pretty lucky to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   And then some. To be anywhere. You might agree with the
philosophy of Boston's own Teddy Green, the renowned (unauthorized)
withdrawer of bank funds, who used to say, ``A room is a room is a
room.'' Of course, most of his had bars on windows and doors at
stopovers like Alcatraz.
</P>
<P>
   As hotel-roomers most of the time over the years, Aurelio and I
have gone the A-to-Z route _ admirable to zany _ and she has a
``fond memories'' half-dozen: the Lake Palace in Udaipur, India;
Hayman Island Resort, Australia; the Cavallieri Hilton in Rome; the
Oriental in Bangkok; San Domenico in Taormina, Sicily;
Hilton-on-the-Park in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Situated on its own small island in the lake, built around a
lush garden, the Lake Palace R _ for romantic _ great,'' she says.
``Hayman has everything _ beaches, pools, six fine restaurants,
wilderness, access to the Great Barrier Reef. On a hilltop, the
Cavallieri gives you bustling Rome at your feet, but in a relaxed
atmosphere. Its swimming pools, indoor and outdoor, are splendid,
the spa fit for the most sybaritic Roman emperor. Longtime staff
members like Grace Rettondini and Lynn Knudsen, concierge Italo
Fort, doormen Antonio Franitto and Salvatore Mirarchi greet you
like old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the string quartet in the lobby to service supreme, plus
the vista of frenetic river traffic, the Oriental is a dream. San
Domenico, a tastefully restored ancient monastery, is chaperoned by
Mount Etna, the Aegean Sea, and elaborate gardens. Aussie good
spirit abounds at that Hilton where Anita Gromotka oversees a new
world-class spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also-likes include: Sails in the Desert at Ayers Rock,
Australia; the Rittenhouse in Philadelphia; the Hyatt in
Birmingham, England; the Metropoles in Moscow and Hanoi; Dolphin
Square in London; Prince de Galles in Paris; Marina Cay in the
British Virgins; Silver Sands on Key Biscayne, Fla.; Four Seasons
in Seattle; UN Plaza (for its pool) in New York; Boca Raton (Fla.)
Resort and Club; the Peninsula in Hong Kong; Norma and Des Fallon's
Queensland Outback ranch, Avington, south of Barcaldine, Australia
_ no jollier B &AMP; B hosts could be found.''
</P>
<P>
   And the zany? The prize goes to the Colonial Motel in Gallup,
N.M., where a bold burglar crawled in through the bathroom window
at 2 a.m., scared us awake, then fled through the door clutching
his prize _ my toothbrush. No reward has been offered.
</P>
<P>
   Murray wants to know, ``Do you people ever go home to Boston?''
</P>
<P>
   We visit. ``You should try it. It's a marvelous city,'' says
Aurelio. ``Both of us are immigrants from way west of Dedham, but,
having lived in The Bean for several decades, we may yet be
approved by Mayor Mennino for green cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston brings music to our ears like no other city _ the
outpourings of classical and jazz on Stations WHRB, WGBH, WBUR,
WHRB. On the road we miss all-rounder Ron Della Chiesa with his
``Morning Classics'' and ``Jazz Song Book'' on WGBH where the
brilliant piano player, Virginia Eskin, hosts ``A Note to You'' on
Sundays (although at 6 a.m.! Are programmers trying to hide Eskin
out in Whitey Bulger style?)
</P>
<P>
   We were fortunate to catch John Williams's composition ``For
Seiji,'' his tribute to Maestro Ozawa's silver anniversary at the
helm of Seiji's Big Band (a.k.a. the Boston Symphony Orchestra).
The same afternoon, Ozawa conducted Richard Strauss's ``Death and
Transfiguration'' so movingly that it made death seem appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The death of a year, a century and a millennium are coming up as
we are about to be transfigured into . . . what? For you, cherished
reader, we wish Holiday Huzzahs, egg nog (straight or enhanced to
your taste), laughs, good health, and avoidance of the Y2Kukoo bug
anywhere you go, as well as those ghastly unmentionable automated
phone systems on which a human voice is as rare as a lovable robot.
</P>
<P>
   Whether millennial malaise or merriment awaits, the advice here
is to close your eyes, hold your nose, say a prayer, and take the
21st-century plunge.
</P>
<P>
   See you anywhere.

ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Dear Santa, 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, I know it's been a long time. How's it goin'? Are
you taking a hit from the Internet shopping boom? I wouldn't worry
too much about it _ at least you know your deliveries will be there
Christmas morning. As for me, I think it's been about 30 or so
years since I last dropped you a line, and if I remember correctly,
I wanted a basketball, right?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's been a pretty good year, and I've already gotten a
number of things I wanted such cancellation of ABC's
``Wasteland''; a host of smart, challenging and provocative films
like ``American Beauty,'' ``Being John Malkovich,'' ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' and ``Election''; a new Nine Inch Nails album, ``The
Fragile''; and a two-year break from performing by Celine Dion.
But, of course, there are a few more wouldn't mind finding under my
tree come Christmas. So, here's my wish list:
</P>
<P>
   --After the failures this decade of dramas with predominately
African-American casts such as Fox's ``413 Hope St.'' and ``South
Central,'' ABC's ``Gabriel's Fire,'' and CBS's ``Under One Roof,''
pleasepleaseplease let CBS's upcoming new hospital drama, ``City of
Angels,'' which premieres Jan. 16, be not only good, but
successful.
</P>
<P>
   --Better sales for Macy Gray's ``On How Life Is,'' Mos Def's
``Black on Both Sides,'' Me'Shell Ndegeocello's ``Bitter,'' and
Fiona Apple's ``When the Pawn. . .''
</P>
<P>
   --Fifty more years of ``Peanuts'' and Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   --Movie trailers that can entice an audience without revealing
every single plot twist.
</P>
<P>
   --No more posthumous albums ``by'' Notorious B.I.G., like the
dreadful ``Born Again,'' which is little more than a crazy quilt of
Biggie rhymes and snippets sewn onto beats and guest-star turns.
Hey Puff, stop rolling Biggie's corpse in hopes that a few more
coins will fall out of his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   --A steel-cage, no-holds-barred, pay-per-view beatdown between
singer/actress/occasional nuisance/Kurt Cobain widow Courtney Love
and Dave Grohl, current Foo Fighter and former Nirvana drummer. The
marvelous catfighting between these two _ La Love recently lit
Grohl up on ``The Howard Stern Show,'' and ``Stacked Actors'' on
the Foos' latest is rumored to be a shot at Courtney _ is just
endlessly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   --An end to lousy ``time-slot'' hits like NBC's ``Jessie'' and
``Stark Raving Mad,'' which succeed simply because they reside in
the comfy cushion between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier,'' and
``Frasier'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   --If the Latin pop trend is to be believed, then how about major
crossover success and full star treatment for the great Celia Cruz
or the Afro-Cuban All-Stars?
</P>
<P>
   --An Academy Award nominating committee that does not follow the
miscue of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the Golden Globe
people) in overlooking the wonderful performance of Wes Bentley in
``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   --Jewel to stick to her folkie-yodeling thing (such as it is),
and write books of poetry _ like the ridiculous and embarassing ``A
Night Without Armor'' _ no more.
</P>
<P>
   --Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit to finally acknowledge that
performing ``Break Stuff'' before the increasingly volatile throngs
at Woodstock '99 last summer was a remarkably stupid thing to do.
Like, dude, what were you thinking?
</P>
<P>
   --No more Woodstocks. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   And, come to think of it, I never did get that basketball.

A SKI GUARANTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will it snow on Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   While the kids may be concerned that Santa won't arrive unless
his sleigh has snow to ride on, skiers have no concerns. At least
skiers who head for six of New England's top areas this holiday
season. They're guaranteed snow if they reserve a ski vacation
between now and Dec. 24 for the period Dec. 25-Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have snow,'' says Les Otten, American Skiing Co. chief
executive officer. ``Our resorts have the most advanced snowmaking
systems in the nation, and we expect to be wide open. But if we
can't give our guests at least 70 percent of their mountain, we'll
activate our guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The guarantee gives guests a 25 percent price reduction on their
next vacation this season and a voucher worth up to $500, which may
be used toward a future ski vacation at The Canyons in Utah or
Steamboat in Colorado. And, guests who choose to may cancel
reservations at no cost on the planned day of arrival if that
threshold has not been met.
</P>
<P>
   The resorts with the guarantee are Killington, Mount Snow, and
Sugarbush in Vermont; Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine; and
Attitash Bear Peak in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And, in addtion to snow, Otten says the resorts will have lots
of other activities as well as festive New Year's Eve parties for
all ages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One big hug
</P>
<P>
   What better way to bring in the new century than one giant
festive hug of people from many nations around the Dead Sea, the
lowest place on earth? The Millennium Great Embrace on New Year's
Eve is a communal effort by the State of Israel, the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. Its purpose is to
be a ``universal declaration of dedication to peace and the
conservation of nature for children,'' said Arie Sommer, Israel
commissioner for tourism in North America. More than 100,000 people
of all ages are expected to join hands around the sea.
</P>

   Snow train
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Bay Railroad Enthusiasts will be running their
annual Snow Train to Vermont Feb. 26. The one-day trip will leave
from Boston and continue to Brattleboro and Bellows Falls. Optional
side trips include a sleigh ride, country inn luncheon, covered
bridge tour, and a 26-mile round-trip ride on the Green Mountain
Railroad. Fares are $70 adult, $40 children 12 and under. Stops
will also be made at Wellesley, West Natick, and Worcester. For
more information, call 617-489-5277 or www.Massbayrre.org.

<P>
   Need a nanny?
</P>
<P>
   Families visiting Aruba can now have the services of a nanny.
The Aruba Sonesta has begun an ``Island Nanny Program'' that
provides a nanny for the duration of the family's stay. The service
costs $120 a day from 8 a.m. to midnight for two children. For
information on the nanny program, call Coleta Zschuschen at
011-2978-36000. For reservations, call 800-SONESTA.

BOSTON GETS ITS JOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas was once banned in Massachusetts and didn't become a
legal holiday in the state until 1856. My, how times have changed:
Nowadays, Massachusetts _ and especially Boston _ is filled with
fa-la-la. And those who take Boston's Holly Jolly Holiday Trolley
Tour not only view the glory of the city at Christmas but learn a
lot about the holiday as well. Among the fascinating facts:
</P>
<P>
   --Charles Dickens gave the first reading of ``A Christmas
Carol'' in the United States at Tremont Temple in 1867, performing
all the parts in different voices. (These days the marvelous
musical ``Black Nativity'' is presented at the temple during the
holiday season.)
</P>
<P>
   --The city's two principal Christmas trees are gifts. The Boston
Common tree is from the children of New Brunswick, and the tree at
the Prudential Center is from the people of Nova Scotia. Decorating
the Pru tree, incidentally, takes more than 3,200 hours to hang 4.5
miles of wire and 17,000 lights.
</P>
<P>
   --America's first Christmas cards originated in Boston in 1874.
</P>

PUT ON THE RITZ AT MY PLACE

   News bulletin: Florida couple pays $100,000 for the Boston
Ritz-Carlton ``Ultimate Millennium Experience'' package on New
Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That thrilling rumor being celebrated in Boston society circles
this holiday season is absolutely true. I've decided to rent out my
apartment for New Year's Eve, and it promises to be a weekend that
my lucky guests will not soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know what you're thinking. The unabashed elegance, the
exotic fabrics, the European-trained staff, the vintage wines _ how
can we, the public, ever afford to take such a place of honor in
your cherished home?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the short answer is, you probably can't.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who can, be assured that no expense will be
spared, no detail overlooked, no luxury stinted in an attempt to
make this the most resplendent weekend of your important lives. And
allow me to earn your trust. Never, ever, would I gouge on prices
amid all this crass and commercial millennial hype, even among you
tardy last-minute party planners. Not me.
</P>
<P>
   What's the competition? This Ritz-Carlton ``Ultimate Millennium
Experience?'' Ultimate schmultimate. That hotel hasn't been
renovated in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   And their package, which is already booked, barely goes beyond
the usual fare, with the typical chauffeur-driven Jaguar, a few
nights in the presidential suite with a butler, a magnum of
Taittinger champagne and couple of Baccarat crystal flutes,
matching Bulgari watches, Bulgari perfume. Remember, Bulgari rhymes
with vulgarity, almost.
</P>
<P>
   And, ho-hum, you get dinner in their wine cellar, breakfast in
bed and entry to their so-called New Year's Eve party, where blue
hair suddenly looks like a fashion trend.
</P>
<P>
   And their point is?
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine yourself sashaying into the inviting environs of my
one-bedroom apartment. Set the thermostat at whatever temperature
you'd like. Help yourself to the holiday M&AMP;Ms piled high in a
festive Crate &AMP; Barrel bowl. Walk the dog as often as you desire,
and feel free to give him his anti-itch pills precisely at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Choose from hand-selected wines in both red and white. Kick your
feet up on the genuine wooden coffee table and partake in your
favorite television show (use of remote control included). Sprawl
out on the recently laundered sheets of my double bed.
</P>
<P>
   Staff? My Aunt Nanny will iron your tails and gowns for the
enchanting evening ahead. My nephew waits outside in his 1993 Dodge
Caravan, ready to whisk you as far as your imagination might go,
provided he has enough gas.
</P>
<P>
   And I am personally at your beck and call, available and eager
to tend to your every need, whether it be pushing my soiled clothes
into the corner of a closet or helping you unclog the stubborn
bathtub drain. If I've fallen asleep on the couch, I encourage
guests to show no hesitation whatsoever in waking me up. Just be
warned that on rare occasions I've been heard to shout nonviolent
obscenities in my sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts? Make liberal use of the Old Spice cologne left on the
bathroom vanity. Lather yourself in an array of Ivory soaps and
Breck shampoos. Wrap your cleansed body in the softened warmth of a
cotton-poly blend towel.
</P>
<P>
   And as you leave, as a memento of the times past and the
wondrous stories you'll carry ahead, take a keepsake glass ashtray
engraved with the words, ``Days Inn/Hartsfield Airport.'' These are
the memories that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And dinner will bring your millennial experience to an entirely
different level, which in this case is actually the basement, where
you will dine on a genuine white tablecloth in a setting
reminiscent of the Ritz wine cellar. Notice, for instance, all the
pretty bottles in the nearby recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
   Choose from an array of Asian delicacies from the menu of a
local Chinese take-out restaurant, all as my friend, Eduardo,
thrills you with your favorite polkas mastered on his accordion.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, for the special enjoyment of our guests, we've
arranged for a massive, complimentary fireworks display over Boston
Harbor at the stroke of midnight. Kindly tell the uniformed police
officers that you're the guest of honor and they'll no doubt leave
you to your personal joy.
</P>
<P>
   And all this, ladies and gentlemen, for exactly half the price
of that Ritz package. Yes, you read that right. No gouging here,
not like all those other establishments in town that charge so much
for so little. And the leftover Chinese food? It's yours to go.

BRUSH UP YOUR BIBLE, START QUOTING IT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential candidates have decided not to hide their light
under a bushel this campaign season. They're letting their light
shine before men, playing the faith card, though how far they'll go
in applying the Golden Rule to their rivals remains to be seen. But
the rhetoric bears watching, and not just on grounds of
appropriateness and sincerity. When it comes to misquotation and
misapprehension, the Bible is probably running neck and neck with
poor Shakespeare, and we want to hold would-be leaders to a high
rhetorical standard.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's true, misquotation is a venial sin: Shakespeare
wrote ``To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,'' but it's usually
condensed to ``gild the lily''; Churchill spoke of ``blood, toil,
tears, and sweat,'' but we like it better as ``blood, sweat, and
tears.'' The biblical proverb says ``Pride goeth before
destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall''; in popular use,
it's ``Pride goeth before a fall.'' But these modifications remain
true to the spirit, if not the letter, of the originals.
</P>
<P>
   Our collective editing is not always so benign, though. Reader
Eric Naticchioni of Chelmsford, for one, is mightily vexed by the
common misusage of the Bible's ``suffer the children'' as if it
meant ``the children are suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   As Naticchioni notes, the biblical scene _ he quotes from the
King James version, Mark 10:13-16 _ has the disciples trying to
keep visiting children away from Jesus. ``But when Jesus saw it, he
was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
God.'' ``Suffer'' here means simply ``allow,'' and though that
meaning is now called archaic, it was in use a mere century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The worst offenders in the ``suffer'' department are not
reporters, in fact, but headline writers, who can't resist slapping
``Suffer the children'' onto editorials about families in poverty
or feature stories about child abuse. These headlines (and the Pat
Benatar song title, too) are all misquotations _ though the writers
may not know they're quotations at all. I suspect some of the perps
do know their rendering is wrong, but think readers don't care; Mr.
Naticchioni is here to testify that they do care, and so should
editors.
</P>
<P>
   None of the presidential candidates is likely to quote ``Money
is the root of all evil,'' but if John McCain ventures onto that
ground _ with ``Soft money is the root of all evil,'' say _ the
opposition's defense is the correct quotation: ``Love of money is
the root of all evil.'' After all, even a guy who's filthy rich can
deny that he actually loves the loot _ except, maybe, Donald Trump,
who revels in the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But ``filthy rich'' may be an inappropriate description of The
Donald, with his hygiene obsession; he should be appealing to the
cleanliness-is-next-to-godliness constituency. Would he be
surprised _ and would they _ to learn that the maxim comes from a
sermon by that pillar of Protestantism, John Wesley? And that he
borrowed it not from the Bible, but from the Talmud?
</P>
<P>
   As for that Golden Rule _ ``Do unto others as you would have
others do unto you'' _ it doesn't appear in the Bible in that form,
either; it's a distillation of Jesus' words from two of the
gospels. (The similar sentiment, ``Love thy neighbor as thyself,''
appears first as an Old Testament injunction.) And ``God helps
those who help themselves'' is no more biblical than ``Win one for
the Gipper''; it's from Aesop, though his gods were plural.
</P>
<P>
   God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb? Perhaps, but not in the
Bible. The English novelist Laurence Sterne stole it from a
16th-century French version. And that lamb isn't lying down with
the lion to keep warm, either. In the original, full-length
version, Isaiah's vision is that ``The wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf
and the young lion and the fatling together.'' But the lion and the
lamb make a natural alliterative pair, and a much more reassuring
image for a holid. (Here too, folklore has trumped fact; a
lion is far more dangerous than a wolf, but try telling that to
Little Red Riding Hood.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as we watch the ``Peanuts'' gang stage its final
Christmas pageant, here's a timely tidbit: The Bible doesn't tell
us that there were three kings, or wise men, who came to Bethlehem
from the East _ only that they brought three kinds of gifts. For
all we know there were two dozen, wise enough to pool their
resources for a gift basket of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. But
ignorance, in this case, may be bliss: ``We 14 kings of Orient
are'' just wouldn't have the same ring, would it?

COSMIC FORCES CREATE A SOLSTICE WORTH CELEBRATING

<P>
   Put aside millennial madness for a moment. For a year-end event
with a little cosmic clout, consider Wednesday, the first day of
winter, coincides with a full moon and the lunar perigee, the point
at which the moon's orbit is closest to the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the moon is approaching its nearest point to the
sun, all of which adds up to a somewhat rare confluence of cosmic
events. Though you may not even notice it, the full moon will be a
little larger and a little brighter than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Where skies are clear and there is snow and ice on the ground
the effect could be quite magical. Given this celestial setting,
new age devotees have been planning celebration rituals for months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, professional astronomers are not particularly excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solstice, the full moon, and the lunar perigee all occur
within a few hours of each other. So what?'' says Brian Marsden,
director of the planetary science division of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center of Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
``The moon is always high and bright in December and January.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers generally find full moons boring, Marsden says.
``You can't see the stars well or tell what's happening on the dark
side of the moon,'' he explains. ``Full moon nights are good ones
for astronomers to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   But astrologers, neo-pagans, Wiccans, and practioners of Native
American shamanism attach a great deal of importance to all full
moons and changes of season. `
</P>
<P>
   `The moon mythically represents our unconsciousness, and a full
moon on the solstice at the end of the century is very
significant,'' says Karen Thorne of Lincoln, Mass., a professional
astrologer.``I don't think that there will be any one dramatic
occurrence, but there could be profound changes in our collective
unconsciousness that will bring new insights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pagan and Wiccan spirituality is earth-centered and its
holidays correspond with changes in the environment,'' explains
Chistopher Giroux, manager of the Unicorn Bookstore in Arlington,
Mass., which specializes in new age literature and serves as a
resource center for the local neo-pagan community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate the winter solstice as `Yule,' the rebirth of the
sun. The summer solstice and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are
also holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   The winter solstice, when the sun is farthest south of the
celestial equator, falls on the shortest day of the year. But it
won't seem very short to Cheryl Masson of Rehoboth, Mass., a
priestess in the Church of Wicca and chairwoman of the Witches
League for Public Awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very long day,'' says Masson. Beside the
customary Wiccan rituals associated with a full moon and solstice,
Masson says, she will participate in the dedication of the site of
a new temple for the congregation she has cofounded in Dighton with
Laurie Cabot of Salem, Mass., dean of the area's self-declared
witches.
</P>
<P>
   Masson is also a local coordinator for ``Goddess 2000,'' an
international project involving Wiccan and neo-pagan groups all
over the United States and in 32 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witches and others will gather around the world to celebrate
the solstice,'' Masson says, but also ``to focus their energy to
create awareness in the coming millennium of what we call `the
goddess,' the feminine element of the universal life force.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this year the solstice falls midweek, many new age
organizations held combination ritual and social events over the
weekend; members will observe the actual seasonal change on their
own. ``We had a Yule celebration, with a ritual circle, at the
bookstore on Saturday and a couple of dozen people took part,''
says Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   Many pagans and Wiccans also prefer to keep a low profile and
observe their holidays in the privacy of their homes. ``The winter
solstice is an important holiday but my husband and I are solitary
practitioners of Wicca,'' says Lynn Dube of Haverill, Mass. ``We'll
just have a little party, light candles, and maybe do something a
bit special in the way of ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   The big moon solstice has also touched off a buzz on the
Internet: exchanges of e-mail messages and electronic chain
letters. Many people were first alerted to the event by a
hyperbolic Old Farmer's Almanac article, which even speculated
wildly that the moon could get so bright ``even your car's
headlights may seem superfluous.''
</P>
<P>
   Be advised, say scientists and highway safety experts: The moon
never gets so bright that it's safe to turn car headlights off at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Marsden says that what is of rare note is that the three events
_ the winter solstice, the perigee, and the full moon _ take place
in such quick succession this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1866, the solstice, full moon, and lunar perigee occurred
over 20 hours,'' he says. ``But this time it will be over 10 hours,
with the solstice at 12:42 p.m., the perigee at 4 p.m., and the
full moon at 10:32 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you could say,'' Marsden adds, ``that ours will be even
better than the last one.''

 &HT;    (Vincent de Liberto is a freelance writer based in New York.)
 &HT;    
 By VINCENT de LIBERTO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Nearly 40 years ago I passed my first Christmas in Germany as a
19-year-old American soldier. I had arrived at a small U.S. Army
base outside the town of Herzogenaurach, so deep in the snowbound
month of December that I lacked an immediate duty assignment.
Luckily, I received a surprise 24-hour-pass to Christmas Eve.
 &HT;    I joined some other green-uniformed soldiers and we boarded the
regular military bus heading off base to explore the nearest big
city--Nuremberg.
 &HT;    We had seen a USO brochure describing Nuremberg as Germany's No.
l Christmas city. Nuremberg of the infamous war-crimes trials, the
Hitler rallies, the racial laws--Nuremberg, the setting of the Nazi
propaganda film, ``Triumph of the Will.''
 &HT;    Our bus stopped at the very Nuremberg streetcorner I would
recognize years later in the film, ``Judgment at Nuremberg.''
 &HT;    I paired up with an army pal and we headed for the Altstadt, or
Old City, the walled medieval center surmounted by a castle on a
hill.
 &HT;    First, of course, we made sure to stop in one, two, or
three--and probably four--Stammlokals (or taverns) along the way;
we needed to test the local Franconian brews.
 &HT;    I knew something of Nuremberg's notorious history under the
Nazis -- I had seen the 1930s newsreels of torchlit Nazi rallies in
the Altstadt. Allied bombers later flattened the half-timbered
medieval center. In 1945, in a single night, 600 bombers rained
down tons of explosives, killed thousands and rendered tens of
thousands homeless.
 &HT;    We finally made our way into the Altstadt, behind the restored
medieval walls, and found the Hauptmarkt, or central market square.
 &HT;    For hundreds of years, each Christmas season the market square
has hosted the Christkindelsmarkt, or Christchild Market.
Nurembergers set up dozens of booths and stalls--festooned with
strings of lights--and sell regional handicrafts, dolls, puppets
and tin soldiers.
 &HT;    We caught a smokey whiff of a foodstand offering Nuremberger
specialties--warm pretzels and sizzling sausages. Immediately, we
reached for the Nuremberger pretzels that go so well with the
Franconian brews, then the small, dark, sizzling bratwursts, served
up with steamy scoops of onions on a hard roll. And there was
Schnapps, of course.
 &HT;    Suitably fortified against the biting night air, we moved
through the market throngs to the Shoenerbrunner, or Beautiful
Fountain, a medieval masterwork. We found the fabled brass ring
hand-wrought seamlessly into the iron grillwork, spun it, but could
not work it loose. We greeted sparkling frauleins in the spirit of
the season as they passed us by.
 &HT;    By now, it had surprised me to see no signs of war damage. In
Frankfurt, our embarkation point into West Germany, lingering
damage was still evident in bombed-out ruins in side streets. Now,
in Nuremberg, in the heart of the most heavily bombed city in West
Germany, singled out for special attention as a Nazi symbol of
rancor and exterminationist hatred of the Jews, the Altstadt
seemingly had risen to a new life to celebrate the birthday of
Christ.
 &HT;    As commercial activity began to slow in the Christkindelsmarkt,
the crowds were moving toward the Frauenkirche, or Our Lady's
Church. It too had risen from the ashes of destruction -- postcards
on sale in local shops showed it as a smoldering ruin in 1945. Now,
the doors were flung open to a Christmas service under way.
 &HT;    A celestial melody floated out into the market square,
accompanied by angelic voices. It was ``Silent Night,'' but it took
me a moment to catch on to the original German lyrics, ``Stille
Nacht, Heilige Nacht.'' They floated in the night air like a balm
to soothe my private images of World War II destruction.
 &HT;    In 1960 the German language was mainly familiar to me through
the filter of World War II movies--''Achtung!'', ``Jawohl!'' or
``Heil Hitler!'' Now I heard it renedered beautifully in a
Christmas night, and I went on in later years to memorize the
German lyrics, preferring them to the English.
 &HT;    In fact, I started to collect them in the languages of countries
where I would pass the holidays in the ensuing decades--France,
Spain, the Netherlands.
 &HT;    I recently managed to revisit Herzogenaurach and Nuremberg. I
did so through the magical transport of the Internet and the World
Wide Web. I glimpsed this year's Christkindelsmarkt by ``live
cam.'' And my cyberspace visit sparked the memory of my 1960
footsoldier's tour and the deathless tones of ``Stille Nacht,
Heilige Nacht'' soaring in that frigid market square that had once
been smashed into ruins.
 &HT;    Later, I focused my Web search engine on ``Silent Night.'' To my
surprise, the master site was not in Germany or Austria but in
South Africa. The Web page (http://silentnight.web.za/) collects a
hundred translations of Silent Night in a hundred languages,
literally from A to Z--including versions in American Sign Language
and Delaware Indian.
 &HT;    Then again, maybe it is fitting that we should find ``Silent
Night's'' healing words featured in South Africa--a country that
has also known more than its fair share of rancor and racial hatred
in this century. So this 1999 season the Afrikaner sings, ``Stille
nag, heilige nag''--and the Zulu, ``Busuku obuhle.''
 &HT;    The Christmas carol that conquered the world.

   TOKYO _ Put a pair of chopsticks between your teeth, and bite
down. The corners of your mouth should rise above the horizontal
line of the chopsticks. No? Then you need some smile therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshihiko Kadokawa is happy to help out. With his company, the
Smile Amenity Institute, and his book, ``The Power of the Smile,''
he has a tidy little business going teaching the Japanese how to
grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to always keep the mouth up, it creates a good
face,'' Kadokawa said. And it is a lesson many Japanese badly need,
added the smile specialist, who bemoans his people's lack of facial
expressiveness.

a good face to attract customers, Kadokawa has more work than he
can do teaching eye contact, cheek movement, and how to massage the
face to give it a softer, more pleasant expression.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, putting on a good face in Japan meant doing
nothing at all. For centuries, the face has been a social mask more
than a tool for individual expression. Even talking about it was
considered taboo.
</P>
<P>
   But like so much in Japan these days, much of the old way of
life is being flipped on its head _ including the face.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, whether it is a raised eyebrow or muscular control,
facial expression is the subject of books, academic study,
television shows, and a museum exhibition touring the country.
Scientists, business executives, and ordinary Japanese are deciding
that despite all the communication tools at their disposal _ from
the Internet to mobile phones _ the face has an important role to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese predisposition to keep a blank face does not suit
the modern world, said Hiroshi Harashima, director of the Academy
of Facial Studies in Tokyo, whose 700 members include
psychologists, cosmetologists, physiologists, anthropologists, and
forensic scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of expression is changing because of
international society. It is important not to be misunderstood,''
said Harashima, an engineer who founded the academy, which is said
to be the only one of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Harashima became interested in the face in the 1980s when
videophones began to be developed. He began working on computer
techniques to alter facial expressions and make faces more
pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   The academy helped sponsor a popular interactive museum show
called Dai-Kao-Ten (Big Face Exhibition) to which hundreds of
thousands are flocking.
</P>
<P>
   During the show's run in Tokyo, more than 300,000 people crowded
the National Science Museum to ponder the faces of celebrities,
politicians, historical figures, even animals. How to read the
face, and how emotions of surprise and disgust are registered _
these are just some of the issues the exhibit explores.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the exhibition interactive, visitors can examine
and remold their faces with odd-angled mirrors and computer
simulations.
</P>
<P>
   Susumu Kiyoko and his wife said they came away from the exhibit
realizing that the face is more than just a social tool. It can
affect how you feel about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep an angry face, it can make you angry. I don't want
that to happen so I have to be careful to keep smiling,'' said
Kiyoko, a 51-year-old dollmaker.
</P>
<P>
   After watching exhibits on how to control eye muscles, one young
man positioned himself in front of a large round mirror to learn to
raise one eyebrow. He got nowhere at first, but he was determined
to practice until he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to create a more vivid facial expression, I want to
make it funnier, so it's an enjoyable face,'' said Tsuyoshi Nakano,
32, a computer software programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Countless Japanese expressions reflect the era when any kind of
exaggerated movement of the face was considered unseemly and the
ideal was a mask-like face, from ``The face cannot be seen'' to one
that pretty much declares that smiling or any lively expression a
no-no: ``Man moves only half a cheek in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nakano balked at the suggestion that Japanese have little or
no facial expression. ``We do have our own, it's just that our
movements are tiny and small, so foreigners don't see it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The best illustration of the subtlety _ not to say immobility _
of Japanese facial expressions is the stylized tradition of Noh
theater, which features actors wearing painted masks. Changes in
emotion are conveyed by the slightest movements of the head.
Tilting the face forward conveys sadness; tilting it slightly
upward signals a more desperate anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologist Yakinari Kohara said there are physical reasons
for the slight facial expressions of the Japanese. Kohara, who has
studied the faces of Americans, Japanese, and the Ainu, Japan's
indigenous population, found that the Japanese find it very hard to
wink. That in turn means less eye motion, and eye mobility is what
gives the face its greatest expression, says Kohara.
</P>
<P>
   While there are both physical and cultural reasons for the
Japanese penchant for impassive faces, Kohara said that over the
years, Japanese have developed a more expressive facial repertoire.
Kohara, a 70-year-old with a wide grin and crinkly cheeks, said he
is very happy about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to feel tight inside because I couldn't show my
emotions. But now it's OK, and I feel as if I've been released
somehow,'' he said laughing, his mouth open wide enough to show his
fillings.

THE CHRISTMAS CAROL THAT CONQUERED THE WORLD

 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Vincent de Liberto is a freelance writer based in New York.)
 &HT;    
 By VINCENT de LIBERTO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Nearly 40 years ago I passed my first Christmas in Germany as a
19-year-old American soldier. I had arrived at a small U.S. Army
base outside the town of Herzogenaurach, so deep in the snowbound
month of December that I lacked an immediate duty assignment.
Luckily, I received a surprise 24-hour-pass to Christmas Eve.
 &HT;    I joined some other green-uniformed soldiers and we boarded the
regular military bus heading off base to explore the nearest big
city--Nuremberg.
 &HT;    We had seen a USO brochure describing Nuremberg as Germany's No.
l Christmas city. Nuremberg of the infamous war-crimes trials, the
Hitler rallies, the racial laws--Nuremberg, the setting of the Nazi
propaganda film, ``Triumph of the Will.''
 &HT;    Our bus stopped at the very Nuremberg streetcorner I would
recognize years later in the film, ``Judgment at Nuremberg.''
 &HT;    I paired up with an army pal and we headed for the Altstadt, or
Old City, the walled medieval center surmounted by a castle on a
hill.
 &HT;    First, of course, we made sure to stop in one, two, or
three--and probably four--Stammlokals (or taverns) along the way;
we needed to test the local Franconian brews.
 &HT;    I knew something of Nuremberg's notorious history under the
Nazis -- I had seen the 1930sels of torchlit Nazi rallies in
the Altstadt. Allied bombers later flattened the half-timbered
medieval center. In 1945, in a single night, 600 bombers rained
down tons of explosives, killed thousands and rendered tens of
thousands homeless.
 &HT;    We finally made our way into the Altstadt, behind the restored
medieval walls, and found the Hauptmarkt, or central market square.
 &HT;    For hundreds of years, each Christmas season the market square
has hosted the Christkindelsmarkt, or Christchild Market.
Nurembergers set up dozens of booths and stalls--festooned with
strings of lights--and sell regional handicrafts, dolls, puppets
and tin soldiers.
 &HT;    We caught a smokey whiff of a foodstand offering Nuremberger
specialties--warm pretzels and sizzling sausages. Immediately, we
reached for the Nuremberger pretzels that go so well with the
Franconian brews, then the small, dark, sizzling bratwursts, served
up with steamy scoops of onions on a hard roll. And there was
Schnapps, of course.
 &HT;    Suitably fortified against the biting night air, we moved
through the market throngs to the Shoenerbrunner, or Beautiful
Fountain, a medieval masterwork. We found the fabled brass ring
hand-wrought seamlessly into the iron grillwork, spun it, but could
not work it loose. We greeted sparkling frauleins in the spirit of
the season as they passed us by.
 &HT;    By now, it had surprised me to see no signs of war damage. In
Frankfurt, our embarkation point into West Germany, lingering
damage was still evident in bombed-out ruins in side streets. Now,
in Nuremberg, in the heart of the most heavily bombed city in West
Germany, singled out for special attention as a Nazi symbol of
rancor and exterminationist hatred of the Jews, the Altstadt
seemingly had risen to a new life to celebrate the birthday of
Christ.
 &HT;    As commercial activity began to slow in the Christkindelsmarkt,
the crowds were moving toward the Frauenkirche, or Our Lady's
Church. It too had risen from the ashes of destruction -- postcards
on sale in local shops showed it as a smoldering ruin in 1945. Now,
the doors were flung open to a Christmas service under way.
 &HT;    A celestial melody floated out into the market square,
accompanied by angelic voices. It was ``Silent Night,'' but it took
me a moment to catch on to the original German lyrics, ``Stille
Nacht, Heilige Nacht.'' They floated in the night air like a balm
to soothe my private images of World War II destruction.
 &HT;    In 1960 the German language was mainly familiar to me through
the filter of World War II movies--''Achtung!'', ``Jawohl!'' or
``Heil Hitler!'' Now I heard it renedered beautifully in a
Christmas night, and I went on in later years to memorize the
German lyrics, preferring them to the English.
 &HT;    In fact, I started to collect them in the languages of countries
where I would pass the holidays in the ensuing decades--France,
Spain, the Netherlands.
 &HT;    I recently managed to revisit Herzogenaurach and Nuremberg. I
did so through the magical transport of the Internet and the World
Wide Web. I glimpsed this year's Christkindelsmarkt by ``live
cam.'' And my cyberspace visit sparked the memory of my 1960
footsoldier's tour and the deathless tones of ``Stille Nacht,
Heilige Nacht'' soaring in that frigid market square that had once
been smashed into ruins.
 &HT;    Later, I focused my Web search engine on ``Silent Night.'' To my
surprise, the master site was not in Germany or Austria but in
South Africa. The Web page (http://silentnight.web.za/) collects a
hundred translations of Silent Night in a hundred languages,
literally from A to Z--including versions in American Sign Language
and Delaware Indian.
 &HT;    Then again, maybe it is fitting that we should find ``Silent
Night's'' healing words featured in South Africa--a country that
has also known more than its fair share of rancor and racial hatred
in this century. So this 1999 season the Afrikaner sings, ``Stille
nag, heilige nag''--and the Zulu, ``Busuku obuhle.''
 &HT;    The Christmas carol that conquered the world.

 DECADE LATER, THEFT FROM BOSTON MUSEUM STILL BAFFLES POLICE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ The two police officers banged on the museum's side
door in the late night rain demanding entry. There had been a
disturbance nearby in the Fenway neighborhood, they shouted into
the intercom, and they wanted to make sure that everything was OK
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's security guard knew that standard procedure
mandated that he telephone Boston police headquarters to verify
such a claim, but the two officers were so insistent that he let
them in without calling.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grievous error. Within seconds, the ``police officers''
had tied up the guard and his partner and for the next 81 minutes
set off to rob the Gardner Museum of some of the world's most
irreplaceable pieces of art.
</P>
<P>
   While the guard can be faulted for his action, the museum's
trustees share some of the blame _ for inaction. They failed to
provide adequate protection for the more than 3,000 pieces of art
with which Mrs. Isabella Stewart Gardner, the widow of a well-to-do
Boston businessman, filled the walls of her four-story
Venetian-style palace at the turn of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was equipped with electronic sensory equipment, and
it traced the movements of the two thieves as they whisked through
the first two floors of the museum. But it sounded no alarms as
they removed 13 pieces of art _ 11 paintings and sketches by
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Manet, and Degas; a 3200-year old Chinese
beaker; and the bronzed top of a Napoleonic flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is common practice at many museums, not one of the
masterpieces was protected by an alarm system that would have
activated upon its removal. Security was provided primarily by
low-paid guards. Also, not one of the paintings was insured for
theft. In the end, the lack of such coverage denied investigators a
proven negotiating tool for the recovery of stolen artwork:
insurance reward money.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that the Brink's robbery and the Sacco and
Vanzetti trial riveted international attention on Boston, so, too,
has the theft at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum ever since it
took place two hours after midnight on Sunday, March 18, 1990.
Nearly a decade later, the largest art heist in history remains
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a death in the family; I've never really
recovered from the loss or stopped mourning,'' said Anne Hawley,
who had been the museum's director for five months when the crime
occurred. ``This has been a real tragedy for not just Boston, but
the world. Art exists for the beholder, and to believe that it
would be forever lost, hidden in a warehouse someplace, never again
to be appreciated is unspeakably sad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest whodunit
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the robbers' final words before leaving the museum were
``Tell them they'll be hearing from us,'' nothing has been heard
from them or apparently anyone else with direct knowledge of the
theft, according to William (Tom) Cassano, the FBI supervisor who
has overseen the official investigation from its earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Cassano said the bureau has pursued more
than 2,000 leads, using agents from all of its 56 offices
nationally who have traveled to Japan, South America, Mexico, and
Europe to try to solve the case. ``It's the biggest whodunit I've
ever worked on, as well as the most frustrating,'' Cassano said.
``We haven't got a clue as to who is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial speculation _ that the heist was done on the orders of
an unscrupulous collector or by members of an organized crime or
drug ring hoping for a lighter prison sentence for one of their
kingpins _ have been scrutinized and dismissed. To FBI sources in
the criminal underworld, ``we've let it be known that we'd be
appreciative of anything that could be done,'' Cassano said. But
still there is nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He theorized that the thieves planned the robbery on the belief
that the art was insured and that the museum's insurance company
would agree to pay for its return. Insurance companies customarily
offer 5 percent to 10 percent of the insured value of the stolen
property as a reward for its return.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had insured the museum's contents for loss or
damage caused by fire or water, the trustees had decided not to
insure them for theft because of the high cost of that coverage.
Investigators said the $1 million reward the museum offered was too
small to motivate an overture from the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rewards, not ransom
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having no theft insurance meant the museum was without a team of
insurance adjusters and investigators, trained in art theft,
working on its behalf. The FBI and US attorney's office have a dual
purpose, catching those responsible for the theft and orchestrating
the artwork's return.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the roles of insurance and law enforcement personnel can
conflict, especially when dealing with an individual who might be
able to facilitate the artwork's return in exchange for reward
money but wants immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times that we are able to be more flexible in
getting the stolen items returned than the authorities,'' said
Harold J. Smith, who has worked as a fine-arts insurance adjuster
for nearly 60 years. ``We will not pay ransom to art thieves, but
do offer rewards for the safe return of stolen material.''
</P>
<P>
   At several points, museum officials clashed privately with
federal authorities because they believed that the US attorney's
office was more interested in prosecuting the wrong-doers than
retrieving the artwork. Both sides refused to talk about the
incidents on the record but said their relationship now is a strong
one.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators have felt on several occasions that they
were about to crack the case, the leads turned out to have been
based on mistaken or incomplete information, conjecture, or
outright lies. Sometimes comically so.
</P>
<P>
   Cassano shakes his head when he remembers the time, three years
ago, that a Charlestown resident called and said that while walking
his dog one night, he had noticed what appeared to be the stolen
Vermeer, ``The Concert,'' hanging on a neighbor's wall. An FBI
agent and a museum official were dispatched, and what they viewed
from the sidewalk was encouraging. Through opened blinds, they
could see the painting was in a fine frame and expertly
illuminated. But once the owner of the townhouse invited them in
for a closer look, the agent and Gardner official were immediately
able to discern that what was on the wall was a print and not the
priceless original.
</P>
<P>
   Or the time two years ago that a Cambridge photography shop
reported that it had just processed a roll of film that clearly
showed photographs of the most valuable of the three Rembrandts
stolen, ``The Storm in the Sea of Galilee,'' the only seascape
painted by the Dutch master. While FBI agents waited for the film's
owner to pick up the photos, Barbara Mangum, the museum's chief
conservator was contacted and told of the possible break in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a second, you're about to arrest my husband,'' Mangum
said. She had taken the pictures herself to show the investigators
how the stolen masterpiece would look under different lighting and
had asked her husband to get the roll of film developed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Youngworth and Rembrandt
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While those leads were investigated and resolved quickly and
quietly, the one that drew the most public attention during the
10-year investigation still vexes some of those who have worked on
the case the longest.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Youngworth, a 38-year-old antiques dealer from the
Boston suburb of Randolph, who had been in and out of trouble with
the law, claimed in August 1997 that he could facilitate the return
of the artwork, but it would come at a price. To underscore his
credibility, he allowed Tom Mashberg, a reporter for The Boston
Herald, to gain access to a Brooklyn, N.Y. warehouse where,
Mashberg later wrote, he was shown briefly by flashlight what
appeared to be ``The Storm on the Sea of Galilee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Youngworth's asking price for the artwork's return was
steep: The museum was to hand over the reward money, which had been
raised to $5 million; he was to be given immunity from all
prosecution related to the theft, hiding, and transporting of the
paintings; state criminal charges pending against him were to be
dropped; and friend Myles Connor Jr., who was serving time on an
unrelated art theft charge, was to be released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern balked, saying there would be no
negotiations without proof that Youngworth had ``credible and
concrete'' evidence that he could return the artwork. A short time
later, Youngworth turned over to the FBI a small vial of
microscopic paint chips and contended they came from the ``Storm of
the Sea of Galilee.''
</P>
<P>
   But in December 1997 the saga _ which had played out in
newspapers and on television for months, with Youngworth and
federal authorities accusing one another of dealing with bad faith
_ came to a sudden halt. The FBI and the museum announced that
extensive testing of the chips showed they were not from the stolen
masterpiece, and photographs that Youngworth claimed showed the
painting at its current location were phonies.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not dispelled the notion that at some point in the
negotiations Youngworth had reliable information on the artwork's
whereabouts. In Globe interviews, both the FBI's Cassano and the
museum's Hawley said the tests did show that the chips were from
paint used during the 17th century and from the same region in
which Rembrandt painted. But Cassano stressed ``they could have
gotten them from anywhere. . . . The important thing to remember is
that they said it was from that one Rembrandt, and it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some who hesitate to dismiss Youngworth
completely: Hawley, Arnold Hiatt, a Boston business executive and
the museum trustee who has taken the lead in the board's effort to
recover the artwork, and, to a lesser degree, Cassano and Brien T.
O'Connor, the former assistant US attorney who spearheaded the
federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Youngworth, now serving the final year of a three-year sentence
for possession of a stolen vehicle, is not talking and has
indicated that he will not, at least until he gets out of jail.
That may be much longer than anticipated. Last month, the state
Appeals Court ruled that because of past convictions he could be
sentenced under the state habitual-offender statute, which could
increase his sentence by 12 years.

GORE SCORES ON MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time I checked, there were 486,000
Medicare beneficiaries in the somewhat politically significant
state of Iowa, and another 168,000 in its equally prominent sister,
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And it's possible that they and the tens of thousands of people
right behind them in age might be interested in what the Democratic
presidential candidates have to say about this vital piece of twine
in the social safety net. To oversimplify only slightly, there's Al
Gore (a great deal), and there's Bill Bradley (next to nothing).
</P>
<P>
   Those Medicare numbers are expected to double over the next 25
years as the baby boom generation ages. In particular, remembering
that advanced age inevitably means sharply higher medical expenses,
it's worth noting that the 85-and-older populations (now 64,000 in
Iowa and 18,000 in New Hampshire) are going to triple over the same
period. And if the past is prologue, roughly 60 percent of these
seniors will be women.
</P>
<P>
   The future health of Medicare is thus on its graying face as big
an issue as you can find in public policy, especially because (as
with Social Security) the ratio of workers paying taxes to seniors
receiving benefits is certain to shrink dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Democratic Party, which fought for Medicare for more
than 20 years, enacted it in 1965, and has led the fight to
preserve it against the malign intentions of budget-cutters and
privatizers, you would expect ideas galore about a cherished legacy
with an uncertain future looming. You would only be half-right.
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare, the bold guy with the big ideas turns out to be
Gore, and the guy who comes up shooting blanks turns out to be
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Clinton-plus a lot on the issue. The core of his
proposal is that $370 billion be reserved out of non-Social
Security retirement surpluses over the next decade, for seniors'
health care, and that 15 percent of the surpluses be similarly
reserved for at least another five years after that. Some $300
billion would be reserved for the protection of the hospital
insurance trust fund, or Part A of Medicare, that would otherwise
become insolvent in 2014-'15. The remainder would help pay for his
sound targeted prescription drug benefit, in marked contrast to the
Bradley drug proposal which combines the worst of two worlds _ an
open-ended entitlement on the back end and too many deductibles and
co-payments hurting the truly needy on the front end.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton would say, this is a huge deal. By
reserving such a sum of money over 15 years, Gore would extend the
hospital insurance fund's solvent life as is for another dozen
years.That doesn't make ``reform'' unavoidable when the demographic
time bomb goes off, but it does mean that it can be a lot less
wrenching in a program that any senior can tell you is not exactly
famous for its munificence right now. Indeed, its arguable that
Clinton-Gore has already made most of the tough choices.
</P>
<P>
   People forget, but when the administration took office in 1993,
the insolvency date looming for Medicare was this year. Actions
taken that year and in 1997, focusing on hospital, nursing home,
and home health care providers _ along with the greatly improved
economy _ pushed the date back. But some of the squeeze was too
tight, threatening quality of care, and so some of the funds were
restored in the bipartisan budget deal last month.
</P>
<P>
   That's why using the surpluses boldly as well as prudently (on
this topic the two adverbs go together) is so vital, and Gore's
commitment so important. Not surprisingly, he asked Bradley in the
New Hampshire debate for details of his own Medicare thinking, and
got zip in reply.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley relied on three points he's been making all
fall, with underwhelming results. The first is an accurate claim
that in his 18 years in the Senate on the Finance Committee he
defended Medicare against its critics. That claim is now the full
content of a 30-second TV ad that just started running in Iowa, a
defensive move that shows his campaign's legitimate fears.
</P>
<P>
   What Bradley doesn't like to say is that he would not set aside
a red cent to protect Medicare. Instead, he expects that coming
advances in disease control will bring Medicare costs down over
time. That argument impressed people when he first made it, but
Bradley has never fleshed it out with supporting detail. That makes
it a riverboat gamble with Medicare's security, and that's
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   His third point is that if the economy should grow faster than
expected in future years, there could be more money available that
could be set aside to extend Medicare's solvency. But that point
betrays Bradley's horribly misplaced sense of priorities. To him,
Medicare is essentially an afterthought; it brings up the rear. To
Gore, Medicare is at the very top with Social Security, where it

   Maybe Bradley would have had room for Medicare had his broader
health insurance proposal not squandered billions on tax
deductibility for insurance premiums paid by the wealthy and on
subsidies for workers miles beyond the poverty line who already
have health insurance. It is astonishing that two out of every
three Bradley dollars would go to those who already are insured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore doesn't make that mistake. On Medicare, Bradley's proposals
don't match his professed caring.

   Retailers have served up plenty of cheesy holiday platters in
our time. But this year's promotion of splashy millennium
memorabilia is off the charts. Talk about white elephants.
</P>
<P>
   There are baseball caps adorned with working electronic
countdowns to 2000. ``Tiny Bubbles'' necklaces have pendants shaped
like champagne bottles ``corked'' with a gadget through which the
wearer can blow bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the high heels, multicolored sweaters, formal
evening tops, T-shirts, neckties, socks, and handbags embellished
loudly with millennium motifs, sequins, beads, and phrases like
``Celebrate 2000,'' ``I'm OK, Y2K,'' and ``Happy Millennium.'' And
this is all just at Lord &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart has 01-01-00 hats in bucket, ski, and baseball styles, as
well as mittens with a 10-9-8 countdown on the fingertips. Filene's
has polyester and cotton shirts and vests embellished with, among
other things, sequins, party hats, and the number 2000. Bailey
Banks &AMP; Biddle has a ``millennium ring'' _ a solitaire with
``2000'' inscribed by laser within the diamond. Inside the band is
a ``2'' inscribed alongside three inlaid diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these items aren't cheap. Beaded evening tops at Lord &AMP;
Taylor are $59. Its slingback 2000 heels are $99. The Bailey Banks
&AMP; Biddle ring is $1,995 for 1/2 carat, $4,995 for 1 carat.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they aren't selling. Says Lavelle Olexa,
senior vice president of fashion merchandising at Lord &AMP; Taylor,
``We really felt there would be a lot of interest in . . .
memorabilia going into the new millennium. That has proven to be
correct.'' The multicolored sweaters and beaded evening tops have
been ``good sellers,'' she says. A spokeswoman for Bailey Banks &AMP;
Biddle says it expects to sell out its stock of 2,000 millennium
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question for shoppers is: What does one do
with the mementos after January 1? Sure, some of the goods could be
collector's items. Some can be worn throughout 2000. But in
reality, the countdown hats, sparkly sweaters, and embroidered
handbags are most likely destined for the back of the closet. Look
out, Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural to wonder just what people will wear in the
future. In ``Millennium Mode,'' authors Roberta Wolf and Trudy
Schlachter surveyed 40 top designers from around the world _
including Donna Karan, Miuccia Prada, Issey Miyake, Domenico Dolce,
and Stefano Gabbana _ for their predictions. The results make the
book a worthy read.
</P>
<P>
   Is society ready for nakedness? New York designer Daryl Kerrigan
(Daryl K) thinks it's the ultimate fashion statement of the future,
based on the current physical fitness and health crazes. ``While
this concept is obviously not widely accepted right now,'' she
said, ``it's possible that society could embrace such an idea in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sprouse, of New York, said he would love to see clothes
that ``pour'' on. ``Just get in the shower and press the clothing
sprocket. You dip yourself in the clothes and they're hot-wired to
computers to keep you warm or cool, change colors, whatever.
Clothes that respond to you. Eventually, you probably won't need
designers. You'll just need the right cable company.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rennie, chief designer for Escada in Germany, thinks work
will be obsolete in the future, thanks to robots and computers. So,
as people dedicate their time to leisure, home, and travel,
comfortable fabrics will be key, he said. ``It's conceivable that
people will create their own fabrics and fashions over the
computer. This `computer couture' could make designers obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Todd Oldham isn't so hooked on technology. He
predicts that despite technological breakthroughs, computers won't
be the key to moving fashion forward _ humans will. ``You can
streamline machinery, but in the end, the sewing maching that was
invented in the 18th century is pretty much the same one we're
using today. . . . I use computers only in the print process. I
don't design with a computer. Hands have to do that. We're
designing for the human form. It's very instinctive where to place
a seam _ computers can do it, but it won't be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest companies on the planet are using computers to
design and you can see it in the clothes. In the end, I think
people will turn away from that. The success of design is making it
look like humans touched it.''

THESE TEXAS INMATES TO FEAST ON A MEAL FIT FOR A PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When inmates at the Trinity County Jail sit down for
their Christmas meal this year, the daily fare of frozen TV dinners
will give way to a gourmet meal fit for, well, a president.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Hurt, a 21-year-old recent transplant from Seattle and
the new chef at Baroque Restaurant in Houston _ which counts former
President Bush among its occasional visitors _ is whipping up a
holiday feast for jail inmates and staff during her off-work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Day, her ``guests'' will dine on a tossed salad in red
pepper cups dressed with roasted garlic vinaigrette alongside
assorted fresh fruits with cranberry-infused whipped cream. The
entree will consist of ham in a rum-spiked orange and brown-sugar
glaze accompanied by roasted garlic mashed potatoes, green beans
almondine with bacon and red onions, and butter-top rolls. For
desserts, she is serving Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake with
chunks of white and dark chocolate and a raspberry swirl, baked in
an Oreo cookie crust. Warm cinnamon-apple and cherry pies, served a
la mode, also will be on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tradition in our family to adopt people who don't
have families,'' Hurt said, explaining in part how she got involved
in cooking a holiday meal for the nearby Trinity County Jail, which
is about 90 miles north of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second time Hurt has prepared such a feast for
the jail; she and her father also cooked a lavish dinner for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that just felt right to do,'' she said. ``We
would have been cooking anyway, and it's just as easy to cook for a
large group as for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to any harried host or hostess this season who is
fretting over how to handle the increased cooking chores and party
fare.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurt, a graduate of the Western Culinary Institute in
Portland, Ore., who also has studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris,
Scuola di Artes Culinaria in Rome and the Culinary Institute of
America in Napa, Calif., began cooking family meals at age 11,
catered her mother's wedding reception for 85 at age 12 and began
catering meals and special occasion cakes and pastries at age 14.
</P>
<P>
   A former chef with the Doubletree Hotels in Portland and Seattle
and at two trendy Seattle-area restaurants, Hurt moved back to
Texas from Seattle earlier this year to get reacquainted with her
father, Chuck Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents divorced when she was 7, and, after her dad was sent
to prison as a sex offender, Hurt lost all contact with him except
for one visit she made to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice
when she was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom disapproved, and it was very hard for me to communicate
with him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, after seeing her mother struggle with the death
of her own parents from whom she had been estranged, Hurt decided
to move back to Texas to get to know her dad, who was paroled
several years ago and works as a paralegal for Huntsville-area
attorney Bill Habern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just realized how much I didn't know about him,'' she added.
``I haven't known my father in the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father has become a surrogate father to a young man, Tim
Beaver, who is serving time in the Trinity County Jail. They met
while both were in prison and Chuck Hurt had become sort of a
counselor to Beaver. He continued that role after both were
paroled.
</P>
<P>
   And when Hurt and her father began talking about the bleak
Thanksgiving Beaver faced in jail and how they might brighten it,
they came up with the idea of taking him a meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about taking him a plate of food for Thanksgiving
dinner, but that didn't seem very festive or fair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she and her dad decided to cook for all the inmates and
staff at the jail. That is not as cumbersome a task as it might
seem at first, because the jail has only eight inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Brent Phillips said he welcomed the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a small jail, and we don't have much of a budget for
food,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Families of inmates often ask him if they can bring food on
holidays to their relatives behind bars. Because the jail is so
small, Phillips has a policy that if one person gets a special
meal, all the prisoners must get the same treat.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small jail population, Phillips said, morale would
suffer if one prisoner got a home-cooked meal and the others were
left with the frozen fare.
</P>
<P>
   At Thanksgiving, Hurt and her father also tried to promote the
idea of families and organizations volunteering similar holiday
meals in small jails around the state. Ray Hill, who does a Friday
night prison radio show from Houston, promoted the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Inmate Family Association took up the cause, but
executive director Linda Reeves said sheriffs in a number of other
counties rejected the offers from TIFA members to prepare meals.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt admits that putting together the Christmas meal will be a
little more hectic than it was cooking the Thanksgiving feast. She
had not started work at Baroque when she cooked the Thanksgiving
meal.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, she's overseeing the Christmas Eve dinner at
Baroque. Once through there, she will dart to the Huntsville area
where she and her dad will begin cooking. She'll finish up
Christmas morning and the father-daughter team will deliver the
meals to Groveton, where the jail is located, by noon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not everybody's idea of how to spend Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day, but Hurt shrugs it off with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to cook,'' she said.

IN EUROPEAN FORCE, US FEARS A LOSS OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Just days after the European Union pledged to create
its own rapid-reaction force so it would not have to rely always on
the American military, officials from Hanscom Air Force Base went
to an airbase in rural England.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts-based team was there for ceremonies last
Wednesday marking a key milestone in a project to upgrade the Royal
Air Force's fleet of AWACS aircraft, flying command posts packed
with advanced electronics for communication, battlefield
surveillance, and electronic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The visit underscored the fact that in their quest to operate
more independently of the US military, the Europeans will need the
help of Americans to narrow the technological gap that became
glaringly obvious during the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed the fine balance that the United States seeks to
strike as it urges its European allies to spend more on defense,
but not so much that they won't need the Americans at all anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The vaguely anti-American rhetoric that has come out of some
European capitals recently has US officials worried that the
American-dominated NATO alliance could be undermined by a more
robust and independent European military.
</P>
<P>
   But while talk is cheap, improving technology and military
capability is not. And that is the main reason that US military
figures seem less troubled than American diplomats by the European
Union's formal decision to create a 60,000-member rapid reaction
force by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, military officials and analysts suggested that
European governments are neither politically nor culturally
prepared to make the cuts in social welfare programs that would be
needed to pay for a military infrastructure capable of making NATO
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those same officials and analysts say it would be wrong to
dismiss the genuine desire of Europeans to assume more
responsibility for military decisions, and the resentment over what
some say is the propensity of the Americans to dictate to them.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, which with France has led the push for
asserting Europe's military independence, spent $100 million to
upgrade its seven AWACS, or Airborne Warning and Control System,
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   US Air Force Colonel Brad Butler heads the AWACS program at the
Electronic Systems Center at Hanscom that oversaw the British
upgrade, and he sees Britain's investment as underpinning rather
than undermining the future of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this strengthens the alliance, not sets the tone for
division,'' Butler said in an interview here. As he explained it,
upgrading the radar systems on the AWACS aircraft makes it easier
for the allies to exchange information quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This increases the capability to be interoperable, and to
deploy and be ready to fight together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans have made it clear that they want to be able to
deploy soldiers to hot spots like Kosovo without relying on
American forces, and especially on the US Congress, which they see
as increasingly isolationist. The Europeans believe that a
homegrown rapid reaction force could intervene in conflicts such as
Bosnia and Kosovo before they escalate to full-scale wars.
</P>
<P>
   As the European communique issued in Helsinki Dec. 11 put it,
the 15-nation European Union pledged to ``develop an autonomous
capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not
engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations in
response to military crises.'' The goal is 60,000-member force that
is able to deploy within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe Talbott, the US deputy secretary of state, met with NATO
foreign ministers in Brussels last week, and said the United States
welcomed the European decision. But Talbott said the new force
should not supplant NATO and must take into account the security
concerns of NATO members who are not in the EU _ the United States,
Canada, Norway, Iceland, and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting in Brussels underscored the differences between
the Americans and their European allies. Talbott briefed the allies
on a proposed anti-missile defense system for the United States, an
updated version of the ``Star Wars'' project of the 1980s that
never took off. Many of the European allies are opposed to the
so-called missile shield, saying it violates an arms control treaty
with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO is a 19-nation alliance, by law its military
operation must be headed by an American general, and American
superiority in air power and technology gives the United States
disproportionate influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it both ways,'' admitted a senior US diplomat posted
in a European capital, speaking on condition of anonymity. He meant
the United States wants Europeans to increase their defense
spending, but not in a way that would undermine NATO. Right now,
the United States spends 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product
on defense, while the French spend 2.8 percent and the British 2.6
percent. Germany, which has Europe's biggest army, spends only 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Eichenberg, a professor of political science at Tufts
University who has studied the issue, says public support for a
single defense policy that would make Europeans less dependent on
NATO has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear, however, is whether Europeans are willing to pay
for a defense structure that would make NATO irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public support for that is still low, but it has been growing
in recent years,'' said Eichenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles Andreani, a French military analyst and senior fellow at
the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies, said
the State Department is more worried about the European plans than
the Pentagon. Pentagon officials, he said, see the force for what
it is _ a relatively small operation of 60,000 troops taken from a
pool of 2 million European soldiers. Pentagon officials also
remember that without French and German cooperation, the US would
not have been able to deploy nuclear missiles in Germany in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with longer-term vision are pretty relaxed over what
the Europeans are doing,'' he said. ``The guardians of the temple
are from the State Department, and they have exaggerated suspicions
of the French.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials, notably President Jacques Chirac and Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, have complained openly that the post-Cold
War United States has gone from superpower to hyperpower.
Unchallenged on the world stage, the Americans too often dictate
rather than treat their allies as partners, they say.
</P>
<P>
   While the French have long wanted to rely less on the Americans,
it was not until last year, when British Prime Minister Tony Blair
joined Chirac at a British-French summit at St. Malo, that Paris
had the ally it needed to push the European Union to create its own
intervention force. Blair, Washington's most steadfast ally, has
repeatedly reassured the United States that the NATO alliance will
not be undermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French are more explicit about the need for autonomy and a
more balanced dialogue,'' said Andreani, the analyst. ``The British
are more explicit about this not being pursued in a manner that
affects NATO integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   There are different motivations at work, Andreani says. The
French and the Germans, who have already established a small
bilingual force, see it as a way to strengthen European
integration. The British, always the most skeptical about such
integration, ``see this as a way they can lead in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But in their statements at Helsinki, the various European
leaders said they needed to be able to act when NATO cannot or will
not.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, whose research center at Hanscom has produced some of
the technology that gives the US military its huge edge over its
allies, was stationed in Europe during the 1980s and calls talk
about weakening of the American-European alliance exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo showed that we and the Europeans have shared values as
much as shared interests,'' he said. ``The cooperation we had with
our European allies on this AWACS project was typical. We don't
have the market cornered on the best ideas. I come away from this
more encouraged about the alliance, not more worried about its
future.''

MILOSEVIC 
Portrait of a Tyrant 
By Dusko Doder and Louise Branson 
Free Press, 284 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last! A biography that skips the saint-or-sinner debate.
</P>
<P>
   As Dusko Doder and Louise Branson abundantly document, Slobodan
Milosevic, almost from the start, epitomized the Balkan-variety bad
seed. The child of parents who both committed suicide, Milosevic
aligned himself with a woman who hungered for power to avenge the
ignominious death of her mother. Milosevic betrayed a college
classmate, a mentor of two decades, and his next-door neighbor in
lunging to the top of Yugoslavia's diseased post-Tito political
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Milosevic: Portrait of a Tyrant'' traces how he encouraged
_ and later sacrificed _ thugs and political aspirants, urging them
to remain king of Belgrade's hill even as he led his nation down a
path of political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, Washington correspondent for The Scotsman, and Doder, a
native Montenegrin and a longtime journalist (he has covered the
Balkans for The Boston Globe and The Washington Post), deftly
explore two perplexing questions that have surrounded Milosevic: Is
he the root of all recent Balkan evil, as Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright and other US policymakers contended before
this year's costly NATO campaign to wrest Kosovo from his clutches?
And how could such a man remain in power for so long?
</P>
<P>
   It is a mistake, the authors argue, to view Milosevic as
omnipotent and (despite his background) premeditatedly malevolent.
His signal speech a decade ago in Kosovo, in which he promised
ethnic Serbs that they would never again be victimized by the
Albanians who were an ethnic majority in the southern province,
came on the cuff, only after jeers greeted his standard
conciliatory government message. After the rapturous welcome given
that speech, Milosevic, according to Doder and Branson, became
addicted to exploiting ethnic divisions to rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   But he also recoiled at the worst excesses of Bosnian Serb
atrocities in Bosnia, he was eager to portray himself as
indispensable to peace to Western negotiators such as Richard
Holbrooke, and he sold out 200,000 ethnic Serbs in the Krajina
region of Croatia rather than prolong a confrontation there (and
buttress Serb rivals).
</P>
<P>
   Despite Albright's contentions, the authors argue, he is no dark
Machiavelli or Clausewitz. ``There was no hard center to his rule;
no strategy,'' the authors write, their use of the past tense
reflective of their view of the tenuousness of his rule today. ``He
lived from day to day. The only discernible pattern was perpetual
mayhem. . . . He promoted conflicts _ in Slovenia, in Croatia, in
Bosnia, in Serbia itself _ to enlarge his power and to keep his own
people distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation by Albright and other US policymakers to use
overwhelming force against him in Kosovo was based on a tragic
misreading of the man, the authors argue. Although Milosevic backed
down in Bosnia, he did so as much to undercut increasingly
independent Bosnian Serb rivals as to respond to the West's
stiffening spine. Kosovo, where he first made his mark, would have
to be taken from him, at whatever cost to his shrinking nation.
</P>
<P>
   The biography's most painful moments arise as the authors
chronicle the series of missed opportunities, by Washington and by
internal opponents, to truncate Milosevic's rule. Twisting state
media with the skill of a Nazi propagandist, Milosevic, whose only
clear-cut electoral victory came in 1990, silenced his critics. He
fixed elections, or disregarded them if he lost. He unleashed his
police, secret agents, and terrorist freelancers against meddlesome
opponents such as nationalist Vuk Draskovic, beaten so severely in
1993 that his mental faculties since have come into question.
</P>
<P>
   Doder and Branson assert that inflexible US diplomats
short-circuited a true internal challenger, the Serb-American Milan
Panic, whose platform in 1992 elections became the removal of
Milosevic. Advised by a former US ambassador to Yugoslavia, Jack
Scanlan, Panic could not coax a commitment from the outgoing Bush
administration that economic sanctions would end if he ousted
Milosevic. While he was wildly popular, Panic's lack of US
influence kept Milosevic's lieutenants from defecting, and it left
the propaganda and electoral mechanisms in Milosevic's hands.
Today, with beatings and arrests of Serbian opponents to Milosevic
on the rise again, Washington yearns for a counterweight as strong
as Panic was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   As this biography makes clear, many Belgrade residents gave up
on Milosevic long before the NATO warplanes rained down bombs on
them last spring. In 1997, derisive crowds besieged Milosevic in
1997 as he and his megalomaniac wifepassed through Belgrade in the
Mercedes 600 of the former Yugoslav leader, Josip Broz Tito. ``The
partners in power were in for a shock,'' Doder and Branson write.
``The crowds pelted their limousine with old shoes, a message that
the couple were not fit for the shoes of the old dictator.''

   CHINA-INTERNET (Beijing) _ With the ambivalent blessing of the

   BUSH-ADVISERS (Austin, Texas) _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is
counting on a small group of conservative experts steeped in the
intricacies of arms control, military budgets and geopolitical
security to counsel him on a subject that has caused him the most
trouble in his presidential campaign: foreign affairs. Not
surprisingly, the job of helping Bush translate his core principles
for America's role in the world into concrete policies lies largely
in the hands of eight hawkish advisers with broad experience under
President Ronald Reagan or Bush's father, President George Bush.

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-MILLENNIUM _ JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government's
religious ministry has asked that hotels keep Christmas trees
behind closed doors to avoid offending the locals. The government
started preparations for the expected crowds years late. A look
around Jerusalem finds no signs or decorations about the event to
come. After all, in the Jewish calendar it's not 2000, it's 5760,
and the Jewish state is a reluctant host to the Christian
milestone. In fact, the Palestinians nextdoor may steal the
millennial show. A few Israelis have been openly anxious about the
influx of the Christian masses. Most are indifferent, but their
knowledge of Christianity is limited. A Gallup Poll released
Tuesday shows that most Israelis do not know the date of Christmas.

BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS EXPERTS LEARN TO PUT SKILLS TO PEACEFUL USE

 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. _ Just a few years ago, Dr. Vladimir Bugreyev
was making deadly biological weapons in the secretive ``closed
city'' of Stepnogorsk in the Kazakhstan region of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   His potential target: The United States and other military foes
of the U.S.S.R.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bugreyev is working with American scientists at the U.S.
Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In October, he and three other colleagues _ from among the
60,000 or more former biowarfare scientists from the Soviet
``Biopreparat'' _ concluded weeks of work at PNNL learning to put
their skills to peaceful and commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an assistance program of sorts for their scientists and
engineers,'' said Dr. Richard Weller, the lead scientific liaison
between the researchers and the Richland laboratory, now operated
for the government by the private firm Battelle.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the retraining effort is the fear that scientists who
once worked for the now dismantled Soviet biowarfare program will
market their talents to rogue nations or terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Recent revelations of how extensive the Soviet Union's
biowarfare research program was _ including reports of deaths
caused by the accidental release of anthrax at Sverdlovsk in 1979 _
have prompted an urgent international effort to reduce the threat
and learn how to defend against an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Young, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and now director of the National Disaster Medical
System, said last month at a scientific forum that a biological
warfare attack on the United States is almost inevitable. Young
warned that the country is not prepared to rapidly identify such an
attack, much less defend against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat is very large and it's true we're not ready for
it,'' said Dr. Tam Garland, a veterinary scientist at Texas A&AMP;M
University and an expert on animal-based biowarfare agents such as
anthrax and plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biologicals are the most worrisome weapons of mass destruction
because they are so easy to acquire and transport,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the breakup of the Soviet Union, American and former Soviet
officials recently decided to work together to minimize the chances
that weapon-making skills might fall into the wrong hands, said
Patricia Godoy-Kain, manager of PNNL's international biological
weapons non-proliferation program.
</P>
<P>
   The Tri-Cities, home of the Department of Energy's Hanford
Nuclear Reservation, has spent decades learning how to shift away
from a government-run weapons program to a more diversified and
commercialized economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Russian officials first focused their efforts on
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology. Attention soon
turned to biological and chemical weapons as well, and PNNL was
selected to lead the effort aimed at preventing the proliferation
of bioweapons because of the Richland lab's established expertise
in molecular biology.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, groups of former Soviet biowarfare researchers have
been coming to the Richland lab. Bugreyev, his wife and scientific
partner, Dr. Nadezhda Bugreyeva, Dr. Ekaterina Nikitina and Dr.
Vladimir Berezin were the most recent visitors to the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Another group is scheduled to arrive in February.
</P>
<P>
   Most are from Stepnogorsk or other cities in the newly
independent state of Kazakhstan, where the Soviet Union had
concentrated much of its work on anthrax and plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepnogorsk demonstrated our ability to wage biological
warfare on a scale matched by no other nation in history,'' Ken
Alibek, a former deputy chief of Biopreparat, revealed in his book
``Biohazard,'' published earlier this year. ``Needless to say, we
didn't advertise our accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, however, American officials soon
learned of the massive Soviet scientific system that had been
dedicated to biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first level of engagement is scientist to scientist,''
said PNNL's Weller, who recently visited the Kazakhstani scientists
back home to help them in their shift toward developing biomedical
research projects.
</P>
<P>
   Weller said the goal is to help them identify practical and
commercial applications for the work previously dedicated to
weapons development. It's not as much of a stretch as you might
think, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the basic molecular biology and the lab techniques are
the same,'' Weller said.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage that many former Soviet scientists have over their
American colleagues, he said, is that most U.S. researchers are
heavily dependent on high-tech equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the former Soviet Union, Weller said, had less to
work with and were forced to become more creative.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Evguenia Rainina is a biochemist from Moscow
who came to PNNL a year ago and stayed. Rainina now sometimes
serves as a liaison between the Richland scientists and her former
Soviet colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, she had developed a system for rapid detection of
bacterial toxins and other pathogens _ something of critical
importance if attacked by a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, Rainina didn't engineer any genes or develop some
high-tech instrument.
</P>
<P>
   She used fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and his friends grew up catching fireflies,'' Rainina
said, noting that her research project back then even had a tilt
toward capitalism. ``We paid the kids for each firefly they
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   What she got from the fireflies was an enzyme responsible for
the bugs' luminescence known as luciferase. Rainina found that the
enzyme luciferase could be visibly triggered by very small amounts
of a common metabolic chemical _ ATP, adenosine triphosphate _
found in all living cells.
</P>
<P>
   Further research allowed her to discriminate between types of
living cells, which allowed identification of different microbes.
The presence of even a minute amount of an organism's ATP can
produce a visual flash of light. All this is valuable if troops are
exposed to an unknown bioweapon.
</P>
<P>
   But Rainina's work with the firefly enzyme may also be valuable
for medical diagnoses and detection of bacterial contaminants in
food.
</P>
<P>
   Through her work with researchers at PNNL, where the project
also pairs up the foreign scientists with commercial firms, Rainina
is now working with a medical equipment manufacturer in Maryland to
develop a highly sensitive pathogen detector that may be used first
for food safety inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Weller said the company, New Horizons Diagnostics, plans to
develop an inexpensive ``illuminator'' detection device that simply
alerts the user to the presence of a bacterial contaminant. Further
research, he said, is aimed at creating detectors that can
distinguish types of organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects with the Kazakhstani scientists include work on
an experimental hepatitis C vaccine based on a natural
immunity-stimulating compound refined by Berezin and an antifungal
medication based on a unique strain of strep bacteria Nikitina
isolated from soil.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these health-oriented projects are based on accidental
discoveries that can trace their roots back to research looking for
new bioweapons or for antidotes to these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchange of information also benefits the United States,
Weller said, by bringing us new commercial opportunities and novel
scientific approaches to problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a win-win situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M's Garland, who also helps operate an Internet-based
independent database called ProMED that reports on disease
outbreaks worldwide, said another likely but unstated benefit of
the PNNL program is to gather defensive information about the
former Soviet biowarfare program.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, she said, should be for the U.S. scientific,
medical and public health communities to come together with a
well-defined response plan in the event of an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Limited attempts at bioterrorism may have already taken place
that have gone unrecognized, she said. The recent outbreak of West
Nile encephalitis in New York City that sickened at least 50 people
and killed seven, she said, fits the profile of such an attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it was (an act of bioterrorism) but it's an
extremely odd virus that's not been seen in the U.S. before,''
Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York illnesses were initially misdiagnosed by medical
doctors as St. Louis encephalitis and attributed to a common virus.
The rare virus was discovered and eventually linked to the human
outbreak by a Wildlife Conservation Society veterinary pathologist,
Tracey McNamara, who had been examining dying birds at the Bronx
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said that episode, whether it was an act of bioterrorism
or not, demonstrates the need for a better system to recognize and
respond to biological weapons. The PNNL program is a good step in
that direction, she said, but it's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to biological weapons it's not a question of if,
but when,'' Garland said.

 &HT;    CLINTON RAPE ACCUSER SEEKS RECORDS FROM ADMINISTRATION
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The woman who alleges that President Clinton raped
her more than 21 years ago is suing the White House and Justice
Department to obtain any records held by the Clinton administration
about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to know if there's a file there,'' Juanita
Broaddrick said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas nursing home executive made accusations against
Clinton that were made public early this year by The Wall Street
Journal and NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick said in a brief interview Tuesday that the White
House rejected a request she made in October for files kept about
her.
</P>
<P>
   She has hired Larry Klayman, the head of Judicial Watch, an
attorney who has filed numerous suits against the Clinton
administration. The court papers cite rights under the Privacy Act
in seeking to have the White House turn over records.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 27 letter responding to the request, the White House
legal office said the Privacy Act did not apply to the president's
personal staff.
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick said that she had hoped the lawsuit would not
generate publicity. However, a CNN television news team was at the
federal district courthouse here for the filing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the rape allegation was first aired last February, Clinton
issued a denial through his lawyer, but he has not personally
responded. Since then, Broaddrick has returned to her private life
in rural Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy resurfaced last week when a woman at a New
Hampshire forum asked Vice President Al Gore if he believed
Broaddrick's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had not seen the televised interview, but said, ``I
guess I'm like a lot of people in that I think that enough is
enough. I do not know how to evaluate each one of these individual
stories. I just don't know.''

KAUFMAN STORY ENTERTAINING YET EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Forman accomplished a
minor miracle three years ago with ``The People vs. Larry Flynt,''
a film biography of a somewhat despicable pornographer that managed
to be an authentically moving tribute to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In its follow-up, ``Man On the Moon,'' Forman tries to do
something like the same trick with a biopic about another offbeat,
highly outrageous and, in many ways, prototypically '70s character:
TV comedian Andy Kaufman (``Taxi,'' ``Saturday Night Live!'').
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, it's often hilarious, and it also offers a
reasonably strong, A-level star vehicle for Jim Carrey. But it
offers no special insights into its subject, it doesn't connect on
any higher level, and it left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied and
let down.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (who
also wrote ``Larry Flynt''), it opens with a clever title sequence
in which Kaufman (Carrey) addresses the audience, then dramatizes a
random moment from his affluent Long Island childhood before
zipping to his first days as a struggling L.A. stand-up comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Though he seems a spectacularly inept comic, an important agent
(Kaufman's ``Taxi'' co-star, Danny DeVito, who also co-produced)
quickly notices something original and brilliant in his strange
impersonations and sketches, which have no obvious punchlines and
are often esoterically obscure or blatantly sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, he's a semi-regular on ``SNL'' and a crazy mechanic
on ``Taxi,'' where his bizarre humor is finally fully appreciated
and fawning network executives are catering to his every whim.
(DeVito has reunited the cast of ``Taxi'' for these scenes, and
it's a mistake, because they're all rather glaringly 20 years older
than we remember.)
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie deals with his growing contempt for and
rebellion against his success, his inexplicable obsession with
wrestling, his love affair with one of his ring opponents (Courtney
Love, in a fairly nondescript role), and his brief battle with the
lung cancer that will quickly take his life.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly for Forman, it's kind of an MTV-style movie _ all
high points, omitting scenes that might ``explain'' Kaufman's
unique, self-destructive drive. The film views his life as a series
of outrageous stunts and hoaxes in which the comedian and his
faithful companion and writing partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti),
are ultimately shown to be putting on everyone around them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain refreshing honesty in this _ an acceptance
that all human beings are basically unknowable (``There is no
you,'' the Courtney Love character tells him at one point) _ but
it's also frustrating and negates Kaufman's importance as a
cultural figure. The only conclusion we can draw from the movie is
that Kaufman was a complete nut-case.
</P>
<P>
   Since Forman and the writers clearly don't know what to make of
Kaufman, Carrey's impersonation is not really a performance. But it
still holds the movie together nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey has a seductive screen presence; he is always both
surprising and entertaining (more entertaining, for sure, than the
real Andy Kaufman), and it's basically the kind of eye-bulging,
face-twisting, mug-fest role at which he has no equal.
</P>
<P>
   Man on the Moon. Directed by Milos Forman. Written by Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Cast: Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito,
Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti. Universal. 118 minutes. Rated R for
language, sex scenes and nudity.

ALMODOVAR'S `MOTHER' COMBINES DARKNESS AND COMPASSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spanish director Pedro Almodovar has run the gamut from good to
ugly in his wildly flamboyant films.
</P>
<P>
   From the misanthropic ``Kika,'' to the histrionics of ``The
Flower of My Secret,'' to the crazy vibrance of ``Woman on the
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' ``Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down'' and
``Dark Habits,'' Almodovar has traipsed all over the emotional map.
</P>
<P>
   So it's lovely to note that ``All About My Mother'' is as dark
as a Greek tragedy yet it has a vibrance and joie de vivre that
can't be contained by grief.
</P>
<P>
   The film pays loving tribute to actresses and that genre of
movies familiarly called ``women's films'' and Almodovar has merged
three _ Bette Davis in ``All About Eve,'' Gena Rowlands in
``Opening Night'' and Romy Schneider in ``L'important c'est
d'aimer'' _ into a buoyant homage to the female sex, ``women who
act'' and ``actresses who have played actresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuela (Cecilia Roth) is a nurse and single mother who is
raising her son, Esteban (Elor Azorin), a bright, curious teenager
who wants to be a writer. On his 17th birthday, his mother
surprises him with tickets to a stage production of ``A Streetcar
Named Desire'' starring the great actress Huma Rojo (Marisa
Parides) as Blanche Dubois.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban has asked his mother for only two things on this special
day: to finally tell him about his father and to wait with him by
the stage door in the pouring rain so he may ask Rojo for her
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   But tragedy strikes and the boy is killed in a freak car
accident. Consumed by grief, Manuela returns to Barcelona to find
Esteban's father, who has never known his son, and tell him of the
death.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela's journey becomes remarkable when three extraordinary
women enter her life; Rojo, pregnant nun Sister Rosa (Penelope
Cruz) and the transvestite Agrado (Antonia San Juan), who is
Manuela's old friend and the keeper of the secret of Esteban's
father and his true identity.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar has painted this story of gender, loss and the slow
process of healing with his signature palette of color, camp and
chaos. But ``All About My Mother'' brims with a compassion that
gives the story great dignity despite its wild array of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who worked previously with Almodovar on ``What Have I Done
To Deserve This?'' and ``Dark Habits,'' is wonderfully thrilling
and chilling in her grief as the primally wounded Manuela. Her face
carries both the pain and the capacity for reason and forgiveness
though her heart is broken. San Juan creates a character who
lovingly bounces off life's sadness with a survivor's humor and the
humanity of a woman who has reinvented herself (literally).
</P>
<P>
   The result is a dizzying, marvelously acted rush of a movie that
may, after more than 20 films, finally give Almodovar a wider
crossover appeal. He's already won the best director prize at this
year's Cannes Film Festival and ``All About My Mother'' swept the
best foreign film of the year awards from the National Board of
Review and the New York, Los Angeles and Boston film critics
groups.
</P>
<P>
   All About My Mother. Directed and written by Pedro Almodovar.
Cast: Cecelia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz, Antonia San
Juan. Sony Pictures Classics. 101 minutes. Rated R for sexual
themes. In Spanish with English subtitles.

ALLEN'S `SWEET AND LOWDOWN' WINDS UP DOWN AND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all these years and all his troubles, it still can be fun
to see the annual Woody Allen movie. It's usually a letdown, but it
always contains some good stuff and invariably involves an element
of surprise: You never quite know what you're going to get.
</P>
<P>
   In this 1999 edition, ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' Allen exercises his
well-known fascination for ethnomusicology with a lighthearted,
semicomedic exploration of the life and legend of a fictitious jazz
guitarist of the '30s named Emmett Ray (Sean Penn).
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Ray is that he's a thoroughly despicable human
being. The opening scenes establish him as a pimp, a thief, a
coward and a self-obsessed, gun-toting braggadocio whose idea of a
good time is a midnight excursion to shoot rats at the city dump.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also a sublime musician, second at his instrument only
to the great French Gypsy guitarist, Django Reinhardt, whose
mystical superiority so haunts the insecure Ray that the movie's
running gag is that he can't stop talking about the man.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's script roughly takes the form of a documentary, with the
dramatic scenes introduced by a series of Ray experts, including
Allen, his former writing partner Douglas McGrath, and a succession
of fatuously tongue-in-cheek jazz authorities, including critic Nat
Hentoff.
</P>
<P>
   It largely traces Ray's life in terms of his two most important
relationships: his affair with a ``half-witted'' mute woman
(Samantha Morton) who appreciates his music and accepts him for
what he is, and the shallow society dilettante (Uma Thurman) he
marries.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Allen movies of the '90s, ``Sweet and Lowdown'' never
tries to be a laugh riot, and aims more at maintaining a consistent
level of irony and whimsy. It's entertaining, but somewhat trivial
and underwhelming, and you do finally get tired of it before it's
over.
</P>
<P>
   The film is, however, a real showcase for Penn, who seems to
positively delight in playing a slimy, hateful character that most
stars would not go near. Never has it seemed clearer that this
endlessly rebellious actor intends to be the Robert Mitchum of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet and Lowdown. Directed and written by Woody Allen. Cast:
Sean Penn, Samantha Morton, Uma Thurman, Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen
Mol, John Waters. Sony Pictures Classics. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13
for sexual references.

`ANY GIVEN SUNDAY' GIVES UP YARDAGE IN TIRED OLD TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a football movie carries the names of Oliver Stone and Al
Pacino in its credits, one might reasonably expect it to be an
imaginative examination of the prototypical American institution,
with possibly some of the devastating power and insight of ``Wall
Street'' or ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   But the duo's near-three-hour gridiron extravaganza, ``Any Given
Sunday,'' is one more sports film about a talented hot-shot rookie
who learns to be a team player and appreciate the traditions of the
game _ a plot that was a groaning cliche even in the Silent Era.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino plays Tony D'Amato, the veteran head coach of the
fictional Miami Sharks, a troubled franchise with attendance
problems, a 38-year-old quarterback (Dennis Quaid) held together by
scar tissue, and, as the film opens, two humiliating losses in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   In a desperate moment, Tony has to use his third-string
quarterback (Jamie Foxx), and the kid comes through, and even shows
signs of being the miracle the team needs. The trouble is he won't
obey the game plan, he has no team spirit and he insists on doing
things his way.
</P>
<P>
   But he makes touchdowns, and the young team owner (Cameron Diaz)
insists that Tony use him. So the story goes on a collision course
_ Tony, his loyalty to the game and his aging quarterback pal on
one track; the arrogant upstart player and the money-grubbing owner
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   As always with Stone, the film has some gritty performances and
a certain likable audacity. Pacino commands the screen with his
usual slouchy magnificence, and Diaz holds her own as his
yuppie-scum nemesis. Several of the game sequences also are fairly
compelling, even if you know nothing about football.
</P>
<P>
   But far too much of the film is taken up with tiresome and
confusing scenes of unidentifiable men violently crashing into each
other, and Stone's nervous, hand-held visual style _ half a tribute
to the competition movies of Michael Ritchie (``Downhill Racer''),
half to ``The Blair Witch Project'' _ is mostly uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also is too darn long. Like nearly every other major
film of this holiday movie season, it's just shy of three hours _
which in this case means it has an extra hour of locker-room excess
and unnecessary and annoyingly repetitive battle scenes tagged onto
its very thin plot line.
</P>
<P>

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ed Lucas was at the east end of the concourse
beneath the Empire State Plaza at lunchtime the other day, in a
gray suit and red tie, just like New York Gov. George Pataki wears
so often. Clearly, he was enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's a tall, rangy guy who looks vaguely like the governor _
although not so much that you really would mistake either of them
for the other. In stage makeup designed to age him _ Lucas is 15
years younger than the governor _ he was in character as Pataki. As
state workers hustled by, he stopped them and offered them their
Christmas bonuses _ lumps of coal in gift boxes. As state workers
got the idea, they played along.
</P>
<P>
   They would moan to the ``governor'' about how desperately they
want a contract, how much they need a few extra bucks, how wounded
they are that the governor got his 20-plus percent raise, along
with his commissioners, and that the state legislators gave
themselves a 38 percent bump fully a year ago, but the
rank-and-file workers still can't get anything out of the state of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was all street theater cooked up by the Public Employees
Federation (PEF), one of the state employee unions. Lucas is a PEF
divisional president responsible for 1,200 members. In real life,
for more than 20 years, he has been a civil engineer for the state
Department of Transportation. He was having a fine time yesterday
playing George Pataki and poking fun at the Republican governor.
But the unions won't be so good-natured Jan. 5, when they gather at
the Capitol as Pataki delivers his State of the State Message.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the state workers plan to have thousands of
protesters on hand, waving signs, chanting, doing whatever they can
think of within the limits of the law to dramatize their dismay
over stalled contract talks. You can probably expect a chorus line
of Pataki look-alikes, kicking up their heels like Jay Leno's
dancing Judge Lance Ito during the O.J. Simpson trial. Actually,
the possibilities for bad taste and rowdiness here are virtually
limitless.
</P>
<P>
   The state workers will be right on the merits of this, too.
They've been without a contract since April. They've gone four of
the last eight years with no raises and with only minor increases
in the years in which raises did come through. Meanwhile, as
salaries stagnated, they've been called upon to pay more on their
health insurance. In general, a state government with a surplus
totaling billions _ with Wall Street cash washing like a tidal wave
into state coffers _ is treating the people who make government
work day-to-day like dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas isn't a bad example. He lives in a modest house in an
older section of Niskayuna. He has two young kids. His specialty is
concrete. He evaluates the stability of concrete structures, does
work on bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing sexy; nothing exciting. It's merely the workaday
business of government that keeps buildings from falling in on
people and bridges from tumbling into rivers.
</P>
<P>
   For this work, we taxpayers pay Lucas $40,000 a year _ or, to
put it another way, we pay him not quite twice the size of the
raise the legislators gave themselves. In total, we pay him only
$10,000 a year more than the raise the governor got and signed into
law last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy my work,'' Lucas said. ``I save the taxpayers a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, if anybody in this state's political leadership
appreciates that, they sure have a funny way of showing it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, though, the outrage festival slated for Jan. 5 will get
their attention.

LEVINSON REVISITS BALTIMORE IN `LIBERTY HEIGHTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his bittersweet 1990 family saga ``Avalon'' _ the third of
his autobiographical ``Baltimore'' movies _ director-writer Barry
Levinson traced the subtle disintegration of an extended, once
close-knit Jewish family in the post-World War II era. It was the
best of the three and a far cry from its more comedic predecessors
_ ``Diner'' (1982) and ``Tin Men'' (1987) _ but its melancholy
story and downbeat vision seemed to turn off audiences, and the
film died at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, for his fourth installment in the series,
``Liberty Heights,'' Levinson returns to the same '50s territory in
a much more positive frame of mind. The film is a valentine to the
roots of a big change-for-the-better that is about to consume '50s
America.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the titular Northwest Baltimore Jewish neighborhood in
1954, the film traces a year in the life of the Kurtzman family:
Nate (Joe Mantegna), his wife Ada (Bebe Neuwirth), and teenage sons
Van (Adrien Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster).
</P>
<P>
   The script weaves three parallel story lines:
</P>
<P>
   _The problems that arise when Nate, who owns a cheesy burlesque
house that's mostly a front for the numbers racket, is financially
busted by the big numbers win of a small-time black gangster.
</P>
<P>
   _The romance between Ben, Nate's sweet-spirited youngest son,
and Sylvia, the first black student in the Liberty Heights high
school after the courts officially desegregated the Baltimore
school system that year.
</P>
<P>
   _The impossible love affair between Van, Nate's oldest son, and
the beautiful-but-alcoholic and probably doomed blonde WASP
princess (Carolyn Murphy) he meets at an upper-crust Gentile
Halloween party.
</P>
<P>
   All three stories take place in a world that at first seems more
innocent and simple than ours, but is gradually revealed to be
wracked and compartmentalized by racial prejudice _ white for
black, black for white, Gentile for Jewish, Jewish for the whole
threatening world outside their immediate community.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext of the movie is that the changes about to engulf
this world _ the Civil Rights movement, rock music (the advent of
which we see in the form of a James Brown concert), and the great
counterculture of the '60s _ are going to shake it, and leave a
more diversified and better place in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   As always with Levinson, it's well done. The dialogue is funny
and the cast is flawless _ especially Mantegna, who creates a
semi-gangster character of genuine nobility. And it's as warm and
uplifting a portrait of a family that will somehow survive these
changes as ``Avalon'' was the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is marred by the broad strokes with which Levinson
paints his picture of mid-'50s prejudice. Were the characters
really so obsessed with race in 1954 that it's their only topic of
conversation? Did Baltimore's top country club really have a
gigantic sign at its entrance stating: ``No Jews, Dogs or
Coloreds''?
</P>
<P>
   It's also annoying that the film is a sloppy catalog of
anachronisms. Levinson has a major reference to the ``Perry Mason''
TV show that would not debut until 1957. Van refers to himself as a
``beatnik'' even though the term wasn't coined until 1958. And so
on.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the film is in so many ways, it also altogether rings
a bit false and contrived _ in the way that many highly
autobiographic works of cinema do, as their artists grow older and
wealthier and less emotionally connected to the lost eras that
inspired them to be artists.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Heights. Directed and written by Barry Levinson.
Produced by Levinson and Paula Weinstein. Cast: Joe Mantegna,
Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Ben Foster, Rebekah Johnson. Warner

   &QL;  WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE JUNK COMES HOME
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Lipman
</P>
<P>
   Special to space.com
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (States News Service) - What do you do with a junky
old computer? Throw it out? Donate it to a school? Cannibalize it
for parts? Or, you could do as NASA does, and store it in an inert
nitrogen envelope in a corner of the world's largest clean room.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble Space Telescope's DF-224 will be the world's most
expensive obsolete computer when astronauts bring it back from the
telescope later this month. Although the old computer, Hubble's
original, isn't necessarily all that expensive in-and-of itself,
its launch to orbit and return cost roughly $1.8 million. (NOTE TO
EDITORS: NASA VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE OF LAUNCH COSTS &QC; $9,000/LB. WEIGHT
OF OLD COMPUTER &QC; 100 LBS. 9,000 $/LB x 100 LB x 2 FLIGHTS  &QC; 
$1,800,000)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, NASA is reluctant to simply throw the thing away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineers by nature are kind of pack rats,'' said Preston
Burch, the project manager for HST Operations. ``If you ever came
to my office, it would scare you.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch has racks of 'junk' stored at his facility, which he takes
out now and then to fiddle with for testing and diagnostic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, anything that comes back from Hubble is examined
closely and often recycled for reuse. This is the third servicing
mission to the telescope, and astronauts have brought back old
components on each earlier flight. These obsolete and often broken
pieces of equipment are some of the only objects ever returned to
Earth from an extended stay in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outer space is one of the greatest long-term storage
environments there is,'' Burch said. ``There's not any dirt to get
on it, there's no one to get one of their greasy hands on it.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA recycles what it can. For instance, a previous crew
installed the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, the workhorse
instrument that takes most pictures from Hubble, and ferried the
first model back to Earth. The first camera has been stripped and
remodeled, and will go back to orbit next year as 'WFPC3.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's an instrument and it's coming back and it's in
perfectly good shape, we'll send it to another contractor,'' Burch
said. ``We'll definitely want to use the flight structure and the
latches, and maybe the optical bench - that's a structure that's
designed to be very rigid that holds all of the optical
components...it has to be very precise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hubble is ten years old, and has been very busy. Some parts
have ``degraded'' as NASA says, like the stabilizing gyroscopes the
current Discovery crew is replacing. Wires inside the gyroscope
have corroded because of exposure to oxygen and are now, well,
junk.
</P>
<P>
   Burch wants them back anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we're replacing the originals because they failed,''
Burch said. ``And one of the things we want to know is why it
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they get components back from orbit, NASA's engineers are
often pressed to find out what went wrong with a part by reading
all the telemetry from the satellite, so that they can re-design
the part. When the part comes back, the staff at NASA Goddard
center likes to test their earlier hypotheses.
</P>
<P>
   When they're done inspecting, dissecting, and rejecting the
part, it goes into storage. NASA staff like to keep it around to
help them diagnose problems with new parts, Burch said. If one of
the new gyroscopes starts showing a problem, for instance,
engineers will haul out the old ones to see if they can make it
behave the same way in a lab.

   Goddard has the largest clean room of its kind in the world,
needed to build the Hubble, and has plenty of space. Failing that,
Burch said, engineers can seal the part in a plastic container with
dry nitrogen - all water vapor removed - to prevent corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very last thing we'd ever do is throw it in the
dumpster,'' Burch said.
</P>
<P>
   The old computer, however, is ``a different animal,'' he said.
It's not dumpster-bound, but it's not something Burch even really
needs to look at. Because of the radiation in space, satellite
computers need to be more robust than Earth-based systems, and tend
to be a generation or so behind. The old Hubble computer has a
processing speed below that of the Apple II home computer, NASA
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old computer was really something from the 1970s, maybe
even earlier,'' Burch said. ``It's of limited value. So when it
comes back, we're not going to spend a lot of time and money trying
to understand what the failures were.''
</P>
<P>
   The new computer, a 486-based machine, is so radically
different, Burch said, that the old one isn't even very useful as a
test bed. But they'll hold on to it anyway, at least until the end
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be worthwhile hanging on to that,'' Burch reasoned.
``I mean, the new computer. . .we haven't seen it operate on orbit
yet.''

&HT;     PHYSICIANS SAY PAINFUL NERVE DISORDER STILL NOT NDERSTOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ His pain is so intense, the Rev. Paul Tartaglia
can't chew, talk, brush his teeth or even touch his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me right above the eye,'' said the semiretired
Albany priest. ``It's like someone with a golf cleat smashing into
the eye area and then electrifying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians say those who suffer from attacks of trigeminal
neuralgia aren't exaggerating. This nerve disorder is so
excruciating that some people have been known to commit suicide
rather than endure it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst pain in the world,'' said Dr. Peter Jannetta, a
neurology professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a pioneer
of a controversial surgical treatment of the condition, known as
microvascular decompression.
</P>
<P>
   Tartaglia traveled last week to New York University Medical
Center to undergo the operation in hopes of stopping the pain that
has dogged him over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to such medical advancements, most people diagnosed with
trigeminal neuralgia can find some relief. Over the past three
decades, researchers have come up with new ways of treating this
condition, from oral medications to minimally invasive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet trigeminal neuralgia is still not widely understood, even
among some physicians. ``When I tell people I have this, they've
never ever heard of it,'' said Tartaglia, who works in the Chancery
office of the Albany Roman Catholic Diocese. ``I initially thought
it was an eye problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sometimes confuse the pain with a severe toothache
because of the location of the trigeminal nerve. It's not unusual
for neurologists to see patients with trigeminal neuralgia who have
had several teeth pulled before their condition was accurately
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is the largest of the nerves in the head, the
trigeminal nerve is responsible for much sensation in the face,
from chewing to blinking.
</P>
<P>
   Without the nerve, the face would feel numb, like after a trip
to the dentist. Imagine not being able to feel a light breeze, a
soft kiss or a wisp of hair on the face, and the important role of
the trigeminal nerve becomes easier to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerve endings in the face are the most concentrated in the
body, even more than the fingertips,'' Jannetta said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one theory as to what causes the pain associated
with trigeminal neuralgia, and attacks can be caused by anything
from smiling to going outside on a windy day. Because people with
the condition live in fear of triggering it, some doctors have seen
patients who won't even talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have patients coming to my office smelling like a stinking
pig because they can't brush their teeth,'' said Dr. Ramesh Babu, a
neurosurgeon at New York University Medical Center. ``You have to
see it to believe how painful it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of specialists believe that the protective covering
of the nerve, known as the myelin sheath, deteriorates, either as a
result of another condition, such as aging, multiple sclerosis or
because of pressure from a nearby blood vessel or tumor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, regular nerve transmissions are interrupted, much
like static in a phone line. The sensation is pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, terrible pain,'' said Isabelle Peete, 84, who
also suffers from trigeminal neuralgia. ``When you have those
pains, you can't open your mouth, you can't eat. It's like
electrical shocks,'' said Peete, who lives near Plattsburgh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Trigeminal neuralgia affects about one in every 25,000 people
and is slightly more common in women than men. This year alone, the
Trigeminal Neuralgia Association estimates that 15,000 new cases
will be diagnosed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In cases that can't be linked to multiple sclerosis or a tumor,
the first line of defense is medication such as Tegretol, an
anti-convulsant drug also commonly used to treat epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such drugs may not work for everybody or they may lose their
effectiveness over time. Tartaglia didn't want to risk the
potential side effects, such as kidney and liver problems, because
of other underlying health problems.
</P>
<P>
   His search for relief brought him to the New York University
Medical Center recently, when he underwent a three-hour operation
to pull a tiny blood vessel away from his trigeminal nerve, a
procedure that's still a matter of dispute among some
neurosurgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's controversial, but it works,'' said Dr. Marc Schwartz,
one of two neurosurgeons who perform the delicate operation at the
Albany Medical Center. ``There are different ways of treating this,
the controversy is, who's data do you believe?''
</P>
<P>
   Jannetta, who pioneered microvascular decompression in the
1960s, said the procedure has become more widely accepted in recent
years as long-term data show it offers a more permanent solution
and involves fewer side effects than other techniques, including
cutting the nerve or injecting it with glycerol to damage the pain
receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fewer than 10 percent of all neurosurgeons perform
microvascular decompression, in part because it can be difficult to
find the tiny blood vessel that's responsible. And, as with any
surgery in the head, there are risks, including meningitis or
hearing damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced this procedure is the best way to treat
trigeminal neuralgia,'' said Babu, the neurosurgeon at the New York
University Medical Center who operated on Tartaglia last week.
</P>
<P>
   The key, however, is finding a neurosurgeon with a lot of
practice at finding a blood vessel much smaller than a hair. Once
that blood vessel is identified, the surgeon inserts a tiny piece
of Teflon to buffer it from the nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest critics of this procedure are the ones who can't
locate a 50 micron blood vessel,'' Jannetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Tartaglia was hopeful the surgery will bring him the relief he's
been seeking. Although he's been suffering from trigeminal
neuralgia since the early 1990s, the attacks recently become more
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since a year ago October, there is no time I haven't known I
have this condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after surgery and still in the hospital, Tartaglia
was optimistic. Although he still felt pain from the incision, he
didn't feel the trigeminal neuralgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely on Cloud Nine,'' he said. ``I have total
confidence at this stage. It's very encouraging.''

 &HT;    FTC MOVES AGAINST WEB-BASED PYRAMID SCHEMES

   WASHINGTON _ Word to the con artists running illegal pyramid
schemes on the Internet: Halt.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal law enforcers Tuesday announced a crackdown on
scam operators who use new technologies to perpetrate old frauds.
The Federal Trade Commission said its staff, with the help of state
officials, has swept the Internet and found more than 600
potentially illegal pyramid sites.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcers have taken action against 23 sites so far, said
Paul Luehr, assistant director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection. The FTC has made patrolling the Web a high priority
because illegal scams ``have the potential to take off so rapidly,
given the global reach of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the crackdown, the FTC earlier month filed a federal
lawsuit to shut down 2Xtreme Performance International Inc., a
Dallas-based company that purported to sell nutritional
supplements. The company was using the Internet to help recruit
distributors to ``learn a guaranteed method to put $5,000 to
$10,000 in your pocket in tax savings each and every year for the
rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the company used deceptive claims to
recruit consumers, who spent as much as $1,300 each to participate
in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Luehr said many con artists are using e-mail to lure victims and
glitzy Web sites to help persuade them of a scheme's legitimacy.
``What we're finding is that many programs are operating on and off
the Web, using info-mercials, telemarketing, e-mail and Web sites''
to build the appearance of legitimacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC advises consumers to learn the difference between legal
multi-level marketing plans and shady pyramid schemes. The former
are a way to sell goods or services through distributors.
Typically, these plans provide distributors with commissions from
their own sales, as well as from the sales of the people they
recruit to become distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid schemes have a similar structure, but focus on the
commissions earned for recruiting new distributors, not on the
selling of useful products or services. Such plans are widely
outlawed because they collapse when no new distributors can be
found, and everyone except for a few people at the very top of the
pyramid loses his or her money.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC offers these tips to protect yourself from a illegal
pyramid schemes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be wary of plans that claim you'll make money through the
growth of sales made by distributors you recruit, not from sales
you make yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of plans that ask new distributors to spend money on
high-priced inventory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid plans that promise enormous earnings or claim to sell
miracle products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of shills _ ``decoy'' references who the promoter pays
to describe fictional success through the plan.

BRINING WORKS WONDERS WITH POULTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: This is the seventh of eight columns by Patrick O'Connell,
the chef and an owner of the Inn at Little Washington in
Washington, Va. They are written with Marian Burros.) 
 (af) 
 By PATRICK O'CONNELL  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
     Brining is a centuries-old method of food preservation, with
the most basic formulas using salt, water and sugar. Recently,
there has been a surprising resurgence of interest in the
technique. Chefs are brining everything from salmon to pork loin,
but most commonly the method is being used for turkeys and
chickens.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why has this suddenly come into vogue? Probably because of a
never-ending quest by chefs for intensified flavors. Many of these
old recipes were developed in the absence of refrigeration, and
they used salt, acid or sugar to preserve meats and, at times, to
mask off-tastes.
</P>
<P>
   With these treatments the food often acquired another dimension.
Many of the exotic tastes and the layerings of flavors in these old
inventions of necessity suddenly seem novel and nostalgic in this
era of technological sterility.
</P>
<P>
   We first began to use a brining technique during the holidays
many years ago, when we had a tradition of giving an open house for
the entire town. We roasted three suckling pigs after soaking them
overnight in an aromatic solution of salt, sugar, water and plenty
of spices.
</P>
<P>
   The roast pigs were such a delicious success that we were
inspired to begin experimenting with brining other foods, and we
found the process also had a miraculous effect on poultry, both
turkey and chicken.
</P>
<P>
   We always use a brine with our Thanksgiving turkeys, and
whenever we have roast chicken for the meal for staff members. The
technique prevents the bird from drying out during roasting and
imparts a beautiful flavor with a lot of depth. The sugar in the
brine helps a turkey or chicken take on a rich amber color as it
cooks. The combination of salt, water and a panoply of herbs and
spices cures and flavors the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Salt alone could be used, but the brining liquid works much
faster. The salt draws out fluid from the tissues and concentrates
the flavor. The liquid in the brine replaces the moisture drawn out
by the salt, so the meat is much juicier. Any spices in the brine
also penetrate all the way through the meat. The result is a tender
and succulent bird that needs no additional seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Water for the brining mixture should be brought to a boil before
the salt, sugar and aromatic seasonings are added. But be sure to
cool it to room temperature before adding the bird, and keep it
refrigerated or in a very cool place to prevent bacterial growth.
The brine can be made well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   BRINED CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour 15 minutes, plus overnight brining
</P>
<P>
   For the brine:
</P>
<P>
   { cup kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1} cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs each fresh parsley, dill, thyme, tarragon, sage
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   2 large bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon juniper berries
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon cardamom pods
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved and squeezed lightly
</P>
<P>
   3 star anise
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon whole allspice
</P>
<P>
   For the chicken:
</P>
<P>
   1 3 to 4 pound chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large stockpot or roasting pan large enough to hold
chicken, place 1 gallon water. Bring to a boil, and remove from
heat. Add all ingredients for brine, and stir. Cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add chicken to pan. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drain chicken well, and discard brine. Cut off and discard
wing tips. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a roasting pan, place
carrots, celery and onion. Place chicken on top of vegetables.
Brush chicken with melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   4. Roast chicken until thigh joint temperature reaches 150
degrees, about 1 hour. Baste with pan juices at least every 15
minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning; if parts become well
browned, cover with foil. When chicken is done, remove from oven,
and allow it to rest 10 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 5 servings.

IN MIAMI, CHRISTMAS EVE MEANS ROAST PIG

 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Every year, on the day before Christmas, the sky here is
filled with smoke from countless backyard barbecues. This is not
just any smoke: It's the aroma of lechon asado, pork that has been
soaked in a garlicky marinade, wrapped in banana leaves and
pit-roasted. It's the fragrance of La Noche Buena, the traditional
Cuban Christmas Eve feast.
</P>
<P>
   At no other time are Cuban roots in Miami more visible or more
festive. Butcher shops advertise fresh young pigs; bakeries are
crowded with customers buying syrup-soaked fritters called bunuelos
and nougat-like turron, the Spanish candy of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   For Latin Americans, and particularly Cubans, Christmas Eve is
one of the most festive nights of the year. A traditional Cuban
Noche Buena begins with a late-night feast accompanied by drinking,
dancing and socializing and followed by midnight Mass. In Miami it
combines the belt-loosening largess of Thanksgiving with the
conviviality of a Fourth of July barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   I got a preview of La Noche Buena from a friend, Efrain Veiga
Sr., 79, who was a butcher in Havana before immigrating to Miami in
1959; he continued to work in the meat industry here. (In the late
1980s, his son Efrain opened what may have been the nation's first
nuevo Latino restaurant, Yuca, and he recently opened Mayya, an
upscale Mexican place in Miami Beach.)
</P>
<P>
   As Veiga demonstrated, the first step of La Noche Buena is
buying the pig: alive. At a blue cinder-block slaughterhouse called
Cabrera's on the outskirts of Miami, in Hialeah Gardens, we waited
in line to pick out a 49-pound macho (male) that looked
appropriately plump and lively. And then waited in another line
while he was slaughtered. On a slow day, the ranch kills 300 pigs
to order; two days before Christmas, the number jumps to 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   At the bay-front home of Veiga's son in Miami Beach, we soaked
the pig in a tangy marinade called adobo that pits the pungency of
lots of fresh garlic against the fragrance of cumin and oregano,
with a greenish fruit called naranja agria, or sour orange,
providing a snappy acidity. The fruit is sold in supermarkets here,
but a mixture of three parts fresh lime juice to one-part orange
juice is a worthy substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Adobo takes its name from the medieval term ``adobar,''
literally ``to ennoble.'' (The term survives in the English
expression ``to dub,'' as in to dub someone a knight.) And what's
being ennobled here is the pork.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great barbecue, lechon asado requires bursts of intense
activity followed by lots of sitting around watching the pig roast.
As we sipped beer, Veiga recalled his last Noche Buena in Cuba. He
and his friends strung an enormous pig between two palm trees like
a hammock and swung it back and forth over the fire until the skin
was as crisp as a potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the Miami pig was as shiny and dark as mahogany
and the meat tender enough to pull apart with your fingers, which
is what we did. We filled plates with black beans, rice, yuca and
plantains, and splashed garlicky mojo over the pork and licked our
fingers. At the end, Mrs. Veiga brought out a shimmering flan
delicately flavored with lemon and cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking a whole pig can be challenging, so Veiga suggested an
alternative: making lechon asado with a pork shoulder. Like the
pig, the roast is marinated in garlicky adobo; for extra flavor,
poke holes in the meat to increase the penetration of the marinade.
In the recipe here, the pork is roasted in the oven, but the purist
can cook it over indirect heat on the grill. Either way, it's the
essence of La Noche Buena.

TASTY CURRY IN ONE POT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a relatively standard Indian dish of cauliflower and
potatoes whose flavors I have long loved. I even have a 30-year-old
Indian cookbook _ one that cost me all of 95 cents _ with a
dog-eared page to prove it. But over the years, I found myself
making the dish with just cauliflower because the potatoes seemed
too starchy, especially since the curry practically cries out for
white rice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, I substituted boneless chicken for the
potatoes, in roughly equal quantity. This turned the dish into a
one-pot meal even nonvegetarians could appreciate. The chewiness of
the chicken, as opposed to the mealiness of the potatoes, gave the
dish an added dimension.
</P>
<P>
   I made the flavor slightly more complex by adding a fair amount
of cumin seeds, which contribute not only taste, but also crunch.
And now I can serve this curry with flatbreads or over rice without
feeling as if I'm eating a crate of carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, this dish can be little more than onions,
cauliflower, curry powder and water. But there are many ways to
vary it. A tablespoon or even more of minced ginger added to the
onion as it cooks will enhance the flavor even further, as will a
teaspoon or two of minced garlic; a little cayenne or some chilies,
fresh or dried, are other options. I like to use chopped tomatoes
with their juice for liquid, but you can use a little stock
instead, or just rely on water.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarians will want to revert to something closer to the
original recipe, with potatoes instead of chicken. Use a waxy
variety, like new potatoes, peeled and cut into one-half-inch dice,
and cook along with the cauliflower until tender. And two cups of
cubed eggplant cooked with the cauliflower is a great addition,
whether you're using chicken or potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   CURRIED CAULIFLOWER AND CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grape seed
</P>
<P>
   { cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 head cauliflower, about 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cumin seed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons curry powder, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   5 or 6 canned plum tomatoes, with juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless chicken, cut into {-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Minced cilantro or parsley for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put the oil in a 12-inch skillet, and turn the heat to high;
add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to
brown. While it's cooking, trim the cauliflower and cut the florets
into {-inch-thick pieces.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the onion has browned a little, add the cumin seed and
curry powder and cook about 30 seconds. Add the cauliflower, and
stir, still over high heat, for another minute. Cut up the
tomatoes, and add them to the pan along with their juice, \ cup
water and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Cover, and turn
the heat to medium-low.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook 10 minutes, stirring once or twice. Add the chicken,
stir, cover the pan again and cook 6 to 8 minutes longer, or until
the chicken is cooked through. (If the sauce appears to be drying
up at any time, add a little more water.) Stir in the lemon juice,
taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish if you like, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

<P>
   The fizzing sound you will no doubt hear on Dec. 31 will not be
the air going out of the Y2K balloon but millions of bottles of
sparkling wine being uncorked. For Champagne producers, that's the
kind of payday that comes along, oh, once every thousand years. For
consumers giving large parties, it's a substantial investment.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to pay for a Champagne ball, there are
alternatives beyond California sparkling wine, which now has both
critical acclaim and the prices that go with it. One possibility is
cava, the Spanish sparkling wine, which is relatively inexpensive
and eminently likable.
</P>
<P>
   Cava _ the word means cellar in Spanish _ is probably most
familiar to Americans as Freixenet Cordon Negro. But there's a
world beyond Freixenet's black bottles, and because the cava
industry is booming, other producers are getting easier to find.
</P>
<P>
   Good cava is produced using the traditional Champagne method,
but with different grapes. Instead of the red-and-white blend used
for Champagne _ pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay _ cava has
historically been made of three white Spanish grapes: macabeo,
parellada and xarel-lo. Some of the better makers now add
chardonnay. Cavas are usually lighter bodied and less acidic than
Champagnes, and they lack their richness but can be fresh and
lively.
</P>
<P>
   Cavas are aged a minimum of nine months; reservas are aged
longer. The wine is in contact with yeast sediments as it ages, so
older cavas have a yeasty, toasty character typical of wines made
by the Champagne method. These six cavas are listed in order of
preference. &QL;

THE SOUL OF THE GRAPE, DROP BY DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know what they say about necessity. Centuries ago, when
refined cane sugar was a luxury for aristocrats only, the common
folk made sweeteners by concentrating the juices of grapes and
other fruit into dark, viscous syrups with a touch of acidity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these age-old, often homemade sugar substitutes have
acquired culinary cachet. Chefs across the country are using them
to enrich marinades and sauces and drizzling them around braised
cabbage and pork, over sharp pecorino cheese or on creamy panna
cotta or berries. They are imported mainly from the Emilia-Romagna
region and, in the south, Apulia.
</P>
<P>
   Odette Fada, the chef at San Domenico in Manhattan, has used
fruit syrups for years. ``I get mine from a friend in Italy who
makes her own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, these sweeteners are made from wine grapes and go by
regional names like saba, sapa, vin cotto or mosto cotto. Vin cotto
means ``cooked wine'' though it is made from unfermented grape
juice, or must, and has no alcohol. In southern Italy, vin cotto is
sometimes made from figs.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro Mafrici, the chef at I Trulli, uses vin cotto from Apulia
as a glazing dip for fried Christmas cookies and to sweeten an
apple and almond cake. At Babbo and nearby Po, saba is used in
sauces and dressings. The chef, Mario Batali, said he discovered it
when he lived in Modena. ``They often make it from the grapes they
thin from the vines before the harvest, so they don't go to
waste,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, a syrup called pekmez is made from grapes or
pomegranate juice (sold as pomegranate molasses) and is more acidic
than saba. Similar concentrates are found in parts of North
America, especially in New England, where boiled cider has been a
sweetener since the Colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dark brown, intensely apple-flavored sweetener, it has at
the same time a definite snappiness that keeps it from being too
cloying,'' writes Ben Watson in ``Cider, Hard and Sweet''
(Countryman Press, $19.95). Cider mills in Vermont and Sally
Schmitt's Apple Farm in Philo, Calif., sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Balsamic vinegar is thought to have evolved from saba, said
Lynne Rossetto Kasper, the cookbook author. Both start by boiling
down the must of trebbiano or lambrusco wine grapes. ``The syrup
might have been stored in vinegar barrels, and that's how balsamico
came about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fada said she often uses saba like balsamic vinegar, as a
finishing touch for butternut squash soup. It is also delicious on
grilled radicchio or baked peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Aging gives true balsamic vinegar its complexity, and its steep
price. But add a touch of good red wine vinegar to saba or vin
cotto, and you'll have something closer to traditional $100
artisanal balsamic vinegar than the harsh industrially produced
vinegars in most stores. And you're better off spooning saba over
next spring's strawberries than using less than top-of-the-line
balsamico. At $10 to $25 for 17 ounces, saba and other syrups now
cost more than sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottled imports don't fit our budget, so we're making our
own interpretation,'' said Mark Ladner, the chef at Lupa in
Greenwich Village. He crushes red grapes, cooks the juice down with
some red wine vinegar and sugar, and adds semi-dried grapes to the
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasper notes in ``The Italian Country Table'' (Scribner,
$35) that farmers in Italy still make vin cotto or saba, though
sugar is now cheap. One farm woman told her: ``Sugar sweetens. Vin
cotto flavors.''

   WASHINGTON _ Word to the con artists running illegal pyramid
schemes on the Internet: Halt.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal law enforcers Tuesday announced a crackdown on
scam operators who use new technologies to perpetrate old frauds.
The Federal Trade Commission said its staff, with the help of state
officials, has swept the Internet and found more than 600
potentially illegal pyramid sites.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcers have taken action against 23 sites so far, said
Paul Luehr, assistant director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection. The FTC has made patrolling the Web a high priority
because illegal scams ``have the potential to take off so rapidly,
given the global reach of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the crackdown, the FTC earlier this month filed a
federal lawsuit to shut down 2Xtreme Performance International
Inc., a Dallas-based company that purported to sell nutritional
supplements. The company was using the Internet to help recruit
distributors to ``learn a guaranteed method to put $5,000 to
$10,000 in your pocket in tax savings each and every year for the
rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the company used deceptive claims to
recruit consumers, who spent as much as $1,300 each to participate
in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Luehr said many con artists are using e-mail to lure victims and
glitzy Web sites to help persuade them of a scheme's legitimacy.
``What we're finding is that many programs are operating on and off
the Web, using info-mercials, telemarketing, e-mail and Web sites''
to build the appearance of legitimacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC advises consumers to learn the difference between legal
multi-level marketing plans and shady pyramid schemes. The former
are a way to sell goods or services through distributors.
Typically, these plans provide distributors with commissions from
their own sales, as well as from the sales of the people they
recruit to become distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid schemes have a similar structure, but focus on the
commissions earned for recruiting new distributors, not on the
selling of useful products or services. Such plans are widely
outlawed because they collapse when no new distributors can be
found, and everyone except for a few people at the very top of the
pyramid loses his or her money.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC offers these tips to protect yourself from a illegal
pyramid schemes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be wary of plans that claim you'll make money through the
growth of sales made by distributors you recruit, not from sales
you make yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of plans that ask new distributors to spend money on
high-priced inventory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid plans that promise enormous earnings or claim to sell
miracle products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of shills _ ``decoy'' references who the promoter pays
to describe fictional success through the plan.

LA DOLCE VITA, SICILIAN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MODICA, Italy _ Viewed from the cosmopolitan cities of the
north, like London and Paris, the southeastern corner of Sicily is
a remote part of Europe. But in a Mediterranean context, it lies at
the very heart of things. It stands sentinel between Iberia and the
Middle East, closer to Tunisia in North Africa than to Rome and
Naples in the boot of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Geography has shaped Sicily's history, and history has shaped
its traditions, including its eating habits _ most of all, the
sweets that Sicilians adore. It was a Sicilian, Francesco Procopio,
who in 1670 opened the first ice cream parlor in Paris (long since,
alas, converted into a mediocre restaurant). And here in the
southeast, in the fine old Baroque cities of Noto and Modica,
skilled confectioners practice the ancient arts brought to the
island by the Arab conquerors in the ninth century and by the
Spanish in the 15th.
</P>
<P>
   For a man with a sweet tooth, this is the promised land. For a
man on a diet, it's a nightmare, an unceasing series of sugary
temptations called peccatucci, or little sins.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish imported the prickly pear and saffron, among other
things, but their most important gift was chocolate, whose delights
they had learned from the Aztecs of Mexico. The Arabs, often
referred to by modern-day Sicilians as Saracens, taught the locals
how to mix snow from Mount Etna or elsewhere with flavored syrup.
They called the result ``sharbat'' or ``sciarbat''; it was the
granddaddy of today's gelato (ice cream), sorbetto (sherbet) and
granita (water ice). Most important, the Saracens planted the
ancestors of the almond and citrus trees that now blanket this area
and provide flavoring for cakes, candies and frozen sweets, and
they introduced sugar cane, a far more versatile sweetener than the
honey previously used.
</P>
<P>
   Today, every town and every season have their specialties, made
for the most part in pastry shops. A fig- and nut-filled ring
called a buccellato heralds Christmas in Palermo, but in Modica,
figs are combined with walnuts and almonds and enclosed in thin
pastry shells, which are bent into S shapes before baking. The
little cookies, called nucatoli, taste like fig newtons gone to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Other holiday specialties are citrus based. Grated citron is
heated with honey and formed into hard, sausage-shape rolls, from
which bits are broken off to nibble as an aid to digestion after
the Christmas feast (an acquired taste, I'm afraid, from my point
of view). Peels from the uniquely perfumed local oranges are
candied with sugar. Orange peels are cooked for at least two or
three hours with honey to form balls called aranciati.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Betsey, and I watched at a Modica shop called the
Antica Dolceria Bonajuto as a short, cheerful, muscular man named
Giorgio Turla stirred a copper vat full of orange peel with a
paddle at least twice as tall as he. In December, that is his
chore, all day, every day. At the Bonajuto sweet shop, a bastion of
tradition, they do these things by hand.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is the domain of a gentle, dignified man named Franco
Ruta, who has a passion for preserving all that is best in this
fragrant Island of the Sun, as Homer called Sicily. We met him
through the intercession of Piero Selvaggio, owner of one of
California's most esteemed Italian restaurants, Valentino in Santa
Monica. Selvaggio was born in Modica, once one of the seats of
Spanish power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand poverty and donkey carts and the Mafia as
symbols of Sicily,'' said Ruta, a medical technician who retired a
decade ago to take over the shop, which was founded in 1880 by his
father-in-law's father-in-law. ``I want our people to appreciate
our history and our patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   One important legacy, in his eyes, is chocolate, and he and his
half-dozen workers make chocolate of astonishingly pure, powerful
flavor. Using semiprocessed cacao from the Ivory Coast, which
contains all the cocoa butter that makes the end product rich, they
combine it with vanilla or cinnamon and heat it until it turns
soft, at about 100 to 120 degrees. Industrial chocolate, Ruta said,
is made at much higher temperatures, which harm texture and taste.
</P>
<P>
   Pierpaolo Ruta, Franco's son, told me that his research, carried
out with the help of the Internet, suggests that only in Oaxaca,
Mexico, and in certain Catalan towns in Spain is this old process
still used.
</P>
<P>
   When the chocolate comes out of the pan, it looks like brownie
mix. It is next rolled between the hands of the confectioner and
dropped into long aluminum loaf pans. The pans are placed in wooden
trays, which are banged briskly (and loudly) on marble worktops,
expelling air bubbles and leaving a satin-smooth surface atop the
deep brown chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting it, said Sicilian gastronome Leonardo Sciascia, ``is
like reaching the absolute, the archetype'' _ and I most heartily
agree. It is dense, fudgy and full-flavored. Because of the low
temperatures involved, the sugar granules remain intact, leaving a
slight, pleasant graininess.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruta family's chocolate can be used in a hot drink, in the
Aztec style, or eaten as a sweet. But Modican tradition views it as
a food rather than a candy. So the Dolceria makes 'mpanatigghi,
ravioli stuffed with mincemeat and chocolate _ the name is related
to the Spanish empanada _ and liccumie, another pastry stuffed with
eggplant and chocolate, and even chocolate bonbons flavored with
more than a hint of chili pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the Corso Umberto I, Modica's main street, at the
sleekly modern Fattoria della Torri, recently anointed as one of
Sicily's two best restaurants by the Gambero Rosso guide, they
serve rabbit with a sauce (wait for it) made of chocolate. Had I
not known, I would have thought I was eating a wine sauce with some
mystery ingredient, perhaps rabbit liver.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, all this sounds preposterous, even if very
vaguely reminiscent of the mole sauce served in Mexico. But not a
single one of these savory chocolate creations tasted a bit weird.
All were perfectly delicious.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As were Corrado Costanza's gelati, even though both of us winced
a bit before tasting them. Rose ice cream? Jasmine? Ricotta cheese
ice cream? One bite of each, however, is enough to demonstrate why
Costanza, now 70, has been chosen again and again as Sicily's
gelato and granita king. The rose and jasmine tasted the way those
flowers smell at their peak; eating them was a walk in a summer
garden. The ricotta, unctuous and sweet but with sour undertones,
is superb, too; it is made with a kind of cottage cheese and plenty
of cinnamon, which has long been a favorite Sicilian spice.
</P>
<P>
   But Costanza's masterpiece, it seemed to us, was the gloriously
fragrant tangerine sorbet _ just fresh tangerine juice with pure
water and sugar. It occurred to me that it would make a perfect
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   We tasted them all at his shop, an unassuming place with yellow
striped awnings, down the street from the cathedral in Noto. We
tasted them with traditional Sicilian ice cream spades, which used
to be seen in old-fashioned American ice cream parlors, too. We
tasted them while Costanza, who has visited New York twice, held
forth on things he did not like in the United States, including
air-filled, factory-made American ice cream. ``Gelato gonfiato,''
he called that, meaning puffed-up ice cream. ``Not real, no good.''
California citrus, said Costanza, a jolly man with a white brush of
a mustache, was OK. But Sicilian oranges, he added, ``have a lot
more'' _ and here, his English having run out, he pantomimed a
punch.
</P>
<P>
   None of that good-natured railery should be construed as a
suggestion of arrogance. Costanza is a humble man. When I noticed a
certificate, signed by the president and prime minister of Italy,
making him a cavaliere, or knight, he shot me a disdainful look and
commented: ``That doesn't matter. What matters is whether you think
my ice cream tastes good or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ruta's, Costanza's workshops, next door to his cafe and
shop, contain some reassuringly elderly equipment, but a lot of
modern tools, too, including automated ice cream machines. Some, he
hastened to show me, wouldn't work unless safety screens were in
place to guard against the loss of a finger. Old-fashioned he may
be; a Luddite he certainly is not.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, he also makes granita from lemons, tangerines, black
mulberries and other fruit, as well as coffee. Ricotta fills the
crisp little tubes called cannoli and the celebrated cake called
the cassata.
</P>
<P>
   But the superlative local almonds are Costanza's secret weapons;
scoop a few from a bin, blanched but unsugared, and they have a
remarkable sweetness. He makes torrone, or nougat, with them, and
fashions miniature fruits and vegetables from hand-painted almond
paste, or marzipan. That word, too, is Saracen in origin, stemming
from the Arabic ``martaban,'' but the Sicilians call it martorana,
after a Palermo convent where it was once made.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more important almond product _ the sugar-coated
nuts that we call Jordan almonds and the Sicilians call confetti.
Mary Taylor Simeti remarks in ``Pomp and Sustenance'' (Ecco Press,
1998) that ``food in Sicily shares in what I have come to regard as
the terrible density of Sicilian culture, an insular culture
compacted by centuries of foreign conquest and domestic
oppression,'' and confetti is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we Americans throw our paper confetti at brides and
bridegrooms, Sicilians sometimes hurl almonds. The custom
originated in the far-off epoch when brides were kidnapped by the
groom's friends, and the bride's defenders often threw stones or
other missiles at the captors. Confetti throwing, or so Waverly
Root reports in ``The Food of Italy'' (Vintage Books, 1992), is
simply the present-day ritualization of those long-forgotten
battles. &QL;

WHAT WAS BRADLEY-MCCAIN SHOW SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like a little dog-and-pony show to liven up a
boring political campaign _ or to help a couple of underdog
candidates grab some headlines and free TV time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more gullible among the media tried to palm it off
as historic, or at least important, but Thursday's joint appearance
by Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican John McCain to talk up
campaign finance reform was barely more than a run-of-the-mill
publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   It was different, we can give 'em that. A candidate seeking his
party's presidential nomination doesn't usually go on television
with a would-be nominee from another party _ which might be why Ted
Koppel figured that the Bradley-McCain encounter deserved exclusive
treatment on ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   What it really deserved, of course, was a giant yawn _ and
probably got it, seeing as how most public-opinion polls suggest
that voters are about as interested in campaign finance reform as
they are in Monica Lewinsky's latest diet.
</P>
<P>
   No fair-minded voter should find fault with these guys for
availing themselves of the opportunity to hype their campaigns and
take potshots at their intraparty opponents _ and to do it while
sharing the authoritative spotlight commanded by Koppel.
</P>
<P>
   But the stunt does raise a question: Exactly who was it supposed
to impress?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is obvious enough where Bradley is concerned.
Campaign finance reform is a popular issue among liberal Democrats,
who are perennial also-rans to conservative Republicans when it
comes to fund-raising. But McCain?
</P>
<P>
   McCain must know that rank-and-file Republicans and conservative
activists have no use for most of the proposals to reform campaign
finance because they are rigged to favor Democrats and punish the
GOP. Besides, conservatives generally believe that contributing
financially to a political campaign is tantamount to free speech _
and therefore that stringent restrictions on such contributions are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   So. What was a candidate for the ``Republican'' presidential
nomination trying to accomplish by participating in that
Bradley-to-McCain-to-Koppel double play?
</P>
<P>
   Best guess: He was scrounging for independent votes in New
Hampshire, where independents apparently are interested in campaign
finance reform _ and where residents can vote in either party's
primary. McCain might be gambling that independents can help him
defeat front-runner George W. Bush in the Feb. 1 primary, and that
a win in New Hampshire will give him so much momentum that he'll be
able to overtake Bush in later primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain keeps insisting that voters really do care about
campaign finance reform despite polls indicating otherwise, he
seems to be basing his strategy on the cynical assumption that
Republican voters care so little about the issue that his
anti-Republican position won't dissuade Republicans from supporting
him in party primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Give him credit for chutzpah, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Bush is right when he says that campaign finance
reform is a scam designed to neutralize the GOP's fund-raising
advantage _ and most Republican voters agree with him. Faced with
choosing between a presidential candidate who represents their
thinking (Bush) and one who is determined to sell out to the
Democrats (McCain), GOP voters won't have to think twice before
voting for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   All this is academic, anyway, because McCain's big surge in New
Hampshire is a mirage. Even if he wins that primary, he's going
nowhere. A win in New Hampshire will no more propel him to the
Republican nomination than it propelled Pat Buchanan to the
nomination when he upset Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a one-issue candidate. And his one issue, campaign
finance reform, doesn't even appeal to the voters whose support he
must enlist if he expects to give Bush a run for his, uh, money,
much less win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's headline grab with Bradley was good theater. It was not
good politics _ unless McCain hopes to be Bradley's running mate.

   You know what they say about necessity. Centuries ago, when
refined cane sugar was a luxury for aristocrats only, the common
folk made sweeteners by concentrating the juices of grapes and
other fruit into dark, viscous syrups with a touch of acidity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these age-old, often homemade sugar substitutes have
acquired culinary cachet. Chefs across the country are using them
to enrich marinades and sauces and drizzling them around braised
cabbage and pork, over sharp pecorino cheese or on creamy panna
cotta or berries. They are imported mainly from the Emilia-Romagna
region and, in the south, Apulia.
</P>
<P>
   Odette Fada, the chef at San Domenico in Manhattan, has used
fruit syrups for years. ``I get mine from a friend in Italy who
makes her own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, these sweeteners are made from wine grapes and go by
regional names like saba, sapa, vin cotto or mosto cotto. Vin cotto
means ``cooked wine'' though it is made from unfermented grape
juice, or must, and has no alcohol. In southern Italy, vin cotto is
sometimes made from figs.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro Mafrici, the chef at I Trulli, uses vin cotto from Apulia
as a glazing dip for fried Christmas cookies and to sweeten an
apple and almond cake. At Babbo and nearby Po, saba is used in
sauces and dressings. The chef, Mario Batali, said he discovered it
when he lived in Modena. ``They often make it from the grapes they
thin from the vines before the harvest, so they don't go to
waste,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, a syrup called pekmez is made from grapes or
pomegranate juice (sold as pomegranate molasses) and is more acidic
than saba. Similar concentrates are found in parts of North
America, especially in New England, where boiled cider has been a
sweetener since the Colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dark brown, intensely apple-flavored sweetener, it has at
the same time a definite snappiness that keeps it from being too
cloying,'' writes Ben Watson in ``Cider, Hard and Sweet''
(Countryman Press, $19.95). Cider mills in Vermont and Sally
Schmitt's Apple Farm in Philo, Calif., sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Balsamic vinegar is thought to have evolved from saba, said
Lynne Rossetto Kasper, the cookbook author. Both start by boiling
down the must of trebbiano or lambrusco wine grapes. ``The syrup
might have been stored in vinegar barrels, and that's how balsamico
came about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fada said she often uses saba like balsamic vinegar, as a
finishing touch for butternut squash soup. It is also delicious on
grilled radicchio or baked peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Aging gives true balsamic vinegar its complexity, and its steep
price. But add a touch of good red wine vinegar to saba or vin
cotto, and you'll have something closer to traditional $100
artisanal balsamic vinegar than the harsh industrially produced
vinegars in most stores. And you're better off spooning saba over
next spring's strawberries than using less than top-of-the-line
balsamico. At $10 to $25 for 17 ounces, saba and other syrups now
cost more than sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottled imports don't fit our budget, so we're making our
own interpretation,'' said Mark Ladner, the chef at Lupa in
Greenwich Village. He crushes red grapes, cooks the juice down with
some red wine vinegar and sugar, and adds semi-dried grapes to the
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasper notes in ``The Italian Country Table'' (Scribner,
$35) that farmers in Italy still make vin cotto or saba, though
sugar is now cheap. One farm woman told her: ``Sugar sweetens. Vin
cotto flavors.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Unhappy birthday, dear impeachment
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first anniversary of Bill Clinton's impeachment came
dribbling by the other day with precious little celebration.
Nothing more stale, I suppose, than old non-news warmed over.
</P>
<P>
   The usual suspects seemed to be working their customary sides of
the street. Monica Lewinsky was appearing as a witness in the
Maryland wiretapping trial of the pathetic Linda Tripp, who may
have the peculiar distinction of being the only participant to do
time. Impeachment managers were still insisting on the rectitude of
the enterprise. The public, which thinks more poorly of Bill
Clinton, was still yawning. Special prosecutor Ken Starr admitted
he made some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes up to which Starr owned were merely failures to
explain himself clearly enough to the public. Starr does not still
realize that explaining is what got him in trouble in the first
place. Superior spin would have made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's less than startling admission is a valuable indication,
however, as to what it was all about in the first place.

`WEIR COOKING': NEW RECIPES WITH A FAMILIAR WINE COUNTRY FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Italy)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (Eds: A recipe appears at end of review.)  (DW) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cookbook becomes a keeper when you want to take it into the
kitchen after you flip through it once. Usually, the attraction is
not the book's new culinary horizons but comfortable yet alluring
recipes that do not demand hours of work. Joanne Weir's cookbooks
are like that. They have a familiar feel and offer the best advice
for any home cook: prepare dishes made with the finest ingredients
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weir Cooking: Recipes From the Wine Country'' (Time-Life
Books, $27.50) outlines California cooking with an eye on the
Mediterranean. As Ms. Weir points out, both regions share a similar
climate and ingredients, like olives, and she fills her first
chapter with dishes fortified with their briny tang. Her excellent
mock puff pastry for an olive tart could be put to wider use.
</P>
<P>
   The book moves on to more substantial fare, like polenta cakes
with mushroom ragout, seared salmon showered with oil-infused
herbs, asparagus cheese puffs and a dessert tart with a nubbly
cornmeal texture.
</P>
<P>
   Root vegetables were excellent roasted with a splash of Marsala.
Ms. Weir did not specify whether it was to be dry or sweet: I'm
glad I had dry on hand. In a recipe for spicy shellfish stew, she
did not say what kind of clams or scallops to use. If I had good,
thick rib-eye steaks, I would grill them instead of going to the
trouble of butterflying them, filling them with a vegetable
stuffing and braising them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where in the town of Recco, on the Ligurian coast
of Italy, she ate the famous focaccia col formaggio, a kind of huge
double-crusted cheese pie made with very thin dough. But her
recipe, calling for a yeast dough, misses the mark. It's tasty but
not the real thing. Only those who had been to Recco might know the
difference.

&HT;     U.S. SAYS Y2K GLITCHES WON'T AFFECT SOCIAL SECURITY  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 44 million Americans who receive Social
Security retirement benefits will get their checks as usual on Jan.
3 _ even in the event of a Y2K-related computer failure or power
outage, the federal government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who depend on us can rest assured that their
payments will arrive on time,'' Social Security Commissioner
Kenneth Apfel told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The agency that runs the nation's Social Security retirement
system began addressing the Y2K problem in 1989 _ several years
before the rest of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security has done a wonderful job in dealing with its
own systems,'' said John Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar.
``Social Security has been a leader in the federal government in
terms of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Apfel said Social Security has been issuing checks for more than
a year using computers that have been fixed to overcome any 2000
problem. If computers are not fixed they may misread the digits
``00'' as 1900 and malfunction, potentially wrecking havoc in the
nation's air traffic control system, the power grid or the
financial sector, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Treasury Department has already printed the paper
checks that will be received by 11 million Americans next month.
Those checks will be delivered to U.S. post offices on Wednesday,
Dec. 29 _ one day earlier than usual _ to ensure they are received
by Monday, Jan. 3. Social Security benefits are always paid out on
the third of each month.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Social Security officials will have forwarded the
electronic files to the Treasury Department of the 33 million
Americans whose Social Security payments are automatically
deposited into their bank accounts. The Treasury Department will
forward those files to the Federal Reserve, which in turn will
forward the files to various banks by Dec. 30. The banks will have
until Jan. 3 to electronically deposit the money into the accounts
of individual recipients.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 30, the six million Americans who receive supplemental
Social Security disability checks will receive their benefit
payments. Those payments are normally made on the first of each
month, but because Jan. 1 is a federal holiday, the supplemental
payments are being made early and will be unaffected by any Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case there are some Y2K glitches, Apfel said the
agency is taking several steps to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will operate a 24-hour command center at its
headquarters in Baltimore from Dec. 30 to Jan. 7. Shortly before
midnight on New Year's Eve, Social Security's main computers there
will be switched to a backup generator powered by jet fuel in case
the city's power fails. If Social Security officials receive word
that there was no disruption to the regular power supply, the
computers will be plugged back into the Baltimore power grid.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 officials at more than 1,300 local Social Security
offices will be assigned to check all phones and computers to make
sure they are working and report into the national headquarters. If
there are any problems _ which are not expected _ the computers
will be fixed Jan. 1 and Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event a bank cannot receive electronic deposits,
Social Security will have the Treasury Department issue and mail
paper checks within five days. If people are unable to wait for
that check, they can go to their local Social Security office to
have the check issued immediately.

`PASSAGE TO JUNEAU': A SOLITARY SEAMAN'S VOYAGE WITH A PRICE TO
PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do we travel, especially when the reviews on leaving home
are so mixed? Blaise Pascal's aphorism that all human evil comes
from ``man's being unable to sit still in a room'' rings a clear
alarm about the hazards of restlessness. But then there is what
Jonathan Raban in ``Passage to Juneau,'' his latest book of travel,
calls ``the Romantic solitary wanderer,'' like the figure in
Shelley's first major poem who left ``His cold fireside and
alienated home/To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Raban, in sailing alone from Seattle to Juneau, Alaska, did not
discover any undiscovered lands. There are no undiscovered lands
anymore, though certainly the Inside Passage from Washington state
to Alaska, even if heavily used by cruise liners, fishing boats and
fortune seekers, is remote by most people's definition. In his last
book, ``Bad Land,'' the British-born Raban explored the meaning of
remote landlocked regions, so it made sense that he try a kind of
watery counterpart, and the goal was more defined by Shelley than
Pascal: to pursue strange truths, or perhaps truths, even if not
strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant to go fishing for reflections and come back with a
glittering haul,'' Raban writes early on, meaning reflections on
the sea as a zone of meaning, as a mirror of human vanity, as an
imminent danger, as a place where history happened and cultures
collided. ``Other people's reflections, as I thought then,'' Raban
continues, before hinting at a tragic disclosure to follow, ``I
wasn't prepared for the catch I eventually made.''
</P>
<P>
   Raban is perhaps our most literate and literary travel writer.
His books are not, as are those of many other travel writers,
essentially entertainments based on encounters with oddball
characters met on route, though a few such characters certainly do
appear on Raban's itinerary. ``Passage to Juneau'' brings its
readers through a complicated maze of physical description, of
solitary sailing tribulations and of historical-cultural
ruminations. It is a rich, even overly rich melange, showing an
author with a mind always at eloquent work but with some confusion
as to its central theme.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually his narrative is taken over by emotionally laden
personal matters: the death of his father, strains on his marriage.
These matters of private life are moving but seem distant from the
subject at hand, the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage to Juneau'' in other words is a highly intelligent and
lushly written repository of products created by a meditative and
adventurous sensibility. It has much that is brilliant, including
many passages of fine descriptive writing; it is also a caldron
overflowing with too much stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Raban boarded his 35-foot, library-equipped sailboat on April
Fool's Day, saying goodbye to his wife and the 3{-year-old daughter
whose annoyance at his temporary abandonment tinged his journey
with sadness from the beginning. As Raban navigates northward, he
establishes himself as an unillusioned observer, one attuned to
beauty but not rhapsodic about it or about nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motoring through the sound, watching for deadheads, I sailed
through a logjam of dead literary cliche,'' he writes in a passage
about scenery and Romantic poetry. ``Snowcapped peaks above,
fathomless depths below, and, in the middle of the picture, the
usual gaunt cliffs, hoary crags, wild woods, and crystal
cascades.'' And later: ``I felt that entering a landscape like
Desolation Sound was uncomfortably like wandering over a famous
battlefield left over from someone else's war. That it had been a
scene of such heightened emotion in the past only made me feel more
keenly my own absence of feeling in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Along his way Raban gives a savory history of a geographically
identical journey though the Inside Passage taken by the ships and
crew commanded by Capt. George Vancouver, whose unhappy surveying
voyage of 1791 to 1795 gave many of the islands, promontories, bays
and mountains of the Northwest Pacific their names. And so Raban's
own account of heavy tides and fog is interspersed with tales from
Vancouver's afflicted voyage, which included frequent floggings,
one grounding, many tense encounters with Indians and an
undercurrent of late-18th-century British class warfare. Raban
reflects on many other matters as well: on the impossibility of
knowing what the original native culture was; on anthropologists
like Franz Boas and Claude Levi-Strauss; on landscape painting,
Romantic poetry, even Mozart at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Raban marvelously describes the perilous unpredictability of
tides and currents. He ties up at forlorn spots where the canneries
have closed and the tourists have not yet arrived, giving a picture
of profane, unhappy men sitting in bars and cursing their fates. A
lover of nature, he distinguishes himself from a certain kin of
prayerfully reverential environmentalism associated with writers
like John Muir that in Raban's view represented a maudlin variation
on ravished-by-nature 19th-century Romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lopez's version struck me as improbably tidy and benign,''
Raban writes, Lopez being Barry Lopez, whom Raban groups with other
Northwest nature writers. ``A `design inherent' in nature implied a
designer, in whose existence I had no faith at all. `Logic' was, I
thought, a useful word so long as it  &UR; meant &LR;  logic, not some
vapory, intuited life-force.''
</P>
<P>
   The sea, in other words, like nature, may have its meanings to
some, but Raban associates it more with the chaos, the terrifying
whirling abysses that he remembers in the paintings of J.M.W.
Turner, about whom he discourses learnedly. Wildness is not
friendly, but then, it turns out, neither is human life. In the
end, Raban identifies the price he pays for his own inability to
sit quietly in a room. It would be unfair to disclose here exactly
what that price is, but it is one that gives Raban's entire account
a melancholy gloss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage to Juneau'' in a sense turns out to be a kind of
anti-travel book, a refreshingly counter-sentimental antidote to
the notion of travel as continuous adventure, quantum-leap
self-discovery. The very capaciousness of Raban's interests gives
his account a dense and tangled quality, but within every thicket
there is the kind of intellectual precision that makes going along
on this unromantic adventure very worthwhile.

&HT;     CHEERLEADERS MOBILIZE FOR HOLIDAY ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>

   ROME, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders usually work along the
sidelines, but this week they are on the front line for another
American team _ U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mission with one delightful holiday twist: When they
fall in on European stages wearing their trademark blue blouses,
white vests and white pants trimmed with stars and rhinestones,
they will cheer a team that _ unlike the Cowboys football team _
can't lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clearly the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders' mission
to give back to the troops that help keep us free and safe at
home,'' choreographer Shelly Roper-McCaslin said Monday. ``And it's
bringing a little bit of home to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the idea of this year's Defense Department-USO holiday
tour to the Balkan region of Europe. Among those making the trip
are NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw, ``Saturday Night
Live'' alumnus Al Franken, Grammy-winning country singer Mary
Chapin Carpenter and supermodel Christie Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   Roper-McCaslin and six other Cowboy cheerleaders headed east,
where they will open hourlong shows in the former Yugoslav republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina; in Kosovo, the disputed province of Serbia;
the Republic of Macedonia, another former region of Yugoslavia; and
Italy. They will entertain about 15,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen more headed to Okinawa and South Korea, continuing a
Cowboys tradition Roper-McCaslin said began in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to me to be able to go over and touch
someone's life at Christmastime,'' cheerleader Alice Phillips, 32,
said. ``It gets you warm and fuzzy inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Jim Finch, the service's top
enlisted man, would not doubt that after seeing smiles from the
cheerleaders that could melt a Bosnian snowbank.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest overseas holiday event Finch, 43, has seen in his
25-year career was in 1977, when an Air Force band played before
300 service personnel at a Royal Air Force base 60 miles west of
London.
</P>
<P>
   This tour will be far better, he said, and predicted the
cheerleaders would be a big hit with the American forces
participating in peacekeeping duties in Kosovo and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be a big treat for the troops,'' he said.
``In many cases they're young folks and have not had Christmases
away from home before, and so to have someone come out here and
entertain them makes them feel like they're somebody special and
somebody cares.''

` ANY GIVEN SUNDAY': END ZONE AS WAR ZONE ... HUT! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end.) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   As a cinematic flasher of not-so-secret mass culture fantasies,
Oliver Stone is Hollywood's R-rated answer to P.T. Barnum. Instead
of clowns, aerialists and lion tamers, he parades his own
hyper-macho vision of modern American life as a primitive
bread-and-circuses carnival of power, greed, lust, fame and
violence (especially violence). And in ``Any Given Sunday,'' his
viscerally charged, razzle-dazzle ode to professional football as a
blood sport, he comes up with some quintessentially zany Oliver
Stone moments.
</P>
<P>
   Take the scene in the locker room of the Miami Sharks in which a
heavily muscled naked football player with a mammoth sexual
endowment is placed directly in front of the camera. The shot is
held for an extra half-beat as if to say: ``Look at it. We all know
that this is what football is really about: colliding superstuds
whose bedroom conquests we would like to imagine are the erotic
equivalent of their stadium feats.''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene in which the Sharks' head coach, Tony D'Amato
(Al Pacino), lectures the hotshot young quarterback Willie Beamen
(Jamie Foxx) on being a team player, the movie lards in clips of
the climactic chariot race from ``Ben-Hur.'' In case we haven't
already gotten the movie's blatant message about football being the
home-grown equivalent of a Roman gladiatorial circus, here it is
spelled out again. Later the movie actually trots out Charlton
Heston for a cameo appearance as the moralizing commissioner of the
Associated Football Franchises of America. It should be no surprise
that Stone is as gleefully at home inside a football stadium as he
is on the battlefield, since his new movie portrays professional
football and wartime combat as variations of the same experience.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most exciting scenes take place in the bone-crushing
thick of the fray, and they provide about as acute a sense of
straining muscle and excruciating collision as a football movie
could hope to give. Like battlefield casualties, injured players
are rushed off the field on stretchers. And at halftime, the locker
room resembles a hospital emergency ward where players who are not
too badly injured are frantically sewn up and shot up with
painkillers, then sent back into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Encasing all this action, the director and his collaborators
John Logan and Daniel Pyne have erected the shell of a story that
is a crude morality play in the style of Stone's ``Wall Street.''
The biggest struggle pits the old school of football philosophy
against the new. That old school is exemplified by the battle-weary
D'Amato and the Sharks' loyal but fading star quarterback, the
legendary Jack Rooney, known as Cap (Dennis Quaid), who at 39 is
nearing the end of his career. Tony and Cap represent a cooperative
team-player ethic that is being undermined by big money and the
star-making power of television.
</P>
<P>
   The new school is embodied by the gifted but arrogant and
relatively inexperienced Willie, who catapults from third-string
quarterback into the Sharks' resident superstar. In a matter of
months, Willie has also scored a chart-topping rap hit and landed
some lucrative television commercials. But Willie is so green that
he throws up before every game. Not groomed to be a team player, he
infuriates Tony by calling his own shots in the huddle. But when
his spontaneous decisions win games and the Sharks' sagging
fortunes start to reverse, Tony's old-school philosophy is
increasingly called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Willie's flash is backed by the Sharks' ruthless owner,
Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), who, with her alcoholic mother
(Ann-Margret), inherited the team from her football legend of a
father, who was also Tony's mentor. Other moral conflicts pit the
Sharks' coldbloodedly pragmatic orthopedist, (and Dr. Feelgood)
Harvey Mandrake (James Woods), who risks the lives of the players
to keep them in the game at all costs, and its young internist,
Oliver Powers (Matthew Modine), who is appalled by Mandrake's
reckless decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the movie, the kinetic furor of the game sequences
helps camouflage the weaknesses of a screenplay that is a
mechanically contrived series of power struggles, each of which has
an issue attached to it. But as the movie develops into a kind of
mega-``Rocky'' with an end-of-game sequence that stretches nine
seconds of play into many minutes, the strains begin to show.
</P>
<P>
   Those strains extend to some crucial performances. Quaid appears
several years too old (and not in good enough shape) for his role,
and Ms. Diaz, who can be such a winning comedian, is not up to the
dramatic demands of her unsympathetic character. But Pacino's Tony
is a solid if well-worn variation on a familiar Pacino type, a
weather-beaten not-so-young true believer stretched beyond his
limits and forced to re-evaluate his entire life. The movie's
revelation is Foxx's Willie, who gracefully embodies the internal
conflicts of a talented, insecure athlete. Embittered by years of
racial discrimination and tempted by the rewards of instant
celebrity, he struggles not to lose his humanity amid the hoopla.
It's a subtle performance in a movie that has nothing else subtle
about it.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Stone's attitude toward the frenzy he has conjured is
wildly ambivalent. ``Any Given Sunday,'' like so many other Stone
films dealing with violence, embraces the visceral Dionysian thrill
of professional football with the ecstatic eagerness of a
scaredy-cat who has conquered his fear of skydiving and become
addicted to jumping out of airplanes. At the same time it is also
an expose of professional football and its sins and the mad,
mindless excesses of greed, power-mongering, exploitation and
phallic worship it enshrines.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the movie cops out. Although the story presents many
opportunities for tragedy (some situations practically beg for it),
``Any Given Sunday'' turns ludicrously upbeat as it hastily ties
all its strands together. P.T. Barnum liked happy endings too.
Circus lions are in the ring to be tamed, aerialists are expected
not to fall. The final message of ``Any Given Sunday'' is one big
thumbs up: Let the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Any Given Sunday'' is rated R. It has profanity,
sexual situations and lots of playing-field violence.

<P>
   My husband says I've always been a workaholic. When I was a kid,
I worked all the time. I got 50 cents allowance, and in high school
I got a raise to $1 a week. That was not enough to get your big toe
into a movie theater. So I used to baby-sit a lot. In high school,
I became known for cleaning houses. I was a parking lot attendant
at the University of California at Berkeley. I also worked in the
dean's office. One summer I was accepted into a program that sent
80 students to Washington. Ninety-five percent of the students
ended up as unpaid aides to members of Congress. I was one of three
who had paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I attended Berkeley in the '70s, but I was never part of the
counterculture. I was one of those students who went to all their
calculus and accounting classes. Patty Hearst lived a block away
from me when she was kidnapped by the SLA. I paid no attention. I
didn't care about politics. The summer I was in Washington, Nixon
was impeached, and everyone had to explain to me what was going on.
I was an early-stage nerd.
</P>
<P>
   I have a bachelor's degree in accounting and an MBA in finance
from Berkeley. I am a very logical person, and those are extremely
logical subjects. But by age 25, I knew there was a lot more to
life than becoming just a financial person. I wanted to really
apply my skills in an area where I could keep learning. Even back
then, I knew that computing was going to be the future.
</P>
<P>
   I basically stayed in sales for the first 10 years of my career
at IBM. They did a great job of training me on the basics of
management. The biggest reward of being a manager is not making
quota or making your business plan _ those are just the minimum
requirements to keep your job. The best reward is to watch people
achieve their full potential.
</P>
<P>
   I continue to struggle with finding a balance in my life. I'm
very lucky, because my husband, Francis Reed, works at home. We
never had a nanny for our children, Deirdre, who is 13, and John,
who is 10. Francis has always taken the primary responsibility.
Still, I have long days, and I miss them growing up. If I see the
children at all, it's only in the morning. That's the price you pay
if you want a robust career.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I are a great team, but still a lot of things
don't get done. This is not the ``Leave It to Beaver'' house. You
would never walk in our house and say, ``Isn't this beautifully
clean.'' We have a German shepherd; there are dog hairs, but it's
home.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a secret to my success, it's growing up in a family
of five girls. I was the fourth. My father had us mowing lawns,
painting rooms, changing the oil in the car. He started a girls'
softball league in the '60s _ I was an all-star first baseman. We
were sent to an all-girls high school. I was 18 or 19 before
someone intimated that I wasn't supposed to be doing something
because I was a girl. I never had any limitations placed on me.

`THE GREAT GATSBY': MUSIC CATERING   TO THE WORDS   OF FITZGERALD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One came away from ``The Great Gatsby'' at the
Metropolitan Opera on Monday night thinking not so much about Daisy
Buchanan, Nick Carraway or even Gatsby himself, but of what a nice
man John Harbison must be. His new opera has many responsibilities
to serve and much to live up to, and Harbison's sense of duty is
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the obligations incurred: a handsome commission from
the Met; a gilt-edged cast; an elegant staging by Mark Lamos,
Michael Yeargan and Jane Greenwood; the ministrations of one of the
world's great opera conductors, James Levine; voluminous
pre-premiere publicity; and finally an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel of
iconic stature.
</P>
<P>
   In 3 hours and 15 minutes this composer serves his several
masters with all the imagination at his disposal. When original
dramatic effects are required, Harbison is there with his thudding
percussive strokes. When scenes cry out for music of the Jazz Age,
combos and megaphoned pop singers materialize onstage performing
convincing syntheses of 1920s popular style. Everywhere is the
spirit of accommodation. Every need is tended to, promptly and
caringly.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful opera, on the other hand, may be more than doing the
right thing. I have long gone along with the idea that success in
this field means the judicious blend of music and words. ``The
Great Gatsby'' makes me wonder. Powerful opera may well start with
the monstrous musical ego: cruel to literature and contemptuous of
everything around it. A friend suggested to me that opera ought not
to be allowed near great writing, which ``Gatsby'' certainly is. I
would alter that to say that opera should not be allowed to treat
great writing with too much respect.
</P>
<P>
   For minutes at a stretch Harbison's music patiently accompanies
operatic narrative and conversation that an Alban Berg would have
squeezed mercilessly into seconds. One inches along these dreary
passages waiting for the bursts of interest that occasionally
appear. The composer tries to fill up long stretches with
interesting music, but legato singing lines played against a busy
movement in the orchestra results too often in mutual
nullification. I wish there were more rhythmic and metric life in
Harbison's music, but the tamely uniform sequential patterns simply
do not rouse the ear.
</P>
<P>
   To compare Harbison's music with Verdi's would be manifestly
unfair, but manner and approach are another matter. Verdi's love of
Shakespeare did not prevent him from pouring acid over the skin and
viscera of magnificent prose-poetry and writing operas using only
the skeletal remains. Harbison's own libretto (with song lyrics by
Murray Horwitz) extrudes and compresses, but it may be too
respectful of Fitzgerald for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Gatsby'' is in two acts and 10 scenes, the latter
bridged by orchestral interludes. Harbison ends with Gatsby's
funeral, omitting Nick Carraway's final encounter with the
Buchanans. This is sound theater in the big-finale tradition,
although Fitzgerald's final sigh of despair might have been an
updated, domesticated version of Mussorgsky's Idiot at the end of
``Boris Godunov.'' The Long Island decor, backed by sheer, silken
curtains, is elegance itself, and Ms. Greenaway's costumes, both
men's and women's, are a constant delight.
</P>
<P>
   The opera catches fire twice, both times in the party scenes.
Here music and dance do what they should be doing, overwhelming
everything around them. Robert La Fosse's choreography glitters
with frenetic energy and great charm. The cast is splendid. Dawn
Upshaw and Susan Graham are Daisy and Jordan and could scarcely be
better. Dwayne Croft's baritone as Nick is in luxurious condition,
and Mark Baker is a forceful Tom Buchanan. Jerry Hadley takes the
title role. His slightly overworked top register is probably an
acquired taste (though one not in my possession). The Wilsons _
Lorraine Hunt Lieberson and Richard Paul Fink _ provide the needed
rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in ``The Great Gatsby,'' partly buried, lies an
effective opera. Harbison is beholden to perhaps too many elements
of this enterprise, but every so often his musical imagination
rises, hearteningly, in revolt. His opera may also be the victim of
the inflated expectations surrounding it. With a little less star
treatment, ``The Great Gatsby'' might have passed quietly and
benignly into our lives.
</P>

 &HT;    Yummy appetizers come to fore at this most festive time of year
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the French decreed in the 17th century that hors
d'oeuvres should be served before a meal, we are, after all,
approaching the 21st, and times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   After a holiday season of preparing sumptuous, sit-down feasts,
it may be the perfect time to alter the pace, take appetizers off
the sidelines and put them into the spotlight of your New Year's
celebration. Indeed, a buffet table brimming with trays of savory
morsels and a crystal bowl of sparkling punch can be perfectly
suited for a relaxed and festive evening of revelry.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to be a professional caterer to create
awesome appetizers, either. Most are simple, fun to prepare and
allow for unlimited creativity in presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and cold meats, fish, cheeses, fruits and vegetables can be
mixed and matched, stuffed, rolled, dipped and wrapped in unlimited
ways to create unexpected tastes and textures. Better yet,
quantities can be easily adjusted to serve two or 200. And best of
all _ for the host or hostess _ most appetizers can be made ahead
and frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most difficult part of putting together an
appetizer buffet is deciding what will grace your table. Help is
out there. The Larousse Gastronomique devotes no fewer than 15
encyclopedic pages to hors d'oeuvres, and the Internet has many
times more.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nobody will miss a sit-down dinner of turkey or ham when
presented with a lovely display of antipasto kebabs of salami,
peppers, zucchini, olives and cherry tomatoes drenched in oil,
lemon juice and minced garlic. It's but one of hundreds of
appetizer ideas you'll find at
www.ichef.com/ichef-recipes/Appetizers/table-g.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If it can be stuffed, rolled, dipped, spread or made into a
log, you'll find it among the recipes at
sunsite.auc.dk/recipes/english/cat10
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For a variety of gourmet appetizers with lots of cheese and
vegetarian choices, see
www.ama-assn.org/insight/genhlth/gourmet/recapp.htm and
www.thebodygourmet.com/recappet.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Making appetizers ahead of time and freezing them guarantees a
fun evening for the host. Crab Bites, Blue Cheesecake, Sausage
Spinach Balls, Baked Clam Loaf, Sausage Cheese Bites, Cajun Clams,
Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Teriyaki Stuffed Pepperoncini, Savory Clam
Balls and Tortilla Pinwheels are a few of the surprisingly simple
recipes you can make ahead and freeze. See
busycooks.about.com/library
</P>
<P>
   /weekly/aa120699.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And then there are dips, which present a separate array of
taste-bud tempters. Put aside containers of prepared ranch and
French onion dips _ this is, after all, the millennium. Check out
the excellent links at
cheese.about.com/home/cheese/msub7.htm?REDIR404
</P>
<P>
   &QC; yes&AMP; for fantastic collections of dips, spreads, sauces, easy
mousses and salsas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When choosing dips, don't think chips _ think fine British
crackers, crusty rounds of French bread, pita wedges or bagel
thins. Check out the import section of the grocery and see what you
can come up with. Go all out and save the chips for the Super Bowl.

 &HT;    Key lime juice puts some bite into wafers
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Louise Gay of Blairsville, Ga., wrote for cookie
recipes using bottled Key lime juice, I thought of Key Lime
Squares. Since that recipe was published in this paper several
years ago, it has become one of my favorites for cookie trays,
providing a welcome alternative to chocolates and vanillas, pecans
and peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   We published her request, though, hoping to get some more ideas.
This recipe for Lime Meltaways, originally published in Martha
Stewart Living in 1995, was sent in by Billie Boswell of Roswell,
Ga., who added a disclaimer that she is no fan of Stewart's and it
was a ``fluke'' she came across the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we're glad she did. These bite-size wafers are a snap to
make, and they hold just the right balance of sweet and tart.

<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners' sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Key lime juice or freshly squeezed lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 2 limes

</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, cream butter and 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
until fluffy. (Place remaining confectioners' sugar in a plastic
zip-top bag and set aside.) Add lime juice, zest and vanilla,
beating until incorporated (some of the juice may not be absorbed
completely).

   In a separate bowl, stir together flour, cornstarch and salt.
Add to butter mixture and beat on low speed until combined.

   When ready to prepare, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking
sheet with parchment. Slice dough logs into 1/8-inch-thick coins.
Place rounds on sheet, about 1 inch apart.

 &HT;    How to organize your home
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 23.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders and Alma Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough's enough.
</P>
<P>
   That realization made Kimberly Harrison seek professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem I'd been working on for a while, but I finally
just needed someone to help me get a handle on things,'' says the
Woodstock homemaker and mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison suffers from one of today's most common addictions _
stuff. The excess of the '90s, heaped by a lack of time for
organizing it, has snowballed into an avalanche of clutter that
leaves homeowners like her chronically frustrated. That is, until
this month when Harrison hired a professional organizer to help her
and her family get a grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a new person now,'' she says. ``It is such a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as consumers brace for Saturday's delivery of even more
``stuff'' while eyeing the new year as a time for changing habits,
masses of others will seek relief as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their biggest resolutions each New Year's are to get healthy
and to get their closet organized,'' says Jim Stockstill, a trainer
for the Container Store in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer is among a growing number of storage businesses
targeting the time-pressed consumer's weakness for disarray. And
for those too busy or too overwhelmed by organizational products to
shop, there are hundreds of experts willing to unravel a mess for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization industry is just booming,'' says Judith
Kolberg, president of the 50-member Georgia chapter of the National
Association of Professional Organizers. ``People are just wired to
the max and looking for an antidote for simplifying their lives.
There's also the recycling consciousness. People don't want to
waste anything _ and especially their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some professionals specialize in business organization, while
others concentrate on homes, says Kolberg, whose own niche is the
``chronically disorganized.''
</P>
<P>
   The pantry was the starting point when Harrison hired Charlotte
DeMarco to make sense of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge walk-in pantry that had become a storehouse for
lots of toys, lots of kids' clothes _ everything but food,'' says
Harrison, whose children are 3 and 1. ``We couldn't find a thing in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco removed everything from the pantry and created labels
for organizing the shelves by category. She then placed tiered
units on the shelves so that the labels on all canned goods could
be seen. Baskets and a turkey basting pan became instant storage
bins. ``I didn't have to buy a plethora of things,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco moved seasonal housewares, such as Christmas and picnic
items, to a new home in cabinets over the fridge, the least
accessible yet most practical place for such seldom used things.
</P>
<P>
   By simply purging the pantry of other items, Harrison was left
with two large bags filled with garbage and two giant boxes of
giveaways. The job, which cost about $200 for seven hours of work,
also left her with a lesson she won't soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to organizing, DeMarco taught her to think of
every item in the house as either ``friend, acquaintance or
stranger.'' Friends are called on all the time, acquaintances are
needed only some of the time, while strangers aren't allowed in the
house. The message? Store each accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that,'' Harrison says. ``This morning, as I
walked through rooms, I started asking myself, `Do I really need
this anymore?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bedroom Closet
</P>
<P>
   One of the home's most disorganized areas is the bedroom closet,
so once in order, it provides a sense of satisfaction few can deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is make everything where you can see it and
access it easily,'' says Lance Stadmiller of California Closets in
Atlanta, which designs and installs storage systems. ``Once you
have a place for things, you don't have to think about it. You know
where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Organize a closet by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Taking inventory of everything you would like to store in the
closet. Separate items by season and store noncurrent ones in
another part of the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Donating articles you rarely wear to charity or storing them
in a box for a future garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Removing the clothes-hanging bars so that you can more easily
visualize the amount of space. Measure the floor-to-ceiling space
and, if adequate, install double-hung bars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Purchasing a storage system that can be reconfigured as your
needs change or if you move.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Protecting your belongings. ``A lot of people invest in
clothing but don't protect it,'' said Jim Stockstill of the
Container Store. Choose quality products that won't damage
clothing, such as plastic hangers, clear plastic shoe boxes,
tie/belt racks, hanging accessory organizers and pest-protection
items, including cedar blocks and sachets. &QR;  Storing
special-occasion shoes in clear boxes on high shelves to save space
for everyday wear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Standing purses upright between vertical shelf dividers so
they are easy to see and retain their shapes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Taking advantage of space under the bed for long-term storage
of items, placed in clear containers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using the back of the door for hanging racks and bags for
shoes, belts, ties, scarves, jewelry and other accessories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Adding a trash can for holding dry-cleaning bags and wire
hangers.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen/Pantry
</P>
<P>
   No area contains more items than a kitchen, so don't let an
organization job there overwhelm you. Always start small, with a
drawer or cabinet, Stockstill says.
</P>
<P>
   Start by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Considering one of the variety of storage systems on the
market for maximizing the space inside your cabinets and pantry.
The most practical ones can be expanded by adding shelves, drawers
and doors as needs change.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Making spice jars easy to see by placing them on tiered units
on shelves. Spices tend to prefer a dark area, so don't leave
frequently used jars on counters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Placing a step stool in the pantry that can be hung on the
back of the door or wall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using deep drawers for bulky potato chip bags or cereal boxes,
and shallow ones for napkins and placemats.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using turntables in hard-to-get-to corner cabinets and in
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Storing opened boxes of cereals and grains in clear containers
for saving space and avoiding bugs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Repairing or discarding small appliances that are broken.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using dividers to organize utensils.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Placing tiered units on top shelves so that items can be seen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using vertical space in cabinets but not placing items on top
of things, such as stacks of plates. Instead, use racks to elevate
items.
</P>
<P>
   bathroom
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge in organizing a bathroom is counter space.
Maximize it by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using jewelry trays and valets for holding keys and change.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Storing cosmetics in clear acrylic containers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Placing soaps, shampoos and conditioners in shower totes or on
wall racks attached with suction cups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using rolling carts, wall-mounted racks and over-the-door
racks for holding toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   children's rooms
</P>
<P>
   Few things create more clutter than toys because kids rarely
return them to their neat boxes after playing with them. Make toy
storage fun by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choosing brightly colored stackable bins for holding
odd-shaped toys.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Storing them in groups of like items.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Creating a bulletin board to which wooden cutouts and other
small items can be attached with Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Providing deep clear plastic chests.
</P>
<P>
   holiday items
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't felt the frustration of untangling a string of
Christmas lights or wrestling with crumpled gift wrap? Avoid
compounding your holiday stress by:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Storing ornaments in compartmentalized bins and boxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wrapping tree lights around cardboard dividers and storing
them in a box.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Storing rolls of gift wrap, along with bows, ribbons, scissors
and tape, in a flat, compartmentalized box or plastic bin.
</P>
<P>
   10 TIPS TO GET ORGANIZED
</P>
<P>
   Here are some general tips for organizing your home, according
to the Container Store, Target, California Closets and the National
Association of Professional Organizers:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Edit belongings for items that can be thrown away, donated to
charity or sold in a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Decide which items need to be accessible and which can be
stored.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visibility, flexibility and accessibility are the keys to
storage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get in the habit of putting things away immediately and not
letting them stack up.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Designate one central location in the house where all mail,
including bills, magazines and junk mail, can be sorted. Give all
family members a box, with their name labeled on it, for holding
their mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Throw out junk mail and magazines after tearing out anything
of interest for future reference.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create a tickler file for papers with dates and deadlines that
require attention later. Include files for each month and one
labeled ``current'' with dividers marked 1-31 for each day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get rid of any box, except for ones holding memorabilia and
keepsakes, that you haven't looked inside in two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you're planning a yard sale, designate a box for collecting
the items.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get rid of clothes and accessories you haven't worn in two
years.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exceptionally dry weather pattern will cover most of the
nation for the next several days. Unusually strong high pressure
centered near the Northwest coast will expand across the Plains
into the East suppressing moist air far to the south over southern
parts of Florida and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cold air will continue to spread gradually through the East
Coast states as breezes from the northwest import Canadian air.
Wednesday will begin with clouds near the coast from the Carolinas
to southern New England as low pressure moves quickly out to sea
off the Northeast coast. Patchy rain will linger much of the day
near the Middle Atlantic coast, but farther north, clouds will
break during the afternoon. Much of the interior Northeast will
have ample sun, although patchy clouds and snow showers will occur
near the eastern shores of the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   A moisture-starved disturbance will produce patches of clouds
and a few flurries near the central Mississippi Valley and northern
Ohio Valley. Otherwise, the Middle West will be dry and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will expand from the southern Rio Grande Valley to the
mountains of eastern New Mexico and western Texas. Patchy snow will
occur in the higher terrain, while a few light showers dampen lower
elevations. Farther north, areas of clouds and snow showers will
linger near the central and northern Rockies, particularly along
north-facing slopes. West of the Rockies, sunshine will be
plentiful as very strong high pressure remains nearly stationary
over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Direct Connect &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 inches of snow fell Saturday at Yakutat, Alaska, as
a south-to-north channel of moisture originating over Hawaii
connected the two states. As a general rule, weather moves from
west to east, but, on occasion, particularly in winter, there are
transitions to patterns in which weather moves nearly parallel to
longitude lines rather than latitude lines. Such a pattern, with
cold air flowing far south and warm air far north, often results in
great storminess. Currently, however, there has been no potent
disturbance to touch off a chain of events leading up to a big
storm. &QL;

 &HT;        Agencies get cyber 
 &HT;     By Tania Anderson and Jonathan Lipman

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 -- Two federal agencies launched online
databases Tuesday that are expected to make life easier for small
business owners. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is making it
easier to check progress on patents and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation is making its survey of bank and thrift
deposits accessible in an online database.
</P>
<P>
   The Patent Application Information Retrieval (PAIR) system will
make it possible for applicants or their attorneys ``to get
up-to-the-minute information...without compromising the
confidentiality or security of pending or abandoned applications,''
a Commerce Department release said. Users will be able to download
information such as whether a filing date has been recorded, the
current status of the application, and the examiner's name and
contact information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our customers will appreciate the ease of using
PAIR as more and more of the agency's products and services become
available on the Internet,'' said Q. Todd Dickinson, Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks, in the statement. ``It should be
particularly helpful to small businesses and small inventors as it
makes it more convenient to check the status of pending
applications,''
</P>
<P>
   Since patent data is private by law, businesses interested in
using the computer system will have to obtain free software from
the patent office in order to receive encrypted data from the PAIR
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation posted its most recent
deposit survey of all insured bank and savings institution offices
on http://www2.fdic.gov/sod. The FDIC's Summary of Deposits shows
the address of each of the more than 84,000 insured bank and
savings institution offices throughout the nation, plus the amount
of deposits reported by each office.
</P>
<P>
   The summary typically is used to evaluate market share for each
financial institution operating offices in any state, county or
city. Holding company market-share data at the state level also are
available. The website includes tables and graphs reflecting
aggregate national statistics for the industry, as well as data for
each state, county and metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   These online services come soon after the White House sent memos
to each federal agency head to make government information more
accessible on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has the potential to enhance civil society as
well as to boost commerce,'' said President Clinton in a statement.

PARIS' POMPIDOU CENTER UNEARTHS THE MUSEUM WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ For its 20th birthday in 1997, the Georges Pompidou
Center got a much-needed paint job that made the polychromatic
neo-industrial building in eastern Paris look more like the
cultural fun palace it was designed to be. Then it shut down for 27
months to allow its insides to be torn apart and thoroughly
reorganized. Now, on the inevitable date of Jan. 1, France's most
visited arts institution finally reopens to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The results are impressive. Its permanent collection of modern
and contemporary art has been given 50 percent more space. The
public information library, one of its main attractions, has been
brought up to date and expanded. The main foyer has been
redesigned, and the basement has four theaters for dance, cinema
and theater. At long last, the center will even have a top-class
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying this ambitious $90 million makeover, a perhaps more
fundamental reflection has been taking place about the center's
future role. With some 150 million visitors in its first 20 years,
the Pompidou Center was undeniably a success, but its original
multifaceted mission was gradually lost in the crowds. Now its plan
is to reopen with a clearer purpose and a fresh creative spirit.
And perhaps fewer visitors.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is one likely consequence of denying free access
to its sixth-level glass-paneled viewing platform. Until 1997, 20
percent of the center's 8 million annual visitors _ in the main
foreign tourists _ rode the escalators up the outside of the
building to the platform for the sights. They spent nothing, saw no
art and added to wear-and-tear. ``The center had become a machine
for looking out at Paris,'' said its president, Jean-Jacques
Aillagon. ``Some tour operators even charged for the visit when it
was free.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, then, while admission to the center's
cavernous foyer will remain free to the public, admiring Paris from
the platform will require a $4.50 ticket. The view is intended as
bait to lure people to the fourth and fifth levels of the center,
where with the same ticket they can visit the National Museum of
Modern Art and its extraordinary collection of 20th-century works.
In fact, a crucial objective of the ``new'' center is to focus
attention on that museum.
</P>
<P>
   It has been housed in the center since 1977, but its name is
little known (and often confused with the Museum of Modern Art of
the City of Paris in the Palais de Tokyo), and its identity has
been obscured by that of the center, which is in turn widely known
in Paris as the Beaubourg (the name of one street that runs by it).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the museum does not have a single iconic work, like
``Mona Lisa,'' to ensure its automatic inclusion on bus tours of
Paris. Thus while the center always draws good crowds to its
temporary shows (``Matisse'' in 1993 attracted 735,000 visitors),
the museum has been surprisingly overlooked, with just 700,000
visitors annually compared with 6 million or so for the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the center is not about to abandon blockbusters.
So ``Picasso Sculptor'' will be a major exhibition from June 7 to
Sept. 25, ``The Pop Years'' is planned for early 2001, and a
Dubuffet retrospective will open in the summer of 2001. Also on the
schedule are smaller shows dedicated to the photography of Nan
Goldin, the architecture of Jean Nouvel and the artworks of Daniel
Buren.
</P>
<P>
   To Werner Spies, the museum's director, its 20th-century art is
matched only by that of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. And
if in the past it was not always presented as a living collection,
its reorganization, he says, should now make it more appealing to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reopening of the Pompidou Center is perhaps the true birth
of the museum because never before has our collection been seen
with such impact,'' said Spies, who has supervised the display of
some 1,600 works from the museum's 45,000-piece collection. ``In
the past, there were people who didn't even know there was a museum
here. I would hope that the Pompidou Center will now become
synonymous with the National Museum of Modern Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Spies has done his bit. Until 1997, people taking the escalator
to temporary shows or to the viewing platform on the sixth level
could enter the museum on the fifth level. Then they visited the
modern galleries, which show art from 1905 to 1960, but rarely
bothered to include the contemporary collection, covering the
period since 1960, on the fourth level.
</P>
<P>
   Now the museum's entrance is on the fourth level, leading
visitors first to the contemporary collection, starting with Jean
Tinguely's ``Requiem for a Dead Leaf,'' Claes Oldenberg's ``Giant
Ice Bag'' and Warhol's ``10 Times Liz.'' ``In the past, people
didn't go down to the contemporary galleries,'' Spies said. ``In
museums, it's a bit pejorative to go  &UR; down &LR; . Now they climb toward
jubilation.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before they do, however, the expanded contemporary floor looks
better than ever, with some rooms dedicated to such key movements
as Pop Art, Arte Povera, Op Art, Fluxus and the like, and others to
individual artists, among them Beuys, Dubuffet, Gerhard Richter,
Christian Boltanski and Annette Messager. And for the first time,
design and architecture are treated as contemporary art. Over the
last two years, the museum has also bought works by Oldenberg, Ms.
Messager, Sophie Calle, Christo and others.
</P>
<P>
   The staircase to the modern galleries on the fifth level ends at
Picasso's sculpture ``Little Girl Skipping Rope'' and Le Douanier
Rousseau's painting ``La Guerre.'' Dozens of galleries then lead
off a broad ``avenue'' that runs the length of the building, again
with some dedicated to movements, starting with Fauvism and Cubism,
and others highlighting and contrasting works by 20th-century
masters, from Picasso, Braque, Brancusi, Kandinsky and Matisse to
Miro, Dali and Max Ernst. Picasso's ``Mercure,'' a large painting
on cloth, has been restored for the occasion, and Francis Picabia's
``Dresseur d'Animaux'' is among the new acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Another novelty is that the museum's contemporary display will
be rehung every 18 months and its modern galleries every year, both
to make use of its vast stored collection and to create mini-shows
of different artists or movements. Two new fourth-level spaces, the
Museum Gallery and the Graphic Art Gallery, will feature individual
artists or special projects. Yet another space will house the
museum's new media collection.
</P>
<P>
   Below the museum, with all administration offices moved to an
adjacent building, two entire floors are now given over to the
public information library, which remains open to the public
without charge and has traditionally accounted for 40 percent of
visits to the Pompidou Center. In hindsight, this is perhaps a
strange place to put a library, but it was part of French President
Georges Pompidou's idea of founding a multicultural institution
with an interdisciplinary vocation. And the written word was
included.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, however, interdisciplinary activities faltered.
There was cinema, dance, theater, architecture, industrial design,
music (through the Institute of Research and Coordination of
Acoustic Music, better known as Ircam) and of course the visual
arts, but each went its own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived here four years ago, the center had become a
`cultural hotel' in which each art form locked itself in its own
room,'' Aillagon recalled. ``I remember saying, `If you're just
going to share a building, you might do well to plan your own
buildings.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the reopening, then, Aillagon has used his position as
president not only of the center but also of the library and Ircam
to promote cross-fertilization of the arts, something other museums
are trying (the Louvre, for example, now has theater, concert and
movie programs) and the Pompidou Center is already well equipped
for.
</P>
<P>
   For the center's first temporary show, ``Le Temps, Vite,'' an
exhibition about time that runs Jan. 13 through April 17, German
composer Heiner Goebbels has been commissioned to write a score to
accompany visitors, while Ircam will echo the show's theme in six
concerts. In addition some 50 writers will participate in a public
reading of Proust's ``Remembrance of Things Past.''
</P>
<P>
   With space for temporary shows now available in three galleries
on the sixth level, two on the fourth level and one on the first
level, the center will also be able to present very different
exhibitions at the same time with the hope that visitors will be
encouraged to pass from drawings to architecture, from sculpture to
video art. And to remind readers where they are, large sculptures
by Frank Stella and Dubuffet are being stationed at the entrance to
the library.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, then, as it comes of age, the Pompidou Center as a
whole is starting life afresh. During its first 20 years it not
only helped gentrify the surrounding neighborhoods of Les Halles
and Le Marais, with its sloping plaza alive with street performers
and artists, but it also encouraged other European cultural
institutions to diversify their approach to the arts. Now it wants
to return to its founding principles and demonstrate that it is
still a pioneer. It may remain the Beaubourg to Parisians, but in
the future it wants to be known as a museum with a difference.

 &HT;    FEELINGS MIXED IN ISRAEL ABOUT HOSTING MILLENNIUM
 &HT;    750 and adds
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM_ This is the year 5760 according to the Jewish
calendar. But, the Jewish state finds itself playing the ambivalent
host to the Christian millennium.
</P>
<P>
   As one rabbi puts it, Israelis feel like they are letting
outsiders use their house for a party they do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any discussion in Israel about what the
millennium means to Christians,'' said Rabbi Donniel(cq) Hartman,
an advocate of religious pluralism at the Shalom Hartman Institute
in Jerusalem. ``The whole country has just sort of been asleep
about the whole issue. Just not even there. And our preparation
shows as a result of it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $90 million worth of preparations _ paving roads and
walkways, building new police stations, adding security cameras _
are still underway to accommodate expected crowds at tourist sites.
Still, tourism industry officials criticize Israel's preparation as
sluggish. And at one point the country's religious affairs ministry
asked hotels to keep Christmas trees, the most recognizable image
of the Christian holiday season, behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Christians want to remind the Israelis that their country
includes many of Christianity's holiest sites. Jerusalem's Church
of the Holy Sepulcher is where many believe Christ was crucified.
Nazareth's Basilica of the Annunciation is where it is believed an
angel informed the Virgin Mary she would give birth to Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Christians urge Israelis to face up to their obligations as the
keeper of these holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Father Peter Vasko, a member of the Franciscan board that
oversees holy sites in the Middle East, takes exception with
Hartman's party-in-the-house analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity is part and parcel of this land, whether people
like it or not,'' said Vasko, once a travel agency executive in
Atlanta. ``It's not just their house. It's the house of Christians,
too. It is shared by both.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone poll of 479 people conducted by Gallup Israel two
weeks ago and released Tuesday showed that Jewish Israelis know
little about Christianity. The margin of error was plus or minus
4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 27.2 percent knew that Dec. 25 was a date of significance
and 44.1 percent said Dec. 31 this year has no special meaning to
them.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, most American Christians probably could not
recognize the date of a Jewish holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as on most issues, Israelis are split about the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The majority lead secular lives and are indifferent or
unbothered by the turn of the western Gregorian calendar, which
many of them follow.
</P>
<P>
   Though New Years Eve falls on the Friday night sabbath, when
most stores and restaurants must stay closed, there are parties
planned in the cork-popping, midnight-kissing traditions of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis view the millennium as at least mildly interesting
and a boon to tourism in a sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important, but it's interesting,'' said Israeli Ike
Kedm(cq), 54, a labor union treasurer in Jerusalem. ``If you don't
have a lot of tourists, the city starts to get boring.''
</P>
<P>
   But, there have been cries of concern from leaders of the
ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, comprising about 10 percent of the
country. They stress the historically rough relationship between
Christians and Jews. They are suspicious about the missionary
intentions of Christians coming here.
</P>
<P>
   Yaakov Sabag, kosher supervisor for the Ministry of Religious
Affairs, which issued the Christmas tree ruling, said trees in
public could conjure up images of the violent Holy Land Crusades of
the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas tree, Sabag told Cox Newspapers, would hurt an
Israeli's feelings, ``like the Swastika hurts peoples' feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the anticipation that cities display when hosting
a Super Bowl or Olympics, decorations for the millennium seem
light. There are banners stating ``Welcome to Jerusalem 2000'' on
street lights in Jerusalem, but little other fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The media focus has been on security concerns about Christian
fanatics. There has been little written about the significance the
millennium holds for the vast majority of the peaceful pilgrims
expected.
</P>
<P>
   What Rabbi Hartman calls Israel's ``polite silence'' is
accentuated by the festivities next door in areas controlled by the
Palestinian Authority. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has
himself been involved in planning the celebrations taking place in
Bethlehem, which is located in a Palestinian-controlled sector of
the West Bank.

<P>
   In his opening address to the parliament in July, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak could not have made the millennial ambivalence
any clearer, as he awkwardly tried to draw on some millennial
inspiration: ``In the entire world, there is great anticipation of
the coming millennium. The Hebrew calendar does not recognize this,
and for most of us the change of date between 31 December and 1
January is not a day of celebration. But we are part of the world,
and this new government will cross the line into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials maintain that they are making all the
necessary preparations, but that the celebrations are not their
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a state event. It's a Christian religious event,''
said Uri Mor, the Israeli government's liaison with Christian
communities. ``The Christian community directs the events. The
government takes it on its shoulders to help implement the event.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Jewish state includes more than 100,000 Christian
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, they will be supplemented by Christians who are
expected to make up the bulk of the 3.2 million visitors to the
country _ almost 30 percent more than the previous high. One
expected visitor is Pope John Paul II, planning his first visit in
March.

<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The poll released Tuesday showed that about 53 percent of
Israelis view that visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based International Fellowship of Christians and
Jews, a group that raises money for Israeli Jewish charities,
sponsored the poll. The group's leaders stressed that most Israelis
think this year's influx of visitors will help Israel ``prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   But, 16.7 percent Israelis said that the more American
Christians coming to visit, ``the bigger the threat posed to
Israel's Jewish character.'' That number was heavily weighted by
respondents who considered themselves ultra-Orthodox, a significant
share of the population of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, Israel office director of the Anti-Defamation
League, said ultra-Orthodox Israelis tend to focus more on history
than other Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But, he decried a nearly complete lack of Christian studies in
the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That has slowed Jewish-Christian understanding, he said, and it
is showing up in Israeli ignorance about Christianity at the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little understanding of the practices and
teachings,'' he said. ``The year 2000 is a great opportunity to
start the process of righting the wounds of the past.''

   BKN-HAWKS-TERRY _ ATLANTA _ When Jason Terry was acquired with
the 10th pick of the 1999 NBA draft, it was thought that he would
jump immediately into the starting lineup and lead the new-look
Atlanta Hawks. Although he hasn't worked his way into the starting
lineup, Terry is playing a key role off the bench for the team. He
has played well in spots, but has also shown the mistakes of a
rookie. A look at the play of the Hawks' top pick after the first
20 games of the season. (Denberg, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

'MAN ON THE MOON': EXPLORING THE OUTER LIMITS OF AN ODD COMEDIC
UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Kaufman's mind games with his audiences played on an
element of the unknown. Whether he was treating everyone in
Carnegie Hall to milk and cookies or spewing abuse in his corrosive
Tony Clifton mode, it was crucial that the viewer never know
whether to laugh or squirm. Kaufman's precocious genius for ironic
detachment seemed extreme, to the point where his death in 1984
struck even his loved ones as a possible put-on. But time has
turned Kaufman into a hugely influential avatar of confrontational
comedy. Jim Carrey, to name just one spiritual descendant, would
not be possible without him.
</P>
<P>
   Now Carrey delivers an electrifying homage in ``Man on the
Moon,'' Milos Forman's vivid re-creation of Kaufman's too-short and
enduringly strange career. (The film takes its title from R.E.M.'s
ghostly musical tribute to the Kaufman spirit.) In a film that
summons its subject's most memorable creative inventions as a
series of greatest hits, Carrey makes a flawless, uncanny
impersonator. It's all here: the timid, wide-eyed Foreign Man, the
sneering wrestling matches with women, the reading of ``The Great
Gatsby'' in its entirety to a dumbfounded college audience, the
priceless pantomime of the ``Mighty Mouse'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   But what is missing here, though it might have been the first
thing expected from an ostensible film biography, is an answer to
the simplest question: Who was Andy Kaufman, and how did he get
that way? ``Man on the Moon,'' which takes the form of a
surprisingly straightforward show business rise-and-fall story,
isn't telling. Whether this is a strictly artistic choice or an
indication that the generous treatment of Kaufman's agent,
girlfriend and immediate family make this a somewhat authorized
version, it limits the film's ability to give Kaufman three
dimensions. That's a dramatic liability even if you believe, as
perhaps the filmmakers do, that Kaufman was no more of a cipher to
audiences than he was to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' is another big, vibrant collaboration
between Forman and the screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry
Karaszewski. Together they brilliantly evoked the world of ``The
People vs. Larry Flynt'' in all its absurdity and unlikely
gravitas. But their new film remains more opaque, perhaps because
Kaufman was such a self-conscious figure in the first place. Unlike
Flynt or Ed Wood (whom the writers also summoned so wonderfully in
Tim Burton's film), Kaufman does not offer the creative leeway of
an unexamined life.
</P>
<P>
   Hamstrung as it may be, ``Man on the Moon'' is still a
formidable piece of work. As it dutifully revisits the milestones
of the Kaufman career, the film benefits enormously from Carrey's
way of channeling his character.
</P>
<P>
   Artfully distilled, the Kaufman happenings (that's what they
were) are rendered faithfully yet made tighter and funnier. Without
losing Kaufman's penchant for letting an audience twist in the
wind, Carrey adds his own stamp to the material by making it
brighter.
</P>
<P>
   Fleshing out the story of how Kaufman progressed from a
middle-class upbringing in Great Neck, N.Y., to the crowd-baiting
outer limits of the comedy frontier, the film needs to give him a
succession of sounding boards. These include Danny DeVito (one of
the film's producers) as the agent George Shapiro, who is given a
``Eureka!'' moment when he is first made privy to a Kaufman put-on,
and who later becomes Kaufman's staunch protector.
</P>
<P>
   Also used here in a similar capacity is Bob Zmuda (played
likably by Paul Giamatti), the writing partner and co-conspirator
who helped Kaufman create his boorish lounge-act alter ego, Tony
Clifton. The unapologetic ugliness and aggression of the Clifton
character is, like Kaufman's avid delight in wrestling women
(Courtney Love appears as one of them), a kink that the film leaves
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Man on the Moon'' is rated R. It includes profanity
and sexual situations involving prostitution.

&HT;     FULL MOON BREEDS PREDICTIONS OF GLOOM, DOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The world probably won't end Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the sky should be a bit brighter, and the Earth's
inhabitants may act a little goofier.
</P>
<P>
   While some police officers, ambulance medics, bartenders and
cabbies swear it is true, there is little scientific evidence to
support the common belief that people really are crazier during a
full moon.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sun, moon and Earth are in a rare alignment, unseen
since 1866, it will be one of the brightest when an unusual amount
of sunlight will be cast on the lunar surface Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could count how many arrests we make,'' said Officer
Sherman Ackerson of the San Francisco police. ``It would be
interesting if it makes the jails fill up.''
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, the full moon has been said to influence
human and animal behavior. It has been linked to everything from
sleepwalking and sexual potency to seizures and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the full moon has reputedly increased the number
of murders, robberies, bar brawls and car crashes. That notion has
been repeated by word of mouth, amplified by the Internet and
supported by at least one 1978 book, ``The Lunar Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout history there has been this notion that the moon
can make you crazy,'' said Alan Dundes, an anthropologist, folklore
expert and professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
``The only real evidence is that if you keep repeating that a
certain thing makes you act crazy, then it probably will. The power
of suggestion is effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the moon could toy with the human mind was first
recorded in the latter years of the Roman Empire, when many people
maintained that worshipers of the moon goddess Luna were insane.
That led to the word ``lunatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the police, emergency workers and others who see aberrant
behavior up close, the ``lunar lunacy'' is an axiom that is often
repeated but never proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it the werewolf effect,'' Ackerson said. ``When I
started out as a cop 27 years ago, everyone said a full moon was
always the worst night _ that everyone acts a little crazier than
usual. I never saw proof, but a lot of people who work the street
assume there is some truth to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The superstition about the full moon is not just limited to
emergency workers in California. In a database search on the topic,
constables and 911 dispatchers were quoted saying similar things in
newspapers from Scotland to Singapore and India to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But there also are a lot of skeptics on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an urban myth,'' said David Fleming, an assistant nursing
manager at San Francisco General Hospital, who works the swing
shift in the emergency room. ``It's a great story, fascinating for
conversation. But I've never seen a study that backs it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes his own.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming recently looked at hospital admissions records on full
moon nights and compared them to other shifts that were similar in
every aspect _ except the lunar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full moons really don't show an increase in the number of
people we see in emergency rooms,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Several researchers agree with Fleming. More than one report
suggests that people are more likely to remember a full moon than a
crescent one.
</P>
<P>
   So if a killing were to take place when the moon is a
fog-shrouded sliver, the theory goes, no one would take note. But
police officers called out to a crime scene under a clear, full
moon, might note that detail in their nightly log or talk about it
in the squad room.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the full moon becomes associated with the crime, even
though similar events occur at other times of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's moon should be one to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be able to read by the light of the moon if it
isn't cloudy,'' said Bob Strom, a scientist at the Lunar and
Planetary Institute in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   For about 10 hours beginning around 4:15 p.m., the Earth will be
at its closest point to the sun and the moon. The result will be an
unusually bright full moon, made so because it reflects so much
light from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The moon becomes full every 29.5 days. This month's full moon
happens to fall on the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice, the
longest night of the year. It's an event that happens on the winter
solstice only once every 19 years. It puts the moon 17,000 miles
closer than its average distance of 230,000 miles during its
off-center orbit of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth is also nearing its closest approach to the sun. The
Earth will make its closest pass to the sun, 91.4 million miles, on
Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Those stellar pieces have not fallen into place like that for
133 years.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 21, 1866, under the full, bright moon, the Oglala Sioux
lured U.S. Army troops into a deadly trap in what was then the
Idaho Territory. The Sioux, led by Crazy Horse, surrounded and
killed all 80 soldiers in what became known as Fetterman's
Massacre, after commanding officer Capt. William Fetterman. Next to
Little Big Horn, it was perhaps the biggest defeat suffered by U.S.
troops in frontier days.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe some of the e-mails circulating cyberspace,
Wednesday night to early Thursday could have even bloodier portent
than Fetterman's Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   But then some of these same folks probably believe that the
world's going to end on New Year's Day 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
   There were those predictions on Friday, March 13, 1998. That
Friday the 13th coincided with a full moon and a lunar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the world did not come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does (Wednesday), call me back for a quote,'' laughed
Dundes, who has written a half-dozen books on folklore and urban
myths.

<P>
   The 10-page wine list at Maritime, a new Manhattan seafood
restaurant, includes a Chassagne-Montrachet Morgeot, an Hommage
cabernet from Clos Pegase, a Grande Cuvee Krug. These fine wines,
priced from $60 to $200, appear under the headings ``The Light Red
District'' ``Red Hot Mamas'' and ``Et Tu, Brut.''
</P>
<P>
   Perusing the list at Fressen, wine drinkers are presented with
groupings like ``Mellow Yellow'' and ``Heaven Scent.'' And at
Thalia, the categories read like excerpts from the Wine Spectator:
``Sophisticated, chic with depth and passion. ...''
</P>
<P>
   What ever happened to Red/White, France/Italy,
Burgundy/Bordeaux? At many New York restaurants the old
color-country-region system has been dumped in favor of oenophile
lingo, cute gimmicks and bad puns.
</P>
<P>
   Just as stuffy sommeliers have been replaced by 20-something
``wine guys'' who tell you that a 1995 Barolo  &UR; rocks,  &LR; wine lists
have undergone a makeover. In some cases (Union Square Cafe), this
means the convenience of wines listed by style and weight for
today's more curious, knowledgeable customers. Elsewhere, the new
lists get goofier and, in some cases, end up sounding even more
obscure and pretentious than the old.
</P>
<P>
   The new lists want to  &UR; evoke,  &LR; to  &UR; relate  &LR; to customers in a way
that might make a traditionalist wince.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to move wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selling lots of pigato from Liguria,'' said Jerri Banks,
the beverage director at Fressen, who put this full-bodied Italian
white alongside an Austrian furmint and a Menetou-Salon from the
Loire Valley under Seafood Specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to lighten it up more,'' said Ms. Banks, who has
been in the wine business for 22 years, including a stint at Cellar
in the Sky. ``Groups of young women giggle their way through the
list.''
</P>
<P>
   That a high priestess from this temple to the grape, which
specialized in hard-to-find wines, should now be doing a rock 'n'
roll wine list in the meatpacking district suggests a new era when
wine, like everything else in life, is being marketed within an
inch of its shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of the average American wine drinker is to order a
wine he or she has heard of, Ms. Banks said. The thinking behind
rewriting wine lists by style of wine or according to what foods
they will compatibly wash down is to get people to sample, say, a
South African shiraz or Oregon gamay that might have scared them
before.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to demystify the complexities of wine has taken
some restaurateurs and wine consultants to the opposite extreme: a
sort of ``Wine for Dummies'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Best Cellars chain of wine stores has reduced its entire
stock to eight adjectives: fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy,
smooth, big or sweet. The stores take user-friendliness to new
highs (or lows) by limiting their selections to about 100 wines,
almost all under $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine is so tradition-bound that most people who work in the
business have a hard time imagining it classified any other way
than by grape type or country of origin,'' said Joshua Wesson, one
of the founders of Best Cellars, which has expanded from its base
in Manhattan to Boston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Wesson, who says he is registering these adjectives as
trademarks, has licensed them to the Xando chain of coffee and wine
bars. Rammy Harwood, national marketing manager at Xando Cosi Inc.,
said wine sales were up sixfold since it licensed Best Cellars'
labels seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The way Harwood sees it, ``If I go in and say, `I want a bold
wine' and I see `bold' on the menu, it makes it a lot easier. It's
educational.'' Previously, wine was not even on the Xando menu. It
appeared on cardboard ``table tents,'' Harwood said, and the
selection consisted of ``a couple of reds and a couple of whites.''
</P>
<P>
   To aid the educational process, little icons appear on the Xando
menu. Next to ``luscious'' (a Cartlidge &AMP; Browne chardonnay) is a
pair of lips. There's a lollipop next to the port and sherry, which
are described as ``sweet'' _ once a banned word in wine circles, in
favor of the more elegant-sounding ``fruity.''
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of wine guy sees his simple adjectives and
icons as the antidote to generations of snobbery. The manager at
Maritime, Andrew Newhouser, unabashedly declares: ``Wine is grape
juice. It's grape juice! I've never understood this huge mystique
behind it. It should be a lot more easy and fun than people make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouser attributes his whimsical list with its Rubenesque Reds
and Pisces Meets Libra whites to Ted Davidson, the former sommelier
at Maritime, who was, he said, ``a very whimsical guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much whimsy, though, can be as unhelpful as too little.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Olson, a wine consultant and self-described ``wine geek,''
who devised the list for Typhoon Brewery, said he has seen wines
described on menus as ``sexy'' and ``obtuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine language has ``evolved to the point now where some of it is
pretty trite and doesn't work,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early rebels was Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at
Montrachet and for Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group.
Montrachet's collection, which includes a vast repository of
Burgundies, is listed the old-fashioned way, by country and then by
region.
</P>
<P>
   But when Layla opened five years ago, Johnnes made ``What would
be the best wine if you were stuck in the desert?'' a category.
</P>
<P>
   Anything to ``encourage a dialogue with the consumer,'' Johnnes
said. Most diners, he pointed out, still read the wine list from
right to left. And frugal readers will notice new euphemisms for
expensive and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   At Fressen, if the wine costs more than $60, it falls into the
``classic'' category. At Quantum, a new place in Manhattan that
bills itself as a ``progressive American restaurant,'' the words
``Light and Crisp'' introduce the relatively inexpensive rieslings
and pinot grigios, whereas the ``Rich, Full and Classic'' reds
include $80 cabernets and a $212 Pomerol.
</P>
<P>
   If you're unwilling to have your wallet rocked by a classic,
there's always the Homer Simpson method: just order the
second-least-expensive bottle on the menu and hope you get lucky.

`SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS': PREJUDICE LINGERS IN A LAND OF MISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is an almost heartbreaking
example of what can happen when a filmmaker becomes so overawed by
his source that he confuses dramatic storytelling with the
production of mammoth coffee-table art books. Bathed in deepening
shades of snow-lit Prussian blue, this screen adaptation of David
Guterson's popular 1994 novel is admirably high-minded and visually
gorgeous but fatally anesthetized by its own grandiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Frame by frame the movie, directed by Scott Hicks (of ``Shine'')
and filmed by Robert Richardson (the virtuoso cinematographer
behind several Oliver Stone movies), isn't just a series of shots
but a sequence of exquisitely balanced photographic compositions.
The piling on of so much visual beauty, however, only contributes
to the sense of the movie as a frozen artifact cut off from the
real world and designed to be viewed from behind a glass casement.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson here about the aesthetics of mass-audience
movies. Pretty pictures, as nice as they may be, are finally no
substitute for a living, breathing screenplay. ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' like many an elegant coffee-table book, has a skimpy text
(by Hicks and Ron Bass) that too often substitutes distilled,
poeticized oration for everyday speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a moment passes when we're not conscious of the movie's
messages about tolerance and forgiveness being shoved in our faces.
Even when they are delivered by an actor as gifted as Max von
Sydow, playing a defense lawyer who is the movie's official
conscience, ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' rings with the hollow boom
of a Sunday school sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest mistake in translating the novel to the
screen was to have the film imitate the book's intricate flashback
structure. Flipping back and forth between the present and the past
on the page is one thing. (It encourages your imagination to make
leaps and allows you to take whatever time you need to bridge those
transitions.) But when a movie does the same thing, the imagination
is short-circuited, and there is hardly time for reflection. The
film is so busy darting back and forth between past and present
that from scene to scene its characters barely have time to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   There are also far too many lingering close-ups of haunted
faces. A surreal montage that harks back to the early films of
Alain Resnais (specifically ``Hiroshima, Mon Amour''), brings the
movie to a dead halt. This might have been a coup de cinema in
another film, but here it seems narratively evasive.
</P>
<P>
   The story unfolds as a series of flashbacks from the 1950 murder
trial of Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a young Japanese-American
accused of killing a fisherman on his boat off the coast of the
fictitious San Piedro Island, north of Puget Sound. Most of the
events are seen through the eyes of Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke),
a morose young reporter covering the trial for the local newspaper.
Many years earlier Ishmael and the defendant's wife, Hatsue (Youki
Kudoh), were teen-age lovers who met secretly in the hollow trunk
of a cedar tree deep in the rain forest. The affair ends when it is
discovered by Hatsue's mother, who is vehemently opposed to
interracial relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The film's strongest scenes look back to World War II when the
island's Japanese-Americans were interrogated, rounded up and sent
to internment camps for the duration of the war. The murder trial
revolves around the bitterness surrounding a land deal on which
Kazuo's family defaulted while imprisoned. During the trial, the
prosecutor (James Rebhorn) blatantly appeals to the local whites'
lingering anti-Japanese prejudice in speeches that play on the
racist stereotype of Asians as treacherous and inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie jumps back and forth in time, we meet Ishmael's
late father, Arthur (Sam Shepard), the crusading local newspaper
editor who stood up to the anti-Japanese hysteria that swept the
community after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Nine years later
Ishmael, poring over evidence in the case, decides to strike his
own blow for truth and justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' may be dramatically inert, but it is
well acted, and it succeeds in sustaining a mood of spellbound
reflection. The endless swirling snow, the blue-lit fog and the
rain forest with its dripping evergreens evoke a brooding interior
landscape where memory and reflection loom solemnly over the
present.
</P>
<P>
   But even this mood is undermined by James Newton Howard's
bombastic score, which suggests the romantic minimalism of Michael
Nyman encrusted with heavenly vocal choirs. The overwrought score
is the final lethal touch in a movie that buckles under the weight
of its own pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has sexual situations.
</P>

 &HT;    `Man on the Moon' out of this world
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exploring the twisted mind of a comic genius, without a map,
``Man on the Moon'' re-creates the one-of-a-kind career of Andy
Kaufman, a performer as interested in making people squirm as
making them laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Director Milos Forman (``Amadeus'') and his screenwriting team
from ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' once again hone in on a
fascinating real-life figure whose work toyed with freedom of
expression while courting public outrage. In the process, they give
Jim Carrey the showcase for one of the year's most mesmerizing
performances. His impersonation of the late prankish Kaufman is
often so pitch-perfect, it's more like channeling than acting.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Kaufman captured national attention with his
``Mighty Mouse'' theme-song sing-alongs and dead-on Elvis
impressions on ``Saturday Night Live.'' He gained more exposure
when his Foreign Man act (``t'ank you veddy much'') morphed into
the sitcom character Latka on ``Taxi.'' But ``Man on the Moon,''
opening today, shows us how Andy never stopped acting (and acting
out), even when the cameras were off.
</P>
<P>
   When a comedy-club honcho in the film tells him his routine is
like amateur hour, Kaufman counters, ``I'm not like everyone
else.'' The truth is, he isn't like anybody else. Applause and
laughs are OK, but Kaufman wants something more: ``They love me,
they hate me, they walk out,'' he shrugs, as though each of these
reactions is valid.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly _ in his inter-gender wrestling matches with
women or performances where he bores crowds by reading from ``The
Great Gatsby'' _ he strips bare the innate hostility between a
comic and his audience. (He succeeds a little too well when the
viewers of ``Saturday Night Live'' overwhelmingly vote to ban him
from the show forever.)
</P>
<P>
   Aided in his sociopathic silliness by writer/prankster Bob Zmuda
(Paul Giamatti), Kaufman keeps everyone around him unbalanced,
including agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who asks him, ``Who
are you trying to entertain, the audience or yourself?'' Well,
both. The problem only escalates with Kaufman's refusal to let
anyone (besides Zmuda) in on the joke. He perfects surreal punch
lines built to make only two people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Forman and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski aren't
interested in psychoanalyzing Kaufman. They don't try to explain
his gifts with standard biopic tropes. Instead, they subject us to
his pranks, much like Kaufman's friends who constantly had to
second-guess what was real, what was a gag. The movie re-creates
the funhouse-mirror atmosphere Kaufman created, in which even a
violent physical assault in the wrestling ring can turn out to be
an elaborate hoax.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, when Kaufman announces he's ill, that friends
and family react with boy-who-cried-wolf disbelief. The film
reaches its dizzy climax with Kaufman meeting his match in cosmic
clowning: a faith healer who proves that the joke is ultimately on
him.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening coda, when he addresses the audience as the
Foreign Man and introduces the film (``I wish it were better ...
but it is so stupid''), Carrey is a revelation. He captures
Kaufman's endless contradictions, his swerves from boyish sweetness
to unbottled rage. When not shooting a TV special with guest-star
Howdy Doody, he's roughhousing with a couple of hookers. As his
abusive, lounge-singer alter-ego Tony Clifton, he's a walking
spleen, spilling drinks, chainsmoking, and shrieking at the paying
audience to shut up. Carrey doesn't sugarcoat the comic's life; he
understands that genius and niceness don't necessarily go
hand-in-hand. Still, he never loses the spark of pleasure that lets
us stay fascinated with Kaufman, even at his most extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Forman supports Carrey's performance with vigorous, headlong
direction that views Kaufman's life as a pop-culture parade. The
script is usually pithy and sharp, with only the occasional
tin-eared line. (You may wince when DeVito, as Kaufman's
long-suffering agent, says, ``You're insane, but you might also be
brilliant.'') The movie makes some other missteps. Having the
original ``Taxi'' actors, looking worse for wear, play their
younger selves is distracting. The film's mystic coda doesn't
really make sense, and Courtney Love is a self-conscious washout as
Kaufman's feisty girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's title comes from an R.E.M. song about the comic, and
the Athens band wrote the movie's score. It's minimal, except for
the title song and a new one which plays briefly during one scene.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how well-made the movie is, Kaufman's life and
career may be too arcane a footnote to attract a mainstream crowd.
Carrey fans might not want to see him playing another comic's
shtick. But adventurous viewers will appreciate not only the
actor's performance, but the film's head-spinning examination of a
man who blurred the lines between anarchy and amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti. Rated R for
language and brief sexuality/nudity. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A dizzying look at the mind of a comic genius,
capped by a spectacular lead performance.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR PROSPECTS:
</P>
<P>
   It could get nods for best actor (Jim Carrey), director (Milos
Forman) and screenplay. In the Golden Globes, it's up for best
comedy movie and comedy actor (Carrey).

 &HT;    `Sunday' tackles gritty world of ferocious football
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Stone's movies, which include ``JFK'' and the
Oscar-winning ``Platoon,'' are not known for their subtlety. The
word never comes into play in the director's new big bully of a
movie ``Any Given Sunday,'' opening today.
</P>
<P>
   Given the filmmaker's past obsession with conspiracy, many
viewers probably expect to see a play-by-play expose of pro
football in Stone's new saga, a sort of ``North Dallas Forty''
meets ``The Insider.'' What they will find instead is a frequently
entertaining, rah-rah look at pro football at its most ferocious,
up close and too personal. It's full of hard hits and harder
cheerleader bodies. Bone-crunching tackles. Killer blocks. Hulking
players screaming obscenities. Hovering dark clouds. Cracking
lightning bolts. Coaches literally roaring like lions.
</P>
<P>
   The film's first 20 or so minutes are a brutal in-your-face
football game that Stone orchestrates with cameras mounted just
about everywhere. On players' helmets, on their bodies. With
quick-cut edits and swirling cameras, the jarring visuals come at
you nonstop. It's a smart move because it heightens the realistic
feel of the film. It also makes it the blurriest, jittery-est movie
experience since ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacino bristles with bravado
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday'' is so gut-wrenchingly gung-ho, it's the kind of movie
where depictions of vomit eventually become endearing. Unleashed
into all this is Al Pacino in all his celebrated hoo-ha bravado. He
plays coach Tony D'Amato of the troubled Miami Sharks, a team on
the verge of missing the playoffs if it doesn't start winning
again. His veins pop with each line.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato frequently goes toe-to-toe in heated arguments with the
Sharks' tough young co-owner Christina Pagniacci, played with
venomous verve by Cameron Diaz. Alas, her veins just can't out-pop
Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   They're joined by dozens of no-holds-barred actors and
ex-football players, including James Woods as the team's shady
orthopedist; Dennis Quaid as the Sharks' legendary, aging
quarterback Jack ``Cap'' Rooney; Ann-Margret as Christina's
drink-dazed mom; Lauren Holly as Cap's prickly wife; Jim Brown as a
defensive coordinator; Lawrence Taylor as linebacker Luther
``Shark'' Lavay; and LL Cool J as the team's star running back.
Charlton Heston even shows up as the commissioner of the fictional
Associated Football Franchises of America.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's biggest surprise performance is by Jamie Foxx, from
``Booty Call'' and TV's ``The Jamie Foxx Show'' and ``In Living
Color.'' He plays Willie Beamen, the Sharks' bench-warming
third-string quarterback who's unexpectedly thrust into the
limelight. And he gives the role real spark and shading, one minute
hot-dogging on TV commercials and changing D'Amato's plays in the
huddle, the next realistically helping rebuild team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The film explores the familiar murk of pro football's dark
underbelly: questionable medical ethics, pills, booze, prostitutes,
the mighty TV dollar, shady behind-the-scenes deals, blabbering
on-camera sports commentators.
</P>
<P>
   A Stone cold moment
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a few mind-boggling moments. Off the field after
the initial football game, Stone waits forever to pull his camera
back from all the extreme close-ups, making it a bit too difficult
to discern where his characters are. And one night game is so
poorly lit, it's a complete distraction from the action. And did
Stone intend for the fictional Dallas Knights to wear the most
ridiculous team uniforms imaginable?
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is like a dedicated fan's take on the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's so pro football that after nearly three hours, Stone hasn't
had enough and invades the film's closing credits, squeezing in
``Sunday's'' sucker punch conclusion in another scene and more
dialogue as the names of the film's crew roll by.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. Many moviegoers at a recent preview screening were
already filing out of the auditorium. Despite the surprise scene,
they kept leaving. Just like at a game that their team's about to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz. Rated R for
strong profanity and some nudity/sexuality. 2 hours, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Oliver Stone takes on pro football _ and loves it.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: It could land a film editing nod.
</P>

`ONEGIN': A COLD COMEUPPANCE IN ST. PETERSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the camera spends enough time contemplating an attractive
face, isn't it bound eventually to uncover the mysteries of the
Mona Lisa? That seems to be the guiding principle of the first-time
director Martha Fiennes (Ralph's sister) in photographing Liv
Tyler's scenes for the film ``Onegin.'' In this rickety screen
adaptation of Alexander Pushkin's verse novel ``Eugene Onegin,''
Ms. Tyler is Tatyana, an enigmatic heartbreaker who reduces the
arrogant, rakish title character (Fiennes) to a quivering wreck.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer the camera lingers over Ms. Tyler's impassive
face, the less it discovers. There are no hidden pools of passion
or wit, no tantalizing secrets lurking behind her blank,
expressionless gaze. Late in the movie, when her eyes brim with
tears, the only emotion Ms. Tyler conveys is the peevish
frustration of a little girl who has misplaced her Barbie doll.
Since ``Onegin'' was made with a largely English cast, Ms. Tyler is
forced to affect an approximation of an English accent, and the
effort only makes her performance seem all the more inert.
</P>
<P>
   The excruciating mismatch of Ms. Tyler, the celluloid equivalent
of vanilla pudding, with Fiennes, the screen embodiment of
restless, neurasthenic romanticism, is only one of many elements in
``Onegin'' that feels out of balance. That mismatch fatally reduces
a love story of Scarlett-and-Rhett dimensions to a portrait of an
unlikely, not-very-compelling relationship foiled by bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything that's good about ``Onegin'' emanates from
Fiennes' complex portrayal of a wealthy, dashing aristocrat cursed
by his propensity for boredom and his ability to see through every
social facade. Of course, we've seen versions of this refined,
overbred malcontent before in ``The English Patient,'' ``The End of
the Affair'' and in Fiennes' cool, haughty profile-to-the-audience
stage portrayal of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Onegin's impatient, know-it-all attitude along with his
swashbuckling poet's sensibility cause women to melt before him and
men to grovel for his approval. When he inherits his uncle's vast
estate, Onegin becomes the 1820s Russian equivalent of the master
of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The character is also something of a radical idealist with an
urge to flout convention. Instead of running his country estate
himself, he turns it over to his serfs to manage. But we never see
the results of that decision, and the movie touches only glancingly
on Onegin's unorthodox politics and social views.
</P>
<P>
   In matters of the heart Onegin is a cynic. While in the country
settling his uncle's estate, he is befriended by a neighbor,
Vladimir Lensky (Toby Stephens), who introduces him to his
sweetheart, Olga (Lena Headey), and her younger sister, Tatyana
(Ms. Tyler). Both women are dazzled by Onegin. But when Tatyana
sends him a desperate letter declaring her passion, he rejects her
and to Vladimir's chagrin perversely flirts with Olga. Blithely
dismissing Olga as ``easy,'' Onegin so insults Vladimir that the
friends end up fighting a senseless and tragic duel.
</P>
<P>
   The story jumps ahead to find Onegin returning to St. Petersburg
after six years of travel and soul-searching. Tatyana is now
comfortably married to Prince Nikitin (Martin Donovan) and lives in
an enormous palace. Onegin, upon setting eyes on her, finds himself
instantly, hopelessly besotted. The tables have turned, and, as the
song says, now it's Onegin's turn to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onegin'' aspires to be a surging costume drama of star-crossed
passions swept along by the tides of history. But the movie feels
too cramped, indoorsy and bloodless to catch romantic fire. Even
the grandest ballrooms of 19th-century St. Petersburg at the height
of the season look a little drab.

`THE NUTCRACKER': RITE OF PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dancing the three lead roles in George Balanchine's
production of ``The Nutcracker'' can be a rite of passage at the
New York City Ballet, and such was the case at the Saturday and
Sunday matinees.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Janie Taylor brought her usual endearing spunkiness
to the demanding choreography of Dewdrop. Nerves did not diminish
the beauty of her fully shaped dancing, held arabesques and
controlled abandon.
</P>
<P>
   In other newly acquired roles on Saturday, Antonio Carmena
balanced the exotic acrobatics of the Tea divertissement with humor
and an easy, expansive attack. Jeroen Hofmans looked perfectly at
home with the prances and jumps, some through hoops, in the Candy
Cane divertissement. And Eva Natanya glowed graciously in ``Hot
Chocolate,'' performed with Jason Fowler. Yvonne Borree and Peter
Boal were the Sugarplum Fairy and Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastien Marcovici took on the role of the Cavalier on Sunday
afternoon. Watching the ballet's culminating grand pas de deux,
performed with Jenifer Ringer, was a terrifying experience.
Marcovici has a uniquely lush, almost lupine quality. But the
Cavalier demands clean classical dancing and strong, confident
partnering. Neither was forthcoming, and Ms. Ringer deserves a
medal for valor.
</P>
<P>
   She was a first-rate Sugarplum Fairy, blending musical phrasing,
a keen sense of dramatic detail and a radiant aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's child leads were among the best in a long time. Zakary
Yermolenko's Little Prince was a touchingly solemn, well-mannered
boy who seemed far older than his years but who came into his own
in miming that was elegantly larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Score made Marie a sweet-natured girl with unexpected
gumption and an amusingly mouselike walk. And Shimon Ito's Fritz
was such a lovably eager, pensive and naughty child that one wanted
to pluck him offstage and bring him home as a stocking-stuffer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Grace Huang, a 23-year-old viola student at the
Juilliard School, was chatting with two classmates and a professor
in Room 524 recently about her latest composition: a jazzy score to
a mock television commercial for Ethan Allen, the furniture maker
and retailer.
</P>
<P>
   A classical musician studying TV commercials? At Juilliard?
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five years ago, a class on how to score
commercials and film would not have been offered at the prestigious
school, which trains top-flight classical musicians. These days,
however, what was once the domain of Madison Avenue jingle writers
has become an outlet of musical expression, and income, for the
most talented young musicians in every genre of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so much fun is that the kids come into class and
discover parts of their musical personality,'' said Edward Bilous,
a composer who began teaching the course at Juilliard three years
ago. ``By the end of each year, a few students are considering a
whole new life path.''
</P>
<P>
   Even composers, who used to shun commercials as an enterprise
too crass for their art, are being drawn to them. Michelle DiBucci,
38, a classical composer and teacher of music theory at Juilliard,
for example, gave up waiting tables at night and made the leap to
television commercials as a way to support her opera compositions,
both financially and, she says, artistically.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight years, Ms. DiBucci has written commercials
for sponsors ranging from the Olive Garden restaurants to Nissan to
New Jersey Transit. She often meets with the client and composes
and produces a commercial in less than a week, earning more in a
few days that she does in six months with a classical commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do I earn money,'' she said. ``I work with the best
musicians in the world and get inspirations for my operas.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, inspiration for operas from supervising the production of a
commercial. For the snappy, often sappy jingle of the past has been
replaced with sophisticated scores to express the mood and energy
the advertiser wants to project. In a Cachet perfume commercial,
for example, Ms. DiBucci mixed the sounds of a Japanese shakuhachi,
or flute, as well as a Lebanese tambourine, a classical cello, an
Indian vocalist and electronic music to illustrate morphing
animated images of women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DiBucci was lucky: Prince Matchabelli, which makes Cachet,
had a rich budget of $2.5 million for this commercial, allowing her
to bring performers together. More typically, scores these days are
produced by computers and synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
   That is the unhappy flip side of the new opportunities for
composers: The explosion of electronic music, combined with a
growing use of golden oldies and other previously released music,
has decimated the livelihood of the studio musician who once made a
living performing for commercial scores.
</P>
<P>
   With studio jobs disappearing, young performers like Ms. Huang
are increasingly looking for work in commercials as a higher-paying
alternative to giving private lessons or waiting tables.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four members of Bilous' scoring class formed a
production company, Trifecta Music for Film. They will have plenty
of competition; according to Theresa Piti, managing editor of The
Shoot Directory, a trade publication, the number of such houses has
grown from a handful in the early 1980s to an estimated 600 today.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of cable television stations and the Internet
revolution have created the advertising boom that is fueling that
growth. At the same time, the availability of cheap recording
equipment has lowered the economic barriers to entering the
industry for classical musicians, not known for having lots of cash
on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   As opportunities have opened up and old ones have vanished, a
jack-of-all-trades mentality is taking hold among many classical
musicians. Younger performers who grew up on pop music don't view
it as an inferior art form and are less willing to limit their
careers to academia. ``Composers no longer want to write just for
other composers and colleges,'' said Frances Richard, vice
president for concert music at the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rice, 32, a bass player with a master's degree in
orchestral performance from the Manhattan School of Music, said,
``For me right now, it is all about adapting.'' He earns a living
playing reggae music and its predecessor, ska, three nights a week
in downtown Manhattan clubs like the Knitting Factory and the
Cooler. He also spends hours each week at Cliff Schwarz Music
Production as an unpaid intern designing audio and sound effects
for TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Appleton, 32, is one of the army of beeper-clad musicians
making ends meet with a melange of freelance jobs. A guitarist with
his own band, he has produced CDs for Nickelodeon and American
Express, created music for Web sites and produced the sound effects
for a CD-Rom soccer game. ``Until recently no one thought of
putting sound on the Internet,'' he said. ``It was the silent movie
of the computer age.'' So far, however, the most he has earned on a
single project was $5,000, and that was a flat fee, with no
provision for royalties.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change. Marc Morgenstern, executive vice
president of Ascap, said 1,500 Web sites had registered with the
trade group, indicating that the Internet could become a major new
stream of royalty revenues for composers and artists.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Subotnick, a composer, lecturer and revered
electronic-music guru, say he believes the Internet is the
profession's future. Subotnick recently developed a software
program called Making Music that allows children to create
compositions on the computer, and he is developing a Web site for
the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you had to drive a taxi, or at best give
private lessons,'' he said of classical composers. ``Now the
opportunities are so great, you can put together a living through
music.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Robert Bresson, the acclaimed French movie director
whose best-known films, among them ``Diary of a Country Priest''
and ``Pickpocket,'' reflected a strongly aesthetic and spiritual
approach to cinema, died on Saturday. He was 98 and lived in Paris.
He made his last film in 1983 and had been unwell for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson, a slim man with a shock of white hair that made him
immediately recognizable, was very much a loner, keeping aloof from
both fellow directors and journalists, interested neither in
becoming a celebrity nor in following cinematic fashion. Rather, he
pursued his own vision slowly and meticulously, making just 13
films in a 40-year career. But they earned him a special place in
cinema history.
</P>
<P>
   In visual terms, his films were often described as ``purist''
because he tried to reduce his images to almost abstract
simplicity, stripping them of all sentimentality. When possible, he
avoided using professional actors, or at least those whose stage
work had made them, in his view, too theatrical. ``His cinema is
closer to painting than photography,'' Francois Truffaut once
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson nonetheless posed complex emotional and spiritual
problems in his movies, some of which he wrote himself, often by
confronting tragic lives and situations with a distant hope of
redemption. At times seemingly struggling with his own faith, he
was known to some French critics as ``a dark Catholic.'' But he
rarely favored them with an explanation: Once he had completed a
movie, he preferred it to speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you see my film?'' he asked one interviewer in 1983. The
journalist answered affirmatively. ``Then you know as much as I
do,'' he replied. ``What do we have to talk about?''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he published ``Notes sur le Cinematographe'' in 1975,
but they were neither memoir nor primer. Rather, they contained a
series of maxims that served as his guides, like ``it is not a
question of directing someone else, but directing yourself'' and
``there can be no marriage between theater and cinema without
mutual destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most quoted ``note'' reflected his obsession with
internalizing his dramas: ``A film is not made for you to promenade
your eyes, but for you enter it and become entirely absorbed by
it.'' This effect was achieved principally in the editing room.
``To edit a film is to link people to each other and objects
through their looks,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson's films reflect a deep stoicism preoccupied with
redemption and atonement, predestination and spiritual favor, like
the triumph of love over hate and of grace over sin. They are
marked by an austerity that the critic Andre Bazin described as
``almost unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bresson was born in Bromont-Lamothe, a small town in
central France, on Sept. 25, 1901. His father was an army officer,
and the family moved frequently while he was young. Drawn to the
arts at an early age, he worked first as a painter and then as a
photographer before testing his hand as a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, he made his first film, a satirical short called
``Public Affairs.'' It includes a ship-launching scene in which a
Champagne bottle remains intact and the ship's prow splits in two.
</P>
<P>
   He then became a co-writer of several scripts, including ``Pure
Air'' for Rene Clair. When Germany invaded France in 1940, he was
among the tens of thousands of French soldiers who were captured,
and he was held in a German prison for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson's first feature film, ``Les Anges du Peche,'' did not
come until 1943. Made during the German occupation, it tells of a
secluded order of nuns who dedicate themselves to rehabilitating
women from prison, in this case one Therese, who is unrepentant.
Hailed as a remarkable debut, the film already announced Bresson's
theme of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   In his next film, ``Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne,'' released in
1945, revenge and sexuality take the place of salvation. ``There
was no doubt about `Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne' being a landmark
in cinema history,'' observed the critic and film historian David
Thomson. The work was ``taken from Diderot's `Jacques le
Fatalisme,' with dialogue by Jean Cocteau,'' Thomson said. ``The
literary transposition was less important to Bresson than the
first, triumphant use of abstraction in photographing people.'' He
added, ``Here, plainly, outward appearance was a formal shell for
emotional and intellectual identity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 Bresson returned to spirituality in ``Diary of a Country
Priest,'' one of his finest films, in which a young priest dying of
cancer suffers even more from his failure to save souls until he
mysteriously assumes a state of grace that releases him from his
torment. Adapted from a novel by Georges Bernanos, the film won the
Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival in 1951. Truffaut, calling
it Bresson's best, said that ``every shot is as true as a handful
of earth.''
</P>
<P>
   His next film, ``A Man Escaped,'' a true story of a Resistance
fighter's escape from the Gestapo, was not made until 1956 (winning
him the award for best director at the 1957 Cannes International
Film Festival). Critics have remarked on his focus on the
prisoner's face in his narrow cell, the prisoner's growth of faith
and the way the ritual of prison life subtly fades into religious
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1959, Bresson made ``Pickpocket,'' one his most
celebrated works, in which he follows a young man's erotic
obsession with pickpocketing as it alienates him from those who
want to help him. In the film's final minutes, the pickpocket is
redeemed by a woman's love. Paul Schrader, an American director and
writer influenced by Bresson, echoes these minutes in his film
``American Gigolo.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Bresson's work seems to have been unaffected by the
New Wave that was sweeping French cinema in the late 1950s and
early '60s. The spiritual undertone of many of his films evidently
irritated some critics, but he continued to make the films he
wanted to make, including ``The Trial of Joan of Arc'' (1962), in
which he contrasts the serene transcript of her testimony with the
brutal way she was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who detests Christianity cannot be interested in `Les
Anges du Peche,' `Diary of a Country Priest' and `The Trial of Joan
of Arc,''' Roger Boussinot wrote in his French-language
``Encyclopedia of Cinema.'' ``Anti-clerics, rationalists and
surrealists have not missed a chance to ridicule the commonplaces
of Bresson's admirers.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Balthazar,'' made in 1966, Bresson uses the story of a
brutalized donkey as an allegory for human cruelty and love. In the
same year, in ``Mouchette,'' another adaptation of a Bernanos
novel, a teen-age peasant girl driven to suicide epitomizes human
suffering. Three years later, in his first color film, ``A Gentle
Creature,'' starring Dominique Sanda, then a 17-year-old model, the
director again tackles suicide, but this time seen through the
angry and guilt-ridden eyes of a surviving husband.
</P>
<P>
   His final four films were ``Four Nights of a Dreamer'' (1971),
``Lancelot of the Lake'' (1974), ``The Devil, Probably'' (1977) and
``Money'' (1983). In the last one, an expression of his distaste
for unrestrained materialism, the forgery of a 500-franc note
begins as a schoolboy prank and ends up a catalyst for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Bresson's first marriage, to Leidia van der Zee, ended in
divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Marie-Madeleine van der
Mersch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bresson, then 77, had difficulty raising funds to make ``Money''
and was helped by the French culture minister, Jack Lang. The movie
went on to win the best-film award at the 1983 Cannes festival.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Robert Bresson remained a true auteur who controlled
every facet of his work, who managed to work independent of
commercial considerations and who made movies that are instantly
recognizable as his. Although he was too iconoclastic to inspire a
school of filmmakers to follow him, he did have a legion of
admirers, becoming, as Jean-Luc Godard put it, ``to French cinema
what Mozart is to German music and Dostoyevsky is to Russian
literature.''

 &HT;    ETour seeks exposure after money
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little over a year ago, 29-year-old Roger Barnette
was just another Web geek.
</P>
<P>
   He had nothing more than a business plan, an Emory University
business degree and an idea for a company that would deliver Web
sites to registered users based on their interests and preferences.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnette's days of struggle are quickly fading. This week
the company, now called eTour, received another $25 million in
funding from a group of broadcast outlets and still more money from
Atlanta-based investors including iXL's Bert Ellis and WebMD's Jeff
Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast outlets include Jefferson Pilot Corp., Susquehanna
Broadcasting, Barnstable Broadcasting and Beasley Broadcast
company. NeoCarta, a Boston-based venture fund, led the funding.
</P>
<P>
   The new infusion of cash comes only five months after Barnette
received $10 million from Atlanta investors. The money has helped
Barnette lift his company up onto the national radar. In addition
to new, spacious offices, there are also offices in New York and
San Francisco. He has increased his staff from 15 to about 80 with
plans to hire still more employees early next year.
</P>
<P>
   New York ad agency Fallon McElligott, the same folks who do
those ``MindSpring loves me'' ads, have done a series of equally
quirky ads touting eTour with the tag line ``surf without
searching.'' And then there is Mahir.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir is the hapless Turkish guy whose lonely hearts home page
is written in fractured English with the headline ``Welcome to my
home page! Kiss
you!!!!!!!(members.xoom.com/XOOM/primall/mahir/index.html) has made
him the darling of the online world. Mahir is now looking for a lot
more than love on the Net, he's looking for money. He's selling
merchandise and touring the United States on a whirlwind media
blitz sponsored by Barnette and eTour.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet media have been eager to jump on the Mahir
bandwagon, its sponsor has been virtually ignored. In a bubbly
Salon article called ``I Kissed Mahir,'' Internet writer Janelle
Brown described every detail of her encounter with Mahir but left
the party somewhat puzzled about eTour.
</P>
<P>
   Of Mahir's stop in San Francisco, Brown writes: ``Our host,
eTour, has provided meatballs and brie and Thai chicken on skewers,
plus all the free cocktails you can drink ...eTour has plastered
the walls with its logos and Mahir posters ... I can only wonder
what it costs to wine and dine this crowd of strangers _ none of
whom, incidentally, have been able to tell me what exactly eTour
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette just shakes his head and laughs quietly when he hears
the Salon story. He's certainly not surprised that eTour got lost
in the hoopla. That's been his company's most pressing problem all
along, describing itself and what it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is radically different from anything else out there
on the Web. We need to get the word out, and that's what all the
money is for. There's really nothing like eTour that lets users see
Web sites they've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette says eTour is a quick and easy way to see what's out
there on the Web, in addition to the dozen or so sites the average
Web user frequents. ``Old timers go to the same sites over and over
again. The appeal of searching is gone,'' he says. ``There are
millions of sites out there. We are absolutely a service. People do
want to see sites they've never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a service has to make money. A staff of editors selects
sites for each of eTour's categories, but most of eTour's income
comes from Web sites that pay to be part of the eTour rotation.
About 20 percent of the sites eTour users see have paid for the
privilege and the number will not go higher than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barnette also says that users won't see the paid site _ or any
other site _ more than once a month. (The average eTour user logs
on about 8.5 times a month.) ``Every day the experience should be
different,'' he says. ``You won't see the same Web site more than
once in a month. What a site pays for is the eyeballs of people who
have said they have an interest in the products or services or
content that site has, whether it's auctions or food or golf.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an effort to convert editorial picks into paying
customers, although Barnette maintains there are other ways to make
money without compromising the customer experience.
</P>
<P>
   He uses his mother as an example of the perfect eTour user. A
newcomer to the Web, Barnette's mom surfs the Web using eTour,
without even realizing she's surfing. But no matter how wonderful
or relevant eTour is, or how many people are willing to invest in
Barnette's ``surf without searching'' Web venture, if no one knows
about eTour, eTour is through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring more eyeballs to the site,'' Barnette
acknowledges. ``And describing what we do has always been our
biggest challenge. There's no real world corollary or even an
online corollary.''
</P>
<P>
   He says even his hip TV ads are a gamble. ``It's hard to get the
message across in 30 seconds. We've done a good job (on TV) of
getting the message out. We actually show people the Web site _ not
a lot of Web sites do. Most of them are just out there advertising
for shock value.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the money is rolling in and the users are signing
up, Barnette knows there's plenty of work ahead. ``I spent two
years getting a lot of blank stares,'' he says. ``It's hard to do
this on a tight budget. We need the money to get to the next
level.''

 &HT;    General Mills could be made to ante up for charity
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General Mills Inc. could owe $4.5 million in new
charitable contributions to breast cancer research if other states
follow a formula Georgia imposed after investigating a recent
yogurt marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The company had promised on the outside of specially marked
Yoplait yogurt lids to donate 50 cents to breast cancer research
for each returned lid.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on the inside of the lid said the company's donation
would be limited to $100,000. But consumers had to purchase the
yogurt and open it before they could read the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers nationwide returned 9.4 million lids to General Mills,
far more than expected. The company would have had to donate $4.7
million to keep the promise on the outside of the Yoplait lids. It
donated $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Cathy Cox found that the campaign deceived
Georgia consumers. ``We must make sure Georgia consumers are not
misled by sales promotions that feature a charitable component,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cox said Georgia planned to share with charity
regulators in other states its formula for calculating how much
extra General Mills should contribute. The formula is based on a
projection that Georgians purchase about 1.32 percent of all
Yoplait yogurt sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have created a template for other states'' to use in
calculating breast cancer research donations required on behalf of
their citizens, said Cox spokesman Chris Riggall.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the matter, General Mills has agreed to pay an
additional $63,000 to cover donations that should have been made on
behalf of Georgians who returned lids.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills spokesman Austin Sullivan said the company was
``frustrated with Georgia's stance. We felt we had acted in good
faith and were forthcoming in every respect.'' Settling with
Georgia for $63,000 was ``a fairly easy business decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said General Mills had no indication the lid-mailback
campaign was an issue outside Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will contribute more than $1 million to
breast cancer research this year and is currently conducting
another Yoplait lid-return campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the new campaign, the company promises to donate 10 cents per
lid to breast cancer research, with a $500,000 minimum donation and
up to $500,000 more depending on how many lids are returned. Those
terms are shown on the outside of yogurt container.
</P>
<P>
   The Breast Cancer Research Foundation expressed support for
General Mills and other companies that engage in ``cause-related
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate campaigns such as General Mills' not only generate
important financial support for breast cancer research, but also
raise awareness about the dangers of breast cancer and what can be
done to deter or prevent it. It's hard to put a price tag on that
kind of contribution _ but it's invaluable,'' Susan Hirschorn, the
foundation's executive director, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the initial Yoplait lid campaign was General
Mills' first venture into cause-related marketing. ``In all things
you do for the first time, you learn a few things,'' he said. ``We
were bowled over by the response.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Sullivan said, the campaign did not cause a spurt in
Yoplait sales. He said the company hopes the program will help
typical yogurt consumers _ women between 18 and 45 _ associate one
of their key concerns with the Yoplait brand over the long term.

 &HT;    Most signs are ripe for S1 success
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yahoo and eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Both are well-known Internet companies. Each dominates their
market. Each stock is in the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Now S1 founder James S. ``Chip'' Mahan, and some analysts, think
you can add S1 to that list.
</P>
<P>
   It has the potential. S1 holds a dominant position in an
emerging industry. S1, formerly Security First Technologies, sells
software and services so banks can let their business and consumer
customers manage their money online. Banks, citing concern over
Year 2000 issues, have not pushed online banking services to their
customers. But that reluctance is expected to change next year.
</P>
<P>
   S1 also has size to capitalize on the emerging market. S1's
technology powered the first Internet bank, Security First Network
Bank. Last year, Mahan sold the Internet bank to Royal Bank of
Canada and focused on peddling the tools and the expertise that
made the online bank possible.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May, S1 said it was buying Edify and FICS, two of its
largest competitors. In September, S1 said it was buying
VerticalOne, an Atlanta firm with a technology to let users access
all their online accounts with one password. In four months, the
firm grew from 250 employees to 1,600. The deals closed in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan, S1's chief executive, also says he thinks the timing is
right. The repeal of parts of the Glass-Steagle Bank Act of 1933 is
expected to bring massive change in the financial services
industry, allowing banks and insurance firms to offer each other's
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the precise time all the walls are falling between these
industries is the precise time that broadband Internet access is
upon us, which is the precise time that people want access to
information that had been locked away on mainframe systems,'' said
Mahan. ``Why wouldn't a company like this be a really big, $100
million market capitalization company?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week S1 hosted an analysts conference to tell Wall Street
its story. Analysts apparently liked what they heard. Since the
meeting, three analysts have issued S1 ``strong buy''
recommendations, three have issued buy ratings.
</P>
<P>
   S1 shares hit a 52-week high of $89 Tuesday, before closing at
$85, down 25 cents. S1 shares are up 457 percent for the year, more
than 76 percent for December.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Baker, of SunTrust Equitable Securities, said he thinks S1
shares should be trading at $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``S1 is the industry leader and has little, if any, direct
competition,'' Baker wrote in his research note. ``We believe 2000
will be a pivotal year for financial service technology companies
as traditional and non-traditional finance companies begin to
aggressively market their electronic services. As a result, we
believe S1 is one of the financial service companies that is
strategically positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he based his $200 price target on the valuations of
other companies that dominate their markets, such as eBay, Yahoo,
Inktomi and Verisign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no competition for S1,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the first time analysts and investors had a
chance to hear about how S1 had absorbed its acquisitions, said
Jeff John, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better than I expected,'' he said. ``They are targeting
the top 200 global financial institutions as customers. And they
are well on their way. S1's main competition are the banks that
build the software on their own. S1 owns the high-end of the
market. There doesn't appear to be anyone really challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   John has a target price of $120.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray's Steve Franco said S1 is positioning
itself to be a multi-national, very large software company selling
to the largest financial customers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts know Mahan as a deal-maker. Mahan said S1 might forge
some alliances, but he said he does not expect to make any
acquisitions anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have the software to do what we need to do,'' he
said. ``Now we can be a little more selective in how we feed the
engine.''

WINE TALK: UNCORKING GOOD CHEER AT THE LAST MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You. Yes, you with the panic-stricken look. Stop cringing.
Straighten up, and throw those shoulders back. Yes, you still have
gifts to buy. No, the Internet cannot save you now; it's a bit late
to click your troubles away. But be of good cheer: there is someone
who can.
</P>
<P>
   Who? Why, that friend to the dilatory, that last resort of all
last resorts, your local wine merchant. When all others have
failed, or closed up and gone home, he stands ready, up to the very
last minute, to lighten your holiday burden. Your wallet, as well,
but in truth, when it comes to gifts, there are probably more
bargains on the wine-shop shelves than just about anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Wine is one gift that flatters the giver and the recipient. Even
someone who doesn't know beans about wine is delighted to know that
you think he or she does. In fact, it's an area where neither of
you has to know very much.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of a really superb gift I spied in one of the shops
the other day: a wooden case containing three bottles of Dom
Perignon Champagne from three great vintages: 1966, 1975 and 1978.
The cost: $1,050. Now, before you gulp at the price, consider this:
Some names transcend their metier. People who know nothing about
baseball know about Joe Torre. People who know nothing about wine
have heard of Dom Perignon, Moet &AMP; Chandon's top-of-the-line brand.
For a wine fan, such a gift is doubly welcome, because Champagne is
made to be drunk soon after it is bottled, and even Champagne
lovers rarely have a chance to taste older vintages. Here is that
chance.
</P>
<P>
   For more modest tastes _ and pocketbooks _ a single bottle of a
good Champagne is always a welcome gift. Especially this year, when
it can be opened to bring in the new year, new century and new
millennium. Veuve Clicquot, dressed up for the holidays in its
special sack, is a perfect last-minute gift, at about $5.
</P>
<P>
   Just as festive, and quite a bit more wine, is a case of Georges
Duboeuf's Beaujolais nouveau, released a month ago and now at its
peak. It's difficult to think of a more compelling gift for about
$70. If you know you are buying for a true Beaujolais fan, think of
Duboeuf's 1998 Morgon, a bigger and better Beaujolais, for about
$120 a case.
</P>
<P>
   Port is a wonderful wine for cold winter nights. A roaring fire
and a faithful old dog are the perfect accompaniments, but none of
the wine shops I know carry them. Vintage port is the most
discussed of all the port styles, and for the port expert on your
list, it's the ideal gift. For anyone else, I'd choose a tawny,
which has been aged in wood for many years. A Taylor Special
20-year Tawny sells for about $45, a 30-year version for about $90.
Tawny refers to the amber color the wine assumes during its long
life in oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing less than a vintage port will do, a wise choice would
be a bottle of Cockburn's from one of the finest vintages of the
last century, 1963; it will go for around $200. A Quinta do Noval
from 1970, another fine vintage, sells for about $80.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive of all wine gifts is the big bottle.
Even a magnum, which is just a double bottle holding a liter and a
half of wine, is quite a sight on the dining table. Think of the
impact you will make when you bestow a double magnum, which equals
four regular bottles, or an imperial, which holds the equivalent of
eight bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of these outsize gifts can be reasonable. A magnum of
the 1996 Chateau Gloria can be had for about $60; Chateau
Phelan-Segur, a favorite of mine from St.-Estephe, is also $60. The
1996 Lafite-Rothschild, in magnum, is $1,100, but the same-size
bottle of 1995 Chateau Canon-Moueix, an attractive property in
Fronsac owned by Christian Moueix of Petrus fame, is only about
$38.
</P>
<P>
   In a double magnum, I like Chateau Malmaison 1995 from Moulis.
This is a second property of the late Baron Edmond de Rothschild,
now managed by his widow, Nadine. Not a complex wine but a most
attractive Bordeaux nonetheless. And at about $80, it makes a
spectacular gift.
</P>
<P>
   As for those imperials, the 1986 Petrus will set you back about
$10,000, but the 1996 Carruades de Lafite, the second label for
Lafite-Rothschild, is only around $375, and Chateau Talbot, from
the same vintage, is about $400. If you buy one of these monsters
and it's too late to have it delivered, bring a strong friend to
help carry it.
</P>
<P>
   A note of caution: Wine shops are filled with wine artifacts
this time of year: books, openers, stoppers, racks, glasses and
others. Some are interesting; many are junk. Avoid packages pairing
a bottle of wine with two glasses. The glasses are usually cheap
but add considerably to the price of the wine. Assume that whoever
is getting the gift already has glasses, and just buy the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a wine gift to end all wine gifts? Well, you could buy
someone a chateau in Bordeaux or a winery in Napa, but we're
talking last-minute stuff here; buying a chateau might take a day
or two. Here is something you might pick up on your way home from
work tomorrow: a set of three magnums _ those double bottles _ of
Romanee-Conti from the 1996 vintage. Romanee-Conti, from the
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti in Burgundy, is by far the most
prestigious of all French wines, surpassing even the great Bordeaux
like Petrus, Margaux and Haut-Brion.
</P>
<P>
   Romanee-Conti routinely sells for about $1,000 a bottle at the
vineyard, a price that escalates quickly because so little is made
each year _ around 700 cases _ that wealthy collectors vie to own
just a few bottles. Park Avenue Liquor Shop, in Manhattan, which is
making this offer, is charging about what you might pay for a new
Honda: $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Happy down-to-the-wire shopping.

 &HT;    MEXICAN DEMOCRACY FAILS SCREEN TEST AS FILMMAKER BATTLES
ATTEMPTED CENSORSHIP
 &HT;    1000 and add
 &HT;    Advance for release Sunday, Dec. 26
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But never before, during 70 years of one-party domination, has a
Mexican filmmaker dared to use this country's ruling party as the
undisguised villain in a movie about abuse of power. Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, is the explicit running
joke in ``Herod's Law,'' a newly-finished black comedy set in rural
Mexico in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is good enough to have won screenings in January at
Robert Redford's prestigious Sundance Film Festival in Utah. But a
short-lived debut in Mexico has prompted a national scandal that
belies the current PRI government's image as more respectful of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixture of political clumsiness and evil,'' said
37-year-old filmmaker Luis Estrada, reflecting on alleged attempts
to censor his movie, which still hasn't been released in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought things like this didn't still happen in this
country,'' Estrada added. ``Surprise, surprise, surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The film represents the first time a filmmaker here has broken
through a veil of self-censorship and state control to create
unsavory characters clearly identified as members of the PRI _
right down to their membership cards and campaign buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, magazines and non-fiction books take aim at the
PRI's failures and flaws with greater vigor now than when the party
ruled more supremely. But movies and television are the final
frontiers, even when it comes to a fictional treatment of the party
set 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada obtained more than 60 percent of his $1.45 million
budget for the film _ his fourth _ from the government-run Mexican
Cinema Institute. Filmmakers rely heavily on the agency because
private financing is so difficult to obtain here. A committee
reviewed the script in 1995 and approved funding and agreed to take
on distribution of the movie in partnership with Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell a story about power in this country,''
Estrada said. ``And it doesn't say anything new. The bad guys
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said some colleagues were taken aback by the audacity of
his script for ``Herod's Law,'' but he felt secure that times had
changed enough in Mexico that the film couldn't be repressed.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening scene, a top aide to a Mexican governor pins a
button emblazoned with the PRI logo on the main character's lapel.
From then on, the pin becomes a supporting character in a madcap
descent into corruption and betrayal set against an infectious
mambo soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we owe everything to the party,'' the aide tells the
protagonist, Juan Vargas, a swindler whose dream is to rise to a
lucrative position in Congress from his appointment as mayor of a
miserable desert hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is told to bring ``modernity and social justice'' to the
troubled village. But most of all, the party brass want control of
the townsfolk at any cost until after an upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's movie lampoons one of Mexico's main opposition parties
_ the National Action Party, or PAN _ as well as the Catholic
clergy and greedy gringos. But the antics of PRI politicians, who
pack pistols and consort with thugs with names like ``Sharkey,''
appear to be what ultimately terrified government bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to a 1992 reform that forbids it to censor content, the
film institute gave Estrada ``complete freedom'' while he produced
the movie, he said. After it was completed in September the
institute's directors saw it and congratulated him on its high
quality and humor.
</P>
<P>
   But when ``Herod's Law'' was scheduled for a French-sponsored
film festival in Acapulco in November, the institute tried to block
it from screening. Although it remains unclear who ordered the
muzzling, Estrada said it was obvious the institute showed the film
to someone in a powerful position who became upset.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Gonzalez Rubio, a novelist and committee member, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A functionary sees the film and panics about what he thinks
could be a problem for the party in an electoral period,'' Gonzalez
said, relating the story as if it were the plot for its own movie.
``A comedy of errors begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican newspapers leaped on the dispute and members of the
Acapulco audience began chanting ``freedom!'' in French. The
institute relented and the film was shown.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada began to negotiate with the institute, offering to buy
the agency's stake in the film and find an independent distributor.
He said the institute wanted to buy his share and dump the movie in
a can until at least 2001 _ well after Mexico's July 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of talks, Estrada opened up a newspaper in early
December and discovered two Mexico City theaters were screening his
film with minimal publicity, no opening event and without his
permission.
</P>
<P>
   People who saw the film told him the copies shown for several
days were either blurry or constantly interrupted by projector
problems. Estrada suspected a cheap attempt to further sabotage the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged, Estrada demanded the film be pulled. The institute told
him he was free to sue for beach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The institute wanted him to get tangled up in a lawsuit, Estrada
alleges, because it knew legal action would probably shelve the
film for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada turned to an opposition member of Congress who
threatened to make the conflict a legislative issue. Mexico's
top-ranking culture secretary stepped in and a settlement was
reached. Estrada assumed $900,000 from the institute's investment
in the film's $1.45 million budget and agreed to pay the debt from
the film's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently looking for a distributor interested in the
film's money-making potential and brave enough to take on a what he
calls a ``hot potato.'' He wants to show the film in Berlin and
already has been invited to events in Montreal, San Antonio, and
San Diego, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada also hopes to show the movie in U.S. cities where
Mexican immigrants are concentrated. He believes they'll embrace
the film as a ``little vengeance'' because so many immigrants blame
the PRI for their having to leave Mexico to seek better lives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some here have questioned Estrada's decision to use government
funds to make a film criticizing the party with the most power.
``The funds are everyone's. They don't belong to the government,''
Estrada bristled in response.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the deal was struck releasing the institute from
its partnership in the film, the agency's director was fired for
committing the ``error'' of trying to squelch the movie, according
to Rafael Tovar y de Teresa (CQ), president of Mexico's national
arts council.
</P>
<P>
   When the agreement with Estrada was struck, Tovar y de Teresa
announced publicly that ``freedom of individual creation and
artistic talent in Mexico is guaranteed.'' But he declined repeated
requests to discuss the matter further.
</P>
<P>
   The film institute's new director also declined to talk about
the dispute. And since he was removed, the previous director hasn't
been available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   An aide in President Ernesto Zedillo's office said the Mexican
leader, respecting the autonomy of the institute, didn't get
involved in the imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   The aide acknowledged, however, that the attempt to block the
movie ``contradicted'' Zedillo's emphasis in speeches that Mexicans
should enjoy freedom of expression. It was Zedillo who championed
the PRI's first primary presidential election in November as a show
that his party was becoming more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist in Mexico City's Reforma newspaper recently reported
that on Nov. 26 a powerful group convened for a private screening
of ``Herod's Law.'' The group included Mexico's interior secretary,
whose ministry rates movies, Tovar y de Teresa and the former film
institute director.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco reportedly thought the film
was funny and reflected a PRI of 50 years ago that no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexicans finally get a chance to see the film, Estrada
said, ``Each person can ask himself that question. Is it a PRI that
no longer _ or still _ exists?''

   NEW YORK _ Birthdays do not make me feel nearly as old as I feel
come New Year's Eve. I think it's the communal countdown in the
final seconds, then weeks of miswriting the date on checks because
I'm still living in the past, that make me acutely aware of the
passage of time. I've had 365 days, my psyche whines. Where did
they all go?
</P>
<P>
   In college _ back when I thought I was busy _ I spent some spare
time reading Ionesco. ``We haven't the time to take our time,'' he
wrote, and I copied that down and tacked it to my bulletin board,
my justification for sloppy work and rash decisions. I now know, of
course, that I couldn't have been all that busy since I had time to
read a Romanian playwright who wrote in French.
</P>
<P>
   Then I graduated and began my first job. Talk about busy. In
those early years I came to the newsroom early, left late, skipped
vacation and stopped in for at least a few hours most weekends. But
my mental scrapbook also contains snapshots of brunch. Hours spent
reading the whole of the Sunday paper. Along the way I married and
I shared those brunches and that paper with my husband, Bruce _
before each of us headed off for a few hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until I had children that I understood what busy was.
Bruce and I had never fought during our first four years together,
but when our first son was born, I found myself picking fights
about something I'd always taken for granted. No, not sleep. Time.
``The devourer of all things,'' was how Ovid described it (yes, I'd
once had time to read him, too), and now that I was trying to give
100 percent of myself at work and 100 percent of myself at home,
the lack of time was threatening to devour me.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir came one afternoon when I drew up an elaborate chart,
with separate columns for the amount of time, to the minute, that
we had each spent alone, together, working, playing and caring for
the baby, over the weekend. That it didn't prove the dramatic
imbalance I'd set out to prove only fueled my rage more. I maturely
ripped the chart to pieces, tossed it all at my husband and stormed
out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Life (and time) being relative (no, I never read Einstein), some
people would see it as a luxury to have time to make a chart in the
first place, and even more of a luxury to have a partner to throw
it at. I have been writing this column for three months now, and
readers have been writing back. Most of the mail is about time (and
guilt, which, given the context, is the same thing), and much of it
is from people who are balancing work and life and children on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a single parent,'' says Jennifer McGregor, who runs a
Manhattan consulting company that specializes in public art
projects, ``I'm dependent on complex, fragile arrangements that
include an excellent after-school program, the health of my two
girls, the availability of my parents who live 250 miles away, and
the good will of the children's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she says, the house of cards tumbles, like the day
she was at a meeting in Philadelphia and realized she had forgotten
to leave a key for the sitter who was supposed to pick up the
children from a friend's house and take them home.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Laing has only recently come to see her life reflected
in such moments. Until last year she was a professional
photographer in Midland, Texas, a job she loved for its creativity
as well as its flexibility. Every Christmas season, she would hold
an elaborate party, where dozens of neighborhood children would
bake and ice hundreds of cookies and then deliver them to homeless
shelters. She would also create a masterpiece of a Christmas card.
Once she rented a trampoline and placed it against the backdrop of
a cloud-filled sky so she could photograph her children as if they
were flying.
</P>
<P>
   But now she is divorced, working 50 hours a week at a job with
benefits and a steady paycheck. There will be no cookie party this
year, and no Christmas card, not even a store-bought one. ``It's an
acknowledgment that I have limits and can only do so many things,''
she said during a teary phone call. ``I just ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't managed to send holiday cards this season, either. The
ones I have received wish me peace and love and joy, and computers
that continue to function after midnight on the 31st. I wish you
all those things, and one thing more. I wish you the time to enjoy
them.

TIGHTER SECURITY FOR WEB BUYERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has been a boon for wired travelers with the
patience and savvy to surf for good deals, but it can also leave
unwary travelers in a highly precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, a technical administrator for an
Internet service provider in Seattle discovered that hundreds of
Web sites had left their customers' credit card information
completely exposed to anyone with an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sites was a travel company that arranged trips to
Cancun; so not only could thieves use the card but they could also
find out a family's travel plans and visit the empty home while
they were away.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of travel Web sites are quick to point out that no
such thefts have been reported, but the mere threat continues to
vex Internet users. Jupiter Communications, a New York-based
research firm, says that 17 percent of online shoppers surveyed are
``extremely reluctant'' to use credit cards online.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is improving, as technology companies and
travel sites continue to roll out features and policies meant to
protect customers from fraud _ and as consumers become more
accustomed to online buying.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular travel sites now give customers myriad ways to
pay for tickets and secure reservations, while also paying the
first $50 of any fraudulent misuse of credit cards (credit card
issuers are liable for the rest). And every reputable online travel
site features secure sockets layer (SSL) transactions, which
encrypt credit card data while in transit, virtually guaranteeing
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet you can't tell when you're in the bad part of
town,'' said Terrell B. Jones, president of Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com), which announced a merger with Preview Travel
(www.previewtravel.com) in October. ``Everything looks just about
the same, so we have to convince people we're a safe place to do
business. And that's especially true when you're selling a $280,
nonrefundable electronic ticket. People don't want to make a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that Travelocity saw a measurable difference in sales
last year when it posted a notice telling consumers that they would
not be liable for the first $50 of any credit card misuse, if the
card issuer did not cover it. ``We also told consumers they could
call in their credit card numbers if they weren't comfortable
giving them online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company allows consumers to mail or fax credit
card numbers to secure reservations. ``Somehow people think a fax
is an unbreakable secure encryption system, which it isn't, but
that's OK, it's what they're comfortable with,'' he said, noting
that about 50 people a day phone or fax their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and executives say it is now common for the
better-known travel sites to offer the option to phone or fax
credit-card numbers. But most travel sites will not honor a
personal check.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines cannot hold seats based on a personal check because it
can take several days for bad checks to be reported, during which
time the airlines cannot sell the seats to other buyers. ``And they
don't want a 7-year-old booking a flight on the Concorde, which
happened once,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Travel sites are also sweetening the pot to encourage reluctant
shoppers to part with their credit card numbers online, mostly
because sites know how much cheaper it is to process a reservation
online. Companies can pay $25 or more in overhead every time a
customer service representative answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the deluge of online travel incentives: the Hotel
Reservation Network (www.hoteldiscount.com), a Dallas-based service
that books hotel rooms nationwide, is offering rebates up to $50
this month for reservations made completely online; through April
30, United Airlines (www.ual.com) is giving 3,000 miles upon each
customer's first online booking, plus the standard 1,000-mile bonus
for each online purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Sites are offering other forms of encouragement as well _ most
notably convenience. Online travel companies have made it easier
than ever to complete transactions, in part because they now offer
a degree of personalized service that's almost unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Expedia (www.expedia.com), Travelocity's chief
competitor, allows registered users to create a file of travel
preferences for everyone in the family, including frequent flier
numbers, seating and food preferences, disabilities and age (in
case anyone qualifies for discounts).
</P>
<P>
   Expedia will also store a user's home airport the first time a
trip is booked through the site, which, when combined with the
travel preferences and credit card information stored by Expedia,
can whisk users through a reservation in three to four clicks.
Travelocity boasts the same capability, and both sites go to great
lengths to assure that personal information will remain
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who are either too leery of storing personal
information on multiple travel sites or don't want to spend the
time typing it in are candidates to use an increasingly popular
online technology called the ``digital wallet.'' These wallets
allow users to store their information either on their computer or
on a secure Internet site, where it can be used to fill in forms
with one click.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the more popular wallet devices are offered by eCode
(www.ecode.com) and Gator (www.gator.com), each of which provide
the service free. ECode, based in Santa Clara, Calif., stores a
user's personal and credit card information _ as well as log-ins or
passwords for sites requiring registration _ on the company's
secure server.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever users confront a blank form on any site, they click a
button and their relevant information is instantly sent _ encrypted
_ to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Gator, which has compiled hundreds of thousands of users in a
few months, stores your information on your computer. Frequent
travelers must store it on laptops to use a digital wallet on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   With both Gator and eCode, users must spend a few minutes
downloading the wallet software, which does not work with a
Macintosh. Wallets only help fill out the transaction forms _
ticket returns or any other issues arising from the purchase must
be handled directly with the merchant. And these wallets don't yet
store the more-complete dossier of information that travel sites
typically do. But that may change quickly, as technology improves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision is for Gator to evolve into a general purpose
assistant,'' said Jeff McFadden, the company's chief executive.
``So if you're on United Airlines' site looking to book a trip to
Bermuda, Gator could recognize that and say `Hey, would you like me
to check all the rest of the airline sites for a better rate?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gator, based in San Mateo, Calif., was begun last year by
McFadden and a team of entrepreneurs, who began offering the
service to consumers in June. Since then, McFadden said, the
company's electronic wallet has been downloaded by hundreds of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   ECode is used by more than 100,000 people, said Rohit Chandra,
the company president, who founded the firm in 1997.

``little toasts'' traveled from Tuscany to the U.S. and inevitably
crossed cultures to suit a variety of tastes and sport a variety of
toppings. &HT;    Main story followed by sidebars and recipes from noted Bay Area

MANY CUBANS CONTINUE TO PRAISE CASTRO WHILE DEPLORING THE U.S.
EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ Behind a display case filled with cassettes of
Cuban music from decades past, Wilfredo del Rio keeps another oldie
under glass. It is a photograph of Fidel Castro, smiling and
youthful, taken in the heady days after the revolution triumphed in
January 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have it guarded, like a relic,'' said del Rio, a cashier at
the store in the Barrio Colon section of Havana. ``It is something
big for us. We love Fidel a lot. He has his defects like anyone
else. But I consider him to be the man of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   He reeled off a litany of advances in education and health care
in the 40 years since Castro came to power, a familiar refrain for
many Cubans. For most of that time, the island has been under a
U.S. trade embargo, a move intended to force Castro out of power
or, at least, bring about democratic reforms. Despite the pressure,
Castro and his Communist government remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the embargo's impact has been borne by Cuban
citizens, the most desperate of whom take to the seas in small
boats and rafts, sometimes with tragic results. Those who remain
scramble and improvise to supplement their small monthly incomes
with American dollars from relatives abroad or with tips from
tourists and trades with neighbors and co-workers. If not, they
simply do without.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lack a lot that is needed to move forward and resolve the
economic problems,'' del Rio said. ``I think to resolve the
economic problems there should be a little more liberty and
democracy so that foreign investors will come and invest in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, he insisted that he still had great affection for
Castro as a person.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mix of emotions are often encountered here, pitting
whatever personal admiration people may have for Castro and the
revolution against their daily struggle to make ends meet as the
nation recovers from the economic crisis brought by the collapse of
the Soviet Union eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While officials point to recent economic reforms that have led
to some growth _ legalizing the owning of dollars and courting
foreign investment _ many Cubans complain privately that those
benefits have yet to filter down to their households. In their
daily lives, they are left reconciling their allegiance to the
revolution's social advances with their individual pessimism about
improving their standard of living after years of barely getting
by.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cubans have benefited from the modest liberalizing of the
economy _ and not just in the tourist sector with its gleaming new
hotels filled with dollar-laden foreigners. Tradespeople have gone
into business for themselves while other enterprising types have
opened up paladares _ restaurants they operate in their homes _ in
return for paying a monthly tax in hard currency to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The legalization of the dollar a few years ago has increased
buying power, at least for those Cubans with tourist-industry jobs
or relatives in the United States. But it has also brought with it
an uncomfortable distinction between those who have access to
dollars and those who do not. In a country where people line up to
receive their monthly rations of food, there is now yet another
line, this time of people waiting to get into the state-run dollar
shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say this is a socialist government,'' said del Rio, who
supplements his monthly income with several hundred dollars sent
each year by relatives living in the United States. ``But I see a
mix of capitalism and socialism. On one side I see the dollar in
circulation. Here, we work with the national currency. We do not
get dollars. Yet all the good merchandise from clothes to food is
in dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular morning, few people had passed by the record
shop. del Rio's co-worker, Mercedes Martin, acknowledged that the
economy was tight and people had little money for amusements. At
the same time, she considered it a small sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived under capitalism,'' said Ms. Martin, 53. ``I suffered.
When I was 11 I was cleaning floors in private homes. I could not
go to school. My father was jailed because he was for the
revolution. Things were hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, ``we are another people. There is less
diversion, but we have other things. We have a roof. We have
security. We have schools for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   They also have the embargo, which for her and many other Cubans
is the biggest impediment to their future. But given her past, it
was a burden she insisted she was still willing to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did not have a blockade, we could live like we are
supposed to,'' she said. ``But I prefer the blockade to Fidel
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost absent-mindedly, she stroked Castro's photograph, under
glass and frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave Papa here,'' she said. ``You think we would trade this
because of the blockade? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. A young man who lives in the Cayo Hueso
section said that when he was not working at his maintenance job he
tried to earn a few dollars by steering tourists to restaurants. He
pointed to a child riding her bike on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make $8 a month and that bike over there costs $30,'' said
the man, who declined to give his name. ``I get paid in pesos. How
could I buy that? You cannot live on that. Who can?''
</P>
<P>
   He wondered how much longer it would be like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have got to get better,'' he said. ``Maybe by 2005?''
</P>
<P>
   But guessing when change will come, either by political reform
or biological inevitability, has proven to be a perplexing game. At
73, Castro has outlived many of his fiercest critics. At a summit
meeting in November of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations, he
was resolute in affirming the path he had chosen 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than speculate about any possible transfer of power,
publicly at least, many Cubans prefer to criticize the embargo,
saying that it has not accomplished much except to deny American
businesses the chance to invest in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They themselves lose more by not selling to us,'' said
Cristobal Solano Zuleta, a barber in Cayo Hueso. ``So why not
remove it? There is still a little group in Miami who are
pressuring Washington because they have money. But it will not
remove Fidel.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of his friends and neighbors had gathered inside his
cramped apartment to celebrate his wedding earlier in the day.
Apart from festive music and glasses filled with rum, there was not
much else to fuel the party, but they made do with what they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish for a better future,'' Solano said.
``Economically, socially. I don't know. To live a little better. We
are of the lower class, but we live well. Poor, but well. We eat
every day. We struggle, like any human being.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, his friends said, but they insisted it was the
only way they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say Fidel is going tomorrow, or that he
is gone,'' said Raul Cabrera, 39, who dropped in on the party after
finishing his shift at a construction site. ``But those of us who
were born with this will follow the revolution until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   More neighbors joined the party, as a young boy beat out a dance
rhythm on wooden block mounted on a steel pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wine is bitter,'' Cabrera said. ``But it is ours. We
labor. But it is ours and we drink it.''

 Toast of the Town: A few easy toppings turn simple bread
slices  into delectable crostini   By Tilde Herrera 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Crostini have long been Italy's rustic answer to
the French canape. Less refined than the crackers and toast points
that are the bases _ literally _ for classic canapes, these
``little toasts'' are perfect for holiday entertaining.
<P>
   In the classic tale of American culinary trends, the ``little
toasts'' traveled from Tuscany to the U.S. and inevitably crossed
cultures to suit a variety of tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Crostini are thin slices of day-old baguette, crust intact,
toasted in the oven and brushed with olive oil. Then they can
assume a variety of guises, depending upon what's laid upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they sport silken squares of French foie gras, zesty
mounds of Latin chiles or slices of seared ahi tuna dolloped with
Japanese-inspired wasabe creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   These toppings _ or the likes of porcini and roasted poblanos
from Do &LR; n &LR; a Tom &LR; a &LR; s' Do &LR; n &LR; a Savitsky or ``forest'' crostini from
Bistro Ralph's Ralph Tingle _ are colorful, delicious and most
importantly, many can be prepared quickly for last-minute
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Crostini look appealing, are easy make and to serve _ which is
why they've emerged as a secret weapon of the catering business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chefs like crostini because they can use different kinds
of bread with olive oil, fresh herbs and hundreds of topping
varieties to suit any taste or color scheme,'' says Jane Hammond of
Jane Hammond Events in San Francisco. ``Even if we make thousands
of them, they don't suffer because we can make them ahead of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Teri Menchini of La Bocca Fina Catering in Hayward has been
serving crostini throughout her 18 years in business. ``Crostini
are so varietal, easy to eat and offer so many non-meat options,''
she enthuses. ``People like to have a taste of everything and this
allows them to sample different flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why crostini are especially suited to the last holiday
season of the century. We have collected 10 crostini recipes from
Bay Area chefs and food professionals that are sure to spoil your
guests _ and with very little time and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Just two or three different types are fine for a small
get-together, and none of them requires more than a handful of
ingredients. The choice of toppings is as endless as your
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Crostini Pointers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are ways to ensure top-notch crostini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Use the right bread and slice it thinly.  &LR; Crostini should be
sliced no thicker than 1/4-inch. Italian and French baguettes (not
sourdough) are the best choices, although other breads such as rye
and pumpernickel may be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Use day-old bread if possible because bread that is too fresh
may not be able to withstand the weight or moisture of certain
toppings.
</P>
<P>
   The slices should be small enough to be eaten in 1-2 bites. They
are traditionally cut straight down but bias cuts are very
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Brush the slices with olive oil.  &LR; Don't use too much oil or
your guests will end up with oily, messy fingers. Sprinkle with a
dash of salt and pepper, if desired. They can be rubbed with garlic
as well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Toast the bread.  &LR; Place the sliced bread on a cookie sheet in
a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until lightly golden.
Cook slightly less if you plan to reheat with toppings. Remove and
let cool. If making ahead of time, seal in a plastic airtight
container or storage bag after they have cooled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Choose toppings with care.  &LR; The toppings should be neat and
compact so that they don't fall off the crostini as they are being
passed around or bitten into. Garnish with fresh herbs for color.
Arrange on a serving tray and pass. Some crostini may be assembled
and refrigerated hours in advance if the toppings won't make the
crostini soggy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Plan the correct amount.  &LR; Expect that most people will eat
2-3 of each hors d'oeuvre. Each baguette will yield approximately
36-40 toasts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Topping Options &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More crostini topping ideas:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Tapenade With Roasted Peppers and Basil.  &LR; Top with a thin
layer of good commercial olive tapenade. Garnish with strips of
canned roasted peppers and a leaf of fresh basil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Smoked Salmon With Cream Cheese and Dill.  &LR; Blend 11/4 cups of
softened cream cheese with 1-2 tablespoons of chopped fresh dill
and salt to taste. Cut slices of store-bought smoked salmon and
roll into small cigars. Place a salmon cigar diagonally across a
crostini and garnish with a few capers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Seared Ahi Tuna With Wasabi Creme Fraiche. &LR;  Season a 1-inch
by 1-inch by 5-inch strip of ahi tuna with salt and pepper. Heat a
tablespoon of olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat until
almost smoking. Place ahi in the pan, searing evenly on all sides
until brown but not cooked all the way through. The center should
remain bright pink. Drain and place on cutting board. Cut slices
1/8-inch thick and set aside. Mix 1 cup creme fraiche with prepared
Japanese wasabi to taste. Arrange ahi on crostini and garnish with
a small dollop of creme fraiche. Tuna may be chilled or served
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Smoked Chicken With Roquefort and Toasted Walnuts.  &LR; Sprinkle
1 cup crumbled Roquefort cheese over toasts, followed by a thin
layer of chopped, toasted walnuts. Slice thin shreds of 6 ounces of
prepared smoked chicken and place on crostini. Finish with a
crumble of Roquefort. Place under broiler briefly, until melted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Chicken Liver and Anchovy.  &LR; Chop 8 chicken livers finely and
mix with 1 tablespoon minced parsley. Saute in butter or olive oil
for 5 minutes. Add 3-4 diced anchovy fillets and saute for 1 minute
more. Deglaze pan with a splash of sherry and remove from heat.
Season mixture with salt and pepper and spread on toasts. Garnish
with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; What is Bruschetta? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Crostini resemble their Italian cousin, bruschetta. But the
Italian toasts are generally thicker and made from heavier-crusted
bread. They're traditionally used to show off the quality of a good
olive oil _ the slices are first rubbed with whole garlic cloves,
then grilled and lastly drizzled with the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, bruschetta began to bear toppings as well _ most
notably, ripe tomatoes showered with slivers of fresh basil. Today,
bruschetta is often toasted in the oven, but no matter how it's
made the outside should be crispy or even charred around the edges
while the center remains slightly soft.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, crostini are brushed with olive oil before being
toasted in the oven, are crisp all the way through and support a
huge array of topping combinations. Crostini should never be sliced
more than 1/4-inch thick while bruschetta can be as thick as
3/4-inch. If cleverly planned, bruschetta can even serve as a meal;
crostini are specifically snacks. Ideally, crostini should be eaten
in 1 to 2 bites and can be served warm or cold.
</P>
<P>

QUINCE AND CHEVRE CROSTINI
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Rossi of Oakland's Citron restaurant uses quince,
which tastes like a cross between a pear and an apple, for a
seasonal flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 large quince, peeled, cored and cut into eighths
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces good-quality chevre
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cream
</P>

   36 toasted slices of baguette (see instructions elsewhere on
this page)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place quince and sugar in a non-corrosive pot. Cover with water
and bring to a simmer. Cook until the quince are tender, about 12
minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, lift the quince from the
syrup and, while still warm, cut the quince into thin slices.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the chevre and cream together in a small bowl to form a
soft spread.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the chevre mixture on each baguette slice and top with

 &LR; ARTICHOKE AND YUKON GOLD POTATO CROSTINI
</P>
<P>
   From Kirk Webber of Cafe Kati in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 large artichokes
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large yellow onion, sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Sauvignon Blanc
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Small Yukon Gold potatoes
</P>
<P>
   3 smashed cloves of garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Gorgonzola, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   36 toasted slices of baguette (see instructions elsewhere on
this page)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Remove the outer leaves of the artichoke until you get to the
yellow center leaves. Cut crosswise through those leaves about 1
inch from each stem. Use a paring knife to cut off all of the dark
green leaves, leaving only the tender leaves. Scoop out the chokes
with a teaspoon and place the artichokes in water mixed with the
juice of 1 lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a skillet. Add the onion
and saute briefly. Add half of the Sauvignon Blanc and continue to
cook until the onions turn a deep brown color, stirring regularly
once the onions start to color. When the onions start to stick on
the edges, add the rest of the wine to the pan and boil until the
onions caramelize and the liquid evaporates. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the potatoes into eighths and place them in a large pot with
the artichokes. Add water to cover, the smashed garlic and the 1
tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for
about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Place the potatoes in a bowl and mash with the half-and-half, 2
tablespoons olive oil, 5 teaspoons Gorgonzola, the rosemary and
salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the outer three-fourths of the artichoke stems. With
stem pointed up, cut the artichoke in quarters. Slice thinly with
stem still pointed up. Each artichoke heart should yield
approximately 20 slices.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet. Add the
artichoke slices, season with salt and saute until slightly golden.
When they are done, dip them briefly in a bowl with the juice of
the second lemon. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Spread the potato-Gorgonzola mixture onto
the toasted baguette slices. Put 2-3 slices of artichoke on top,
followed by a thin layer of carmelized onions. Top with a small
crumble of Gorgonzola. Repeat with the remaining crostini.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the crostini to a baking sheet and broil for a few
seconds, until the cheese melts.

 &LR; WHITE BEAN CROSTINI WITH DUCK CONFIT
</P>
<P>
   The duck confit in this recipe from Christopher Fernandez and
Morgan Brownlow of Stars Bar &AMP; Dining in San Francisco can be
purchased at a specialty grocery store or butcher shop, or you can
make your own. You may also substitute canned cannellini beans
instead of cooking them from scratch although some flavor witll be
sacrified. If you use the canned beans, rinse them and add enough
liquid (half water, half stock) to just cover them. Add the sage
leaves and simmer for at least 30 minutes before pureeing.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cannellini beans, soaked overnight in water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 small stalk of celery
</P>
<P>
   1 small carrot, peeled
</P>
<P>
   6 sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves of roasted garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 legs of duck confit, meat pulled off the bone and shredded
</P>
<P>
   36 toasted slices of baguette (see instructions elsewhere on
this page)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Drain the soaked beans and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a
medium-size stockpot and add the onions. When the onions are
translucent, add the drained beans, the celery, carrot, sage
leaves, bay leaf, chicken stock and water. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1-11/2 hours, or until the beans
are soft. Add additional stock and water as needed to keep the
beans submerged in the liquid. Season with salt and pepper to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the beans, reserving 4 tablespoons of the cooking liquid.
Remove the celery, carrot, bay leaf, sage leaves and half of the
onions.
</P>
<P>
   Puree the beans, approximately 1/4-1/2 cup of the reserved
onion, and the roasted garlic in a food processor. Add 2-4
tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid to the processed beans
to a make a slightly thin, spreadable puree. Add the extra virgin
olive oil. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the bean puree on the crostini and garnish with the
shredded duck confit.

   BRASOV, Romania _ Ten years ago, the Romanians rose up against
communist rule and the grinding dictatorship of a personality cult.
But the prosperity that had vanished under Nicolae Ceausescu's
regime now seems more remote than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This often-overlooked country of 22 million, bigger than most of
its East European neighbors, is going through harder times than
most of them. The average wage has slipped to $80 a month, and
one-third of the country lives on less than $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn in Bucharest, the capital, groups of children emerge
from the sewers to beg, just as they do in the capital of Angola.
While Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and even tiny Estonia are
a jump away from joining the European Union, Romania lingers with
the underachievers, proud to be invited to qualify in a later
round.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mihai-Cristian Grigore, 32, a citizen of Brasov, an industrial
city in the Carpathian Mountains, knows Western-style
reorganization from the sharp end. A high school dropout, he was a
machinist in a factory that made hardware for doors before the 1989
revolution. That could have been a job for life. But in 1990,
Grigore recalled, ``our boss bought it from the state, dismissed
everybody and hired his own family.''
</P>
<P>
   His next job lasted five years and ended with a layoff. Six
months later, he found work at a screw factory where his mother
spent her career. But it was shrinking, and he was laid off again.
He wound up tiling sidewalks for a pittance. But that winter was
snowy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Grigore lives on $15 a month from temporary welfare, help
from relatives and the $14 a month that his wife makes selling
fruit on the street.
</P>
<P>
   He took a truck-driving course, but the police officers who
administered the exam were in a hurry at the end, and no one in his
class finished. Now he, too, hopes to obtain a license to sell
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying all I can to improve my life,'' Grigore said. ``But
this is the way we live now. If I could go overseas, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Romanians are bitter. In November, in a poll that stunned the
government, 61 percent said that life was better under Ceausescu,
who along with his wife was so hated that they were tried and shot
on Christmas Day in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Life then was lousy. Apartments were heated less than four hours
a day. Food shortages were so bad that people lined up for hours
and literally fought one another over rare supplies of chicken
parts with almost no meat, and television was two evening hours
simply glorifying the ruling couple.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployed remember that everyone had jobs under
Ceausescu, despite his North Korean-style tyranny. A visitor
constantly hears this refrain: ``Then we had money, but there was
nothing to buy. Now the shops are full, but we have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the government nor President Emil Constantinescu,
elected in 1997 with great hopes for change because it was the
first peaceful transfer of power in Romanian history, is planning a
nationwide celebration of the 10th anniversary of the revolution on
Wednesday. They fear that any spark could set off rioting.
</P>
<P>
   The government itself, a fragile, bickering multiparty
coalition, is in turmoil, accused of corruption and bungling the
economy. In what a local political commentator called ``a typical
Romanian circus,'' Constantinescu dismissed Prime Minister Radu
Vasile on Dec. 14, after most of his cabinet had resigned. Vasile
was defiant, saying the president had no such power, then
succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Mugur Isarescu, an economist who had run the
central bank since 1991 and is in no political party. Isarescu is
highly regarded. He was reported to have taken the job reluctantly
and to have asked Parliament to guarantee him his old job back
after the elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   Violent strikes reminiscent of the dictator's waning days have
returned, and some marchers have taken to carrying Ceausescu's
picture. On Nov. 1 in Brasov, angry workers from the Roman truck
factory invaded and vandalized a government building. Their plant,
which once supplied much of the Soviet bloc, has shrunk, to 9,100
workers from 21,000 in 1990. The Tractorul tractor plant did the
same, and feels stabbed by both East and West. The NATO blockade of
Yugoslavia hurt sales just as the Soviet collapse did.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By some lights, the truck factory is where the 1989 revolution
began. In 1987, workers furious at working on Sundays for no pay
cut the electricity and marched on the building, where they found a
groaning buffet table set out for a Communist Party fete. They
rioted. For two years afterward, the factory floor was full of
security police officers in workers' clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The spies are gone. Hard times are not. A union president, Gabor
Fanica, said his members spent 90 percent of their salaries on
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possibility to buy new clothes or keep up your
apartment, to allow yourself to make phone calls, let alone to go
away on vacation,'' Fanica said. The laid-off go to soup kitchens
or move in with rural relatives and eat what they grow.
</P>
<P>
   Aged pensioners have it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's pension amounts to 7 pizzas a month,'' said Mircea
Irimie, 58, a retired railway engineer in the western city of
Timisoara. ``Who can live on that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These beautiful buildings?'' he added, waving at the town's
Orthodox cathedral with an odd German roof. ``They're all a facade,
my friend. Romania used to export wheat to the world. Now it
exports only prostitutes.''

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: Crustacean's Harvest Leaves Fishermen Crabby  By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; After a very slow start, the Dungeness crab season
is picking up a little steam. But the crabs at seafood markets in
the Bay Area are underweight, with shells that fishmongers say are
still too soft.
<P>
   That means higher retail prices and crabs that aren't as meaty
as in years past.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the average size is about 13/4 pounds. ``A crab from up
north might be two pounds plus but a lot will be water rather than
meat,'' said Steve Kingsley, a partner in San Francisco's Morgan
Fish. ``The crab that are out there haven't matured enough. They're
just not full of meat like you'd want.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabbers and fish wholesalers attribute the slow start to
various causes, all of which boil down to one thing: the vagaries
of mother nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is late this year. Steelhead are a month late,''
says Paul Johnson, president of Monterey Fish.
</P>
<P>
   A round of bad weather earlier this month didn't help local
supplies. Still, the slow start can't all be blamed on the storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we go out there in good weather and the ocean's like
glass, there just aren't any crab,'' says John Minaidis, Jr., owner
of Half Moon Bay Fish Market. ``I think it's just going to stay the
way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 crab boats ply California's waters searching for crab
between mid-November, when the season opens, to the end of June
when it closes. In a good year, crabbers will pull more than 4
million pounds of crab from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   This year doesn't look like it will be particularly good for
local crabbers. But for crab lovers, hope is coming from the north.
Earlier this month, the first shipments of crab from Washington and
Oregon started pouring into the Bay Area, sending prices down and
selection up. Their numbers will likely outweigh the local crab
catch for much of the season, sellers predict.
</P>
<P>
   The quality and amount of the northern catch can affect prices
day to day in the volatile crab market. Monday, prices for live
crab dropped to under $6, although it was up near $10 at a few
markets. Cooked crab was much cheaper Monday. Safeway, which
doesn't sell live crab, had cooked crab for $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   But in the up-and-down world of crab pricing, ``That may change
in heartbeat,'' Kingsley says.

 BRASOV, Romania: only prostitutes.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists and politicians cite many reasons for Romania's
agony.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, Romania was almost entirely agrarian, unlike
East Germany or Czechoslovakia. As collective farming ends and
property seized under communism is restored, peasants are receiving
small plots rather than shares in big farms. Vegetable farming
thrives. But mechanized wheat farming cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ceausescu, any business spirit was throttled by a
Stalinist system more severe than any East European regime outside
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Before communism fell, said Silviu Brucan, a once-ardent
communist economist and former ambassador to the United States who
became disillusioned with Ceausescu and joined the ruling council
that replaced him, there was a ``potential middle class in training
for capitalism'' _ people who owned homes, cars, saw Western
movies, vacationed abroad, perhaps even did some private business.
</P>
<P>
   In Czechoslovakia, Brucan said, that was 30 percent of the
population, in Hungary 20 percent and in Poland 15 percent. In
Romania, it was less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a peasant who wanted to slaughter his pig before
Christmas had to ask permission of the local militia,'' Brucan
said, ``because the number of pigs raised was an important
indicator,'' measured by state planners, to trumpet communism's
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Ceausescu's megalomaniacal industrial projects distorted the
economy. Romania built mills to produce more steel than France and
refineries for 35 million tons of crude oil a year, while the
country pumped 7 million. Now they lie rusting.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, even by 1989, almost no Romanian owned a computer.
Typewriters were treated the way guns were. Each had to be
registered with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Romania has had little appeal to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a German car manufacturer, where would you invest,
Hungary or Romania?'' asked Martin Taylor, director of the European
Emerging Markets group for Baring Asset Management in London. ``In
Hungary, you get high literacy, a seven-year tax break, no tariffs
and very clear commercial law. In Romania, you have corruption,
lower literacy, law that makes it hard to prove ownership, tariffs,
poor infrastructure, and it's further away. Besides, you'd want a
domestic market, and 10 million rich Hungarians will buy more cars
than 20 million poor Romanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ion Iliescu, the former communist who was president from 1990 to
1996 and is leading in preliminary polls for the vote next year,
argues that the economy nosedived from 1990 to 1993, but that he
turned it around by gradually cutting subsidies and government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The current government's shock therapy sent it spinning down
again, Iliescu says. His opponents say that he ran up deficits that
would have meant bankruptcy and that their cost-cutting and
privatization will save the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old story,'' said Petre Roman, an early
post-communist prime minister who became first deputy premier and
foreign minister in the cabinet shuffle last week. ``Those who do
the reform lose the sympathy of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some Romanians note, only amnesiacs could think that
life was better in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandru Ioan Pop, head of the union in the Brasov tractor
plant, sat in a well-stocked bakery with a foreign reporter and
drew the comparison. ``They sold pastry here before the revolution
too,'' Pop said. ``But then there were only two refrigerators and
three kinds of pastry, and the Securitate would have arrested us in
five minutes. In 1989, I wasn't even allowed to stand in the street
and shout, `All I eat is pigs' feet!'''

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  BEST WAY: Homemade Sugar Cookies  
   
 By Rebecca Markowitz  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  One of my most treasured memories from childhood
is how my brothers and sister and I would decorate the holiday
sugar cookies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mom would make the dough, roll it out, cut the cookies and place
them on the cookie sheet. Then we let loose our artistic abilities
in the form of tie-died trees and purple reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't begun baking for the holidays, don't fret, this
recipe can be prepared in an afternoon. It will help occupy the
kids on those long school free days, and may create treasured
memories for your family as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the season, the Chronicle's Food staff ventured
to find what makes the best sugar cookie. We began by comparing
several recipes and found that most varied in the type of fat
specified and slightly in technique. We settled on a basic recipe
from The Chronicle's Baker columnist Flo Braker, then varied the
fat. We baked three batches _ one with all shortening, all butter,
and half butter-half shortening. With each batch, we noted how the
fat affected the mixing, rolling out and final flavor and texture.
We also checked which batch was best after several days' storage.
</P>
<P>
   We found that the recipe using butter only produced a rich
tasting but very soft cookie. In baking, the high amount of butter
also caused the cookie to brown quickly and unevenly. However, it
baked in the shortest time _ just 10 to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The half butter-half shortening cookie was crispy on the outside
and slightly soft on the inside. The edges browned slightly and
evenly, but the cookies took slightly longer to bake _ 13 to 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The shortening-only dough was the easiest to roll out but the
most difficult to transfer to the baking sheet. The resulting
cookie was extremely crisp. Many tasters thought this cookie tasted
bland, but one staffer enjoyed the contrast of the sweet and salty
flavors. Although it took the longest to bake _ 15 to 17 minutes _
it never browned.
</P>
<P>
   Using the half butter-half shortening cookie recipe as our
favorite, we tested how long the dough should be refrigerated
before rolling out. Chilling the dough makes handling the dough
easier. If the dough is too warm, it will stick to everything.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 minutes in the refrigerator, the dough was still too
soft to work with. After one hour, it was better but still
difficult to use. We could cut a few cookies, but within a couple
of minutes the dough warmed up and began to stick. It was too soft
to re-roll.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours in the refrigerator, the dough was able to be
re-rolled more than once. The cookies were also easy to cut and
move. Almost all of the dough was used before it became too warm to
work with.
</P>
<P>
   Chilling the dough for 24 hours made it easiest to work with. It
could be re-rolled until it was all used up. However, the baked
cookies weren't as appealing as those made with the two-hour dough.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The half butter-half shortening cookie, with the dough
refrigerated between 2 and 8 hours, makes the best holiday sugar
cookie. It is ideal for decorating.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; STORING SUGAR COOKIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We reserved half of each batch of baked cookies and stored them
for one week in a sealed plastic bag to see if there was a
difference in how each held up.
</P>
<P>
   Both the shortening- and butter-only cookies tasted stale and
were soggy. The half butter-half shortening cookie lost little
texture, but didn't taste stale at all. So not only is the
half-and-half cookie the best tasting, but it keeps the best, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OLD-FASHIONED SUGAR COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   These cookies may be sprinkled with decorating sugar before
being baked, or leave them plain, or ice the baked and cooled
cookies with a favorite frosting.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces shortening
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, baking powder and salt onto a sheet of wax
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the butter, shortening and sugar in a large mixing bowl.
Using an electric mixer, beat until well blended. Beat in the eggs
and vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture and beat just
until thoroughly blended.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the dough in half and roll out each portion between 2
sheets of wax paper to form a 151/2 x 11-inch rectangle, about 1/8
inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the dough rectangles between the sheets of wax paper,
stack them on a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, at least 2
hours, or up to 3 days; or freeze, well wrapped, up to 1 month.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust rack to lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Remove 1 dough package from the refrigerator. Peel off the top
sheet of wax paper, replace it loosely on top, and flip the entire
package over. Peel off and discard the second sheet of wax paper.
</P>
<P>
   Using a large star or other shape cookie cutter (about 41/4
inches across), cut out cookies and set them about 1/2 inch apart
on the baking sheet. (If the dough softens, return it to the
refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.)
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with second dough package. Scraps of dough may be
rerolled. Bake 1 sheet at a time for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the
cookies are pale golden around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 20 cookies.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: Gift Twist: Give Whisky Not Wine  
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Still looking for gift ideas? You're not alone.
The same old gift of wine won't do this year. What you want is
something different, especially for those few people whose names
are still on your holiday gift list.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look no further. Single malt whisky is the answer. That's right,
single malt Scotch whisky is the ideal gift-with-a-difference for
the wine lover on your list. Like wine, single malts offer variety
of style and character, with major regional differences and more
subtle nuances by the different distilleries.
</P>
<P>
   A single malt is a grain whisky from a single distillery. The
only ingredients in malt whisky are malted barley and pure water.
Blended Scotch, like Johnnie Walker, contains up to 35 single
malts, and grain spirits, usually corn. Fans of blended Scotch
should love Johnnie Walker Blue Label, $160, a special blend
faithful to the recipe John Walker used in 1820 to create his first
bottle of blended Scotch.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 100 single malt distilleries in Scotland,
located in the Highlands, Lowlands and islands. In general, Lowland
whiskies are the lightest, Highland malts the most traditional and
island whiskies the heaviest. There are, of course, regional
stylistic variations; Islay whiskies, for instance, can be heavy
and peaty like Ardbeg and Laphroaig, or more moderately peated,
like Bunnahabhain. The fun is in trying a dram of each and
comparing the single malts, the same as you would do with wine.
</P>
<P>
   Every single malt distillery has a standard line, traditionally
based on age, or the time the whisky spent in oak barrels. In
recent years, a trend among whisky distillers has been to age their
whiskies in barrels that previously held different types of wine.
Glenmorangie, a northern Highland distiller, has a range of single
malts in Sherry, Madeira, Port and the latest, Claret wood.
</P>
<P>
   The new limited First Growth Claret Wood Finish Single Malt
Scotch Whisky, $250, was first aged in American oak barrels and
then transferred to barrels previously used for aging a first
growth Bordeaux from Pauillac. There's also a Limited Edition Fino
Sherry Wood Finish, at $90. Glenmorangie's other wood-finished
single malts, my favorite is the Port Finish, are more modestly
priced at about $40.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenlivet, considered by whisky drinkers as the
quintessential Highland malt, has a set of five vintage-dated
single malts _ 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1972 _ in 200-ml. bottles,
selling for $299, or $199 for a 750-ml. bottle of each. Vintage
dating single malts is a new trend, since traditionally, malt
whisky distillers have never used a vintage date as with wine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular single malts is The Macallan, a
Highland-Speyside malt aged in Spanish oak Sherry casks. The
Macallan's 12 Year Old, $37, and 18 Year Old, $79, are the
standards. Now, The Macallan has added a special cask-select Gran
Reserva, $140 and The Macallan 1946, a collector's single malt,
priced at $2,500, distilled with more peat character than the
standard Macallan. During World War II there was a coal shortage,
requiring the kilning of the barley to use more peat to fuel the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   From the northern island of Orkney comes Highland Park, an
elegant single malt that ranks as one of the best made in Scotland.
Highland Park 12 Year Old, $32 and 18 Year Old, $70, are the
standards. Now, they've added a smoky, deeply flavored Vintage 1977
Reserve, aged 21 Years, for $100.
</P>
<P>
   Other single malt whiskies to consider for the holidays include:
the Sherry-finished Aberlour 15 Year Old, $45 and the newly
released 21 Year Old, $75; Ardbeg smoky-peaty-briny Islay Single
Malt 17 Year Old, $75. There is also a collection of different
single malts, called Defenders of the Malt, that includes
Glendronach 15 Year Old Highland-Speyside, $43, Scapa 12 Year Old
Orkney, $37 and Laphroaig 10 Year old Islay, $40. For a broader
range, look for the six-bottle Classic Malts of Scotland that
includes Talisker from Skye, Lagavulin from Islay, Glenkinchie, a
Lowland malt, Oban from the West Highlands, Dalwhinnie from the
Highlands and Gragganmore from the Highlands-Speyside. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When a wine has a distinct, flat off-odor and taste, it is
usually described as oxidized. Oxidation occurs when a wine is
exposed to the air, is in a bottle with a faulty cork, or has had a
prolonged stay in a barrel or bottle. Browning, an enzymic
oxidation, can occur simultaneously with over-oxidation, but it is
more a factor of enzymes combining oxygen with tannins.
</P>
<P>
   Certain wines, such as sherry, are oxidized wines, with excess
oxidation giving sherry its unique flavor and character. Advanced
oxidation is often called Madeirization (Marsalato in Italy,
</P>
<P>
   for the brown Marsala sweet wine) for the brown sweet wine of
the island of Madeira.

 FLAVORS OF HOME: Desert Harvest for Ramadan   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 DALY CITY, Calif. _  Young Amel Guettatfi had been sneaking looks
at the clock for a good half hour. But the last few minutes, she
didn't take her eyes off the slow-moving hands. When they finally
showed 4:57 p.m., she shouted, ``break time.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   A familiar school scenario? No. The setting was her parents'
Daly City apartment. And the break had nothing to do with classes
but rather the moment the sun went down and her family could break
its daily dawn-to-dusk fast, observed by Muslims all over the world
during the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year-old was lucky that this year, Ramadan falls in the
middle of winter (December 9 to January 7) when days are short.
Because the Arabic lunar calendar has 354 days, Ramadan, the ninth
month of the Arabic year, coincides with different months of the
Gregorian (Western) calendar.
</P>
<P>
   When Ramadan falls in the middle of summer, the hours of fasting
are longer. Actually, Amel is not obligated to fast because of her
age, but, say her parents, Abdel-Kader Guettatfi and his wife,
Houria, she is eager to do it because it's a grown-up thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends at school are fasting,'' Amel says, confirming
the opinion that there is prestige attached to no longer being an
infant who doesn't have to fast (nor do the elderly or infirm). The
school she refers to is the Granada Islamic School in Santa Clara,
where her mom, who has a Ph.D. in computer science from McGill
University, is a teacher. The two of them commute together _ at
least until Amel's baby brother or sister arrives in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, the family breaks the fast with a snack of the
foods that sustained the prophet Mohammed in the desert, according
to 1,400-year-old tradition: dates and milk (buttermilk is the
Guettatfis' choice, its tartness provides a pleasant counterpoint
to the intense sweetness of the dried fruit).
</P>
<P>
   The California dates she purchases are fine, Houria Guettatfi
says, but they are not as delicious as the Deglet Nour dates of
their homeland, Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   There are other North African foods that don't quite have their
equal in America, she says, among them herbs like parsley and mint
(``the flavors are less intense here''); phyllo sheets that are not
as paper-thin as the ones available in this country, and
larger-grained couscous which is favored for certain dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A thoroughly practical woman who has to reconcile a heavy
teaching schedule with family obligations, she has found solutions
to these problems.
</P>
<P>
   She makes do with the fine couscous found in local natural food
stores (the couple visits Berkeley Bowl when time permits), using
it even for the relatively thin couscous with raisins and butter
that is a favorite breakfast food.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than battle the super-thin phyllo (``it's so brittle that
it's hard to work with''), she finds Chinese egg roll wrappers an
acceptable substitute for dishes like bourek, the tubular,
meat-filled fried pastries served with such soups as lamb broth
lightly thickened with barley that started one of her Ramadan
dinners last week.
</P>
<P>
   An avid cook, Guettatfi bases her cooking on recipes she learned
from her mother, with minor adjustments like the use of the egg
roll wrappers. She has every intention to pass her family recipe on
to her daughter, who already loves to help in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims have few dietary restrictions, and none specific to
Ramadan, she explains. Aside from alcohol, the one food strictly
prohibited is anything derived from pigs, so a lot of staples of
the American diet are shunned. Most snack and convenience foods are
forbidden because they might contain pork or pork byproducts (even
gelatin is suspect), as are such items as flavorings that may
contain small amounts of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Not having access to mixes and other convenience items,
Guettatfi has invented a number of shortcuts that enable her to get
dinner on the table within a brief time of returning from work.
</P>
<P>
   To shorten the long cooking time required by garbanzo beans _ a
staple of the Algerian diet _ she soaks a big batch overnight,
drains them in the morning and then freezes them. The combination
of soaking and freezing, she explains, softens the legumes
sufficiently so they take no longer to cook than the meats they
frequently accompany (as in the  &LR; mderbel &LR;  recipe below).
</P>
<P>
   And when she has the time, she makes a big batch of  &LR; bourek &LR;  and
freezes them before frying _ her home-grown version of fast food.
</P>

BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOUREK
</P>
<P>
   Houria Guettatfi uses Chinese egg roll wrappers in place of the
heavier Algerian phyllo she can't get here. She often makes these
in quantity and freezes them for a quick-fix addition to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   20 Chinese egg roll wrappers
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet. Add the chopped onion
and ground beef, breaking the mixture up with a wooden spoon, and
saute until the meat is no longer pink. Add parsley and salt and
pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and cool. When
completely cooled, add the egg.
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the mixture on 1 egg roll wrapper
and roll up, forming a cigar shape. Moisten the edges to adhere or,
if you want to be sure of a tight seal, mix a beaten egg with 1
teaspoon water and brush this solution on the edges. Repeat with
the remaining wrappers and meat.
</P>
<P>
   If these will not be served right away, wrap them tightly in
plastic wrap and overwrap with aluminum foil or more plastic wrap
for extra protection, and freeze. When ready to cook, remove as
many boureks from the freezer as needed. Leave on a plate for a
short time to start defrosting.
</P>
<P>
   To cook, pour vegetable oil to a depth of about 1 to 2 inches
into a heavy skillet, and heat over high heat. When the oil is
shimmering, add the boureks without crowding, reduce the heat to
medium and cook, turning frequently, until crisp and golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   Serve boureks alongside soup or as an appetizer with lemon
wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 5-6.

</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Big pinch of cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   1 russet potato, peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Additional parsley for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prepare the lamb: &LR;  Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and add the
lamb, turning occasionally, and cook until lightly browned. Add
onion and continue sauteing and turning until onion is translucent.
Add garlic and cook a couple more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add a generous amount of salt and pepper, the saffron and the
garbanzo beans. Stir to mix, then add enough boiling water to
cover. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet and simmer about
11/2 hours, until the lamb and beans are very tender, checking and
adding more boiling water if the mixture is not covered.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prepare the vegetables:  &LR; Steam the cauliflower florets until
they are firm-tender, and set aside; do not overcook. This can be
done several hours ahead of finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the egg, milk, chopped parsley, green onion, cinnamon, salt
and pepper in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 to 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy pan until
shimmering. One by one, dip the florets in the egg mixture and then
add to the skillet without crowding (do in 2 batches if needed).
Fry, turning frequently, until crispy brown. Drain in a colander
and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Add the potato slices to the skillet, adding more oil if needed,
and fry, turning once, until crisp-brown. Drain on paper towels and
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble:  &LR; Place fried cauliflower on a warm, rimmed serving
dish. Place the lamb and garbanzos on top, spooning on the sauce.
Top with the potato slices and additional chopped parsley, if
desired. Accompany with quartered lemon to squeeze on top. Serve
with French bread for sopping up extra juices.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   To shorten the garbanzos' cooking time, soak them overnight in
cold water to cover, then drain and freeze in meal-sized batches.
You can also use canned garbanzo beans: Drain them well and add
during the final half hour of cooking.

EDITORS NOTE: This column profiles Northern California growers,
anglers and artisans who make the region such a culinary
wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field to
forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients stocking our
larders.  AT THE SOURCE: Fill Your Belly Full of Greens  
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Fir branches, holly and ivy are not the only
greens that delight us this time of year. The sturdy greens of the
winter garden are wonderful in the kitchen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They look great (put them in a bowl on the table for a couple of
hours before using them), they are chockful of vitamins and
minerals, and they are eminently suited to the sturdy food _ soups,
stews, braised dishes _ we crave when evenings turn gloomy and
cold.
</P>
<P>
   These greens, especially the various kales, are stars in
farmers' market bins this time of year. And they are one of the
crops harvested now through at least February at a unique farming
venture in Yolo County. Full Belly Farms has all manner of kale,
including red Russian (no political reference); tender, long-leafed
Dino; and Karinate, a deep green vegetable with especially sweet
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all kales have a certain sweetness, says Melinda
Baker, the farm's office manager. Full Belly was started in 1984 by
Dru Rivers and Paul Muller, who were later joined by Judith Redmond
and Andrea Brait. The four co-owners' commitment to organic farming
took root on 170 acres in the tiny community of Guinda (near
Woodland). Today, it has a pretty impressive client list: Chez
Panisse and Oliveto restaurants; Monterey Market in Berkeley; Whole
Foods and Real Foods markets, as well as the Thursday Civic Center
Market in San Francisco, the Tuesday Berkeley Farmers' Market and
the Palo Alto Farmers' Market on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, working through the Community Supported Agriculture
organization, Full Belly delivers boxes of produce to individual
customers in the East Bay, Davis, Woodland and Sacramento. (Don't
rush to the phone. The farm can't handle more than the roughly 550
boxes packed each week and has a substantial waiting list.)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from kales, Full Belly's winter greenery includes salad
and braising mixes, spinach, broccoli and cabbage. Kale, a member
of the cabbage family, has been cultivated since ancient times. It
thrives in cold climates as well as moderate ones, a fact which, at
least in part, accounts for its great popularity in central and
northern Europe. A mixture of coarsely mashed potatoes and kale is
a specialty in Germany's Rhine area, often served as a side dish to
pork, and at one of Ireland's most luxurious hotels, Dromoland
Castlecq &LR; , pheasants are served on a bed of kale cooked with bacon
and onions.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caution about kale: It is best cooked within a few
days of being harvested. Not only do the leaves (which are the only
edible part _ the stems are too tough) wilt rather quickly, but the
vegetable loses some of its wealth of vitamins A and C by the hour.

A CITY OF ICE TO WARM WINTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, I wondered if I had sipped hot sake for breakfast
instead of coffee. For there, stretched out in front of me, were
multistory buildings and towering monuments and huge concert stages
and long slides, all glistening white and made entirely of snow.
</P>
<P>
   These were to ice carvings what Mount Rushmore is to sculpture,
and they were invested with a whimsy not always associated with
Japan. Bugs Bunny soared 33 feet tall, a cup of instant noodles
towered 23 feet high, a Hungarian palace stood 66 feet high, and
49-foot Pokemon characters emerged as Brobdingnagian figures
looming over crowds of children zipping down ice slides.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen ice sculptures elsewhere in Japan and had enjoyed the
Harbin Snow Festival in northeast China, but my visit to the
Sapporo Snow Festival last winter topped them all. Perhaps the most
famous snow festival in the world, it is the highlight of the year
for Sapporo, the major city on the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of a million people _ including many foreigners
_ journey to Sapporo during the one-week period when the sculptures
are on display, and space in trains, planes and hotels is
desperately tight. At the end of the week, the organizers demolish
all the sculptures because, they say, it would be too sad to see
their works of art slowly melt and become disfigured.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be the 50th-anniversary of Sapporo snow festival,
founded on Feb. 18, 1950, when a group of high school students made
six snow sculptures in Odori Park in the center of town. It took
off from there, but the secret of the festival's success is that
Japan's military _ which calls itself the Self-Defense Forces _
does most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The Self-Defense Forces are concentrated in Hokkaido because
historically, there was concern about an invasion from the
neighboring Soviet Union. But World War II has made Japan deeply
suspicious of its military, and so the Self-Defense Forces go out
of their way to take on challenges that improve their public image.
</P>
<P>
   A result is the modern Sapporo Snow Festival. It would be
impossibly costly for the private sector to organize, and it would
be regarded as a waste of money by any civilian government
department. But the Self-Defense Forces have no invasions to defend
against, so each year some 1,700 soldiers take a couple of months
off and use 250 army trucks to make about 7,600 round trips to lug
snow from the mountains to make the gigantic sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   After having heard for many years about the festival, I went
with my wife, Sheryl, and our three children from Tokyo, where we
were living. There are day tours from Tokyo, leaving at dawn and
returning late at night, but we decided that would give us only a
taste. There are also group tours, but in the end we found that it
was a bit cheaper to book flights and hotels separately.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relatively expensive time to visit Hokkaido, though,
because prices are all jacked up for the festival: round-trip air
fare from Tokyo costs about $435, at 102 yen to the dollar, and a
Western-style hotel room runs another $250 a night. We flew up to
Sapporo on a Friday night and returned to Tokyo on a Sunday night,
and even that was a bit rushed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Japan's lovely sites do not impress small children, I
have discovered, but the snow festival is designed as a family
event. And my children, then 1, 4 and 6, gave it 9{ points out of
10 (a half-point being deducted for long lines at slides).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, our kids _ having had little experience with snow _
may have been unusually easy to please. Our plane had no sooner
touched down at the airport near Sapporo then they were delirious
with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow!'' shouted Geoffrey, the 4-year-old, and they all began
to assess the height of drifts beside the runway with the same
accuracy that a fisherman uses to measure the ones that get away.
When we were in the terminal, asking about train tickets to
Sapporo, Geoffrey and his 6-year-old brother, Gregory, suddenly
disappeared _ they had gone outside to have a snowball fight.
</P>
<P>
   We spent our first night in a Japanese-style hotel where one
room somehow accommodated all of us. The children liked sleeping on
futons on the tatami-mat floor, but mostly they enjoyed the vacant
snow-covered lot next door. Friends with two children had made the
trip with us from Tokyo and the children all played in the snow
until about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to most Japanese cities, Sapporo is young, with a
bit of the same feel as the American West. Indeed, there are
several parallels, for Hokkaido was Japan's frontier, and until
1869 it was inhabited only by small numbers of an indigenous people
known as Ainu.
</P>
<P>
   They speak their own language, which is very different from
Japanese, and look more like Westerners than like Asians. (Indeed,
a couple of times in Japan I've jokingly tried to pass myself off
as an Ainu, although not terribly successfully.)
</P>
<P>
   The Ainu, never numerous, are now found only in a few villages,
and their language has largely died out. Waves of Japanese migrants
took their land and built cities like Sapporo beginning in the late
19th century. As a result, there are no ancient temples, and
streets are relatively wide, without the mazelike quality of Tokyo
and most other Japanese cities.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Sapporo are also unusually relaxed and friendly,
even boisterous by Japanese standards (although to be boisterous by
Japanese standards is to be sedate by American calibration).
</P>
<P>
   The winter Olympics were held in Sapporo in 1972, and Hokkaido
is still the winter playground for Japan. Several other snow
festivals are held annually elsewhere in Hokkaido, although not on
the same scale as Sapporo's.
</P>
<P>
   Hokkaido also has many outdoor hot springs, and one can soak
naked in an outside hot spring in the snowy woods, admiring the
surrounding ice and cold from the comfort of a steaming spring _
and sip hot sake from a little cup resting on a wooden tray
floating in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Our first expedition the morning after we arrived was to
Susukino, one of the three sites of the festival. I did not bother
mentioning it to Sheryl, but I had some apprehensions about what we
might encounter, as the only thing I knew about Susukino was that
it is Sapporo's famous red light district.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from a Japanese-language sign advertising a Soaplands
massage parlor, there was nothing in the snow sculpture area to
suggest that it was a sex district.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures in Susukino were small, mostly less than 10 feet
tall, and included Chinese junks, Viking warriors and slides for
children. Just a bit farther, though, at the Odori site in downtown
Sapporo, were a series of spectacular sculptures _ although
sculpture is too modest a word, for these were buildings and
castles made of snow.

 &HT;    Terry tries to defy rookie curse
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After three months, Lenny Wilkens figures he has a
pretty good handle on his protege, Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the mental capacity, the size, the skills to be a
terrific player in this league, and he will be. Believe me,''
Wilkens said. ``But, you know, this is such a difficult position
for rookies in the NBA. There's so much going on out there, and
sometimes, well, sometimes, Jason goes a little brain dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be alarmed, said the man who made the Basketball Hall of
Fame for his skill at the point guard position Terry occupies and
for his acumen and longevity as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Stephon Marbury his rookie year. There was a time
when he couldn't do anything right. Terrell (Brandon), the same.
Mark Price, the same. Hey, I went through it in St. Louis, but I
was lucky. Bob Pettit and my coach, Paul Seymour, helped me get
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens says, ``I'll get Jason through this. He'll be so much
better next year, you won't believe it, because he's such a smart
player. He remembers everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal of his first NBA season, Terry remains an
engaging young man, full of fun, optimistic, steadfastly refusing
to be weighed down today by the mistakes of yesterday. ``I'm the
type player (who says), 'Last night is over. I'll take it to them
the next time,' `` he said. ``I'm not going to dwell on past
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After general manager Pete Babcock dealt Mookie Blaylock to
Golden State for the No. 10 pick and Bimbo Coles, it was a foregone
conclusion that he would select a point guard. The draft offered an
unusually large crop of good ones: Steve Francis to Vancouver, and
then on to Houston, at No. 2; Baron Davis to Charlotte at No. 3;
Andre Miller to Cleveland at No. 8; Terry to the Hawks; and William
Avery to Minnesota, No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   All have struggled. And while Francis is flamboyant and Davis
has been both electrifying and steady, the Hawks say they have no
regrets about Terry. ``We would have been satisfied with any of the
others,'' Babcock said. ``And we have a lot of confidence in Jason,
just as Jason has a lot of confidence in himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry, All-American and Pac-10 player of the year as a senior,
is averaging 9.1 points in 22 minutes a game, but his assist
average is a low 2.8 and the 3-to-2 ratio of assists to turnovers
would be unacceptable for a veteran and is only tolerable in a
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   But he still is young, an ebullient kid with a quick smile that
entirely splits narrow features.
</P>
<P>
   His world is a maze of timing and selecting plays. He is trying
to deal with the emotions, desires and varying range of skills of
those around him.
</P>
<P>
   Three months past his 22nd birthday, the father of a 2-year-old
daughter, Jasionna, he also remains committed to his Play Station,
often playing several hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Terry clings to his superstition of wearing at least four pairs
of socks when he plays, one pair hiked to his knees. ``Sometimes I
wear five,'' he says. ``It depends on how my feet are.'' He also
eats the same pregame meal, a chicken sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, for all concerned, he no longer insists on sleeping in
his uniform the night before games. Thatapparently was over when
his four-year tour ended at Arizona. Given the frequency of road
trips and the packed calendar of the NBA, it might have been his
easiest adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Terry acknowledges that he can be his own worst enemy. ``I
thought I would be feeling comfortable right now,'' he says. ``But
after three, four minutes in the game, I find I'm not comfortable.
It's my mentality that changes. Not the other team's. I guess
that's the confidence factor. I've got to get more confident with
everything I can be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry says the active point guard he most admires is the one he
watched as a high school star in his own town of Seattle, Gary
Payton. ``I model my game after him. He's a great leader, very
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Marbury of the Nets and the Bucks' Sam Cassell,
because ``they have no conscience,'' Terry says. ``When they've got
it going, they don't worry about, 'Should I pass or what?' They
keep doing what makes their teams successful.''
</P>
<P>
   When Terry came to grief Saturday night against Utah's John
Stockton, he said he was defeated by his reticence to attack rather
than Stockton's defensive wizardry. ``He played off me, but I felt
it was time for me to pass the ball, and he stole it twice,'' he
said. ``But with him playing off me, it was there for me to take
him, and I didn't do it, not because he's the great John Stockton,
but because I didn't use my natural skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens seizes on that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Jason understands, but the problem is getting him to be
that assertive, to feed on success,'' Wilkens said. ``I tell him,
'Look, it's there for you to go to the basket, so take them. Don't
be shy. Don't worry about your teammates. If they have a problem,
let me be the bad guy, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Terry is learning to become an NBA point guard
and he realizes that he's in a great situation with Wilkens and the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's a great town, I have wonderful teammates, the best
possible coach for me,'' he said. ``Give me a little time. They
drafted me to be their point guard. It's gonna happen.''

 UNDATED: of snow.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several had slides for children and many had huge snow stages on
which bands and dancers were performing to large crowds, with sound
systems and colored lights.
</P>
<P>
   My children loved a set of igloos, which they explored
thoroughly, but my own favorite was a steep ski jump. Some adept
skiers raced down the slope, soared in the air and did a flip
before landing right in front of the crowd, almost at our feet. It
was much more dramatic than most ski jump events because it took
place in a street in the center of a city.
</P>
<P>
   For a midafternoon lunch, we visited Sapporo's Ramen Alley, a
tiny strip of ramen noodle restaurants off a back alley only about
a yard wide. The restaurants were in the same proportions _ a few
small tables, each bumping against the other _ but the hot noodles
were excellent and warming, and only about $5 a person.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, we visited the largest site, at a military base
near the Jieitaimae subway station, a 20-minute ride from the
center of Sapporo. This is where Bugs Bunny and the cup-of-noodles
presided, along with Hungary's Buda Castle and the Pokemon
character Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   This area was bigger than a football field, with fast-food
stands in the middle and ice architecture at the ends. At night,
colored floodlights lighted up the area, and a fireworks display
soared over Buda Castle to the aahs of a crowd of many thousands.
Our 1-year-old, Caroline, toddled around the snow, dazzled by the
sight and waving to friendly Japanese who cooed over her.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to Sapporo for a late dinner at Hyakko, an excellent
Japanese restaurant. Crab and other seafood is plentiful in
Sapporo, so we had hairy crab and assorted sashimi and a wonderful
salmon stew _ all washed down with hot sake.
</P>
<P>
   The previous evening, we were disappointed that the ice slides
at the military base were closed. The site is really for children
so we went again in the morning for another go.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a huge maze of ice, and an artificial ice
mountain that kids could slide down on inner tubes (all provided,
with plenty of volunteers to ensure safety). The whole affair was
impeccably organized; the only problem was that the sculptures were
so fabulous that they attracted throngs.
</P>
<P>
   There was usually a wait of an hour or more for the good slides.
The way to avoid the crowds is to go when Japanese children are in
school: either a weekday morning or afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, adults are allowed to use the slides, too. That
would be immature, I suppose, and it would be best to do it in the
guise of accompanying a child or conducting research. But on the
basis of my research: the slides are fast and fun and wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Warm places to come in from the cold
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Festival for 2000 will run from Feb. 7 to 13. Hotels
and flights normally fill up during the festival, so try to book as
early as possible. Information about the festival is available at
www.aurora-net.or.jp/event/snowfes/indexe.html.
</P>
<P>
   For a non-Japanese speaker, it may be easier (and possibly
cheaper) to book a package through a travel agent. To find an
agent, contact the Japan National Tourist Organization, 1
Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1250, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212)
757-5640, fax (212) 307-6754.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are normally clean and reasonably comfortable, but their
rooms are often tiny by American standards. Small Japanese hotels
are usually a better deal, and in any case, make sure that your
hotel is reasonably central and near a subway line.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed one night at the luxury Sapporo Park Hotel, (81-11)
511-3131, fax (81-11) 531-8522, and it was pleasant, helpful and
just a five-minute subway ride from the festival sites. We paid
about $305 for a room, which turned out to be too small for the
whole family. So we booked a second at the same price.
</P>
<P>
   Our children actually preferred the Japanese-style Hotel
Sanpachi, (81-11) 241-8820, fax (81-11) 271-1375. The rate was $65
a night for each adult and a bit less for children _ $225 total.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel did not have an English-speaking staff, but it seemed
accustomed to dealing with foreigners and was just a 10-minute walk
from the festival areas. We had a single large room with tatami mat
floor and futons spread out to sleep on, so it was more of an
adventure for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   The food is excellent in Sapporo. Try to avoid regular
mealtimes, as all restaurants are jammed during the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone where Ramen Alley is (near the Susukino site) for its
many noodle shops, or for something more upscale, try Hyakko, where
you can eat a six-course Japanese meal without sake for $50 a
person. It is open daily 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.; (81-11) 521-1409.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese often recommend the Sapporo Beer Garden, (81-11)
742-1409, a huge restaurant owned by the brewery that makes Sapporo
beer. The restaurant is child friendly and has Mongolian barbecue,
starting at $13, but there is nothing at all Japanese about the
food or atmosphere, and it is probably more appealing to local
people than to foreigners. Open daily 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.

`ADVENTURES IN TIME': TAKE HUNDREDS OF EPOCHS AND DIGEST IN TWO
HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and channel are
for New York area; see local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So if you're in need of another millennium-season fix, here's a
two-hour special from good old reliable National Geographic.
``Adventures in Time,'' made up mainly of material that fans have
seen before, offers little by way of fresh ideas or incisive
thought, but it is a picturesque grab bag. The notion of packaging
billions of years of happenings in two hours is a television
conceit, so don't take too seriously the pretense that the program
has much to do with time, except the timeouts for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing family may enjoy these quick looks at some favorites
like the 80-million-year-old fossil of an Oviraptor, ``that
fearsome carnivore of the Gobi.'' So much for dinosaurs, and it's
briskly on to the water chevrotain, an ancient flower eater related
to antelopes and pigs that can resist the horned lizard, which in
turn owes its survival to its ability to squirt a nasty stream of
blood into the face of a predatory coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, the program has reached primates, those new
arrivals, in the form of the famous skull discovered by Louis and
Mary Leakey of a young male creature who lived in Africa about 2
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator makes a strained segue from primitive life to an
obsession with death as evidenced by the ancient sarcophagus
discovered not long ago near the pyramids of Giza. If you conclude
that the subjects are driven by the available pictures, you are
onto something.
</P>
<P>
   The camera speeds from New Guinea to the Indian subcontinent to
central Borneo, ostensibly for glimpses of the ways different
peoples see or ignore the passage of time. Although it's a random
collection, the material has its fascination. As much cannot be
said for the familiar references to 20th-century explorers,
including Robert Peary and Matthew Henson, Richard Byrd, William
Beebe and Otis Barton. And then for no particular reason except the
photographs there's an interlude devoted to the perennially popular
pastime of climbing Mount Everest: ``You don't conquer it, you
survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for Earth. Suddenly we are transported to outer space, a
slightly discouraging journey considering the recent failure of the
latest Mars probe.
</P>
<P>
   But the narrator holds out the hope of establishing an outpost
on Mars by 2050, by which time, some expert assures us, gene
research should be producing humans without cavities or colds or
inherited disease who will live almost forever. That is, of course,
if the millennium does not live up to the expectations or wishes of
people who are planning on an end to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But National Geographic is no more a proponent of miraculous
expiration than of creationism. The fears with which the program
leaves us are of ``a doomsday asteroid'' that could strike almost
anytime or global warming or depletion of ocean life or pollution
or overpopulation; you name it. Happy millennium.

   ``In the last couple of weeks, we've seen an increase in the
number of viruses released,'' said Carey Nachenberg, chief
researcher for Symantec's Norton AntiVirus program in Santa Monica.
``We do expect that people will release some new viruses for the
new year.''
</P>
<P>
   One New Year's virus already has been discovered. Mypics will
deliver its destructive package Jan. 1, disguising itself as a Y2K
computer problem, but then erasing data on the hard drive,
Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, software engineers saw a variant of the
Worm.Explore.Zip, which masquerades as an e-mail from a friend and
mails itself to those listed in the Microsoft Explorer address
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received 40 calls on it last week,'' said Scott Gaidano,
president of Drive Savers, a Novato company specializing in
retrieving lost data.
</P>
<P>
   And virus researchers are scrambling to find others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work going on in research and development at
all of the major anti-virus companies,'' said Patrick Hinojosa,
president of U.S. operations for Panda Software, a Madrid, Spain,
software company.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are computer programs that are usually spread by e-mail
attachments. When the attachments are opened, the viruses set up
programs that hide deep within a computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   There are 200 to 300 known viruses that are now in circulation,
and virus researchers find 10 to 20 new ones a week, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, viruses are being written to spread by going into the
computer's Internet browser and using the address book to send
itself out. The virus can thus look like it is coming from a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the viruses are simply mischievous, such as the Music
Bug, which slows down the computer while it plays a short tune.
</P>
<P>
   Others can be destructive, corrupting data in spreadsheets and
files or causing all data on a hard drive to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to combat viruses is for computer users to have
good anti-virus software and update it frequently by loading new
software from the software-maker's Internet site. Most makers
update their software weekly, although Panda is now updating its
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Virus software looks for viruses by ``definition,'' scanning
hard drives for program language that matches known virus program
language, and also looks for program ``behavior'' that matches
virus behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Software officials also warn computer users to not open any
e-mail attachments that don't come from friends, and even then not
to open it unless it was expected.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several high-profile viruses during the past
year, in which there have been a record number of virus attacks
reported to the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon
University, , the U.S. clearinghouse for virus information.
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl virus attacked on May 26, marking the 13th
anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, writing
over a portion of the operating system on a computer hard drive,
stopping the computer from booting up and often causing a loss of
all data on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   That outbreak was scattered throughout the United States, Europe
and Asia and wasn't as bad as it could have been only because
computer users had already suffered from attacks from three other
malevolent viruses _ Melissa, Papa and Happy 99 _ earlier in the
year and were prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus attacked computers by sending itself out on
all the e-mail addresses in a user's Web browser, which had the
effect of overwhelming the e-mail programs on computer networks,
causing the servers to crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Worm.Explore.Zip virus, which used the same principle to
travel around the world within three days, also attacked and
disabled Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents.
</P>
<P>
   Through September, CERT had received 6,844 reports of virus
attacks, compared to 3,734 in 1998, 2,134 in '97, 2,573 in '96,
2,412 in '95, 2,340 in '94 and 1,334 in '93.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa of Panda Software, which has its research headquarters
in Bilbao, Spain, also fears that beginning Jan. 1, computer owners
and network system administrators faced with computer problems
might look for Y2K problems and overlook a virus infection.
</P>
<P>
   CERT spokesman Bill Pollock said it is only speculation that
there will be new and more viruses for the New Year. But
regardless, CERT researchers will be watching, many will be on duty
and others will be on-call.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are viruses that are timed to deliver their payload on
any day of the year, and Jan. 1 is no different,'' Pollock said.
``We don't want to give the impression that people need to gear up
for Jan. 1 and then not be ready for Jan. 2 or 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson, an FBI spokesman in San Francisco, said the
bureau is not issuing warnings, but computer specialists are
prepared and will be working.
</P>
<P>
   Gaidano said Drive Savers has a staff of 30, which will be
working or on-call on New Year's Day.

STALKED BY PHONE, SHE WINS RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, Dec. 28)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end it was like getting rid of an old lover, someone
she'd broken off with years ago but who couldn't believe it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent one, in this case, was the phone company trying
to woo back Kit (for Kathleen) Carson.
</P>
<P>
   You know these dinner-time calls.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of them come from phone companies. How could you leave?
Please come back. Just listen to what I will give you if you come
back.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after doing business with AT&AMP;T for 20 years, Kit
switched to another phone company and then later exchanged it for a
third.
</P>
<P>
   The calls began shortly after and lasted for three years. They'd
come at night, usually around 7 p.m. Kit has severe asthma and goes
to bed early, especially in the winter. By 7 p.m. she's pooped, but
she doesn't turn off her phone because she has a daughter who lives
in Australia and Kit wants to be available if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Kit started out, like most gentle people, not wanting to be
rude. Then, after the phone company refused to quietly go away, she
stopped being nice. But it didn't matter. The calls continued.
</P>
<P>
   We all know about switching phone companies. We do this for
various reasons. We are seduced by free air mileage, special
international calling rates, $100 checks to switch companies. We
are fickle, and maybe if you are a phone company that has been
dumped you think that we will dump the next one, too, and
eventually come back. That is one way of thinking, I suppose, but
when has badgering ever rekindled the flame?
</P>
<P>
   Kit is not easily flapped. She's worked in public relations,
television production, as a junior college instructor. She has a
sense of humor, and fortunately for her stress level, a fair amount
of patience with the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first when they called me and asked why I dropped them I
answered all their questions. They'd send mailings and I'd read
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   No thanks, she said, but they kept up anyhow. Over those three
years she estimates she got more than 50 nighttime phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Each time she would say, ``Please don't call me again'' and
later, ``Don't ever call me again.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't get it. Perhaps they thought she was being coy.
Perhaps they thought when she said no she meant yes.
</P>
<P>
   Often on the following mornings she called AT&AMP;T and would ``work
my way up the hierarchy to talk to a supervisor,'' who would assure
Kit the matter was settled. Then the calls would resume.
</P>
<P>
   She told them she was disabled. She told them she had a
breathing problem and that their calling made it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't shake these people,'' says Kit. ``I was getting
hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard a radio program mention the Telemarketer Consumer
Protection Act. Something could be done, but how to go about it?
She called the California attorney general's office and was advised
to tell AT&AMP;T to put her name on the ``do not call'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Kit calls those ``the magic words.'' Those were the ones that
broke the code when other pleadings failed. Previously she had said
to phone company supervisors, ``What do I have to do to get you not
to call me ever again?'' She even offered suggestions: Perhaps they
could put an asterisk after her name, draw a line through her name.
She said no one at AT&AMP;T ever mentioned the existence of a ``do not
call'' list.
</P>
<P>
   But when she asked to go on it and for AT&AMP;T to please send her a
confirmation letter to that effect, things started happening. The
rule is that if companies continue to solicit people who are on a
``do not call'' list, they can be fined.
</P>
<P>
   Kit was notified that she made the list in March. The calls
continued, not as often but enough to make her finally go to Small
Claims Court and charge the phone company with harassment. In
September she won her case and received a $2,000 check for her
troubles. But she says, ``The money outcome was never the purpose.
The purpose was to make them stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding not unlike the dazed survivor in an alien movie, she
sighs and says, ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she backs up and recalls a laughable moment. After Kit sued
AT&AMP;T she got a letter from company headquarters saying they'd like
to discuss the matter but would she please call them because they
didn't have her phone number. It's unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   There are efforts to make things a little easier than what Kit
went through. In California a ``Do Not Call'' bill has been
introduced in the Legislature that would allow consumers to
register with the attorney general's office to be removed from all
phone solicitation lists. There's also a petition for a ballot
measure being circulated that would control telemarketing.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech's Campbell gets OK to play in Gator Bowl
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia Tech wide receiver Kelly Campbell, arrested last week on
a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge, was cleared Tuesday to
play in the Gator Bowl after a drug test proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad to say the drug test came back negative,'' Campbell
said Tuesday at a news conference. ``I have proclaimed my innocence
from the beginning, and I maintain my same innocence now.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell would not take questions because the charges are still
pending. A court date has been set for March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech sophomore was a passenger in a car stopped Dec. 17 by
Cobb County, Ga. police. A cigar stuffed with marijuana was found,
and police alleged that Campbell was observed stuffing the cigar
between his seat and the car's console. Police also found a bag of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell denied knowledge of the marijuana and told coach George
O'Leary that the driver informed police the marijuana was his. As
per team rules, O'Leary ordered the drug test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have an accusation leveled against a player . . .
in the program, we have a procedure,'' O'Leary said. ``I'm very
happy with the findings of the procedure we went through. Kelly
Campbell is a member of the football team, and will remain a member
of the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might add that Kelly has steadfastly maintained his
innocence in this incident from the beginning. Any further action
by me will be dependent on the resolution of his court hearing on
the legal charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was accompanied by his mother, Belinda Campbell, but
she did not want to comment. Tech players were not available to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said that, because the incident happened at 4:30 p.m.
and did not involve a curfew violation, he has not imposed any
restrictions on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Tech will practice today before breaking for Christmas. The team
will convene in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 26 to prepare for their
New Year's Day game against Miami.

&HT;     TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For decades, political experts have lobbied for
televised campaign debates as the best way to inform voters of the
comparative personalities and policies of our presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   These verbal matches have been promoted as so important that the
candidates routinely spend weeks carefully negotiating the
positioning of the podiums, the nuances of lighting, the design of
the setting. Typically, the fellow who is leading stalls around and
tries to keep the number of debates to a minimum while the
challenger demands more and tries to get as much exposure as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, when Sen. John F. Kennedy bested Vice President
Richard M. Nixon in the first televised presidential debates, the
common wisdom has held that such face-offs are central to the
enlightenment of the electorate. But the drama has faded.
</P>
<P>
   Both verbal fluffs and soaring rhetoric have become increasingly
rare, as politicians have mastered manipulation of the dialogue,
rehearsed their words carefully and hid behind their standard stump
speech as often as possible. Over the years, campaign debates have
deteriorated into dull, self-serving recitals of political mush.
</P>
<P>
   A truly memorable moment such as 1988 Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen's famous putdown of his GOP
rival, Dan Quayle, is the exception rather than the rule. (After
Quayle compared himself with Kennedy, Bentsen intoned: ``Jack
Kennedy was a friend of mine. You are no Jack Kennedy.''
Unfortunately, the top of the Democratic ticket was Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, a disastrous candidate whom Bentsen could not
save with quips or anything else.)
</P>
<P>
   If the candidates are reasonably well matched, voters often
learn little from the debates.
</P>
<P>
   So when Vice President Al Gore carried the concept to absurd
extremes on Sunday by proposing two debates every single week in
exchange for abandoning all primary television advertising, he was
immediately trashed from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, by contrast, was
praised for bluntly declining Gore's offer of a handshake on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   So what is going on here? Have the pundits finally acknowledged
the dirty little secret that debates are boring, boring, boring and
that we are sick of them, no matter how good they are supposed to
be for us?
</P>
<P>
   But why would anyone prefer the repetitious, dumbed-down
30-second advertisements that Gore would cashier, which are already
driving New Hampshire voters nuts? How much can folks learn from a
brief sound bite anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that neither man was particularly
public-spirited here. Both were acting in their own self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has raised more money than Bradley but in a general
election would be at a distinct financial disadvantage against
George Bush. The Texas governor has raised more than $60 million,
and his campaign treasury will presumably be greater than that of
either Democrat. Gore would prefer not to spend lavishly on his
tight contest with Bradley but instead wants to husband his funds
for what he hopes will later be a race against Bush. Debates would
amount to free air time, whereas commercials are costly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, is less known than Gore and feels he
can most effectively spread his message through paid TV ads. First
things first with Bradley. His immediate problem is to catch up to
Gore in the primaries. While the two are about even in New
Hampshire, Gore is now beating Bradley in Iowa, which holds the
first primaries, by a score of 48 percent to 27 percent in a new
CNN-USA Today poll. Underdogs don't have the luxury of worrying in
advance about general election spending.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore was denounced for pulling a stunt, Bradley
didn't come out of the exchange looking very good either. He had
just pulled his own stunt urging campaign finance reform in tandem
with Republican contender John McCain. His refusal to abandon
expensive TV ads seemed to undermine the sincerity of that
particular publicity pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain pledged, should they win their party's
nomination, to give up the so-called soft money that comes in
unlimited amounts and is essential to pay for such ads. Bradley
conditioned his pledge on a reciprocal act by the Republican
nominee, which means he need not fear financial consequences if the
GOP picks Bush, who has every intention of spending every penny he
has raised.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made campaign finance reform the centerpiece of his
campaign, but it has never been a big issue with Bradley, who has a
record of raising huge contributions with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats have already debated three times and the five
Republican candidates three times as well. There will be more such
confrontations on both sides. But it's just as well that Gore's
proposal didn't fly. It would create an excess of dubious riches.

NASDAQ REGISTERS BIGGEST ONE-DAY POINT GAIN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two broad stock market gauges leaped to records
Tuesday, with the bulk of the gains coming after the Federal
Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged and kept its
neutral stance toward future increases.
</P>
<P>
   The gains were particularly pronounced in the technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index, which registered its biggest one-day point
gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which was up early in the session, jumped an
additional 30 points after the Fed announced that it was not
raising interest rates and that it was remaining neutral about a
further increase.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Internet companies like CMGI and Yahoo, the Nasdaq
continued to climb, broke through the 3,900 barrier for the first
time and closed at 3,911.15, a gain of 127.28, or 3.4 percent. With
Tuesday's gains, the Nasdaq is now up 78.4 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a clue why this is happening, and everyone is
amazed by it,'' said Steven C. Witt, a managing director at
Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif., which has about $2.3 billion
invested in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there will be a correction at some point, but interest
in technology has spread to a much, much broader audience than
previously. What is going on is more than momentum investors piling
into stocks that have worked in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock research firm, echoed
those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a mania, because it is so broad and so deep,'' he
said. ``This is more than that, even though I don't know how to
classify it.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Birinyi forecast that the Nasdaq would peak at
2,800 in 1999, a prediction that most on Wall Street viewed as
wildly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision to stand pat also helped to fuel gains in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average
and the Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The S.&AMP; P. 500 climbed 15.34 points, or 1.1 percent, to a record
1,433.43, led by Microsoft and General Electric, the two largest
companies by market value.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which was lower early in the day, rallied after the Fed
announcement and closed at 11,200.54, up 56.27 points, or 0.5
percent. And the Russell 2000 index had a solid day, gaining 8.60
points, or 1.8 percent, to 475.79.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, the Internet holding company, and Qualcomm were two of the
Nasdaq's biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI catapulted 47 13/16, to 270, after Henry Blodget, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch, initiated coverage with an ``accumulate''
rating.
</P>
<P>
   And Qualcomm, a phone and semiconductor maker, gained 20 1/16,
to 496~. The stock was lifted by optimism that Motorola or Nokia
would buy its wireless phone unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are making a bet that analysts are going to be raising
fourth-quarter earnings estimates early next year,'' said Michael
Molnar, a managing director in sales and trading at Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rising interest rates will be the catalyst of a correction,
and that will become more and more of an issue in the second
quarter. But the prospects for the first quarter are great.''

   ROCK-ERA-SONGS (Undated) _ Here's a little post-holiday exercise
for your amusement: grab pen and paper and jot down your 10
favorite songs dating from 1955 to now. Ponder carefully, or don't,
depending on whether you think music should be judged by the brain
or the gut. Call five friends and read them your list. Set up a
date to argue about it, to spin CDs and scream and shout. When
you've done that, you will have helped shape the canon of rock 'n'

   HURRICANE-FILM (Hollywood) _ Norman Jewison is not Hollywood
hip. At the age of 73, the director of such films as
``Moonstruck,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``A Soldier's Story,'' and
``In the Heat of the Night,'' (which won an Academy Award in 1968
as best picture) is hardly on the current A-list of trendy
directors pursued by studio executives and producers. In fact,
executives at Universal Pictures, which is releasing Jewison's
newest drama, ``The Hurricane,'' were skittish about hiring him to
direct the somber drama about Rubin ``Hurrican'' Carter, the boxer
wrongfully accused of murder (portrayed by Denzel Washington.) The
film will open on Wednesday in New York, Los Angeles and a few
other cities in order to qualify for Academy Award consideration.

Massachusetts accent and a fondness for death chamber technology,
who drinks 40 cups of coffee and smokes six packs of cigarettes a

time there's a gas execution, it's an accident waiting to happen.''

   CHINA-FILMS (Beijing) _ These are exhilarating, and perhaps a
bit frightening, times for Zhang Yuan, 36, who is increasingly
described in international film circles as perhaps the most gifted
and original filmmaker of his generation, even though his movies
have not been widely seen at home or abroad. His past films,
including ``Beijing Bastards'' (1992) and ``East Palace, West
Palace'' (1996), were banned in China because they dealt with
hidden subjects like alienated youths and furtive homosexual
encounters. But Zhang's seven feature films, including fiction and
documentaries, have become favorites on the international art-house
and film-festival circuit. Known for years as an intriguing
underground filmmaker, he is now swamped with invitations to appear
at festivals and seminars. By Erik Eckholm.

   HUNGARIAN-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ The Budapest Ensemble calls
its touring folk dance program ``Csardas: The Tango of the East.''
A producer of the show readily volunteers comparisons with the
popular Irish revue ``Riverdance.'' Clearly, a few bets are being
hedged here. But scratch the surface of the marketing campaign and
genuine passion and pride are quickly evident. The csardas is not
only the Hungarian national dance, it seems, but an embodiment of
Hungarian soul and the country's respect for dance in all forms.

century now ending. In the 1920s and '30s came the earliest
electronic instruments that would survive: some are still in
occasional use, including the theremin and the ondes martenot, both
generating the weird effect of voicelike sounds coming from
inexplicable sources, and the electronic organ. By Paul Griffiths.

compliment with a quick hand across his face, viewers were smitten
by the bickering sweethearts and their television love nest,
``Moonlighting.'' Fifteen years later, their chemistry seems as
potent as ever. Which is exactly what Bravo was banking on when it
acquired 65 episodes of the ABC series and annointed them ``TV too
good for TV,'' an honor already bestowed on 1980s classics like
``Max Headroom'' and ``Brooklyn Bridge.'' Next Sunday at 1 p.m.,
Bravo will introduce its newest addition with a mini-marathon of

PROMINENT JAPANESE POLITICIAN QUITS AMID SEX-ASSAULT SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In what is being seen as a major victory for women's
rights, the top official of Japan's second largest city resigned
Tuesday, as prosecutors filed charges against him for molesting a
21-year-old campaign worker.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the once-popular governor of Osaka, Isamu
Yamada _ a former comedian who still goes by his stage name, Knock
Yokoyama _ ended several months of determined efforts by the
politician to make the brewing scandal blow away.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Yokoyama's tactics, which involved publicly
calling his accuser a liar while agreeing to pay a large civil
settlement, failed woefully. The outcome provided a rare,
high-profile instance of encouragement to women, who have
traditionally been reluctant to bring sexually related complaints
to court.
</P>
<P>
   Yokoyama comfortably won re-election in April. But public
opinion swiftly turned against him after the young campaign worker
won a settlement in a civil suit. She contended that three days
before the April election, he had draped a blanket over himself and
the student in the back seat of a campaign vehicle and had groped
her.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded he had draped the blanket over the two of them but
contended it was because she was sick and he was cold. He denied
any improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Local groups, angered at the apparent contradiction between his
strong denials and his quick agreement to pay $107,000 in the civil
suit, mobilized to demand his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Yokoyama was forced to pay a large amount of money, most
people weren't sure whether to side with the governor or the young
woman,'' said Mizuho Fukushima, a member of Parliament's upper
house. ``But once he paid up, most people in Japan concluded that
he was guilty, and public opinion shifted against him strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, the mass media felt pressure to treat this more
seriously. Now he has quit, but he still hasn't admitted his crime.
So I think the prosecutors had to file a criminal case, and I hope
that he has to face the truth and admit it before the court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yoriko Madoka, another member of Parliament's upper house who is
also a prominent feminist, said: ``This indictment must be
considered a major step forward for women's rights in Japan. In the
past in Japan, sexual harassment and rape victims typically ended
up being treated like the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   The university student will probably remain an anonymous hero
for many women because the courts systematically shield the victim
from public exposure.
</P>
<P>
   But she was quoted as saying that she was left frustrated by
Tuesday's outcome. ``Fundamentally, I am not satisfied with his
manner of resignation,'' she said in a statement published by the
Sankei Shimbun. ``For me, I wanted him to apologize earlier,
reflect on what he had done, and then resign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, the student's lawyer, Eri Shimao, said
her client's case had been helped immeasurably by her
forthrightness. ``I think the person who filed the lawsuit had
compelling testimony,'' she said. ``There were no contradictions in
her statement, and that gave her high credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yokoyama has been unavailable for comment since checking into an
Osaka hospital late Monday, soon after police raided his offices.
In previous interviews, though, he has always insisted on his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Several women's groups and lawyers who deal frequently with
sexual harassment issues said the case would provide powerful
encouragement to other women to step forward and bring charges
against men who have harassed them.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``sexual harassment'' entered into usage in Japan only
10 years ago, after a famous case was brought in Fukuouka. Since
then, until recently, women have only very slowly begun to feel
secure enough to come forward to make harassment complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last couple of years, for reasons not entirely clear,
that has begun to change, and lawyers who specialize in such
matters say the numbers of women going to court over harassment has
been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Rising public attention to the issue has also brought legal
changes. In April, the labor ministry introduced sweeping new rules
affecting discrimination against women and harassment in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure from a letter-writing campaign to the
prefectural assembly, which censured Yokoyama last week, and the
prosecutor's office were seen as helpful in creating pressure to
take the complaint seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A civic group called Watchguard wheeled into action after the
civil suit was settled on Oct. 4, sending over 1,500 postcards to
the prosecutor's office demanding that a case be brought against
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's attitude was not only neglectful of women's
rights, but of the law,'' said Yoneko Matsuura, 62, a member of the
group. ``So on the 8th of October, we decided to demand his
resignation.''

HEWLETT-PACKARD BUYS 3 PERCENT OF XCELERA.COM

   Xcelera.com Inc. is getting help from Hewlett-Packard Co. in its
effort to gain a foothold in the business of speeding up Internet
content delivery.
</P>
<P>
   HP will invest $32 million for a 3 percent stake in Xcelera.com,
and will help the Woburn, Mass. company deploy a worldwide network
of Internet data caches built around HP computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Xcelera.com's Mirror Image Internet subsidiary is one of several
businesses that seek to speed up the performance of the Internet by
deploying large data storage caches at key points worldwide. Data
requested by Internet users is sent to them from the nearest cache,
instead of coming all the way from the actual Web site. ``By
storing a lot of content intelligently, close to end-users, we
deliver the content faster,'' said Xcelera.com chief executive Alex
Vik.
</P>
<P>
   Mirror Image Internet already has deployed its data caches in
Frankfurt, London, St. Louis, and Washington, with another under
construction in San Jose, Calif. Eventually, the company plans to
build 32 sites worldwide. Each will be located at a key Internet
access point, where many Internet backbone networks come together.
</P>
<P>
   Xcelera.com is going into the same business as high-flying
Akamai Technologies of Cambridge, Mass. That company already has
deployed hundreds of servers worldwide for speeding up Internet
service, and has done deals with CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass. and
the RoadRunner high-speed Internet system to further expand its
reach.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Akamai is currently one of the hottest of all
technology stocks. The company went public in late October at 26 a
share, and closed Tuesday at 301 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig White, senior vice president of Hewlett-Packard
Technology Finance, said the Mirror Image Internet technology is
superior to Akamai's. ``If you look at this segment,'' said White,
``we think they are going to be the leader, and emerge as the
dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   Xcelera.com Inc. jumped 18 to 85 on the American Stock Exchange,
while HP closed up 2 23/32 at 108 3/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<P>
   BOSTON _ In July, the Red Sox felt they needed Butch Huskey's
bat to make a run at the Yankees, and jumped at the chance to bring
him in from Seattle. Now they've decided he's no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey, 29, was one of three Red Sox players whom the club
decided to grant free agesday by refusing to tend them a
contract. Also gone are catcher Shea Hillenbrand, who batted .269
in 62 games with Pawtucket before suffering a torn anterior
cruciate ligament, and pitcher Julio Santana, acquired from Tampa
Bay in July. Santana did not pitch last season because of a sore
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Obtained just before the trading deadline, Huskey started fast
and hit a respectable .266 in 45 games for the Red Sox, with seven
home runs and 28 RBIs. Even though there are two spots available on
the 40-man roster, the Red Sox apparently feel they can receive
better production from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of outfielder Carl Everett from Houston and
the expected promotion of Michael Coleman from Pawtucket, Huskey,
an outfielder/designated hitter, would have been in a fight for a
starting job. Barring injury, veterans Darren Lewis and Trot Nixon
might platoon in right, unless one can beat out Troy O'Leary in
left. Mike Stanley and Brian Daubauch will likely platoon between
first base and DH. Wilton Veras could be the extra righthanded bat
and/or backup third baseman. Facing those odds, Huskey simply
became the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of competition for jobs,'' said team
spokesman Kevin Shea. ``And it might be difficult for him to be in
a situation where he is not a full-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey was obtained for Pawtucket lefthander Robert Ramsay, who
was promoted to Seattle in less than a month and made six
appearances, three as a starter. Despite his 0-2 record and 6.38
ERA, he is still considered a strong candidate for the Mariners'
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Sox general manager Dan Duquette said the team's No. 1 priority
remains pitching.

AT 77, A FORMER FRANCO AIDE SERVES ON IN SPAIN

<P>
   SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain _ Manuel Fraga Iribarne, Francisco
Franco's propaganda chief in the 1960s, is the only veteran of the
old fascist dictatorship who still holds high elected office in
democratic Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga has been president of his native Galicia in northwest
Spain for nearly a decade, but as he turned 77 in November a fierce
battle to succeed him was brewing here in the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside track are conservatives in Spain's governing
Popular Party, which Fraga himself founded in 1989 after repeatedly
failing to win election as prime minister after Franco's death in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside are upstart progressives, who for the first time
won control of most of Galicia's big cities last June. They say
that despite Fraga's latter-day democratic credentials, which
include helping to write Spain's Constitution of 1978, he rules
relatively poor Galicia like a fief.
</P>
<P>
   To all, Fraga's steely gaze and sly grin send a message not to
expect a disappearing act. He shows every indication of seeking a
fourth consecutive term in the regional elections due by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``My succession has come up, logically, because of my age and my
years of service,'' Fraga told Spain's largest-circulation
newspaper, El Pais, recently. ``But it has been made clear that my
succession is not open.''
</P>
<P>
   A top aide, Jesus Parga Lopez, put it more succinctly: ``He is
his own successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Galicia's fiery opposition leader, Xose Manuel Beiras, is
convinced that Fraga ``wants to continue and die with his boots
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may not surprise many people in this rainy, hilly corner
of Spain near the Atlantic. Fraga's staying power recalls other
leaders with Galician roots. The region produced Franco, who ran
Spain for 36 years, and it was also the birthplace of Fidel
Castro's father, who emigrated to Cuba, which his son has run for
nearly 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Castro and Fraga may be ideological opposites but
they have celebrated their shared Galician heritage during visits
to to each other's territories.
</P>
<P>
   As Galicia's president, roughly equivalent to a governor in the
United States, Fraga has traveled to 28 nations to promote his
region and is sometimes treated like a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that these trips, criticized by the opposition,
have produced huge gains for Galicia's fishing, agricultural and
industrial companies. But Fraga's economic counselor, Jose Antonio
Orza, conceded that his department had never actually calculated
the financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga is not the longest-serving of Spain's 17 regional
government leaders; his counterparts in Catalonia, Extremadura and
New Castile have held office longer. But Fraga is unique for his
link to Franco, whom he served as minister of information and
tourism and later as ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The Franco connection hampered Fraga's four bids to become prime
minister, and the job of moving the Spanish right toward the
political center finally went to his protege, the current prime
minister, Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga retreated to Galicia, a region of 2.7 million people, and
has been elected three times with comfortable majorities. He has
presided over increasing prosperity for Galicia at a time when
Madrid has given it, and other regions, more home-rule powers in
areas like education and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraga is incredibly efficient at image-making,'' said Emilio
Perez Tourino, secretary general of Galicia's Socialist Party. ``He
has been capable of making himself the symbol of this changing
Galicia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Socialists and Beiras' leftist Galician Nationalist Bloc
have buried their differences recently to form a joint threat to
Fraga, like pooling their resources to wrest control of the big
city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential successors come from within the Popular Party,
where analysts say that a longtime Fraga aide, Jose Cuina, heads a
faction strong in rural Galicia, while Madrid's conservatives are
pushing an aide to Prime Minister Aznar, Mariano Rajoy, who
represents the urbane, better-educated Galicians.
</P>
<P>
   Rajoy, the minister of education and culture, announced in
November that the national government would soon invest nearly $1
billion for long-sought railroad improvements in Galicia.
</P>
<P>
   Rajoy's news conference did not include Fraga, who was preparing
to leave for another overseas trip, to Brazil. But the next day, a
new opinion poll said Fraga was still the best-rated leader in
Galicia.

FED STANDS PAT ON RATES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to maintain calm as the world approaches the new
millennium, the Federal Reserve Board has made no changes in its
policy on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee agreed not to rock expectations and not to raise the 5.5
percent federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring a desire as the world's largest central bank to
preserve certainty and liquidity in financial markets during the
days leading up to Jan. 1 _ when computers around the globe may
have difficulty recognizing the year 2000 _ the policy-setting
committee stated that it also would remain neutral toward the
future direction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the Fed Tuesday was ``Have a nice holiday and a
Happy New Year, and we'll see you in February,'' said Glenn
Migliozzi, managing director of fixed income for Fleet Investment
Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Fed vote against a rate increase, analysts said it
is more _ not less _ concerned about inflation and has not ruled
out a rate hike, possibly at its next meeting on Feb. 1-2. Some
analysts noted that Fed members said they ``remain concerned with
the possibility'' that the economy would continue growing too fast,
which could spark a pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Three one-quarter-point Fed rate hikes this year each have done
little, so far, to slow the economy, and analysts detected a
heightened tone of concern about the red-hot economy in the Fed's
statement. After the Nov. 16 rate increase, the Fed policy
committee said its actions so far this year ``should markedly
diminish the risk of inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Fed said, it ``remains concerned with the
possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to
exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of
the remarkable rise in productivity growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed continued: ``Such trends could foster inflationary
imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the booming economy was everywhere in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government reported that retail sales accelerated
in November. Gross domestic product expanded at a 5.5 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace since last year;
forecasts put growth for all of 1999 at about 4 percent, just a tad
below the blistering growth of the two previous years. Tight labor
markets and low (4.1 percent) unemployment have given rise to the
possibility of higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring high-tech stocks are also a continuing concern of
Greenspan. Fueled by the surge of investment interest in Internet
stocks, the Nasdaq stock index has soared 78 percent this year,
adding another 127.28 points Tuesday, or 3.36 percent, to close at
a record 3,911.15. Other major stock-market indexes moved slightly
higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 56.27 points
to close at 11,200.54, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index
rising 15.34 points to close at a new record level of 1,433.43.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has said in the past that ``asset inflation'' _ the
rising values of people's homes and stock portfolios _ can
contribute to increased demand for consumer goods and lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the Fed is focused primarily on getting
through New Year's, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   On the potential Y2K threats, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has
expressed confidence the banking system is prepared to handle the
century date change without any major computer failures. The Fed
also has made sure the financial system has ample currency reserves
to meet unexpected demands for cash from customers withdrawing
extra cash from their banks in the event that financial
institutions have computer glitches that would prevent people from
gaining access to their money.
</P>
<P>
   A boost in interest rates this close to the Y2K switchover would
have added another disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very concerned about the Y2K issue,'' said Pierre
Ellis, senior international economist for Primark Decision
Economics. ``They don't want to contribute to any problems that
might develop _ not just in the US but abroad where there are
concerns.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ James G. Roche faced a retinue of mostly middle-aged
engineers wearing clip-on identity cards and called for his rubber
sword.
</P>
<P>
   A ruby-studded cardboard crown rested askew on his thinning
silver hair, and his casual sweater vest clashed with a royal robe
of blue trimmed with fake ermine. But there was no awkwardness in
Roche's voice as he delivered a classic stemwinder: ``The game's
afoot: Follow your spirit; and upon this charge cry `God for Harry!
England and Saint George!'''
</P>
<P>
   Reciting King Henry V's fabled rallying cry to his troops,
Roche, president of Northrop Grumman's Electronic Sensors and
Systems Sector, is the self-crowned leader of his own company's
effort to imbue its top executives with management skills inspired
by characters in Shakespeare's 400-year-old plays.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's monarchs may have relied on the chopping block as
the ultimate pink slip and pillage as an acceptable threat. But his
timeless characters are taking on fresh appeal lately, inspiring a
minor literary boom in new management books and prompting
executives like Roche to rely on Shakespeare as corporate
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some problems with the union, and their complaint was
that the executives were wimpy; they didn't know how to manage
people,'' explained Roche, a former Navy captain who likens
Northrop, the No. 4 military contractor, to Henry V's outnumbered
forces at the Battle of Agincourt. ``So we came up with this idea
of studying the strategy of war. War is hell, and we're at war.''
</P>
<P>
   Northrop's unlikely theatrical coaches are Kenneth L. Adelman, a
former arms control director in the Reagan administration, and his
wife, Carol, also a former Reagan administration official for the
Agency for International Development. They travel much like
medieval itinerant actors themselves. With a collection of costumes
and scripts, they have created a company called Movers and
Shakespeare, which offers leadership training and impromptu
playacting like this recent daylong retreat, at the Historical
Electronics Museum in Baltimore, for Roche and two dozen top
Northrop executives. The session was jokingly referred to as
``drive-by Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Business revolves around people, and no one has either the
depth of insights into people or the appeal to reveal those depths
greater than Shakespeare,'' said Adelman, who acknowledges that
some executives remain wary about such lessons because of the fear
that they know little about Shakespeare or _ O viper vile! _ might
be forced to don tights.
</P>
<P>
   Adelman has also written a new management guide, ``Shakespeare
in Charge,'' with Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of
Lockheed Martin. The guide, published by Talk Miramax Books _ an
imprint of Hyperion _ is just one title in an expanding collection
of new business books that take a Globe Theater view of mergers and
acquisitions, public relations and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the executive suite version of Shakespeare, Henry V is a
flexible leader and a motivational speaker who exudes confidence
and rallies his followers by masking private doubts. His treatment
of errant followers is decisive (translation: executions), but he
is also capable of great charm and humor during critical merger
talks (translation: a marriage proposal for the anxious French
princess, Katherine).
</P>
<P>
   This year, Shakespeare and his characters have inspired at least
three business books, with two on such a similar wavelength that
they carry the same title: ``Shakespeare on Management.'' A fourth
also tentatively carried that name but is now scheduled for
publication in June as ``Power Plays.'' That book was co-written by
Tina Packer, founder of the Massachusetts-based Shakespeare &AMP;
Company theater, and John Whitney, a former president of Pathmark
Supermarkets, who teaches a popular Columbia University business
class on the same theme, ``In Search of the Perfect Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shakespeare books reflect an even broader trend in business
literature _ seeking guidance from historical events or disasters
that test the mettle of leaders. Viking, for instance, part of
Penguin Putnam, is preparing to publish a management book next year
called ``The Shackleton Way,'' which explores the leadership skills
and hiring strategies of the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton,
whose expedition was trapped on drifting ice caps and survived more
than five months on dwindling supplies and meals of seal blubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if the story is ancient or modern, the key
thing is if it's gripping when leadership is on the line,'' said
Michael Useem, a professor of management and director of the Center
for Leadership and Change at the Wharton School and the author of
``The Leadership Moment: Nine True Stories of Triumph and Disaster
and Their Lessons for Us All.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to this conclusion through hard experience,'' Useem
said. ``You can talk about the 12 great qualities of leadership and
two hours later the students may not remember what was on the list.
You've got to draw people into a story, and I'm convinced that's
what they remember and not the principles.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, for instance, Useem has led a two-week
management seminar in the Himalayas, at the base camp of Mount
Everest, that costs each participant about $4,500 and is
essentially an on-the-scene exploration of the leadership lessons
culled from an Everest climbing disaster in May 1996 that left five
people dead. Jon Krakauer's first-person account, ``Into Thin
Air,'' is required reading, and another survivor, Sandy Hill, was a
surprise guest speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop's daylong Shakespeare seminar was considerably more
sedate, although some executives were wincing as Adelman showed
movie snippets of the Battle of Agincourt with Kenneth Branagh
playing King Henry in grunting, hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   Blood and mud mingled in a relentless scene of French and
English soldiers clawing, grappling and hacking one another until
the English triumphed through clever strategy and technical
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The English waited for attack, using longbow assaults to thin
the rain-soaked French cavalry, whose shiny armor weighed them and
their horses down in the mud. Sharpened stakes placed by the
English forced the French into a funnel that blocked their retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the leadership traits that Harry shows here?''
Adelman asked after the house lights flickered back on.
</P>
<P>
   George E. Pickett, vice president for marketing and business,
raised his hand. ``Henry doesn't show any exhaustion,'' he said.
``I think a great characteristic of his leadership is that he
pushes himself as hard as his men.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Roche was the first seminar participant to
don a gilded crown and emote, to the polite laughter of other
executives. He also played George Washington when his executives
took a leadership field trip to Valley Forge. And he assumed the
roles of George Meade, the Union general, and Robert E. Lee, the
Confederate general, on trips to the Gettysburg battlefield in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy of leadership training by role-playing is a matter
of necessity, Roche acknowledged during a break in the Shakespeare
seminar. In 1996, Northrop Grumman acquired Westinghouse Electric's
military electronics and systems business, which ultimately became
the division that Roche now leads.
</P>
<P>
   The company had gone through a long period of consolidation
after the end of the Cold War when there was little hiring of new
executives and all military contractors were faced with fierce
competition. With the collapse in business, Roche said, a wide age
gap developed between the older executives who stayed on and the
younger people hired more recently.
</P>
<P>
   The battlefield tours and the Shakespeare crash course are part
of a grander strategy to raise a new generation of executives to
think more creatively and nimbly, Roche said, adding that history
offers gripping lessons about decisions made under great stress.
``It does feel like we're in a war,'' he said. ``Remember, we're
the little guy in the industry. And our strategy is to teach all
our executives to think like chief executives.''
</P>
<P>
   The training sessions, Roche and other Northrop executives said,
also helped to build cohesion among executives merged together by
the Westinghouse acquisition. They acknowledged, though, that some
participants were a little wary at first about what they were
supposed to learn from ancient events.
</P>
<P>
   When Northrop was vying earlier this year with the No. 3
military contractor, Raytheon, for a $1 billion contract to build a
new radar system for the Navy's top fighter jet, the company
informally nicknamed its effort Project Agincourt. For the
Shakespeare-challenged, it also provided a Star Trek variation,
referring to itself as the Federation and Raytheon as the Romulans.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it did not have the long-range arrows to triumph
that time; shortly after the Shakespeare seminar, Raytheon won the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some Northrop executives, like C. Lloyd Carpenter, the
vice president for international operations in Roche's division,
have since found themselves pondering what King Henry would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying back from Europe, Harry came to mind,'' Carpenter said.
``I was preparing an outline for management actions on my behalf
next year and found myself running through a mental checklist which
turns out to be a combination of things derived from Henry V and
the many battlefield staff rides we have taken.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the lesson? ``Harry's placement of the sharpened
stakes,'' Carpenter said, noting that the tactic ``forced his
competitor into a funnel-shaped area which caused their strength _
mounted troops _ to become gridlock and easy prey.''

BONDS SLIP AS MARKET REMAINS ANXIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Government bond yields were down moderately on
Tuesday, still hovering near their two-year highs even as the
Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged and its
stance neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 8/32, to 95
21/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose
to 6.46 percent, from 6.44 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   William Hornbarger, fixed-income strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons, said the bond market's performance on Monday was the worst
one-day decline since February, and indicated that the market is
afraid of more interest rate increases by the Fed. The lack of
liquidity at year-end most likely exaggerated the recent weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be noted that the yield spread between the two-year
note and the 30-year bond continues to narrow and is currently at
26 basis points. A more restrictive monetary policy tends to
produce a narrower yield spread,'' Hornbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the week's biggest event was Tuesday's meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee of the Fed. ``Coming into the meeting
it was highly unlikely that the Fed would alter monetary policy''
as the year 2000 neared, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street consensus was that the Fed would adopt a tightening
bias, which they didn't,'' Hornbarger said. ``A change in the bias
would not have meant that a tightening was a foregone conclusion.
It simply would have meant that the Fed views the risks as
unbalanced and that they are more likely to tighten than to ease
going forward.'' He noted that the Fed has adopted a tightening
bias, favoring higher interest rates, 22 times this decade and only
tightened after six of those bias changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the recent weakness, we still feel that bonds
represent good values at these levels. Discounting the rise in
energy prices, inflation remains well in check and there are signs
that the interest-rate-sensitive areas of the economy continue to
slow. A Fed tightening remains a big worry, but the flattening of
the yield curve leads us to believe that further moves won't hurt
long-term rates too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point one has to look past the immediate impact of
tighter policy and at the long-term effects of multiple moves in
the federal funds rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornbarger believes that if the Fed moves again, it will slow
the economy and keep inflation in check, which is ultimately good
for bonds. ``In the near term, we look for yields to continue to
hang around recent levels, but we still feel that looking into the
first half of 2000, yields will fall from current levels to under 6
percent.''

MCCAIN SAYS BUSH ENDANGERING CANDIDACY, DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ News that his principal rival plans to target
him more aggressively in speeches and ads moved Arizona Senator
John McCain to offer what amounted to a scornful lament Tuesday:
George, you just don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview, said Texas Governor George W. Bush can
only hurt his party and himself if he overreacts to fading poll
numbers in New Hampshire and turns his campaign in a negative
direction.
</P>
<P>
   And, as for Bush's criticism of McCain for his stance on
campaign finance overhaul, McCain said Bush must not be fully
briefed on the facts. Even imperfect improvement is better than the
political status quo, in which special interests hold sway, McCain
said. And, he added, Bush's specific complaint that the McCain plan
leaves the power of unions to contribute to campaigns unchecked is
simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could anybody not want to change a system in which a
Chinese army-owned corporation with a subsidiary in the United
States can now give money legally to an American campaign?'' McCain
responded Tuesday during a telephone interview from South Carolina.
``I don't see why anybody wouldn't want to change that. I think
we've got to put country above party on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a Globe interview Monday that he plans next month
to begin drawing distinctions with McCain on campaign finance,
taxes, and education issues. On campaign finance, Bush, who favors
a ban on soft-money contributions by corporations and unions but
not individual donors, is especially critical of McCain for
dropping the so-called ``paycheck protection'' provisions from his
long-pending campaign finance legislation. Currently, union
members' dues can be used for political purposes, and frequently
they wind up funding Democratic causes. Republicans want to give
union workers the option of preventing their dues from being used
that way. McCain, however, dropped that language in the Senate this
year because of Democratic demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the kind of leadership you want?'' Bush asked in the
interview. ``I can't imagine, `Elect me, I'm the kind of leader
willing to hurt the Republican party.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has long supported the right of union members to keep
their dues from being used politically. In addition, he has
supported the right of shareholders in publicly traded corporations
to give or withhold their permission before corporate money can be
used for political means. Tuesday, he said the more pressing
problem is unregulated soft-money donations from labor unions to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor should look at the list of Democratic Party
contributions, they're from labor,'' said McCain, who would
prohibit soft money to the parties from corporations and
individuals, as well as labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, look at the big, huge contributions from big labor to
the Democrats: They're huge millions of dollars in soft-money
contributions,'' said McCain. ``This would eliminate that. I don't
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``drawing distinctions'' with McCain, the Bush campaign
is expected to run television ads that draw an implicit contrast
with McCain, and in some cases an explicit contrast, one senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said Tuesday that he hopes Bush does not engage in a
divisive campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into negative attacks on each other, it hurts
both of you,'' McCain said. ``I think we can have a reasonable
discussion of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said the McCain campaign is
engaging in a political ploy by warning Bush against launching a
negative attack, when he is doing nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's going to run the same positive, upbeat campaign
he always has,'' Fleischer said. ``He's going to discuss with the
American people the issue differences between the two candidates.
He won't hesitate to discuss that taxes will be much higher in a
McCain administration than a Bush administration, but that is
issue-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has criticized Bush for proposing too large a tax cut at
$483 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain campaign is wary. In response to Bush's new
approach to the campaign, McCain aides quickly sent out a copy of a
script from one of Bush's first television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe oftentimes campaigns resort to mud throwing and name
calling,'' Bush says in the ad. ``And Americans are sick of that
kind of campaigning. What they want to hear is what's on people's
minds and where the candidate's hearts are. I'm going to run a
campaign that is hopeful and optimistic and very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign also issued a statement from McCain saying
that Bush's dip in the polls should not deter him from the ultimate
objective, ``to send the Clinton-Gore crowd back home.'' The
statement said a negative campaign will increase the chances of
Vice President Al Gore getting elected, ``and lessen the chances
that a Republican will have the chance to bring conservative change
to our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Rudman, the former New Hampshire senator who is
supporting McCain, warned that Bush had better think again before
running any negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've rarely seen a comparative ad that didn't create
distortions,'' Rudman said in an interview. ``If they want to do
that, they'll do that at their own peril.''

   &UR; TRUE LOVE MEANS LIVING IN LUXURY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vicki Liviakis &LR; , travel reporter for KPIX's ``Evening
Magazine'' and ``Travel Update'' anchor, was lured aboard a
Southwest flight from Oakland to Los Angeles last week, where her
boyfriend proposed. They had met seven years before on the same
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sweet and sentimental moment,'' says Liviakis, and
when the betrothal was announced to the other travelers, they burst

   &UR; A LITERARY HATE CHAIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Salon's  &UR; Craig Offman  &LR; reports on a critical do-si-do of fiction
writers:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Updike  &LR; wrote in the New Yorker that  &UR; Tom Wolfe &LR; 's book,
``A Man in Full'' is ``entertainment, not literature.'' In the New
York Review of Books,  &UR; Norman Mailer &LR;  said that ``Reading the work
can even be said to resemble the act of making love to a 300-pound
woman. Once she gets on top, it's over. Fall in love, or be
asphyxiated.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently retaliatory interview in a Charleston, W.Va.,
newspaper, Wolfe called Mailer and Updike ``two old piles of
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   When informed of this by a Canadian TV interviewer,  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Irving &LR;  jumped into the fray, saying he's unable to read Wolfe
``because he's such a bad writer.'' Irving called Wolfe's novels
``journalistic hyperbole described as fiction. ... He's a
journalist. ... He can't create a character. He can't create a
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wolfe asked about Irving, ``Why does he sputter and
foam so? Because he, like Updike and Mailer, has panicked. All
three have seen the handwriting on the wall, and it reads: `A Man
in Full.' ... Irving needs to get up off his bottom and leave that
farm in Vermont or wherever it is he stays and start living
again.''

<P>
   - Soap opera star  &UR; Susan Lucci  &LR; was to open in the New York
revival of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' December 23, her birthday, but
the opening was postponed last week because the producers said she
had missed some rehearsals because of illness. The New York Post
said she didn't want to open on her birthday because everyone would
be asking her age, which, according to different Web sites, is
either 51 or 53. Lucci says only that she started playing her soap
opera character, in 1970, ``as a 15-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   _Eighty-two members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association
received $400 Coach watches from the makers of ``The Muse'' in the
name of  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR; , while considering nominating her for a
Golden Globe award for her work in the movie. Stone's publicist
said the watches _ provided free by Coach ``because it gets their
name out'' _ were sent by the film company. ``We were touched by
her generosity,'' association President &UR; Helmut Voss &LR;  said of Stone,
``but this is definitely a no-no.'' The watches were retrieved and
returned to Stone, he said. They are now in the offices of USA
Films.

<P>
   &UR; THE HOUSE CHOOSES A NEW CHAPLAIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the House of Representatives have nominated the Rev.
 &UR; Charles Wright, &LR;  a Presbyterian, as chaplain of that body,
rejecting Father  &UR; Timothy O'Brien, &LR;  a Catholic, who had been
recommended by the 18-member selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roll Call, some members of the committee think
O'Brien was rejected because of his religion; he would have been
the first Catholic to hold the office. Rep. &UR; Steve Largent &LR; ,
R-Okla., told fellow members of the committee he was worried that
O'Brien's Roman Catholic priest's collar might cause divisiveness
in the House. Among those who said she was disappointed was Rep.
 &UR; Anna Eshoo &LR; , D-Atherton, who served on the committee. ``As a
Catholic,'' she said, ``I'm resentful and offended as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The full House has to vote on the nomination in January.

GAY (Washington) - Last week, John McCain collected $40,000 from a
fund-raiser sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP
group. But, in the same week, the Washington Blade called McCain an
``enigma,'' on gay issues, noting he was once keynote speaker to an
Oregon group that was condemning homosexuality as ``perverse.'' How
can we explain the apparent contradiction? And is McCain willing to
step in on behalf of reservist Steve May, who is about to get the
boot? By JEFF BARKR. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOMB (Phoenix) - Is fear multiplying in the masses? Each news story
about bomb materials being stolen or smuggled heightens our
awareness of the potential for terrorism on New Years Eve. Scores
of people say they're staying inside, in part out of fear of
calamity. We check in with Phoenix area police guarding big
parties, the airport, federal buildings, major private
corporations, and real people about the real _ and perceived _
threats of New Years Eve. What will security be like on Dec. 31?
What concerns does the FBI have about domestic terrorism around New
Years?

   &UR; Vicki Liviakis &LR; , travel reporter for KPIX's ``Evening
Magazine'' and ``Travel Update'' anchor, was lured aboard a
Southwest flight from Oakland to Los Angeles last week, where her
boyfriend proposed. They had met seven years before on the same
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sweet and sentimental moment,'' says Liviakis, and
when the betrothal was announced to the other travelers, they burst
into applause. And then the flight attendants treated each and
every passenger to an extra bag of peanuts.

   &UR; A LITERARY HATE CHAIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Salon's  &UR; Craig Offman  &LR; reports on a critical do-si-do of fiction
writers:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Updike  &LR; wrote in the New Yorker that  &UR; Tom Wolfe &LR; 's book,
``A Man in Full'' is ``entertainment, not literature.'' In the New
York Review of Books,  &UR; Norman Mailer &LR;  said that ``Reading the work
can even be said to resemble the act of making love to a 300-pound
woman. Once she gets on top, it's over. Fall in love, or be
asphyxiated.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently retaliatory interview in a Charleston, W.Va.,
newspaper, Wolfe called Mailer and Updike ``two old piles of
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   When informed of this by a Canadian TV interviewer,  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Irving &LR;  jumped into the fray, saying he's unable to read Wolfe
``because he's such a bad writer.'' Irving called Wolfe's novels
``journalistic hyperbole described as fiction. ... He's a
journalist. ... He can't create a character. He can't create a
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wolfe asked about Irving, ``Why does he sputter and
foam so? Because he, like Updike and Mailer, has panicked. All
three have seen the handwriting on the wall, and it reads: `A Man
in Full.' ... Irving needs to get up off his bottom and leave that
farm in Vermont or wherever it is he stays and start living
again.''

<P>
   - Soap opera star  &UR; Susan Lucci  &LR; was to open in the New York
revival of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' December 23, her birthday, but
the opening was postponed last week because the producers said she
had missed some rehearsals because of illness. The New York Post
said she didn't want to open on her birthday because everyone would
be asking her age, which, according to different Web sites, is
either 51 or 53. Lucci says only that she started playing her soap
opera character, in 1970, ``as a 15-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   _Eighty-two members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association
received $400 Coach watches from the makers of ``The Muse'' in the
name of  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR; , while considering nominating her for a
Golden Globe award for her work in the movie. Stone's publicist
said the watches _ provided free by Coach ``because it gets their
name out'' _ were sent by the film company. ``We were touched by
her generosity,'' association President &UR; Helmut Voss &LR;  said of Stone,
``but this is definitely a no-no.'' The watches were retrieved and
returned to Stone, he said. They are now in the offices of USA
Films.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOUSE CHOOSES A NEW CHAPLAIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the House of Representatives have nominated the Rev.
 &UR; Charles Wright, &LR;  a Presbyterian, as chaplain of that body,
rejecting Father  &UR; Timothy O'Brien, &LR;  a Catholic, who had been
recommended by the 18-member selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roll Call, some members of the committee think
O'Brien was rejected because of his religion; he would have been
the first Catholic to hold the office. Rep. &UR; Steve Largent &LR; ,
R-Okla., told fellow members of the committee he was worried that
O'Brien's Roman Catholic priest's collar might cause divisiveness
in the House. Among those who said she was disappointed was Rep.
 &UR; Anna Eshoo &LR; , D-Atherton, who served on the committee. ``As a
Catholic,'' she said, ``I'm resentful and offended as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The full House has to vote on the nomination in January.

 &HT;    Rookie Kearse wows NFL
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville, Tenn. _ Tennessee Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse
has a wingspan of 86 inches _ nearly the height of Hawks center
Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse's hands are huge _ he can hold the ends of a 12-inch
ruler between his little finger and thumb _ and he wears size 14
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   During a workout before April's NFL draft, Kearse ran the
40-yard dash under 4.5 seconds, speed usually reserved for very
fast running backs, cornerbacks and receivers.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder teammates, coaches and opponents call him ``The
Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy is physically very unusual. He can do some pretty
amazing things,'' said Denver Broncos receiver Travis McGriff, who
played with Kearse at the University of Florida. ``The guy is 260
pounds, with a 40-inch vertical leap. There's not too many people
walking this earth like that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Few NFL rookies have created such a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, 6 feet 4, leads the AFC in sacks with 13 1/2. He broke
the league's rookie sack record with two in last week's 30-17
victory over the Falcons. Today, Kearse probably will become the
first rookie defensive end from AFC named to the Pro Bowl since the
AFL-NFL merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Kearse said, ``(teammates and coaches) say, 'Man,
how did you do that?' It just comes naturally. Sometimes, I can't
believe it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen other NFL teams didn't think it would come so
naturally. Kearse, who began his college career as a safety before
moving to outside linebacker, fell to the middle of the first round
in the draft. Some NFL scouts were concerned that he was too big to
play linebacker; others said he was too small for defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they just didn't want to take a chance on taking a
'tweener' like me,'' Kearse said with a grin. ``I was moved around
a lot in college. I think other teams saw me as just a big,
athletic guy. Some thought I had to play outside linebacker. Others
thought I was just a pass rusher and not an every-down player.
Teams didn't want to take a chance, and that motivated me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team that passed me up may not play us, but they can
pick up the paper, see our record and my stats.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse's loss was the Titans' gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everybody had a good feel for his gifts, his
talent and his athletic ability prior to the draft,'' Titans coach
Jeff Fisher said. ``We were extremely surprised he fell (to No.
16). Starting with about the sixth pick, we tried to trade up to
get him. We were unsuccessful, and then obviously he fell to us.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kearse leading the way, the Titans (11-3) have clinched at
least a wild-card berth to end their six-year absence from the
playoffs. Tennessee can move within one game of first-place
Jacksonville (13-1) in the AFC Central by beating the Jaguars in
Nashville's Adelphia Coliseum on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy might be the best athlete I've ever seen,'' said
Titans safety Blaine Bishop, a three-time Pro Bowler. ``I'm scared
to race him in the 40. I told him, 'If you pass me chasing someone
from behind, I'm retiring.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight games, Kearse has 10 1/2 sacks, 41 tackles,
nine quarterback pressures and seven forced fumbles. With four
sacks in their final two games, the Titans can break the team
record of 52, set in 1993 when the Houston defense coached by Buddy
Ryan led the NFL in sacks and run defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we didn't know about (Kearse) were the instincts,
the passion, the discipline, those kinds of things,'' Fisher said.
``He has been more than what we expected. He plays very, very hard.
He's extremely instinctive. He's not the biggest (defensive end),
but he separates off blocks. He understands the running game,
primarily because of the instincts. He's a gifted athlete. He's not
satisfied easily.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans wanted to find out about Kearse's heart and
determination, they had only to look at what he'd overcome in the
past. Kearse was one of seven children raised by a single mother in
Ft. Myers, Fla. His father, Joseph Kearse, was shot and killed in a
pool hall eight months before Jevon was born.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, his half-brother, Jermaine ``Rocky'' Green, was
killed at 17 in a drive-by shooting outside the family's apartment.
A grandfather and uncle also were murdered. Kearse's older brother
``J.J.'' is serving a prison term for armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the field, I tell myself that the guy lining up
across from me could be the guy that shot my brother,'' Kearse
said. ``Sometimes, I ask myself what my life would be like now if
I'd grown up with a father. Maybe my younger brother would be
alive. Maybe my older brother wouldn't be in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, if I had grown up with a father, I may not have
pushed myself to be where I am right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Kearse already is one of the top pass rushers in the
NFL, and he might be the best rookie defensive player since
linebacker Lawrence Taylor entered the league in 1981. Tennessee
fans are dancing to the song ``Le Freak,'' and they're cheering
for, of all things, a former Gator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In training camp, there was a play where Chris Sanders, one of
our fastest players, ran a slant pattern from the receiver position
on the opposite side of the field,'' said Titans cornerback Anthony
Dorsett, son of former Dallas running back Tony Dorsett. ``Jevon
was rushing the passer, was in the backfield, turned and ran
upfield and 30 yards downfield caught Chris and was in on the
tackle. We all said to ourselves, 'Man _ that's why he's the
``Freak.'' ' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``We all think he can have the impact like a Lawrence Taylor,''
Dorsett said. ``Think about it: This is his first year, so he's
going off raw ability. Just wait until he gets some (pro) smarts.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Titans defensive coordinator Gregg Williams wanted to
acclimate Kearse cautiously. When Kearse first became a defensive
end in April, he didn't know which hand to put on the ground in a
three-point stance. Early in the season, he played only left end.
But opponents started loading up that side, using tight ends to
help the right offensive tackle double-team him. Teams also keep
running backs in the backfield to chip-block him, making every
effort to keep Kearse away from the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to account for him,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said.
``He's one of those Lawrence Taylor types, where you have to make
sure you take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher says Kearse's best games lie ahead. The team has hired a
nutritionist from Vanderbilt University to add some weight to his
sculpted body. Kearse said his weight has dropped as low as 245
this season. He would like to be at 265 to 270.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher envisions using Kearse's power and quickness to create
mismatches. iKearse has enough speed to drop into the secondary and
cover receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just scratching the surface as far as playing the
defensive line,'' Fisher said. ``We've put him in one position,
rather than moving him around, so he becomes familiar with one. . .
. I really believe that if Jevon keeps the same work habits and
stays healthy, he can be as good as he wants to be. And he wants to
be the best _ ever.''

 &HT;    Look for new _ hopefully improved _ Falcons team in 2000
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons general manager Harold Richardson might make a
great used car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, he showed a sense of humor when asked about the
monstrous job of re-building the Falcons in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   He remarked that of the 57 players currently either on the
active roster or injured reserve, about 42 are signed or are the
exclusive property of the Falcons at least into the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which, if you look around the league,'' he said, ``is probably
about average.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's numbers are about right.
</P>
<P>
   But like a guy who wants his customer to look at the shiny paint
job without looking under the hood, he fails to acknowledge a few
key points.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the unsigned players were starters in last Sunday's 30-17
loss at Tennessee, and nine can become free agents. If right guard
Gene Williams were healthy, he'd have started, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but some of the players signed beyond this season
won't be around by the time the NFL draft rolls around in April
because they haven't played very well, or will be too expensive
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If you see some Falcons players shopping tonight,
be nice. It's the holiday season, and besides, a lot of them will
be unemployed soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I really haven't got used to at this level,''
said second-year linebacker Keith Brooking, who will definitely be
back. ``You have to accept it. It's part of the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of all these unsigned players is that the Falcons
have about $15 million to spend under next season's projected $61
million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   That's rare, and good news for a team that had to trim its cap
last offseason by waiving wide receiver Tony Martin (also partly
for legal reasons) and linebacker Cornelius Bennett, and
re-structuring the contract of quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are the Falcons will go after after a top-notch wide
receiver with size, but plenty of parts will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Even Richardson acknowledged that having that much money to
spend is akin to holiday shopping with a new credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a necessity,'' he said. ``If you're going to add
components, you have to have the resources available.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most curious potential missing faces next season
could be 13-year veteran middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle
</P>
<P>
   He's played well, despite missing two-and-a-half games with a
strained left patella tendon, but will be 35 next season. Still, he
wants money similar to what he's making now -- a salary of about
$2.9 million, and a salary cap charge of about $3.85 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rush on anything,'' he said. ``I think I can play
at a high level again next year. I want to try to end this thing at
15 years, and try to end as an Atlanta Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I' in a position to try to say, `OK, I'll play
for less money.' I don't think my skills have slipped to that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the only starter to become a free agent was strong
safety William White, who the Falcons made no attempt to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, you try to get those negotiations done
before free agency starts (a few weeks after the season),''
Richardson said. ``There are exceptions. It's a fluid situation.
They're looking (at free agency); we're looking.''

BOARD EXONERATES TEACHER IN DEAD MOTHER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. _ The School Committee agreed in a closed
emergency session Monday night not to punish the first grade
teacher whose student, seven-year-old Lydia Hanson, came to school
two weeks ago saying, ``My mom is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Internal school incident reports that explain the morbid tale
indicate that Lydia sent mixed messages about her mother's health
to adults, including her teacher, Janet Makar, 57, according to a
source familiar with the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The child apparently failed to confirm that her mother was dead
after other students alerted Makar, the report said, and Lydia
later told another adult that her mother was merely ill. The child
took the school bus home, where she spent a night sleeping in her
dead mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Several school committee members said it would be unfair to hold
Makar and other Kiley School staff members responsible for not
taking more decisive action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tragedy initiated by an act of God,'' said school
committee member James K. Liacos. ``We feel badly for the family,
the teacher and the counselor, but we believe you have to really go
on the judgment of the individuals involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's grandmother, Sharon Tucker, did not have a strong
reaction to news of the panel's decision, which is to be made
public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have mixed feelings about that. I don't know what to
say,'' Tucker said. ``I have my granddaughter, I just lost my
daughter, and that's all I'm focusing on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Hanson, a 33-year-old single mother, was a diabetic and
died of an enlarged heart, according to Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   School Committee members read incident reports describing the
events of Dec. 9 from the points of view of Makar, the guidance
counselor she consulted about Lydia, Kiley School Principal John M.
Murtagh, Superintendent Louis Perullo and the neighbor who drove
Lydia to school on the fateful morning.
</P>
<P>
   The documentation suggests that Makar handled the situation
appropriately, said School Committee member David D. McGeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the teacher did a very good job,'' McGeney said.
``For whatever reason, this girl did not reach out to any adults,
although she was in contact with several. The only adult that
picked up on any clues was her teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, the incident reports contradict what
Lydia apparently told Tucker and her husband, Richard Tucker, after
Richard Tucker found the child with her mother's body on the
morning of Dec. 10. Sharon Tucker said Lydia told Makar her mother
had died, but the teacher responded, ``You shouldn't say things
like like,'' and sent her back to her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Makar testified in her statement that boys in her class
approached her saying Lydia had told them her mother was dead,
according to the source, who described the documents on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   When Makar asked Lydia if she had said such a thing, the little
girl did not respond at all.
</P>
<P>
   Makar then asked, ``Is that an appropriate thing to say?'' Lydia
answered ``no,'' according to the source, who was paraphrasing the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Since the school had not been contacted about any death and
Lydia had said nothing to the neighbor who gave her a ride to
school, Makar assumed that Kimberly Hanson was not in fact dead,
but still felt alarmed. ``Her experience told her that that's not
right; a kid wouldn't say that,'' said the source.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Makar, a 35-year veteran teacher, then told a
guidance counselor she wanted to speak about a student, but did not
specify the problem. The guidance counselor did not get back to
Makar until Lydia had left for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the teacher didn't leave it at that,'' the source said.
``She continued to monitor the girl's activities. She took a test,
she did well on the test. She ate lunch, she ate a good lunch. She
went to recess and played happily with the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tuckers said that Lydia could not call for help once she got
home from school because she did not know how to use her mother's
new cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   However, the incident reports say that Lydia answered the phone
when a neighbor called to ask why the little girl did not show up
after school, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   When the neighbor asked if she was coming over, Lydia answered,
``No, my mother is sick,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was yet another adult she didn't reach out to,'' said the
source. ``I'm not a psychologist, but it seems that she hid the
fact that her mother had died from adults. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee's decision to exonerate Makar and the Kiley
School was unanimous, said member David C. Gravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody made the decisions based on the information they
had,'' Gravel said. ``There was no flaw in the decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the panel said they would continue to examine the
city's policies and procedures for handling emergency situations.
Such policies are up-to-date, Liacos said, but he added, ``you
can't possibly think of everything that might arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Makar has suffered profound sadness over Lydia's loss as well as
her night alone with Hanson's body, said school committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common nature that when someone is injured, particularly
a child, you want to find a villain,'' McGeney said. ``But there
are no villains in this case.''

 &HT;    Coke, CCE given lower debt ratings
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Concern about higher debt and weak operating
performance prompted Standard &AMP; Poor's on Tuesday to lower its
ratings on the creditworthiness of Coca-Cola and two of its major
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased debt levels, along with weaker-than-expected
operating performance at Coke and its key bottlers in 1999 due to
weak global economies and European product recalls, have weakened
creditor protection measures for the system below ranges considered
appropriate for the former ratings,'' S&AMP;P said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P's corporate credit rating on Coca-Cola Co.'s long-term debt
was lowered to ``A+'' from ``AA-,'' and the rating on its
short-term debt was lowered to ``A1'' from ``A1+.'' The ratings on
Coke's senior unsecured debt and shelf registration debt was
lowered to ``A+'' from ``AA-.'' The rating on commercial paper was
lowered to ``A1'' from ``A1+.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings on Coca-Cola Enterprises' and Coca-Cola Amatil's
long-term and senior unsecured debt also were lowered, from ``A+''
to ``A-.'' Coca-Cola owns 40 percent of Atlanta-based CCE and
around 37 percent of Coca-Cola Amatil, which is based in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The actions were not a surprise. In September, S&AMP;P put
Coca-Cola's senior debt on its credit watch ``with negative
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The downgrades could make it more expensive for Coca-Cola and
the bottlers to borrow money. Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch,
however, said Coca-Cola is confident it will have access to lending
rates that are ``only slightly higher'' than the company has been
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch added that while the company was disappointed in S&AMP;P's
actions, ``we will continue to maintain an open dialogue with them
so they will continue to have a clear understanding of how our
business is operating.''
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P's highest ratings are ``AAA,'' meaning a company's ability
to meet its financial obligations is ``extremely strong,'' and
``AA,'' which means it is ``very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-highest rating, ``A,'' means a company's capacity to
meet its obligations remains strong but that the company has become
more susceptible to the ``adverse effects'' of changes in business
conditions, such as troubled markets or costly acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about $6.3 billion of total debt was outstanding at
Coca-Cola and about $11.2 billion was outstanding at CCE as of
Sept. 30, S&AMP;P says.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, ``Standard &AMP; Poor's does not believe credit
measures are likely to improve to levels consistent with the
previous `AA-' minus rating for Coke or the previous `A+' rating
for CCE and CCA over the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola shares closed Tuesday at $58.43 3/4, down $1.12 1/2.
CCE rose 25 cents to $18.37 1/2. Coca-Cola Amatil's American
depositary receipts closed at $4.75, down 50 cents.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Striking a political balance that limited public
criticism, President Clinton on Tuesday announced the costliest
environmental regulations of his presidency: new air pollution
rules that will require automakers to build cleaner vehicles and
oil companies to refine cleaner gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The president's original proposal, issued last spring, was
modified in three ways to make it more palatable Tuesday to
automakers, oil companies and environmentalists. With Republican
and Democratic presidential candidates trying to portray themselves
as friends of the environment, the new rules have also won support
across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has the enthusiastic backing of
the oil and auto industries, set the political tone earlier this
month when he said in a debate in New Hampshire that he supported
the Environmental Protection Agency's plans for tougher rules. He
then asked Texas regulators last week to tighten state rules on
auto pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, Bush's leading rival for the Republican
nomination, said through a spokesman that he supported the new
rules, provided that they did not turn out to impose unacceptable
costs on consumers. Both candidates for the Democratic nomination,
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have long
advocated tighter auto pollution rules.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A year of political balancing by the Clinton administration, a
few last-minute adjustments to the regulations and a split within
the auto industry produced an extremely rare chorus of support
Tuesday for the regulations _ or at least acceptance of them _ from
automakers, oil companies and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, the lobbying arm of the oil
industry, said that while oil industry officials still disliked
some details of the plan, they would comply. ``This is going into
effect, and we're going to do our part to make it work,'' said
William Hickman, a spokesman for the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers also said Tuesday that they were not planning to
block the new regulations. Officials at General Motors Corp., which
has lagged rivals in reducing pollution from sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks and which had lobbied against the new rules, said
Tuesday that they had decided against filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the rule is there, we have to get on with the job of
meeting the standards,'' said William Noack, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were the most enthusiastic. ``This rule was
No. 1 on our Christmas wish list,'' said Angela Farleigh, an
activist at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which inflated
a 15-foot-high, red balloon shaped like a sport utility vehicle
outside the elementary school in northeast Washington where Clinton
announced the plans. The group has lugged the inflatable vehicle,
dubbed the Exterminator, to protests in two dozen cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday at an elementary school in a low-income
neighborhood of northeast Washington, Clinton presented the new
rules as necessary for public health as Americans drive ever more
miles and increasingly buy sport utility vehicles, which produce
several times more pollution per mile than cars. He said the new
rules would prevent 4,300 premature deaths a year and 173,000 cases
a year of asthma and other respiratory illnesses among children.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma has become a scourge of inner-city children, for reasons
that are not entirely clear but seem to be linked to air pollution.
Gloria Hickman, the nurse at the elementary school, said that 25 of
the school's 315 students suffered from the ailment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They come in frightened, short of breath, scared,'' she said
in an interview. ``It tugs at my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of sport utility vehicles, which tend to pollute the most,
have leveled off at about 17 percent of the market over the last
three years, but are still climbing as a percentage of vehicles in
use, from about 8 percent now. Automakers are working on car-like
models that look like sport utilities, like the Subaru Forester,
but do not have the environmental and safety problems of
traditional, pickup-based sport utilities; General Motors, Ford
Motor and DaimlerChrysler all plan to introduce such vehicles next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimated that automakers and oil companies would spend
$5.3 billion complying with the new rules over the next few years,
but that cleaner air would reduce the nation's medical bills and
other health-related costs by $25.2 billion. That would make the
clean air rules the biggest of the Clinton presidency in terms of
costs and benefits by a wide margin, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs will be so widely spread that opposition to the
rules never really coalesced. The EPA said that the rules would add
$100 to the price of a car, $200 to the price of a sport utility
vehicle and a couple pennies to the price of a gallon of gasoline.
The new rules will reduce allowable pollution from cars by 77
percent in the 2004 model year and then require so-called light
trucks _ sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans _ to
meet car standards in the 2007 to 2009 model years. Light trucks
currently emit several times as much pollution per mile.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress from oil-producing states had posed the
biggest political threat to the new regulations, threatening last
spring to block the new rules through legislation. But the
administration tempered that criticism Tuesday by giving small
refineries two extra years to produce cleaner gasoline; Sen. James
Inhofe, R-Okla., who had led previous criticisms of the plan and
held hearings, welcomed the changes Tuesday, although he said that
he still had some misgivings about the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution rules on large sport utility vehicles were made even
more stringent than under the original proposal. The very largest
models, like the Ford Excursion, will be counted as family vehicles
for the first time instead of medium-duty trucks. This delighted
environmentalists, who had sent more than 100,000 postcards and
letters to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also postponed until sometime next year any
action on diesel vehicle pollution, to the relief of automakers,
who nonetheless remain worried about the possibility of tighter
regulations someday. Automakers want to start equipping more sport
utility vehicles with fuel-efficient diesel engines so as to meet
federal fuel-economy regulations. But environmentalists want much
stricter emissions rules on diesels, because some research has
suggested that the emissions may be carcinogenic.

EDUCATION CHIEF'S PAY LINKED TO STUDENT TEST SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Taking accountability to a new high at a time when
students, teachers and principals are under intense pressure to
boost test scores, Massachusetts will tie the state education
commissioner's pay raise to MCAS results.
</P>
<P>
   The move is believed to make the Commonwealth the second state
in the country -- Illinois is the first -- to link a state
education chief's pay even partially to student gains on a
standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   After voting to grant Education Commissioner David P. Driscoll a
6.75 percent pay increase to $149,450, Board of Education chairman
James A. Peyser suggested Driscoll's future pay hikes should take
into account improvement on students' MCAS scores.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll immediately agreed, joking that he would take a
vacation in May ``to run around all the schools urging the kids
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Details on exactly how much students have to boost scores still
have to be worked out, and Deputy Education Commissioner Alan
Safran said it would be up to the board to set those parameters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, however, raises questions over how far up the
education chain responsibility should extend for test results and
whether an education chief like Driscoll has any direct influence
over individual MCAS scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the key accountability questions: Who should be
accountable and for what?'' said Mary Fulton, a policy analyst for
the Education Commission of the States, a non-profit group
dedicated to improve public education across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises the question over what should be reasonable and
fair. Should you be accountable for something you have no control
over? We have to look at what makes sense and it's the same
question we are asking about students, teachers, schools and local
administrators,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher unions across the country have vehemently protested
tying teacher bonuses or pay hikes to student performance. They
insist it is unfair to hold teachers solely responsible for student
test scores because so many variables affect a child's achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, education officials -- from Texas to Florida -- have
combatted with reams of research showing that a class' performance
and gains on a standardized test may be a good indicator of a
teacher's ability. In Florida, teachers get special bonuses if
their students perform particularly well or make significant gains
on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Lynn school officials won't give principals more
money until their students show a 10 percent improvement on the
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, education officials had mixed responses to Peyser's
suggestion, with some saying it was only fair and others
questioning if such an incentive could somehow result in higher
test scores for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair,'' said Board of Education member Bill
Irwin. ``Everyone has to be held accountable; the students, the
teachers, the administration and even the Department of Education
and the Board of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, along with fellow board member Roberta Schaefer and
Peyser, based Driscoll's current pay increase on three criteria:
effectiveness in building support for board policies; effectiveness
in supporting the board's work and effectiveness in managing the
state Department of Education. Driscoll's pay raise will take
effect in January.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll was appointed education commissioner March 10 1999,
after serving as interim chief for eight months. This is his first
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said the recommendation to link test scores and
Driscoll's future pay ``sounds like an interesting idea, but I have
not thought through the ramifications of it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members did not vote on the issue or discuss it at great
length partially because Driscoll readily agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   How the board determines what is an acceptable gain will be
important, observers say. In Illinois, for example, state education
superintendent Glenn W. ``Max'' McGee's contract says test scores
are ``one of the factors that is going to be looked at,'' said
spokesman Lee Milner, but doesn't mention specific goals.

FORTSON, RECOVERING FROM BROKEN FOOT, PRACTICES WITH TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Danny Fortson will not be expected to solve all of the
Celtics' problems when he returns for their visit to the Los
Angeles Clippers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Fortson's recovery from a broken right foot is an
encouraging sign as the Celtics take a six-game losing streak into
Wednesday's game against Atlanta. Fortson participated in his first
full practice at Brandeis University Tuesday since being injured in
the second game of the exhibition season. His foot has completely
healed, but he will need more conditioning before playing,
according to coach Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have struggled against opposing frontcourts and were
simply overmatched against Los Angeles' Shaquille O'Neal in a 99-90
loss Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won against L.A.,'' Fortson said. ``We've had a
couple of games like that. It was frustrating for me in the
beginning to watch and not be able to help out. But the more and
more I work out it's not so bad. I've learned to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to just go out and win, simple as that. Nobody is
going to feel sorry for you in the NBA. But we are a young team and
we are making progress. If we were a veteran team and we were
losing games we would have major problems. But we're still young
and coach Pitino is pointing us in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics have lately been moving in a negative direction,
with three wins in their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers are playing with a lot of confidence, Shaq is a
dominant player, and they believe they can beat the world right
now,'' Fortson said. ``But L.A. is beatable. And we can have that
same kind of confidence as long as we don't read the papers, just
come here and focus on beating teams on the court. It shouldn't
become a psychological problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' visit to Los Angeles marks the start of a
three-game road trip. And the Celtics have a nine-game road losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling rebounding and (Fortson) gives us another
physical presence,'' said Paul Pierce, who remains out with a
sprained left ankle. ``He is one of the best rebounders in the NBA.
And rebounding is the key. The other team can't get second shots,
and it gets our transition game flowing, everything flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's return has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not rushing things,'' Pierce said. ``I want to make sure
I'm 100 percent. I'm anxious to get back out there and whhen the
doctors and trainer say it's time, I'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating. You never want to be the guy on the
sidelines when you know you could help the team so much. But I've
been learning a lot by watching, learning the strengths and
weaknesses of my teammates and different ways I can fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to find ways to get wins, to get more offensive
consistency, consistency everywhere. We say every day that in order
to be a playoff team we've got to win road games.''

 &HT;    Preacher fields gift, Holyfield queries
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Creflo Dollar of World Changers Ministries says he
gave Fulton County police $100,000 to help financially strapped
officers, not to buy favor.
</P>
<P>
   And Dollar, speaking on a video, said he won't participate in
the Evander Holyfield divorce case because divorce violates his
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the leader of the 20,000-member church
has publicly commented on the two controversial cases. He explained
his position in videos that his lawyer released Tuesday morning to
reporters after a court hearing in Fayetteville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar said he gave $1,000 checks to 100 Fulton County police
officers last month as a way of showing his support for law
enforcement officers. He said he empathized with police because his
late father was a law enforcement officer who often worked extra
jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never the intention to make it look like we were trying
to buy the police,'' Dollar said. ``I want to apologize for it
being taken completely the wrong way. It was an act of kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollar said the checks, handed out in November at an
appreciation breakfast in south Fulton County, had no connection to
two traffic tickets he received in October. Those tickets were
downgraded to warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar said that ``$100,000 for a $150 ticket, that would not be
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fulton County Ethics Board in Atlanta voted last week that
officers must give the money back to Dollar and the church.
</P>
<P>
   Money is a major element in the second controversy Dollar
addressed, the high-stakes divorce case of Janice and Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar does not want to answer questions from Janice Holyfield's
lawyers about how much money the former heavyweight champ donated
to Dollar and the church. Janice Holyfield's lawyer estimates it's
$7 million. Dollar has been ordered to give a deposition, but
refuses to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is against my religious convictions to participate in the
divorce proceedings of Evander and Janice Holyfield,'' Dollar said
on the video. ``I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollar said the Bible orders him to keep people married, not
help them get divorced. He said he'd lose his freedom of religion
if he had to answer questions about counseling the Holyfields.
</P>
<P>
   When Dollar didn't show up for a court-ordered deposition
Tuesday morning, Fayette County Superior Court Judge Ben Miller
found Dollar in contempt and ordered the minister jailed until he
agreed to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar's lawyer, Lecora Bowen, immediately appealed to the
Georgia Court of Appeals, thus keeping Dollar out of jail. Miller
has said some communications between Dollar and the Holyfields,
such as confessional statements, were privleged.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal usually takes several months. John Mayoue, one of
Janice Holyfield's lawyers, didn't know if that would delay the
Holyfield divorce trial, which is scheduled to start April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar is a leader in the ``prosperity gospel'' movement, which
teaches that God promises wealth and health to the faithful.

CELL GENESYS' SOARING VALUE CLOUDS DEAL WITH GENZYME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A surging stock market has jeopardized Genzyme Corp.'s proposed
$350 million acquisition of Cell Genesys Co., whose management
Tuesday asked its shareholders to vote against the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys' opposition comes nine weeks after Genzyme
announced plans to buy the Foster City, Calif., biotechnology
company and its gene therapy technology and extensive patent
portfolio in gene activation technology. Included in the deal was
Cell Genesys' 22 percent interest in Abgenix Inc., a publicly
traded biopharmaceutical company based in Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Abgenix was trading at $39 a share nine weeks ago and accounted
for $129 million of the $350 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since, Abgenix shares have soared after the company announced
several new research agreements. The stock reached a record high of
$119.50 on Friday and closed Tuesday at $112. That makes Cell
Genesys' stake worth $371.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cell Genesys's board withdrew its support for the
deal, saying it isn't in the best interest of its shareholders. In
a statement, Cell Genesys said it has attempted to negotiate a
``mutual termination of the merger agreement with Genzyme but was
unable to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Abgenix was spun out of Cell Genesys in 1996 and its chairman,
Dr. Stephen A. Sherwin, is also chairman and chief executive of
Cell Genesys.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the Oct. 18 merger agreement, Cell Genesys
must pay a $15 million termination fee to cancel the deal or hold a
meeting of stockholders to vote on Genzyme's proposed acquisition.
Tuesday, the company said it would hold a shareholders meeting by
early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies could not agree on how to interpret the
market volatility,'' said Caren Arnstein, Genzyme's vice president
of corporate communications, adding that the Cambridge, Mass.
company was not prepared to make a higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers analyst Anthony Butler said he believes the
Genzyme-Cell Genesys deal is still salvageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frothy stock market is the cause for now, but there are a
lot of benefits to this deal for both Genzyme and Cell Genesys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys's extensive patents and know-how are designed to
enhance Genzyme's own gene therapy plans and protect it against
competitors using another technology called gene activation, which
uses human cells instead of animal cells to make drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of Cambridge and Genzyme are in a
tight race to develop a drug to treat Fabry's disease, a rare
genetic disorder. The only major difference between each company's
drug is in the manufacturing process _ Genzyme using a more
traditional biotech method while Transkaryotic uses gene
activation.

 &HT;    'Tis the season to hurry up and get there
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles

<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the Pakula family, visiting relatives this holiday
season meant bundling up their 3-year-old toddler and packing their
belongings for an overnight train trip to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Laura and Louis, and their son, Frank, made the trek
south from Baltimore along with 135 other passengers on a packed
Amtrak train that arrived Tuesday morning. Laura's mother, Norma
Barnes, is glad they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have your children around you during the holidays makes it
special,'' Barnes said with a smile while playing with her
grandson, who raced around the train station laughing and playing.
``He's my youngest grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakulas are among nearly 45 million Americansexpected to
travel by planes, trains, buses and automobiles over the holidays,
according to estimates by the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport are
predicting the Thursday before and Sunday and Monday after
Christmas will be among their busiest travel days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia and throughout the Southeast, close to 9 million
motorists are expected to hit the highways for holiday visits. It
will likely be slow going in many places.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be in heavy, heavy, heavy traffic,'' said
Teresa Hildebrand, regional director of the AAA's Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   She said her agency is hearing reports of growing congestion
along Interstates 75 and 95, vital north-south routes. ``They can
expect longer delays and more cars on the road,'' Hildebrand said.
</P>
<P>
   No universal rules ensure travelers reach their destinations in
time to unwrap presents with the family and sip egg nog by the
fireplace come Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But travel industry executives say passengers can increase the
odds that their trip will go without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   For example, AAA's Hildebrand said motorists should be sure
their cars have emergency equipment, including a spare tire and
hazard reflectors.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested fuel tanks be topped off because stop-and-go
traffic is likely. Drivers also should make sure their cars are up
to the journey because a mechanic will be hard to find. ``It is
going to be more difficult to limp to the next exit and find
maintenance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AAA believes more motorists will choose to drive this year
because there have been fewer discounted airfares and many people
will stay closer to home with the Y2K uncertainty surrounding the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   At Hartsfield, the biggest crush will occur on the days just
before and after Christmas, with passenger volumes each day
expected to average 230,000 travellers.
</P>
<P>
   The next peak occurs Jan. 3, when more than 245,000 passengers
are forecast to pass through Hartsfield. Airport crowds likely
won't approach those of the Thanksgiving holiday because the
Christmas-New Year's period occurs over weekends, said John
Kennedy, a Delta Air Lines spokesman. ``We are saying the bookings
are 'soft,' because we have two two-day holidays and it's more
spread out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials said passengers can ease the bumps in their
travel experience by arriving early for check-in, by having photo
identification and tickets readily accessible and by calling to see
whether parking lots are open before driving to the airport.
Greyhound Bus Lines said it expects to carry a record 1.3 million
people this holiday season. ``We're doing exceptionally well,''
said spokeswoman Kristin Parsley. She credits a surge in ridership
to low fares, new bus terminals and added buses for routes with
high ridership.
</P>
<P>
   Bus riders should arrive at least an hour early to check in,
Parsley said. And, ``Bring anything that's going to make you
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials declined to predict their passenger loads this
holiday season. But rail officials suggest passengers arrive at
least 30 minutes prior to their train's departure. Officials at
Amtrak's Buckhead office said Tuesday they are expecting large
crowds, especially as Christmas draws near.
</P>
<P>
   For Louis Pakula, traveling by train is the only way to go. ``I
used to travel by train while growing up,'' he said while waiting
to collect his family's bags. ``I prefer it over flying.''

OFFICIALS WEIGH ALGERIANS' POSSIBLE LINK TO BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Algerian men are behind bars _ one in
Washington state suspected of trying to smuggle a truckful of
bomb-making materials into the United States, the other in Vermont
who was in a car with possible traces of explosives in its right
rear fender.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, the government's corridors are abuzz
about the end-of-the-year terrorism threat from UBL _ the acronymn
for Osama bin Laden (US officials spell his first name ``Usama'').
</P>
<P>
   What's the connection between bin Laden, believed to be hiding
out in an Afghanistan cave, and two Algerians trying to sneak into
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Those knowledgeable about counterterrorism said it could be a
link that reaches back to the early 1980s when bin Laden led a
brotherhood of Arab fighters in Afghanistan, giving him well-armed
friends throughout the Arab world, including in the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group. Or there could be nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the hunger for information on bin Laden, and on the
Algerians, is growing by the day, as the year comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scare is on,'' said Hussein Ibish, communications director
of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington.
``Unfortunately, you could see the scare began even before the
arrest of the Algerian in Washington state, emerging in the
warnings and cautions given by the State and Justice departments.
When they mentioned the millennium, they said a particular cause of
concern was the holy month of Ramadan, as if it were a dangerous
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan is a month of spiritual reflection and fasting for
Muslims, not a particularly violent time historically, with the
notable exception in recent years in Algeria, where massacres were
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, though, violence in Algeria has dropped
significantly, and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's amnesty plan
for Islamist fighters has appeared to split the armed resistance
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But those who study terrorism in general and bin Laden in
particular say if there is a link between the arrest of the
Algerians and bin Laden's Feb. 23, 1998, declaration of holy war
against Americans, it is unlikely to be driven by internal Algerian
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, parts of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, a loose group of
Islamic militants from Indonesia to Algeria, could be activated by
word of mouth after an order is given from bin Laden, a member of a
Saudi Arabian family that has made billions in construction
projects, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can assume there is a plan to attack Americans, either
abroad or in the United States, or both,'' said Boaz Ganor,
director of the International Policy Institute for
Counter-Terrorism in Israel and a former top adviser on terrorism
issues to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure the GIA (the Algerian Islamic group) would
target the United States, but I do think it's possible that
specific people in the GIA who have connections with bin Laden
could try to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's worldwide advisory for Americans living
or traveling abroad to exercise caution until after the New Year
was based on specific information that came from the arrests of 11
Jordanians, an Iraqi, and an Algerian who were plotting attacks on
Christian pilgrimage sites in Jordan, said officials there. The
group was funded by bin Laden's close associate, Omar Abu Omar,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, US intelligence specialists were first alerted
to a possible bin Laden terrorism plan targeted for Western Europe
when Turkish authorities said six members of a reported bin Laden
commando unit had infiltrated Turkey. The six, still at large, are
four Iranians and two Algerians. Two weeks ago, Turkey police
detained six Libyan men suspected of planning an attack on the
American Embassy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-American sentiment in the Middle East has its roots in
the Gulf War coalition against Iraq, the nine years of sanctions
against Iraq, and the perceived pro-Israeli bias in peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US government is hated,'' said Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in an interview Tuesday with CBS' ``The Early Show.'' ``All
the people in the world are against it, therefore, there is a
threat. I hope it will not happen in this new year. I have no
knowledge about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, in his 1998 statement urging holy war against
Americans that he and four other Islamic militant leaders signed,
claimed that America was eager to ``destroy Iraq'' and occupy the
holy Arabian peninsula with its troops.
</P>
<P>
   The statement then declared, ``The ruling to kill Americans and
their allies _ civilians and military _ is an individual duty for
every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials have linked bin Laden to the two East Africa US
embassy bombings last year that killed more than 200 people;
terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Sudan; and a group that
tried to bomb American servicemen in Yemen in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But in Vermont Tuesday, US Attorney Charles Tetzlaff said there
was no evidence linking the two arrested Algerians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical,'' said Ibish of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``I don't doubt that a wealthy man
can arrange things, even nasty things if he wants. But he sort of
has assigned this role to himself, in which he spends a lot of time
giving blood-curdling interviews. In the Arab world, the man is
widely regarded as a crank and a dangerous fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, which has posted a $5 million reward
for information leading to bin Laden's arrest, spokesman James B.
Foley tried to strike a balance in describing the nature of the
threat to Americans in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the American public that this is a yellow light.
It is not a red light,'' Foley said. ``We are urging Americans to
be vigilant and cautious as they travel, but we are not
recommending to Americans that they change their plans and that
they not travel overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Americans at home?
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is meeting daily to discuss the issue. The
FBI continues its investigations on the Algerians. Customs
officials have put an extra 300 guards on duty, and all their
border posts on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   And top officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright, General Henry H. Shelton, and CIA Director George Tenet,
met Monday at the White House. But after two hours of discussions,
they decided not to make public any of their drafted statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take this day by day,'' Foley said.

DISCOVERING FRESH WAYS TO SEE AND TO SELL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The major film motif of 1999 was reinvention, both on and off
the screen. Characters and filmmakers alike found significant ways
to renew themselves. Rekindled careers (Robert Altman's with
``Cookie's Fortune,'' Spike Lee's with ``Summer of Sam''),
revisionist notions of storytelling (``Run Lola Run'') and the
jump-starting of an entire genre (animation with ``Princess
Mononoke'' and ``Toy Story 2,'' not to mention the wicked ``South
Park'' musical).
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood even found a way to put aside the usual playbook and
make this Christmas season virtually formula-free.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots marketing triumph of ``The Blair Witch Project''
sent the message that here, too, was an opportunity for reimagining
the familiar. (The single smartest ``Blair Witch'' brainstorm: ads
that cropped the terrified face of Heather Donahue &UR;  &LR; so that this
did not appear to be the kind of low-budget indie film that would
let the camera linger indefinitely on her running nose _ even
though it was.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so much of moviegoing America responded to the
interactive, Internet-driven ``Blair Witch'' siren song means that
the usual ways of attracting film audiences are growing outmoded.
And the imaginative salesmanship may pave the way for more
rewarding idiosyncrasies on screen.
</P>
<P>
   These are the 10 best films of 1999, with their shared
fascination for phoenix-like transformation:
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY' Mike Leigh's gloriously witty and literate foray
into music appreciation. In Leigh's account of how the popular team
of Gilbert and Sullivan escaped their creative doldrums and
concocted ``The Mikado,'' the portrayal of a theatrical world is
immensely clever. And this film's delightful homage to the artistic
process is art in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY' Within the tabloidy tale of a young woman's
gender-bending masquerade, Kimberly Peirce's film found an
essential American tragedy and a terrifying vision of barren,
small-minded life. But her film's vast reserve of hope and beauty
was its great surprise.
</P>
<P>
   As played unforgettably by Hilary Swank, without whom the film
might not have succeeded, the character of Brandon Teena became a
touching emblem of freedom: the chance to reach beyond the
limitations of circumstance and bravely shape a different destiny.
</P>
<P>
   `ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER' Pedro Almodovar, himself no stranger to
the idea of flamboyant reinvention, showed dazzling new ambition
and wisdom in his most mature work yet. Dedicated to film stars who
have played actresses onscreen, this bold, passionate melodrama
brought out the noble heroine in each and every one of its
characters, regardless of gender.
</P>
<P>
   In a newly sweeping, generous style, and with ever more striking
visual sophistication, Almodovar created a group of fabulously
resilient feminine types. The hilarious centerpiece: Antonia San
Juan, as the film's resident transsexual, cataloging all the
womanly perfection that money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY' Somehow it took David Lynch to lead
audiences past the ultimate frontier: into a G-rated parable of
spirituality and decency, seen from the unfashionable vantage point
of old age. Lynch accomplished the unthinkable by putting Richard
Farnsworth, in a devastatingly real and rock-solid performance, on
a lawnmower at 5 mph and still building enough drama and emotion
for a great chase.
</P>
<P>
   Burned out on the surreal and the grotesque, Lynch faced down
inevitable realities about aging and conscience. In yet another
story of a character who radically redefines himself, he made the
most touching and quietly eloquent film of the year.
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY' In a richly nuanced, elegantly
inventive adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's bone-chilling story of
stolen identity, Anthony Minghella beautifully demonstrated that
the exquisite acuity of ``The English Patient'' was no fluke. He
reached beyond the story's criminal particulars and touristy
ambience to explore the psychosexual shadings and socioeconomic
game-playing inherent in its central murder. Minghella was once
again adroit in shaping a first-rate literary adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH' In this jubilant funhouse of a debut
feature, Spike Jonze made a great display of wild, idiosyncratic
humor as he captured the essence of life on the seventh-and-a-half
floor. Never mind the film's curious stooped-over characters and
their strange elevator stop: What Jonze really caught better than
any other film this year was the mind-boggling sensation of a world
bursting with wild new technological possibilities. Portals into
famous brains? Exit routes to the New Jersey Turnpike? ``Being John
Malkovich'' had a giddy new elasticity, a high-tech sense that
anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER' Finally connecting with material to suit his
sleek, impressionistic style, Michael Mann fused agile technique
with a hard-hitting corporate parable. With Russell Crowe
outstanding as a tobacco company man turned whistle-blower, this
glossy, expertly crafted drama framed a moral dilemma for a
ruthlessly business-minded world.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN MOVIE' This funny, beguiling documentary introduced a
would-be independent filmmaker hell-bent on making horror movies.
And then it artfully revealed why, for him, filmmaking was a life
or death proposition. The essence of game, wishful independent
filmmaking could not be captured more honestly _ or entertainingly
_ than this.
</P>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT' Stanley Kubrick's posthumous dreamwalk, a
voyage into sexual mistrust and the uneasy balance between id and
propriety, elicited the year's most disastrous hype. But it remains
one more brilliantly unnerving nightmare from a filmmaker who never
lost his fascination with the dissolution of man's civilized
veneer.
</P>
<P>
   `THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS' In this emotionally raw and astute
French film about two young women and their friendship, questions
of power, loyalty and sexual manipulation figured effortlessly into
a naturalistic drama. A haunting coming of age tale, exemplary for
the rare force and purity of its vision.

   Black choreographers, especially a younger generation, stepped
into the spotlight as a group this year. All had an individual
stamp, but many shared an attraction to African dance movement that
they stylized and absorbed into a personal vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   This very new fusion of idioms makes for work that is abstract
and avant-garde. There was no mistaking the cumulative impact of
recent pieces by, notably, Garth Fagan, Ronald K. Brown, Jawole
Willa Jo Zollar, Donald McKayle, Bill T. Jones, Judith Jamison,
Reggie Wilson (a relative newcomer) and Dwight Rhoden (his
``Twist'' was delivered with dazzle by Dance Theater of Harlem).
</P>
<P>
   It was also a year of blockbuster events. The New York City
Ballet held a mammoth 50th-anniversary celebration. Lincoln Center
Festival '99 carved out a major place for dance. The Kirov Ballet
offered a behemoth of a ``Sleeping Beauty.'' The New Europe '99
Festival added pep with witty surprises in three boroughs. As other
highlights suggest, the best also came in smaller packages.
</P>
<P>
   HERBIN (TAMANGO) VAN CAYSEELE A tap dancer, he is both
sensational and a well-kept secret to most of the dance public. A
cult audience is nonetheless familiar with his astonishing elegance
and virtuosity, a blend of swaying curved form, lightning speed and
skimming floor rhythms. One is tempted to call him the best dancer
of any kind around.
</P>
<P>
   Van Cayseele hails from French Guiana by way of Paris and the
world is visibly his stage. Thanks to the Kitchen, the Manhattan
performance space, his multicultural production ``Urban Tap'' gave
him wider exposure. The musicians and dancers from several
continents that he gathered for this occasion included Max Pollak,
a Cagneyesque tapper, and Eijo, a prancing Artful Dodger. A magic
show led by a wizard.
</P>
<P>
   RONALD K. BROWN ``Grace,'' created for the Ailey company, put
this choreographer over the top as a major talent, although his new
works at the Joyce Theater for his own company, Evidence, presaged
the fireball intensity that ``Grace'' received from the magnificent
Ailey cast at City Center. Telly Fowler, an extraordinary dancer in
Evidence, remains the paragon of the explosive energy and liquid
fluency with which Brown's work has been identified since his
sojourn in the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK CITY BALLET The company's 50th anniversary bash, with
100 ballets spread out over two seasons at the New York State
Theater, got better and better. Fresh insights flowed from the
``Balanchine Black and White Celebration,'' a concentrated dose of
the modernist works that make this company unlike any other. Love
it or hate it, Peter Martins' full-length ``Swan Lake,'' with
splendid sets by Per Kirkeby, cleared away old-fashioned clutter.
Maria Kowroski, a dancer of the 21st century, was the most stunning
Swan Queen.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder other choreographers used her in premieres: Martins'
``Them Twos'' and the rollicking suite of jazz ballets ``Duke!'' by
Robert La Fosse, Fagan and Susan Stroman. Add Christopher
Wheeldon's delightful ``Scenes de Ballet'' plus a thrilling revival
of George Balanchine's creepy ``Ivesiana,'' and it turned out to be
a happy birthday after all.
</P>
<P>
   MERCE CUNNINGHAM Lincoln Center Festival '99 presented a
smashing tribute to a choreographer who has changed the way we look
at dance. Cunningham more than returned the compliment with
splendid New York premieres and revivals at the State Theater.
``Biped'' was the production spectacular, integrating live dancers
with striking animated figures that Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar
had generated through ``motion-capture'' technology. Cunningham's
unfettered originality was seen in the equally haunting ``Pond
Way,'' a subtle nature piece.
</P>
<P>
   NEW EUROPE '99 A three-week showcase of cutting-edge work from
Europe revealed a range of aesthetics that thankfully had more
creativity than coherence. The big hit was Felix Ruckert's
``Hautnah,'' an exploration of audience-performer boundaries at
Joyce SoHo, obliging the viewer to be shut up alone with one
dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha Pepelyaev's brand of physical theater at Dance Theater
Workshop showed how dramatically things have changed in Russia. At
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Jan Lauwers' Needcompany, with
choreography by Carlotta Sagna, confirmed that Belgium remains a
hotbed of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   France was represented by Jose Montalvo's technological wizardry
at the Joyce Theater and by the Compagnie Kafig, which turned
hip-hop into a mesmerizing visual symphony at Hostos Center for the
Arts in the Bronx. A message to David White of Dance Theater
Workshop and his fellow organizers: Encore.
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY What is there to say about Graham,
the mother of it all, except that at her most hermetic, she is
often at her grandest. ``Herodiade'' and ``Dark Meadow'' are among
her enigmatic works, and they were led this year with superlative
power by Terese Capucilli and Christine Dakin. Graham's legacy has
been loyally and beautifully preserved by Ron Protas, the company's
artistic director. Thanks to this season at the Joyce Theater, a
generation of young audiences discovered Graham's genius and
clamored for more.
</P>
<P>
   MOISEYEV DANCE COMPANY Igor Moiseyev turned 93 during the
national tour of his famed folk company from Moscow. Of course, no
folk ever danced like these astounding virtuosos who brought down
the house at Carnegie Hall. Among the premieres, ``Jewish Suite,''
an ingenious vignette about a wedding in Czarist times, and
``Bashkir Dance,'' lyrical in its mystery, testified to Moiseyev's
continuing innovations as a choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   PAUL TAYLOR'S ``OH, YOU KID!'' In this small suite to ragtime,
Taylor created an American parable. For all the sepia glow and faux
nostalgia of the hilarious boardwalk imagery, dark forces were
evoked and got the Taylor treatment. The Ku Klux Klan became a a
mincing chorus line, and Lisa Viola, in a knockout contortionist
performance, was the exploited cooch dancer, a stereotyped vision
of people from foreign climes. Behind the laughter, pain. Thanks go
to the American Dance Festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts for commissioning the piece.
</P>
<P>
   AFTERIMAGES Marcel Marceau, face painted white but persuasively
turning green with seasickness at the Kaye Playhouse; Damien Welch,
the heartthrob of the revitalized Australian Ballet at City Center;
the bravura and artistry of American Ballet Theater's male stars.

SHIP SALVAGES MORE HUMAN REMAINS FROM FLIGHT 990 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Raising hopes that relatives of EgyptAir crash victims might
claim some remains of their loved ones, a deepwater salvage ship
returned to a Rhode Island port Tuesday with aircraft wreckage and
body parts retrieved from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Smit Pioneer docked at Quonset Point at 6 a.m. and began
unloading 16 large containers, each about the size of a commercial
trailer, for distribution to hangars at the former Navy base. The
human remains will be sent to a morgue set up there by the state
medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-foot-long piece of EgyptAir Flight 990 was the largest
wreckage plucked from the bottom during 750 deployments of a
clamshell bucket dropped from the ship. The piece's location on the
plane had not been identified, according to Ted Lopatkiewicz, a
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Other items brought back by the Smit Pioneer, a Dutch ship
leased by the Navy, included passenger seats, seat covers and other
parts of the cabin interior. Clothes and personal items belonging
to the victims were also found during the ship's 10 days at sea.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, the NTSB chairman, said Tuesday he did not know how
much of the Boeing 767ER-300 had been retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, our investigators believe that parts from all areas
of the aircraft have been recovered, most of which are very small
due to the extreme fragmentation of the aircraft fuselage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the jetliner wreckage will be laid in a hangar to dry,
then examined for clues about the cause of the Oct. 31 crash off
Nantucket that killed all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The process will take several weeks, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   No information about the nature or amount of recovered human
remains, which will undergo DNA testing, was disclosed by the NTSB
or the state medical examiner. Nearly all the previously discovered
remains, retrieved in the first days after the crash of the Boeing
767, had broken into small pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatkiewicz said no decision had been made whether the Smit
Pioneer will return to the wreckage field. Over the next two weeks,
the Navy will send a submarine to survey the 270-foot-deep area to
determine whether more work is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, crews recovered an 8-foot section of the aircraft
with three windows, and a nose wheel before high waves forced the
salvage effort to cease for about a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was quite a bit of wreckage where we felt there was
going to be,'' NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crash, underwater robots retrieved the cockpit
voice recorder and flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   While the newly found wreckage is sorted, catalogued and
examined, investigators will continue their probe into what caused
the jetliner, en route to Cairo from New York, to plummet into the
ocean at near-supersonic speeds after a terrifying dive and climb.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that a co-pilot might have crashed the aircraft
purposely followed news leaks that the cockpit voice recorder
contained part of an Islamic prayer just before the fatal dive.
</P>
<P>
   US and Egyptian investigators reportedly have been at odds.
However, Egyptian Ambassador Nabil Fahmy said last week at a
gathering of the Boston-based World Affairs Council that the
investigation has been progressing well, and that the public knows
only 1 percent of what has been a cooperative effort overall.

U.S. MAKES LAST-MINUTE DUES PAYMENT TO UNITED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With barely a week to go before the United
States would have lost its vote in the General Assembly for falling
too far behind in paying its back dues, the Clinton administration
came through Tuesday with a check for $51 million, the United
Nations said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, despite several recent payments totaling $247
million, a minimum of about $8 million remained to be paid by the
United States, the organization's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, had said
earlier in the day. The last-minute payment was consistent with a
pattern in recent years in which just enough money was found by the
United States to save its General Assembly vote. The Security
Council vote is not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations calculates the total outstanding American
debt at still more than $1 billion. The United States does not
accept that figure because of congressional decisions to lower
payments. Both sides agree, however, that a minimum of $255 million
had to be paid by the end of this year. Tuesday's check cleared
that mark comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative at the United Nations, praised a budget agreement in
Washington that finally freed $926 million for the United Nations.
He called the decision a ``terrain-changing event'' for the United
States here, where resentment against Washington for essentially
bankrupting the organization has been mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our judgment from the beginning that if we didn't get
the Helms-Biden bill passed,'' Holbrooke said, referring to the
budget agreement, ``the next year here in New York would have been
very unpleasant, and America's influence not only in the United
Nations but in all sorts of important issues around the world could
have been severely eroded. It was important to get this behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Helms-Biden compromise, agreed to by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
Sen. Joseph Biden, R-Del., the committee's ranking Democrat, set
the $926 million total for U.N. payments.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke is now faced with the task of putting some
congressional conditions to the test here. The money is being
released by Congress in installments, with the condition that
members of the United Nations agree to reduce American
contributions to 22 percent of the organization's budget from 25
percent. Congress has already unilaterally lowered contributions to
the peacekeeping budget to 25 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many other benchmarks are attached to the payments, but
Holbrooke says they are manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hays, an American diplomat with ambassadorial rank, has
joined the U.S. mission here to take on the budgetary and dues
negotiations. Holbrooke said the United States would like to
broaden the debate on dues to review not only American
contributions to the organization, but also those of many other
nations that are perceived to be paying too little or too much.
</P>
<P>
   Except for adjustments two years ago that lowered the rates of
membership for the smallest and poorest countries to $10,000 from
$100,000 annually, a readjustment of dues had not taken place for
more than a quarter of a century, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-six new nations have joined the U.N. since then,'' he
said. ``Some get richer, some poorer. Some nations have told us
privately that as part of a package they will increase their
contributions. Some nations said they would like to reduce. We are
calling for a general revision, not just a diktat from
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the organization needed to find only $38 million
annually to make up for the United States' reduction in payments.

OFFICIALS WEIGH ALGERIANS' POSSIBLE LINK TO BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Algerian men are behind bars _ one in
Washington state suspected of trying to smuggle a truckful of
bomb-making materials into the United States, the other in Vermont
who was in a car with possible traces of explosives in its right
rear fender.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, the government's corridors are abuzz
about the end-of-the-year terrorism threat from UBL _ the acronymn
for Osama bin Laden (US officials spell his first name ``Usama'').
</P>
<P>
   What's the connection between bin Laden, believed to be hiding
out in an Afghanistan cave, and two Algerians trying to sneak into
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Those knowledgeable about counterterrorism said it could be a
link that reaches back to the early 1980s when bin Laden led a
brotherhood of Arab fighters in Afghanistan, giving him well-armed
friends throughout the Arab world, including in the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group. Or there could be nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the hunger for information on bin Laden, and on the
Algerians, is growing by the day, as the year comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scare is on,'' said Hussein Ibish, communications director
of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington.
``Unfortunately, you could see the scare began even before the
arrest of the Algerian in Washington state, emerging in the
warnings and cautions given by the State and Justice departments.
When they mentioned the millennium, they said a particular cause of
concern was the holy month of Ramadan, as if it were a dangerous
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan is a month of spiritual reflection and fasting for
Muslims, not a particularly violent time historically, with the
notable exception in recent years in Algeria, where massacres were
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, though, violence in Algeria has dropped
significantly, and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's amnesty plan
for Islamist fighters has appeared to split the armed resistance
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But those who study terrorism in general and bin Laden in
particular say if there is a link between the arrest of the
Algerians and bin Laden's Feb. 23, 1998, declaration of holy war
against Americans, it is unlikely to be driven by internal Algerian
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, parts of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, a loose group of
Islamic militants from Indonesia to Algeria, could be activated by
word of mouth after an order is given from bin Laden, a member of a
Saudi Arabian family that has made billions in construction
projects, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can assume there is a plan to attack Americans, either
abroad or in the United States, or both,'' said Boaz Ganor,
director of the International Policy Institute for
Counter-Terrorism in Israel and a former top adviser on terrorism
issues to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure the GIA (the Algerian Islamic group) would
target the United States, but I do think it's possible that
specific people in the GIA who have connections with bin Laden
could try to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's worldwide advisory for Americans living
or traveling abroad to exercise caution until after the New Year
was based on specific information that came from the arrests of 11
Jordanians, an Iraqi, and an Algerian who were plotting attacks on
Christian pilgrimage sites in Jordan, said officials there. The
group was funded by bin Laden's close associate, Omar Abu Omar,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, US intelligence specialists were first alerted
to a possible bin Laden terrorism plan targeted for Western Europe
when Turkish authorities said six members of a reported bin Laden
commando unit had infiltrated Turkey. The six, still at large, are
four Iranians and two Algerians. Two weeks ago, Turkey police
detained six Libyan men suspected of planning an attack on the
American Embassy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-American sentiment in the Middle East has its roots in
the Gulf War coalition against Iraq, the nine years of sanctions
against Iraq, and the perceived pro-Israeli bias in peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US government is hated,'' said Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in an interview Tuesday with CBS' ``The Early Show.'' ``All
the people in the world are against it, therefore, there is a
threat. I hope it will not happen in this new year. I have no
knowledge about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, in his 1998 statement urging holy war against
Americans that he and four other Islamic militant leaders signed,
claimed that America was eager to ``destroy Iraq'' and occupy the
holy Arabian peninsula with its troops.
</P>
<P>
   The statement then declared, ``The ruling to kill Americans and
their allies _ civilians and military _ is an individual duty for
every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials have linked bin Laden to the two East Africa US
embassy bombings last year that killed more than 200 people;
terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Sudan; and a group that
tried to bomb American servicemen in Yemen in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But in Vermont Tuesday, US Attorney Charles Tetzlaff said there
was no evidence linking the two arrested Algerians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical,'' said Ibish of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``I don't doubt that a wealthy man
can arrange things, even nasty things if he wants. But he sort of
has assigned this role to himself, in which he spends a lot of time
giving blood-curdling interviews. In the Arab world, the man is
widely regarded as a crank and a dangerous fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, which has posted a $5 million reward
for information leading to bin Laden's arrest, spokesman James B.
Foley tried to strike a balance in describing the nature of the
threat to Americans in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the American public that this is a yellow light.
It is not a red light,'' Foley said. ``We are urging Americans to
be vigilant and cautious as they travel, but we are not
recommending to Americans that they change their plans and that
they not travel overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Americans at home?
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is meeting do discuss the issue. The
FBI continues its investigations on the Algerians. Customs
officials have put an extra 300 guards on duty, and all their
border posts on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   And top officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright, General Henry H. Shelton, and CIA Director George Tenet,
met Monday at the White House. But after two hours of discussions,
they decided not to make public any of their drafted statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take this day by day,'' Foley said.

FED LEAVES RATES UNCHANGED, BUT HINTS IT MAY RAISE THEM IN
FEBRUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve on Tuesday voted to leave
interest rates unchanged, but warned that it might raise rates
early next year to head off inflation if the economy continues to
grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank stopped short of adopting a formal policy
signaling the likelihood of a future rate increase, saying that it
did not want to risk throwing the financiats off balance in
the weeks leading up to the Year 2000, given the possibility of
fallout from the associated computer software problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed's policy-setting committee issued a statement making
clear that it was only the potential for Y2K disruptions to the
markets and the economy that kept it from formally putting
investors on notice that a rate increase might come as soon as its
next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2. And the practical effect of the
statement was nearly the same in any case, emphasizing the Fed's
willingness to consider a rate increase if the economy continues to
run so hot that it generates inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed may formally be neutral, but you don't even have to
read between the lines to see that they're biased towards
tightening policy,'' said James Glassman, an economist at Chase
Manhattan in New York. ``A new chapter of Fed tightening is
certainly on the table for the February and March meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed almost never raises rates in the weeks before Christmas,
and given the added concerns over Year 2000 computer problems,
analysts had long ago concluded that the central bank would not
push rates up Tuesday. On Wall Street, investors read the Fed's
decision not to adopt a formal bias toward raising rates as good
news, sending stock prices modestly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.27, closing at
11,200.54. Bond prices fell, sending up interest rates. The yield
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 2 basis points, or
hundredths of a percent, to 6.46 percent, its highest level since
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is little evidence that inflation might be taking
root, despite economic growth this year of about 5 percent, a level
that economists once assumed would set off broad-based increases in
wages and prices, especially with unemployment as low as it is now
_ 4.1 percent in November.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The economy's remarkable performance has led to wholesale
re-evaluations among Fed officials and economists generally about
the relationship between growth and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe the economy is now capable of substantially
higher levels of noninflationary growth base their case on the huge
investments by American business in computers and other technology
and the associated pickup in the growth rate of productivity, or
the amount that a worker can produce in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But in raising its short-term federal funds target rate three
times this year to 5.5 percent _ and through its statement Tuesday
_ the Fed has stressed that even a more productive economy can bump
up against inflationary pressures that needed to be squelched
before they can endanger the long expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee ``remains concerned with the
possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to
exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking into
account the remarkable rise in productivity growth,'' the central
bank's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such trends,'' it continued, ``could foster inflationary
imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it was nonetheless maintaining its current
neutral policy stance to emphasize that its focus in coming weeks
``must be ensuring a smooth transition into the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   At its upcoming meeting in February, the statement said, ``the
committee will assess available information on the likely balance
of supply and demand, conditions in the financial markets and the
possible need for adjustment in the stance of policy to contain
inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the economy has retained its considerable
momentum as it heads toward the new year. Some of the robust growth
may come from companies' stockpiling goods and supplies as a
protective measure in case the economy is disrupted by widespread
computer problems starting Jan. 1. But most of it continues to stem
from strong consumer demand and a buoyant stock market, heavy
levels of business investment and a rebound in many foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many forecasters say the economy is likely to slow next year but
not right away and probably not until the Fed pushes the federal
funds rate up by at least half a percentage point, to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do expect a slowdown, but I don't think it will be
sufficient to ward off more Fed tightenings, and I don't think it
will be apparent in the first month of the year,'' said Marilyn
Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. ``We'll see
at least two more Fed tightenings with the potential for a third if
the economy does not slow.''
</P>
<P>
   As the prospects grow for a series of rate increases next year,
so does the likelihood that the Fed will become a political issue
in a presidential election year. But the White House reiterated its
support Tuesday for Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose term expires
in June. President Clinton is widely expected to nominate Greenspan
to a fourth four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes he has done a good job, has a lot of
respect for the job he's done and likes him personally, and when
we're ready to announce a decision, we'll announce a decision,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan and his colleagues are likely to face some
difficult decisions about how much leeway to grant the economy,
given the absence of inflation, the benefits of low unemployment
and robust job creation and the wealth being created by the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York, said the Fed might even consider a half-point rate increase
in February if domestic demand and the stock market remain strong.
The Fed has not raised rates by half a percentage point since
February 1995, at the end of a tightening cycle that saw the
central bank double the federal funds rate to 6 percent in the
course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems facing the Fed is that higher rates so far
have done little to restrain Wall Street, whose continuing rise is
seen by most economists as a key driver of consumer confidence and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also indications that even sectors of the economy
that traditionally have been most sensitive to rising rates, like
housing, have so far remained relatively robust. &QL;

 &HT;    Abernathy III convicted of theft, other charges
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It will be the new millennium before a judge decides
whether former state Sen. Ralph David Abernathy III will serve
anything from a maximum of 150 years in prison to a minimum of
probation for stealing state money with false expense reports.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 hours of deliberation, the second jury to try Abernathy
returned with a verdict Tuesday that found him guilty of 18 of the
28 counts against him _ 5 of theft by taking involving $5,700, 5 of
false swearing, 5 of violating his oath of office, 2 of forgery and
1 of influencing a witness.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no lone holdout, refusing to even consider
convicting an Abernathy, to cause a hung jury, which is what other
jury members said happened in his first trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy spent much of his time during the jury's deliberations
studying two Bibles and making notes from them. The verdict seemed
to come as no surprise to him or to his mother, who spent every
moment of both trials in the courtroom. When the judge finished
reading the verdict, Abernathy turned to his mother with a glum
smile. He, his mother, former state Rep. Hosea Williams and other
supporters formed a prayer circle, holding hands across the bar.
Abernathy remained silent while Williams and Mrs. Abernathy prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that not only Ralph but every one of us has fallen
short,'' she prayed. ``We pray, oh God, that this does not mar our
Christmas season.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy refused to speak with reporters. Attorney General
Thurbert Baker, accused by Abernathy's supporters of mounting a
vendetta against him, said ``it is always a sad day when any public
official violates his trust.''

   Williams, looking weak and ill from recent surgery but still
combative, complained that Abernathy ``would have been better off
if he'd been tried by the Ku Klux Klan.'' Abernathy, he insisted,
did nothing that other legislators don't do.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, a core member of the group that worked
with Ralph David Abernathy Sr. and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
during the 1960s, said he is ``deeply saddened'' and hopes the
conviction won't stand.
</P>
<P>
   He added, in a written statement, ''Even though Ralph felt that
he was simply behaving as others around him did, we cannot always
act like the Romans, even when we are in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that in three instances from 1994-1998 while he
was a member of the state Senate, Abernathy got aides or assistants
to sign vouchers saying they had received specific amounts of money
for services rendered, although in fact they had not. Then
Abernathy signed the vouchers _ which included an oath that the
information it contained was true and accurate _ turned them in to
the legislative fiscal office and was paid. But the aides who were
supposed to get the money got little or none of it.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, he obtained $1,200 to pay a telephone bill, of
which a maximum of $700 was paid.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth and most damning case, he signed the name of Zee
Bradford, his public relations consultant, to two vouchers for a
total of $2,700, never gave her a nickel of it, and then, when the
GBI began investigating his actions, was tape recorded in two
conversations begging, cajoling and bullying her to lie and say she
had signed the vouchers and received the money. She refused, and
testified for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Senior Superior Court Judge L.A. McConnell ordered a
pre-sentencing investigation by probation authorities and indicated
he would not decide on a sentence before mid-January. Asked what
kind of sentence he would seek, Baker said mildly that ``We think
all these felony counts are deserving of jail time.'' Assistant
Attorney General Stacey Hydrick, who prosecuted both trials,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tyrone Brooks charged that Baker is ``using the
Abernathy family as a political football.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy's career has been in a tailspin since 1994, when he
led East Point, Ga. police on a high-speed chase because, he said,
he was late for a speech before some elementary school children. He
drew a fine for that. Six months later, a female state employee
said Abernathy barged in on her and refused to leave while she was
inside a Capitol restroom.
</P>
<P>
   A GBI investigation is still ongoing into the interception of
the lunch-bound jury in September's trial by Mrs. Martin Luther
King Jr., members of her family and other civil rights luminaries.
Martin Jr. was the only member of the family to show up during this
trial, and he did not enter the courtroom while the jury was
present.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, customs authorities caught him coming into the
country at Hartsfield International Airport with marijuana in his
underwear. That cost him a $500 fine and a sanction from the
Senate. Last year, he lost his seat when his $400 qualifying check
bounced and the Democrats refused to put him on the ballot.

HOW SANTA GETS THE JOB DONE

   In order to deliver all those toys and presents on Christmas
Eve, Santa must travel at Mach 6,395, which is a pretty rapid clip
_ 1/145th the speed of light, to be exact. Or there's always the
possibility that he's discovered a ripple in the time-space
continuum known as a relativity cloud, in which he can go about his
work at a leisurely pace, even though nothing more than a blink of
the eye seems to pass for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the fascinating factoids served up alongside
the turkey _ itself a lesson in thermodynamics _ in ``The Science
of Christmas,'' a frequently fanciful, other times leaden, holiday
special that drolly applies scientific formulae and speculation to
explain some of the most vexing of yuletide legends. It's based on
the whimsical book of the same title by Roger Highfield, which
first cashed in on the holiday market last year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the star that drew the Wise Men to Bethlehem may
have been a rare conjunction of Jupiter and Venus that lit up the
night sky more than usual. Or: Reindeer need to be able to hit a
running speed of 120 miles per hour to achieve lift-off. And
parasites can indeed cause a reindeer's nose to become red _ which,
in fact, would lead to other reindeer ostracizing it and not
letting it in on any of their reindeer games.
</P>
<P>
   Other segments are significantly more mundane. Is there anyone
who has really wondered, for more than a second, how fake Christmas
trees or the tinsel draped upon them are manufactured, or whether
candy canes require a device developed by NASA to keep their
stripes from bleeding over? (OK, the NASA thing is kind of cool.)
The special is fairly evenly divided between engaging and humdrum
information; it's all pretty blissfully useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Science of Christmas'' is narrated by Daniel Stern, who
early on declares, rather vapidly, ``There is no holiday quite like
it.'' It's that kind of flat-footed exposition that keeps this
program from hitting 120 mph itself, let alone Mach 6,395. But,
give it points for actually having found a fairly fresh way to
approach the creakiest of genres, the Christmas special. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``The Science of Christmas.''  &QL; 
What: Holiday special whimsically applying scientific formulae to
Christmas myths. &QL; 
The stars: Narrated by Daniel Stern. &QL;

ADVERTISING:  PITCHING  TO WOMEN WATCHING PRO FOOTBALL GAMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES- NYT  
 (ATTN: Colo., Minn., Wis., Fla., Mass., N.J., Texas)   By COURTNEY KANE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After decades of televised professional football,
some advertisers are finally catching on that women watch the games
too.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers that include an airline, a credit card company and
even the National Football League itself have aimed more pitches at
women during the games. Some see it as an unconventional way to
reach their target audience, while others regard it as a unique
option to cut through the advertising clutter. Others are just
simply taking advantage of the increase in female viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the new efforts show marketers now realize
that women are not only a significant part of football's fan base,
but, more importantly, that they have buying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have been part of our audience for some time, but
they've clearly evolved from detached and less knowledgeable to far
more involved and connected,'' said Howard Handler, senior vice
president for marketing and fan development at NFL Properties in
New York, the league's in-house marketing unit.
</P>
<P>
   The league says more than 20 million female fans consider
themselves to be avid and approximately 45 million female fans in
general _ about 40 percent of the total 113 million viewers who
constitute the NFL's weekly television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a significant portion of the audience is female,
most ads during football games are dominated by marketers of
products that mainly appeal to men like shaving accessories, beer
and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a steady progression of more and more advertisers
finding many different segments of our audience to market to,''
Handler said. ``As more and more audiences become fragmented and
sponsors strive to find places where they can talk to an entire
family, you're going to see more and more of a broad range of
advertisers and sponsors associated with our games.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is partly responsible for some of the other marketers'
decisions to focus on women. As part of the league's own fan
development campaign, Handler said that the NFL had started sharing
more of its fan-base research and brand expertise with its
advertisers. ``Our partners were really astonished by this in some
ways,'' he said, adding that ``I think that we did a good job of
planting some seeds in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   A commercial from the NFL that is aimed at women, introduced
earlier this month, features the coming of age of the female
football fan. The humorous spot, which spans the decades from the
1960s until today, shows a couple watching football together;
gradually, the woman becomes more knowledgeable about the game than
the man. The commercial, the third installment of the NFL's ``Feel
the power'' fan development campaign, was a collaboration between
the advertising and design group at NFL Properties and Sally
Jenkins, an author who wrote the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines was one of the NFL's first sponsors to
recognize the league's female fan base. Last year, the airline
began a campaign, ``Must be football season,'' that featured women
as football fanatics in two of its four spots. This year, three of
four commercials will portray women as passionate fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting women in ads appeals to a group of people that are
often ignored in sports campaigns,'' said Melanie Jones, a
spokeswoman for Southwest in Dallas. ``These days, a lot of women
are really sports fans and they watch those games. And they're our
customers too and we wanted to reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   One commercial in the campaign, created by the GSD&AMP;M unit of
Omnicom Group in Austin, Texas, takes place in a gift shop. A woman
grabs a crystal vase, spikes it and does a victory dance. Another
spot features a woman standing in a movie theater line when a man
in front of her drops something and he bends over to pick it up:
she assumes a quarterback's stance behind him and starts shouting
signals.
</P>
<P>
   Visa USA has run an ad in response to the NFL research. The Visa
spot, created by BBDO New York, another unit of Omnicom, features a
pregnant woman and husband in a paint store seeking a very specific
shade of orange _ presumably for a nursery. But the woman is shown
at a Denver Broncos game, her face painted orange and blue _ the
team's colors _ cheering heartily. The spot ends with the tagline,
``Visa. Everywhere NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Silver, senior vice president for advertising and
brand management at Visa in Foster City, Calif., said developing
the commercial was a ``very easy step'' after seeing the NFL's
research.
</P>
<P>
   For Campbell Soup Co.'s Chunky Soup brand, an ad created by
Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York, features Terrell Davis, the
Broncos running back, along with an actress portraying his mother.
</P>
<P>
   John Faulkner, a spokesman for Campbell in Camden, N.J., said:
``We certainly recognize that the NFL is an environment where both
men and women consumers enjoy watching the NFL games. While Chunky
is primarily thought of as a men's soup, the reality is that a lot
of women eat Chunky as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best evidence of how much appeal football has to
women and the marketers who court them is Super Bowl XXXIV on Jan.
30, where one longstanding NFL sponsor and two brand-new ones are
willing to pay enormous rates to broadcast spots that pitch to the
female fan. A commercial for the Miller Brewing unit of Philip
Morris Cos., created by Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, is part
of the Miller Lite campaign in which two celebrities debate what
makes Miller Lite taste great. This spot features Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, the model, and Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian, debating
the greatest Super Bowl teams of all time. Kimmel acts as if he is
a football expert but consistently fumbles on the nicknames of
classic teams and Ms. Romijn-Stamos corrects him.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bussen, a spokesman for Miller in Milwaukee, said the ad
supported the Miller Lite Super Bowl promotion in which consumers
select the greatest Super Bowl team of all time. He said the
company's objective was to appeal to both sexes.

 NEW YORK: both sexes. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oxygen Media in New York, a World Wide Web site and cable TV
network aimed at women, is hoping to draw attention with its first
national television commercial during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Oxygen spot, created by Mullen Advertising in
Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos., were not disclosed. But Linda Ong, senior vice president for
marketing at Oxygen said that ``We want to claim the territory,
crash the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous opportunity,'' she added. ``It's the largest
viewing audience of women on television. Women have been there all
along, watching with families, friends, boyfriends, husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana Products in Bradenton, Fla., which traditionally
advertises during female-oriented programming, is also advertising
during the Super Bowl for the first time to introduce a new
campaign that stresses the nutritional benefits of orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl has transcended from being a sporting event to
a real social event,'' Roger Berdusco, senior vice president for
marketing at Tropicana, a division of PepsiCo, said. ``We're
reaching a very broad audience in one fell swoop.'' Details of the
commercial, created by the New York office of the FCB Worldwide
unit of True North Communications, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The league clearly hopes more advertisers follow this trend.
``What we believe,'' Handler of the NFL said, ``is that Visa,
Southwest, Miller and Campbell are going to open up a lot of other
people's eyes to see that certainly the NFL is a place to look for
men _ but women are hearing and responding to these messages.''

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Sean Payton, in stocking feet and a gray
Giants sweatsuit, charged into the darkened room excited and
talking fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one for you,'' said Payton, the Giants' assistant
coach who now calls the team's plays. ``We'll call it Tiki
Special.''
</P>
<P>
   It was early last week in a conference room beneath the Giants
Stadium grandstand and Payton, who had interrupted a meeting of
Giants' defensive coaches, hastily began to sketch small black
circles on a white plastic board.
</P>
<P>
   To the whirl of a film projector and the crunching of sunflower
seeds, he scribbled slashing lines, dashes and arrows _ a football
hieroglyphic _ until every coach in the room easily understood.
</P>
<P>
   It was a new, trick play for the Giants' game against the St.
Louis Rams last Sunday _ a faked handoff to running back Tiki
Barber, who would amble away from the flow of the play as if a
decoy, until the last moment, when quarterback Kerry Collins would
throw back to him streaking up the left sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll buy that,'' said John Fox, the defensive coordinator
whose job it is to shoot holes in any new play.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Payton's diagram came to life as Barber, at a
pivotal juncture of the third quarter, caught a 22-yard pass to the
Rams 2-yard line. The Rams had been duped; Tiki Special had worked.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of hundreds of plays the Giants coaches devised
in a painstaking week of preparation for what turned out to be a
discouraging 31-10 loss to the Rams. The play's inception accounted
for just 10 minutes out of seven days of intensive plotting to play
three hours of football.
</P>
<P>
   To follow an NFL coach from Monday to Sunday is to witness a
numbing succession of meetings, statistical analysis, critiquing of
video tape, along with lengthy after-dinner skull sessions when the
sche plays and defenses are debated and ultimately agreed
upon.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exercise removed from anything athletic, a chess match
of anticipated moves on a gridiron with 300-pound game pieces. The
skill prized above all is the art of deception, as opponents'
tendencies are examined and their weaknesses weighed. The goal is
to play your game with your players but to look completely
different doing it.
</P>
<P>
   When it is done, an average game plan, bound neatly in a blue
spiral notebook with plays and explanations produced by computer,
is more than 125 pages thick.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just for the offense. The defensive game plan is
another 100 pages.
</P>
<P>
   All this work is done to try to control the outcome of a game
played with an oblong ball pointed at both ends that takes wildly
unpredictable bounces. And as the Giants would soon find out last
Sunday, all their planning can be undone by the simplest misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays after Barber's catch, on another new play designed
specifically for the goal line situation the Giants were in, guard
Ron Stone, the team's best lineman, stepped on the foot of Collins
as the play began, tripping him.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant to be a pass to fullback Greg Comella, a play the
Giants discovered while dissecting the video tape of a Rams game
from six weeks ago. In a meeting room last week, the Giants'
offensive coaches had run the tape of the play, a Lions touchdown
against the Rams, back and forth 16 times to be sure they had
captured every nuance.
</P>
<P>
   This new play would have worked, too. Comella was breaking open
in the end zone as Collins stumbled to the ground, where he was
tackled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God,'' a coach yelled into Fassel's sideline headset as
other coaches added more saucy comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up,'' Fassel yelled. ``Next play. Kick the field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Which the Giants did. But instead of cutting a 10-0 Rams lead by
7 points, the Giants never threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the realism of this job just hits you,'' Fassel
would say in his office the day after the game, laughing ruefully.
``It's the right situation, right defense, right call and it
doesn't matter because somebody steps on the quarterback's foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a week earlier, in the midst of the weekly 17-hour
strategy marathon known as game plan Tuesday _ the day when NFL
coaches design the offensive and defensive attack for that week's
opponent _ Fassel paused to relate a conversation he once had with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kitty said to me, `What are you doing there all day and
night?' `` Fassel said. ``And I explained the whole day down to
every last detail. I said: `Amazing, isn't it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Told there might be other words for the seemingly endless work
hours in the average week of a NFL coach, Fassel snickered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``Stupid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' coaching staff arrives each weekday before sunrise,
never later than 6:30 a.m., and when they arrive on Monday morning
_ sometimes less than 12 hours after a big victory or defeat _
there are 25 to 30 video tapes of the next opponent set in a row
neatly across their desks.
</P>
<P>
   At the computer screen on an adjacent credenza, with a few
clicks of a mouse, they can also view virtually any play the
opponent has run during the season _ and they can find it easily
because the plays are categorized by down and distance, by quarter,
even by what players, or groups of players are on the field. If
they see a play that intrigues them or might be useful to another
coach, they can send it to him via the fiber optic cables
connecting the offices.
</P>
<P>
   But first, they would give the play a name, in code, because
everything inside a football office is in code. A play that begins
with the number 12 means a one-back formation with two tight ends.
A play beginning with 21 is the inverse, since the first number
refers to the number of backs on the field and the second the
number of tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the name of the play can have seven different terms,
something like 10 Split Load Left Dig Zany Oscar Eagle 44. Late
last Tuesday, near 11 p.m. of a workday that began 17 hours
earlier, the offensive coaches spent four minutes discussing where
to insert the word ``shift'' in the terminology of a new play.
</P>
<P>
   It does matter. The 11 players on the field are supposed to move
in unison, and each code word in the play's name gives them
complicated rules to follow should the defensive formation change,
which is likely, or should the defense blitz, which is common. If
everybody follows the rules together, every play is technically a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, listening to the coaches debates in their meetings is
like trying to eavesdrop on a conversation in a foreign land where
you don't speak the language.
</P>
<P>
   If a coach says a receiver is going to ``bus ticket,'' it means
he's taking off on a deep pass route. If a lineman ``pops,'' he's
pulling wide of the formation. If a defender ``dogs,'' he's coming
after the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And they never refer to the players by the positions football
fans know and recognize. The quarterback is the ``q,'' the wide
receivers are ``x'' and ``y,'' and the linebackers have four names
based on where they line up: Will, Mike, Sam and Buck.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all high-tech. On Tuesday morning last week, Fassel
was having his first cup of coffee just past 6 a.m. when offensive
line coach Jim McNally bolted into the room. He wanted to show the
head coach a new blocking scheme he had designed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Soon McNally was aligning two blue swivel chairs to mimic
defensive linemen, a bookcase was a defensive end, the couch the
other end. The red, holiday Pachysandra on Fassel's desk was
apparently out of play.
</P>
<P>
   But McNally made his point and Fassel agreed that's how the
guard should line up against that defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel smiled as McNally left the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody does this unless they love it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that is the same about the Giants' offensive and
defensive meeting rooms, which are no more than 20 feet apart, is
that each has a bottle of Tabasco sauce and a bottle of
Worcestershire sauce in the middle of the main conference table.
There is apparently agreement on the condiments needed when dinner

</P>
<P>
   The offensive room is bright, with coaches continually jumping
up to draw prospective plays or formation adjustments on the white
plastic board that's replaced the conventional black chalk board
from Knute Rockne's day. Sometimes two or three coaches will be
diagramming the same play, drawing lines and circles as they
dispute certain details until the whole board becomes an
indecipherable mess resembling a transit system map.
</P>
<P>
   They wipe if off with an eraser and start over.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive room, meanwhile, is usually dark because the
coaches are watching video tape. They are constantly searching for
clues, ways the upcoming opponent might tip off what play they plan
to run, or what part of the field they plan to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes though, the coaches fly by the seat of their pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, they're going to score points so we're going to
have to take some chances,'' Fassel said Wednesday evening in the
third-down meeting.
</P>
<P>
   So two long pass plays were included as surprises for a third
down-and-short situation. Three new plays for the fleet wide
receiver Brian Alford were added to the package. After weeks of
practicing a reverse option pass by receiver Amani Toomer, the
Giants decided to try it.
</P>
<P>
   (When run in the game, it succeeds in getting a pass
interference penalty on the Rams, but a 31-yard gain is nullified
by a Giants penalty.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I get out of here, sit in my backyard with a cigar
and think about what we ought to try,'' Fassel said of the game
plan later in the week. ``You can't let these four walls narrow
your thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   When John Fox went home two Fridays ago _ on his only night off
in the week _ he found himself in his living room watching football
tapes for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was watching an entire season of youth football, played by
sons, Cody, 7, and Mark, 9. Their games were Tuesday nights when
Fox is inside Giants Stadium. His wife, Robin, taped the games.
John watched them all in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see them running around,'' Fox said. ``Usually
I only see them asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night, the Fox family, which includes another son,
Matt, went out to dinner with Payton and his wife, Beth, and
daughter, Meghan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean and I will get away with talking a little shop at
dinner,'' Fox said. ``We'll compare notes on the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the things Fox and the other coaches detected in their
diligent study of the Rams: a minute tick in the stance of the Rams
left tackle Orlando Pace.
</P>
<P>
   When Pace lined up with his left foot in back of his right foot,
with the heel slightly raised off the ground, the Rams were going
to pass. When Pace's left heel was touching the ground, the Rams
ran the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking for details in that dark room,'' Fox said. ``It
doesn't hit you all at once. You go, `Hey, look at that. Look at
his heel.' &UR; '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were hoping to get an edge with their stealthy
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Pace's stance was a fairly accurate predictor, until he
was ejected from the game for a late hit early in the second
quarter. Since Pace hadn't missed a game, the Giants knew little
about his replacement, a converted center, Ryan Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   As Pace left the field, departing with him was any advantage to
the hours of preparation for playing against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you wonder if we should just line up and play,''
Fassel said in his office Monday afternoon, a day after all the
best-laid, highly-intricate plans  &UR; _ &LR;  including many that worked
 &UR; _ &LR;  resulted in a 21-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, it ain't going to matter. But you have to put your
players in the best position to win and hope it helps them execute.
As coaches, this is what we do. &UR;  &LR; And in a little while, I'll start
watching tape of the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't think about last week again,'' Fassel said. ``I've got
a week now to figure out how to beat Minnesota.''

DEADLY ORE WAS SHIPPED AROUND U.S., CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The asbestos-tainted ore that killed and sickened hundreds of
miners and their families in Libby, Mont., didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of pounds of the ore were shipped from a mine near
Libby to at least 60 processing plants throughout the United States
and Canada, causing workers at many of those plants to become ill
and die, a Post-Intelligencer investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
   As they did with the miners, the W.R. Grace Co. and the earlier
owners of the vermiculite mine on Zonolite Mountain kept
information about the lethal nature of the tremolite asbestos
fibers from the men expanding and processing the brownish-pink
vermiculite into insulation, potting soil, fireproofing, cement
mixtures and dozens of other products.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers and family members killed by asbestosis,
lung cancer and mesothelioma at these vermiculite plants will
probably never be known, because of the transient nature of the
work force and because in many cases, as in Libby, the deaths were
attributed to a litany of other diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grace had a difficult time pinning down the number of
employees affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among expansion-plant employees, the high employee turnover
and a variety of past exposures make conclusions difficult,'' says
a May 1977 internal report on tremolite in vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   However, one fact in that Grace report did offer an alarming
indication of the possible scope of the danger:
</P>
<P>
   ``Among 14 employees with 10 or more years of service in
expanding plants which have used Libby ore, 28 percent exhibited
asbestosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers and their families never suspected that
asbestos was making them sick, because they were not told there was
asbestos in the vermiculite ore they worked with.
</P>
<P>
   A P-I investigation published last month documented the
devastation to miners and their families in Libby, a small
northwestern Montana town. The stories showed that Grace, the
Zonolite Co. before it and government regulators ignored the signs
of widespread asbestos contamination that doctors and health
officials say will be killing people for many years to come. The
mine was open from 1924 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enormity of the atrocities committed by Grace on the
citizens of Libby is too great to fathom,'' said Donald Judge, the
head of the Montana AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we're just now discovering, it not only happened to the
citizens of Libby, but dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of
workers throughout the nation are also dead or dying because no one
told them about the danger they were breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge, who earlier this month apologized before an emotional,
packed town meeting for the union's failure to do enough to protect
Libby's miners, said Grace could have protected its workers without
major effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``By simply telling the workers what they were handling and then
taking appropriate safety measures, it wouldn't have happened,''
Judge said. ``It didn't have to happen. The cover-up perpetrated by
Grace is not only immoral, but should be criminal, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's vice president of corporate communication declined
requests to answer questions for this story. In a letter responding
to the P-I's detailed request, William Corcoran said that Grace
personnel were too busy ``helping the people of Libby'' to address
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one left''
</P>
<P>
   Information gleaned from worker compensation offices, health
departments, death certificates, government archives and thousands
of court documents shows that workers at many of Grace's Zonolite
processing plants died or became ill from exposure to asbestos
contained in the Libby ore, or from asbestos added to the products
they were making.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of company documents, letters, memos and reports
collected by the P-I show that the Zonolite Co. and Grace, which
bought the mine from Zonolite in 1963, knew that workers were at
risk. Workers and managers at the expansion plants say they weren't
told.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never were told a thing about that ore being dangerous or
having asbestos in it. Nobody never told me nothing about this
stuff being able to kill you,'' said Arland Blanton, a plant
manager and superintendent of the vermiculite plant in North Little
Rock, Ark., from 1951 until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he knew the ore from Libby was dangerous,
Blanton's normally strong voice dropped to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about the only one left,'' the 82-year-old man said.
``Most of the rest of them are dead. The asbestos got them. All of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe the dust from that vermiculite. It was so
thick that you couldn't see your hands at times,'' Blanton said.
``Had a boy that worked for me that lived in a house nearby and he
used to say that he would have to shake his sheets out every
morning to get the dust off.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them, Zonolite and Grace, just said there was nothing
in that dust that can hurt you. There's a lot of people dead today
who would still be alive if we were told the truth about that
ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton says he does not know how many Little Rock workers were
exposed to the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually had about a dozen workers a day, maybe up to 30
when we ran three shifts,'' he said. ``A whole bunch of men moved
through there over the years. I wonder how many of them are still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Grace's managers criticized the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good company,'' said Courtland Lowe, a former Grace
regional manager in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace did everything they could to comply with all the laws
and regulations at the time,'' Lowe said, declining to discuss it
further.
</P>
<P>
   The company provided the P-I with a list of 51 plants the
company either owned or contracted with to process the vermiculite
ore. Several independent firms that processed the raw ore were
identified from court documents, and former Grace managers say
there were dozens of other such high-volume customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an old gypsum plant in Seattle received large
amounts of Zonolite, but like so many others, does not appear on
Grace's list. At least 59 plants in 29 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and four provinces of Canada are known to
have processed Zonolite ore from Libby.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the ore shipped to the expansion plants, usually
about 300 million pounds a year, came from Libby. A much smaller
percentage came from Grace's mine near Enoree, S.C., which is still
in operation. Grace officials say there is little or no tremolite
in the ore from the Enoree mine.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of most of the expansion plants was a furnace or oven,
where the vermiculite ore was baked at about 2,000 degrees. The
microscopic amount of water between the layers of the vermiculite
boils and expands or exfoliates each piece of ore into a puff 12 to
15 times larger.
</P>
<P>
   The material was then bagged and sold as roof or wall insulation
or soil expander or mixed with clay, gypsum, commercial asbestos
and pigments to produce fireproofing and various construction
products. They also made a product called Verxite, an ingredient
for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never told the workers''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sheeran worked for Grace for 22 years. He began as a
salesman in the Dearborn, Mich., plant and wound up in 1991 as
sales manger for the Dallas operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Grace's vermiculite products sold like mad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of bags of that stuff from Libby was sold in Michigan
as attic fill insulation,'' he recalled. ``They couldn't get it
fast enough. Most of the homes in Flint are filled with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he may have liked selling the products, he had little
positive to say about the management.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never told the workers the vermiculite was hazardous, or
even the pure asbestos they were adding to some products, never
said a word, absolutely not,'' Sheeran said. ``It was purely
economics. It would have cost them money to make the operation
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas plant, he said, was in an area called Little Mexico
and bordered a large black neighborhood. Most of the workers were
transient blacks or Hispanics who crossed the border to work,
Sheeran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grace management has had a stonewall attitude all their
lives and they don't think much of little people,'' Sheeran said.
``The way they treated their workers was a huge injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheeran recalled that at one point, the Libby plant started
shipping the raw ore to Dallas with a coating of soybean oil, to
avoid the railroad having to put skull and crossbones on the bulk
cars. ``It all smelled like french fries when they expanded it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Junker was the treasurer and superintendent of the Dallas
operation where Sheeran worked. In court documents filed in 1991,
he said that he had discussions with Grace about asbestos, ``but we
didn't discuss it with the men that worked in it'' because Junker
didn't want to ``get them all shook up about maybe nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy says you get asbestosis from asbestos, but that
doesn't necessarily mean you do,'' he said. ``I didn't want to
cause a lot of uproar because nothing was official. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go out to a couple of black men on the line and tell
them that they're going to die tomorrow from asbestos breathing and
expect them to even come into the plant tomorrow. You just don't do
it,'' Junker said in a deposition taken in a civil suit against his
company.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for Zonolite and Grace for 31 years. He began as a
bookkeeper for Zonolite in Chicago and in San Antonio and wound up
running the Texas Vermiculite Co.
</P>
<P>
   Junker had equally strong views about a company's need to warn
consumers about a potentially dangerous product.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the public about a potential hazard _ that's what this
is, a potential hazard _ is kind of asinine,'' the plant
superintendent said in his deposition. He added, ``It's bad for
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he mourned the day in 1973 Grace managers ordered the
company to stop marketing products containing added asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had a good thing until they said it was not,''
Junker said. ``It broke all of our hearts because it cut profits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious health hazard''
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents show that the company knew there was a
significant health hazard to the workers handling the ore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, R.M. Vining, the head of the company's construction
products division, wrote a detailed report on vermiculite to the
company's president, Peter Grace.
</P>
<P>
   A major program was needed to ``eliminate a serious health
hazard caused by the presence of vermiculite and asbestos dust in
the mill and expansion plants,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust problem is particularly serious since the vermiculite
ore from Libby contains tremolite asbestos. This material is
difficult to separate from the vermiculite in the mill and is
usually part of the rock remaining in the concentrate when shipped.
Tremolite asbestos is a definite health hazard at both the Libby
operation and at the expansion plants using the ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet documents show that managers from plants using Zonolite as
far away as Australia and Winnipeg were told there was nothing
harmful in the ore. Grace frequently responded by talking about
``nuisance dust.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, seven years after Vining's memo to Peter Grace, the
company told the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration that tremolite was not hazardous and did not cause
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Health questions had surfaced in the 1960s from private
companies licensed by Grace to use the vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson Insulation in Great Falls, Mont., used ore from Libby
for more than a half century, from the early 1930s through 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The ore would arrive in 40-foot-long boxcars, each containing 50
tons of vermiculite. As the demand increased, 100-ton cars were
added. About 2,000 tons a year was delivered to the small plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take two men a day to unload and it was extremely
dusty,'' Floyd Gebert, the plant's general manager, said in court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always dust around vermiculite, whether it's expanded
or unexpanded.''
</P>
<P>
   While the workers may not have known what they were handling,
Gebert said he knew there was asbestos in the vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was asbestos in the mountain and they were trying
to mine it and sell it,'' he recalled, admitting that he was
puzzled about the hazard labels on the box cars hauling the ore to
Robinson's plant in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sign on the boxcars warning the ore may contain
asbestos,'' Gebert said. ``You know, I never saw a sign on any of
the cars that came to Great Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebert said the first official notice of dangers of asbestos
from Grace was in January 1973. He was told by his doctors in the
early 1980s that he had asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the small work force at the Great Falls plant, four have
died of asbestos-related diseases and four others currently have
the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At least four former employees of the Burlington Northern
railroad who say they handled the ore from Libby have become ill
with asbestosis. Another died last year of mesothelioma, said two
lawyers in Dallas and Houston who are representing the former
railroad workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just dropped the ball''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, one of Grace's largest customers, The Scotts Co.,
makers of potting soil and lawn products, documented health
problems among its workers using the vermiculite ore from Libby.
Severe respiratory problems among 12 workers at the Scotts plant in
Marysville, Ohio, led to an investigation by the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health to study the impact of
tremolite. During the 1960s and '70s, Scotts often received as much
as 25 percent of the vermiculite produced by the Libby mine.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Bierman, vice president for corporate relations for The
Scotts Co., said, ``We don't use that product any more.'' Bierman
added that he had no other information about the ore and workers'
health because it all occurred before he started working for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   While the NIOSH study documented the hazards from the tremolite,
the federal government agency did nothing to inform workers using
the material of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Robbins, who headed NIOSH during this period, says
his agency made a mistake not informing the Libby workers and those
at Grace's expansion plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mindset among some in the agency that their
responsibility was just to publish their finding,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working very hard to change that philosophy to let the
workers know what risks they were facing. When it came to this
study on vermiculite, we just dropped the ball,'' said Robbins, who
was fired by President Reagan early in Reagan's presidency because
of his zealous and vocal stance on worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Grace's answer to those who questioned the safety of
their vermiculite ore was that it was only ``nuisance dust'' and
presented no other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases the company stalled in even addressing the
dust problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in 1971, 20 of the expansion plants were in
violation of pollution control laws in their respective states,
according to a Grace internal document.
</P>
<P>
   In a September 1971 memo, Grace's Construction Products Division
said it could not afford to fix all the plants: ``They plan to
tackle them singly, as they are forced to comply, and buy as much
time as possible,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents present a puzzling picture of what the company
told their plant managers when it came to keeping their operations
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is safe to say that I have procrastinated on answering this
notice of violation,'' F.W. Easton of the Zonolite plant in
Weedsport, N.Y., wrote in November 1971 to his superiors about a
pollution violation from the New York state investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1971, the operator of a California Zonolite plant in
the San Francisco Bay Area told headquarters he was nervous when
pollution inspectors questioned him on how much 4 Zonolite ore _ a
particularly dusty grade _ they were processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our ``friendly inspector'' will be by frequently for
the next few weeks'' he wrote, and added that the plant will be
``getting as much 4 out at night as we can.'' When the inspector
wouldn't be around.
</P>
<P>
   Questions from Canada
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. health and environmental agencies largely ignored the
problem, the Canadian government was questioning the health hazards
from the Libby ore as early as 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents show that between 15 million and 40 million
pounds of ore was shipped from Montana to contract plants in Canada
each year. About 8 million pounds usually went to Europe and the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the health department in the Canadian province of
Alberta raised concerns about the content of the heavy quantities
of vermiculite dust coming from a Grace-licensed plant in Calgary
using the ore from Libby. They reported that in examinations of
nine workers, seven had breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This number of men with breathing abnormalities is most
unusual and puzzling,'' wrote Dr. H. Siemons, director of Alberta's
division of industrial health, who asked Grace if there were any
other similar reports from other Western Canadian plants expanding
vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, investigators from the same department found
asbestos in the dust, but their report was discounted by Grace's
local management.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in December 1968, N.F. Bushell, Grace's
Zonolite manger in Vancouver, wrote headquarters about a worker in
their Winnipeg plant that had asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is asbestos in the ore we receive from Libby. I'm afraid
that we may still be exposing our employees to an unnecessary
health hazard,'' Bushell wrote and asked if the company had
measured the amount of asbestos in the air where the Zonolite was
bagged. If not, he asked, when was Grace going to do so?
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Grace, he urged the company to test for
asbestos. ``Get someone on this subject before we get closed down
or slapped with some pretty large claims from employees or their
heirs. It won't take many more biopsy reports before we get
fingered,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another early warning
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Dr. W.E. Park of the Minneapolis City Health Department
voiced concerns about the death of a worker at a Minnesota
vermiculite plant.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote to C.A. Pratt, the head of Western Mineral Products in
Minneapolis, saying the death of a worker ``who had long exposure
to vermiculite dust has renewed our interest in the importance of
vermiculite dust in the causation of lung disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked for specific information about asbestos in the
vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Documents show that Pratt had been concerned about the
contamination for years.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1961, he wrote to Earl Lovick, the manager of the
Libby mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an effective improvement can be made at the mine, in
reducing the asbestos dust, this will of course benefit every plant
that receives the ore and will minimize the hazards to hundreds of
employees in the various plants,'' Pratt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Moody, a Little Rock lawyer who has handled the lawsuits
of dozens of workers at Grace expansion plants, said, ``Grace had
no interest in protecting their workers. None. The documents prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon after Grace took over they started giving annual
physicals and X-rays to these workers,'' Moody said. ``Not one, and
I've handled almost 50 cases, has ever been given a report from
Grace on what the X-rays, breathing function tests, indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they knew they were sick, they never told them a
word.''

 &HT;    Bowl brings together pair from past

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ East Carolina's Steve Logan and Texas Christian's
Dennis Franchione have known each other for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   As small college coaches in Kansas, Franchione often came by to
recruit Logan's junior college talent.
</P>
<P>
   But the duo didn't speak to each other for a long time. The
reason was simple enough _ both are from the Midwest and while
Franchione stayed there and in the southwestern part of the U.S. as
a coach, Logan came to the East Coast 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been on the other end of the world,'' Logan said. ``It's
just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   They renewed acquaintances earlier this week when they arrived
for the inaugural Mobile Alabama Bowl. Tonight, for the first time,
they send teams against each other when Logan's East Carolina
Pirates meet Franchione's Texas Christian Horned Frogs in
Ladd-Peebles Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has done a fine job, everywhere he's been,'' Logan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two remember a pretty good relationship when they were
working in Kansas in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For Logan, this match-up against his friend will be a far
different day on the sideline as compared to his last. In that, the
Pirates beat N.C. State 23-6 to finish the regular season _ and
finish the head coaching tenure of a head coach, Mike O'Cain, for
whom he had a good deal of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, I want to win every game that I coach, but
two years ago when Mike O'Cain won the football game, I had a great
deal of joy for him because I knew they weren't going to fire him
that day,'' Logan said of a season-ending 1997 loss at N.C. State.
``The same thing, you flip it two years later, the incident that
happened out here, again, the empathy and compassion I had for him
. . . I just had a bad, bad feeling about what could happen and, of
course, it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in their right mind would take any joy in that.
Somebody that is of a sick mind would probably have a good time
with that. That is not where I want to live and it isn't where I
live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan and Franchione trace their relationship back to 1981.
Logan was the head coach at Hutchinson (Kan.) Junior College in
1981-82, the same two years Franchione was at Southwestern (Kan.)
College. It was the first head coaching stops for both _ each of
whom had started in the high school ranks and had a brief stint at
a major Division I program.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern was one of more than a half a dozen
church-affiliated, NAIA Division II programs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year after the real-deal recruiting had been over with,
he would always stop by and see what we had,'' Logan said.
``Kansas, K-State, Nebraska _ all those people would come in and
see what we had, and whatever was left, all those church schools
would come by and see if they could get a player or two.''
</P>
<P>
   And he usually found something he liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always looking for the diamonds in the rough, the ones
bigger schools looked at and didn't find something they liked,''
Franchione said. ``You're always looking for players that are
near-misses.''
</P>
<P>
   After Franchione left Southwestern for Tennessee Tech as
offensive coordinator in 1983-84, he had a chance to return to his
alma mater _ NAIA Division I perennial national title contender
Pittsburg State (Kan.). He hinged on making the move, but finally
did and spent 1985-89 coaching the team to five conference titles
and three national semifinal-round appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Pittsburg State, in some ways, was a tough decision. But
a conversation with a friend convinced him his time at Pittsburg
State had lasted long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point, we had been there five years, and sometimes
you take winning for granted,'' Franchione said. ``I'll never
forget. We had been in the national playoffs, ranked number one
twice, and the year before my last year in June, I had someone come
up and ask me who I thought we'd play in the playoffs. And we
hadn't won a game yet. And that stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the '89 season, Southwest Texas State had posted five
straight losing seasons and was in need of a head coach. Franchione
was the man pegged for the job. Two years later, New Mexico was
searching, then finding Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends in coaching said you don't want to go there, it's a
deathbed,'' Franchione said. ``There were things there that
intrigued me and I did it. They had 11 straight losing seasons, and
the year before I got there, they lost 94-17 (to a Jim
Sweeney-coached Fresno State team) and 60-7 (to a Jim
Wacker-coached TCU team).
</P>
<P>
   ``The next year, my first year at New Mexico, our first game was
TCU and (new head coach) Pat Sullivan and we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lobos went on to climb into a bowl game by Franchione's
sixth, and final, season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that Dennis has always done, he's always been an
option coach,'' Logan said. ``He's always been real creative with
the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Mexico hadn't won in a million years, and he went out
there and built a program _ 3-8, 6-5, 5-7, 4-7, 6-5, 9-4. Now, TCU,
they've been down. They were 1-10 when he got in there. He took
them to a 6-5 first year and beat Southern Cal in a bowl game with
the option. Southern Cal, they were clueless with superior athletes
and lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, going through the ranks to the top rungs of Division
I-A means head coaching stops, as it was with Franchione. For
others, it means going through jobs as an assistant, as it was with
Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione assures he could have remained at Southwestern for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be the head coach, to be in charge _ I liked
that,'' Franchione said. ``I was not hung up on any particular
level I was at. Some coaches would rather be on the D-I level, but
that didn't matter to me. I enjoyed coaching whether there were
5,000 people in the stands or 55,000. I'm just a ball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way was good for me, and I had some good years. I was
fortunate. I had the opportunity to move up from time to time, and
if I had not have moved up, I don't think it would have been that
big of a deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference, of course, is compensation and exposure.
There was little of either at Pittsburg State despite the success,
and there's plenty coming at TCU. The pay range is about 10-fold _
somewhere between $75,000 and $80,000 to the more than $700,000 he
earns with the Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been real caught up in the money,'' Franchione
said. ``I'm always telling people I wouldn't want to be two things
_ real rich and real poor. I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy
what I have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my motivator has always been opportunity. To do something
that hasn't been done in a while. To see that there are people
committed to doing those things well. That's far exceeded my
excitement level about a job more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan is much the same.
</P>
<P>
   He embraced the challenge of building a program _ and succeeded.
His eight-year tenure is the longest of any ECU coach in 30 years,
and his 51 wins are the most in school history.
</P>
<P>
   But he rarely gets wrapped up in the match-up of coaches. He'll
enjoy this one, mind you, but it won't cloud his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to go out there and focus on what we can do
well, and what are we going to do for us,'' Logan said. ``We coach
that way all week long. I'm concerned somewhat about Texas
Christian's lead option, but I'm more concerned about us
enthusiastically getting to the ball, taking care of the lead
option scheme with a lot of hustle and enthusiasm.''

CANCER CLAIMS MAN'S LIFE 36 YEARS AFTER HAULING VERMICULITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to spend an entire career shoveling asbestos for
it to kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Joireman was 21 and trying to get money for college. He
worked as a laborer hauling tons of tremolite-laced vermiculite ore
from the boxcars to the ovens at the Western Vermiculite Co., a
Zonolite processing plant on Ash and Maxwell streets in Spokane.
Thirty-six years later, the 23 months he spent on the dusty job
killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students from four middle schools in Portland could
not spell mesothelioma, the asbestos-induced disease that killed
their favorite teacher in 1995. Yet, they mourned his death.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he died, he wrote his mother:
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept my illness from you to spare you needless suffering.
There is nothing you can do to help me, so I just felt it was not
to hurt you any sooner than need be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief doctor for oncology told me very bluntly that I
can't think about all the years I won't get!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He described an incurable type of cancer that I got from
asbestos. It goes clear back to when I worked at Zonolite
Insulation. It can lay quiet for between 30 to 40 years before it
comes active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the bad luck I've ever had, this one is the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, Joireman's health was excellent. He and
his wife, Doris, bowled, bicycled and played basketball. But in
late 1994 he began noticing a fullness in his abdomen, swelling and
shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   In January of 1995, a doctor found cancer cells and Lee began
chemotherapy. Every third week, he would spend at least three days
in the hospital to receive the therapy. The price was high. He
faced months of weight loss, vomiting and pain. The chemotherapy
did not stop the spread of the cancer. Other asbestosis-generated
symptoms developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's no cure, only some delay,'' he wrote his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   His wife quit her job as an elementary school teacher's
assistant to help her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Joireman, one of Lee's three brothers, says he worried
when his brother worked for Zonolite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the plant and I couldn't believe the amount of dust
that was pouring out of the vermiculite,'' Arnie says. ``Lee was
just covered in it. Even without the asbestos in it, it had to be
hazardous. But it did have asbestos in it and no one ever told Lee
or the other workers about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the way they did business,'' he adds. ``They didn't
want to spend the money to protect the workers from the asbestos,
so they said nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace settled a wrongful-death suit with the Joireman family
last year. The amount of the settlement was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Another brother, Jerold, who worked at the plant during the
summers of 1957 and 1958, has no related health problems, but he
worked outside, Arnie says.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 years Joireman taught seventh- and eighth-grade
humanities classes at four Portland schools.
</P>
<P>
   William Staub, a teacher at the Jorge Middle School, said
Joireman touched the hearts and minds of countless students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee was an outstanding teacher,'' Staub said in documents
submitted to the court. ``He will remain one of the most
significant individuals in thousands of former students' lives. It
is an absolute tragedy that his personal talents and teaching
skills, as well as his positive, warm personality are not still at
work in room 417 at Jorge Middle School. What a loss. What a man
and teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Joiremen kept a journal. With the permission of his family,
we share some of his entries which present a painfully vivid
picture of how mesothelioma takes its toll:
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Sept. 24, 1995: It's so tiresome and depressing to be
forced to sit around all day. ... I took pain pills, every four
hours. ... My poor Twerp (Doris) has to keep busy to hide her
suffering. I love her so much it doubles my depression to watch her
and think about her ``future.'' May God watch over her.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Sept. 28: Too many thoughts of how to take care of
Twerp! I must pray stronger for her comfort. Only now do I fully
realize how much she means to me. She HAS made my life worthwhile,
and even if I don't live to 100, each day with her is worth that!!!
Thank you my love for being my wife, in the truest meaning of that
word ... The hardest part is when Twerp &AMP; I lie in bed. I can't put
my arms around her. I feel so useless and despondent!
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Oct. 2: The fluid in my lungs is collecting faster. I
can't eat anything ... I feel very depressed that Twerp and I
cannot do ``normal'' things anymore &AMP; make love, go on trips, go to
the beach, movies with popcorn, walks, bike, etc etc etc!! Why do
we have to ``suffer'' so?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Oct. 3: Had to be drained of 9 liters again. Doctors
said it comes back a little quicker after each drain. My neck and
head hurt so much.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Oct. 7: Watched Mariners beat Yankees to tie 2 to 2 in
best of five. Still taking pain pills every four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Oct. 8: My belly is very big and takes my energy. I
can't write much today.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Oct. 9: Same problems _ I hate seeing Doris so upset at
watching me ``grow'' and realize I'm dying. Hard to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Oct. 12: Seems fluid fills up 24 hours after drained!!
Difficult to breathe, sit, walk, etc. Feel weak and so useless!
Twerp has to do everything. I love her so much that I get very
depressed at her ``hurt'' over watching me get worse each day.
Please dear Lord, MERCY!!!
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Oct. 14: Bad Day! Stomach area swollen and presses
hard on chest and back. Can't lay down or sit comfortably. Legs,
ankles, feet terribly bloated and ache. Neck and head hurt. Why do
we (Twerp and I) have to suffer so?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Oct. 15: I watch TV and that's it. I am totally bored
and depressed. Life is very ``meaningless'' as I get weaker and
ache so much. Please forgive me, but I DO wish IT were over to stop
this useless suffering for us both!
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Oct. 28: Restless. Need two-hour pain pill. Nurse
called and will check me.
</P>
<P>
   That was Lee Joiremen's last entry. He died five days later. His
wife, Doris, was killed in a fall in her home 10 months later.

COMMENTARY: A COAT OF MANY COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Allies' first successes against German forces in Egypt
in World War II, Winston Churchill told the British Parliament that
this was not the end of the war, not even the beginning of the end,
but it might just be the end of the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Russia scholar Leon Aron says the same today of Russia in
the wake of its latest parliamentary elections. The fact that key
centrist and reform-minded parties emerged from these elections
with a chance to control the Russian legislature for the first time
is not the end of Russia's wrenching transition to free-market
democracy, says Aron. It's not even the beginning of the end of
that transition. But it may mark the end of the beginning of
Moscow's tumultuous move away from Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Aron, who immigrated to America from the Soviet Union in 1973 at
age 23 and is now head of Russian studies at the American
Enterprise Institute, has a unique perspective on this. He has just
completed a brilliant, long-awaited biography of Boris Yeltsin,
entitled ``Boris Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life'' (to be published
in February by St. Martin's). In both his Yeltsin biography and
other writings Aron ferociously takes on those who have been
arguing that Russia is irredeemably ``lost'' and that Boris Yeltsin
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One really has to resort to a medical diagnosis to describe
how most of America's political elites have been viewing Russia of
late,'' argues Aron. ``They are afflicted by two simultaneous
maladies: colorblindness and myopia. The myopia is a total lack of
historical perspective. When corruption scandals are in the
headlines, then the entire Russian reform experiment is dismissed
as illegitimate. When the appalling brutality of Russian forces in
Chechnya is in the headlines, we are told that it proves democracy
in Russia is a sham, because no democracy would behave this way _
forgetting India in the Punjab, Turkey in Kurdistan or France in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for colorblindness, they cannot see that unlike the Russia
of 10 years ago, today's Russia is not just a gray monolith. It is
a multicolored mosaic. Yes, Chechnya is a black, black spot, but it
is not the whole coat. It exists alongside a Russia which has free
and fair elections, real free speech and press, a real political
opposition and a real free market for the first time in its
history.''
</P>
<P>
   While Russia still has a long way to go before it gets what I
believe it needs most, the rule of law and institutions that must
undergird any free market, last weekend's elections were an
important step. The fact that so many Russians trudged through the
December snows to vote for constructive, centrist and pro-reform
parties means that the Communists' stranglehold over the Russian
Duma, which has blocked the legal and tax reforms Russia needs to
build the software of democracy, will be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Aron argues that for all his faults, Boris Yeltsin kept Russia
enough on the rails to get to this moment, which is why his legacy
too must be seen as a mosaic of many colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin was the man who lusted after power, but always
insisted on acquiring it through democratic means,'' argued Aron.
``And once he had that power, he used it both to tolerate
corruption, as well as to demilitarize, crudely privatize and even
decentralize the Russian state. And that is why, when all is said
and done, we will remember Boris Yeltsin most for one thing _ what
they call in Russian `peredyshka.' It means catching your breath
between bouts of physical or mental labor. Yeltsin gave us a messy
Russia, but one that for the first time in its history is neither a
monarchy nor a dictatorship. And in doing so he gave Russia time _
time to catch its breath so that its people could start to behave
like rational voters. And we start to see the results of that now
both in this election and the recent upturn in the Russian
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia reminds us just how difficult it is to build a free
market from scratch. You can do it the slow, tortoise way, as
Russia did, by trying to build it with a messy democracy. And you
can do it the fast, hare way, the authoritarian way, as China did,
directed from above with a whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian tortoise was declared to have been lost forever in
the swamp,'' says Aron, ``but these elections tell us that it's
not. It's emerging from the end of its beginning and can now begin
crawling to its real end. Who knows? Maybe it'll even catch the
hare one day.''

OFFICIALS WEIGH ALGERIANS' POSSIBLE LINK TO BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Algerian men are behind bars _ one in
Washington state suspected of trying to smuggle a truckful of
bomb-making materials into the United States, the other in Vermont
who was in a car with possible traces of explosives in its right
rear fender.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, the government's corridors are abuzz
about the end-of-the-year terrorism threat from UBL _ the acronymn
for Osama bin Laden (US officials spell his first name ``Usama'').
</P>
<P>
   What's the connection between bin Laden, believed to be hiding
out in an Afghanistan cave, and two Algerians trying to sneak into
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Those knowledgeable about counterterrorism said it could be a
link that reaches back to the early 1980s when bin Laden led a
brotherhood of Arab fighters in Afghanistan, giving him well-armed
friends throughout the Arab world, including in the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group. Or there could be nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the hunger for information on bin Laden, and on the
Algerians, is growing by the day, as the year comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scare is on,'' said Hussein Ibish, communications director
of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington.
``Unfortunately, you could see the scare began even before the
arrest of the Algerian in Washington state, emerging in the
warnings and cautions given by the State and Justice departments.
When they mentioned the millennium, they said a particular cause of
concern was the holy month of Ramadan, as if it were a dangerous
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan is a month of spiritual reflection and fasting for
Muslims, not a particularly violent time historically, with the
notable exception in recent years in Algeria, where massacres were
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, though, violence in Algeria has dropped
significantly, and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's amnesty plan
for Islamist fighters has appeared to split the armed resistance
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But those who study terrorism in general and bin Laden in
particular say if there is a link between the arrest of the
Algerians and bin Laden's Feb. 23, 1998, declaration of holy war
against Americans, it is unlikely to be driven by internal Algerian
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, parts of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, a loose group of
Islamic militants from Indonesia to Algeria, could be activated by
word of mouth after an order is given from bin Laden, a member of a
Saudi Arabian family that has made billions in construction
projects, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can assume there is a plan to attack Americans, either
abroad or in the United States, or both,'' said Boaz Ganor,
director of the International Policy Institute for
Counter-Terrorism in Israel and a former top adviser on terrorism
issues to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure the GIA (the Algerian Islamic group) would
target the United States, but I do think it's possible that
specific people in the GIA who have connections with bin Laden
could try to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's worldwide advisory for Americans living
or traveling abroad to exercise caution until after the New Year
was based on specific information that came from the arrests of 11
Jordanians, an Iraqi, and an Algerian who were plotting attacks on
Christian pilgrimage sites in Jordan, said officials there. The
group was funded by bin Laden's close associate, Omar Abu Omar,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, US intelligence specialists were first alerted
to a possible bin Laden terrorism plan targeted for Western Europe
when Turkish authorities said six members of a reported bin Laden
commando unit had infiltrated Turkey. The six, still at large, are
four Iranians and two Algerians. Two weeks ago, Turkey police
detained six Libyan men suspected of planning an attack on the
American Embassy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-American sentiment in the Middle East has its roots in
the Gulf War coalition against Iraq, the nine years of sanctions
against Iraq, and the perceived pro-Israeli bias in peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US government is hated,'' said Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi in an interview Tuesday with CBS' ``The Early Show.'' ``All
the people in the world are against it, therefore, there is a
threat. I hope it will not happen in this new year. I have no
knowledge about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, in his 1998 statement urging holy war against
Americans that he and four other Islamic militant leaders signed,
claimed that America was eager to ``destroy Iraq'' and occupy the
holy Arabian peninsula with its troops.
</P>
<P>
   The statement then declared, ``The ruling to kill Americans and
their allies _ civilians and military _ is an individual duty for
every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials have linked bin Laden to the two East Africa US
embassy bombings last year that killed more than 200 people;
terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Sudan; and a group that
tried to bomb American servicemen in Yemen in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But in Vermont Tuesday, US Attorney Charles Tetzlaff said there
was no evidence linking the two arrested Algerians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical,'' said Ibish of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``I don't doubt that a wealthy man
can arrange things, even nasty things if he wants. But he sort of
has assigned this role to himself, in which he spends a lot of time
giving blood-curdling interviews. In the Arab world, the man is
widely regarded as a crank and a dangerous fanatic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, which has posted a $5 million reward
for information leading to bin Laden's arrest, spokesman James B.
Foley tried to strike a balance in describing the nature of the
threat to Americans in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the American public that this is a yellow light.
It is not a red light,'' Foley said. ``We are urging Americans to
be vigilant and cautious as they travel, but we are not
recommending to Americans that they change their plans and that
they not travel overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Americans at home?
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is meeting daily to discuss the issue. The
FBI continues its investigations on the Algerians. Customs
officials have put an extra 300 guards on duty, and all their
border posts on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   And top officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright, General Henry H. Shelton, and CIA Director George Tenet,
met Monday at the White House. But after two hours of discussions,
they decided not to make public any of their drafted statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take this day by day,'' Foley said.

A STRIKING BUT TRYING `SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a season chock-full of big-screen adaptations of literary
favorites, ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' has the distinction of being
the most beautiful and the most maddening of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Director Scott Hicks, in his first film since ``Shine,'' has
crafted a strikingly evocative adaptation of David Guterson's
best-selling tale, but he has splintered the story into so many
flashback fragments that the film eventually crashes under the
weight of its own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who co-wrote the screenplay with the ubiquitous Ron Bass
(with an assist, apparently, from Guterson himself), would have
done better to more fully concentrate on the book's more
straightforward narrative elements. Instead, he loses himself (and,
in turn, the audience) in the heavy atmospherics of the film's
Pacific Northwest setting, weaving a heavily impressionistic yarn
that somehow fails to covey the rich rewards of the textured novel.
Hicks' approach eventually becomes tedious, and, by the film's last
half-hour, everything feels repetitive, a cinematic snow job with
no dramatic cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins, promisingly enough, on a dark and stormy
night. A fisherman, fighting a winter storm off Washington's San
Piedro Island, falls overboard and eventually washes up in the
harbor the next morning. Despite having only the flimsiest of
evidence, the local police arrest a handsome young
Japanese-American, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), and charge him with
murder. The subsequent trial, which begins on the ninth anniversary
of Pearl Harbor, reopens old wounds and bitter prejudices between
the Japanese-American and Anglo populations.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the trial for the town's small newspaper is Ishmael
Chambers (Ethan Hawke), a young man burdened by his late newspaper
father's crusading legacy (Sam Shephard plays the uncompromising
journalist) as well as his own connection to the defendant. At this
point, the story begins its flood of fragmental flashbacks,
returning to Ishmael's adolescence to reveal his love affair with
the young Japanese-American woman Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), who
eventually became Miyamoto's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Tortured over his past with Hatsue, Ishmael must grapple with
his conscience. He doesn't believe Miyamoto killed the local
fisherman; in fact, he has uncovered evidence that could well help
acquit him. But Ishmael has never forgiven Hatsue for marrying
Miyamoto, and the bitterness clouds his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The story has a host of compelling elements _ the forbidden
interracial romance, the murder mystery, the painful flashbacks
involving World War II internment camps. And the trial scenes are
quite involving, thanks in large part to the talents of Max von
Sydow, who plays the elderly defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But in his bold attempt to capture the novel's lush dream world,
Hicks goes overboard with a flurry of stylistic tricks and sinks
the story in the process. The film is gorgeous to watch; indeed,
cinematographer Robert Richardson's carefully composed wintry
visuals are nothing short of extraordinary. But the pretty pictures
can't cover the sins of redundancy, which is why this ``Snow''
ultimately feels like a tempest in a teapot. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' (PG-13; disturbing images,
sensuality and brief strong language). &QL; 
The stars: Ethan Hawke, Youki Kudoh, Max von Sydow. &QL;

VIOLENCE CREATES SYMPATHY VOTE FOR WOUNDED SRI LANKAN PRESIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Buffeted by one of Asia's most persistent
and ingenious insurgencies, Sri Lankans voted in large numbers on
Tuesday in a presidential election whose candidates offered little
real hope of peace.
</P>
<P>
   A large field of candidates, headed by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga and her main challenger, Ranil Wickeramasinghe,
competed in a campaign that was overwhelmed by a surge of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of themselves, the guerrillas may have created a
sympathy vote for the president, who was wounded Saturday in a
suicide bombing that took at least 24 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a second explosion killed 12 people at an
opposition rally on the other side of town. A total of 187 people
were wounded. The guerrillas, who are members of the country's
Tamil ethnic minority, are fighting for an independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks brought home to the capital a distant war in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula, where the insurgents, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have been fighting for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Storming back onto the offensive after a pause of a year and a
half, the insurgents in the last seven weeks have retaken much of
the territory captured by the army in 1995 and 1996. Retrained and
resupplied, they have augmented their well-practiced guerrilla
tactics with devastating artillery barrages.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, 500 government troops have been killed as the
guerrillas try to cut off Elephant Pass, Jaffna's only link to the
rest of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive pushed aside issues of economic hardship and
galvanized an election campaign that Mrs. Kumaratunga called in
October, one year before her term was up, in the full expectation
of an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of issues to begin with, but the principal
issue now is on the battlefield,'' said Saravana Muttu, who heads
the Center for Policy Alternatives, an independent policy group.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the attempt on Mrs. Kumaratunga's life,
which sent shrapnel into her face and left her with a white patch
over her right eye, may have improved her chances in the close
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was leading when the election started, but by the time the
bomb went off she was losing,'' said Kingsley da Silva, executive
director of the International Center for Ethnic Studies, a private
organization that seeks to find formulas for conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Such suicide attacks are a vivid demonstration of the commitment
of the Tamil separatists, many of whom are young woman and many of
whom carry cyanide tablets in case of capture.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaign-rally attacks attributed to the Tamil
insurgents have killed other Sri Lankan politicians, as well as a
former Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Either because she was recuperating or because she feared an
attack, Mrs. Kumaratunga did not travel to her polling place just
outside the capital Tuesday but had her ballot papers flown in by
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the electoral process, and disdaining even to comment on
it directly, was a man who over the years has become a leading
figure in Sri Lankan affairs, the guerrilla leader Vellupillai
Prabhakaran, 45. He has a reputation as a man who ``thrives on
war,'' and he is said to inspire the movement's suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   With Prabhakaran apparently uninterested in compromise, neither
of the leading presidential candidates has offered a creative or
persuasive approach to resolving the long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war began in 1983, it has taken more than 60,000 lives
and displaced perhaps a million people in this nation of 18
million. Total defense spending has been estimated to consume as
much as one-fourth of the national budget. Tourism, foreign
investment and domestic industry have all suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga came to office four years ago on a wave of
euphoria with a promise of peace. But her early overtures to the
rebels made little headway and were replaced by what some analysts
now say was an over-ambitious, over-extended military campaign that
was distorted and weakened by the government's political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's promises of peace, da Silva said, ``If
you look at the number of soldiers killed in the whole war, 4,000
were killed before 1975 and almost double that since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The president now proposes a constitutional amendment that would
offer greater freedoms to the Tamils in the northeast. But the
amendment is general in its terms and unlikely to offer concrete
solutions, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief opponent, Wickeramasinghe, has taken a more
conciliatory line, offering a pause in the fighting and the
possibility of talks. But Prabhakaran has in the past rejected more
generous peace-making overtures, including those of Mrs.
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils are in a minority of just 3.2 million, but they have
close links to a far larger Tamil population just a few miles
across the sea in southern India, where they benefit from sanctuary
and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Their grievances run deep, with roots in the British colonial
administration that favored the Hindu Tamils as bureaucratic
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   With independence in 1948, the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who
make up 74 percent of the population, struck back, imposing
discriminatory laws, making Sinhalese the national language and
withdrawing the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict as deep and intractable as that of Northern
Ireland, said da Silva, and one that requires the kind of
painstaking, drawn-out negotiations that produced a peace agreement
there.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he said, no one seems ready to take a deep breath
and seek real compromise.

`ANY GIVEN SUNDAY' KEEPS ON SCRAMBLING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's war on the field, in the skybox and at the front office in
``Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Oliver Stone has made a football movie, and he's packed it
with all the blood, thunder and shouting that you'd expect. It's
not a bad effort as predictable, inevitably sentimental pro sports
exposes go. But for all its impassioned noise, the film ultimately
has disappointingly little to say.
</P>
<P>
   The good surprise, considering it's a Stone movie, is that
there's a lot that's fun in ``Sunday.'' Reliable acting pros such
as Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Ann-Margret and even
Charlton Heston mix it up vigorously with young comers Cameron
Diaz, Aaron Eckhart and real find Jamie Foxx, whose vulgar TV
comedy gave no indication that he can handle a ball and intense,
jaw-busting dialogue so adroitly. It's also a pleasure to watch the
film's NFL greats (Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor in substantial
parts; Y.A. Tittle, Johnny Unitas, Dick Butkus and others in cameos
as rival coaches) acquit themselves credibly.
</P>
<P>
   There's an abundance of bad boy humor, female flesh (though the
most startling nudity is in the men's locker room) and enjoyably
vicious confrontations staged at that earsplitting decibel level
that Stone is unique in considering conversational. The film's
other sonic and visual elements are marshaled with the relentless
complexity the director is noted for, and they're generally
combined with uncharacteristic coherence and humor. And in its one
noteworthy social commentary, the film's racial politics are never
less than astute.
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of all these good things, ``Sunday'' fumbles about
with two-dimensional characters, the most gratuitously unnecessary
footage of all of this season's overlong films and an increasingly
dumber plot line that comes down, in the clutch, to that hoariest
of sports movie cliches: the big, odds-beating struggle to win the
make-or-break game.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino's Tony D'Amato is the legendary coach of the Associated
Football Franchises of America's Miami Sharks (the NFL was
understandably hesitant to cooperate with the uncontrollable
Stone). He's won a lot of playoffs, but the current season is going
right down the tubes. Veteran quarterback Cap Rooney (Quaid) is
severely injured and thinking about retirement. His cocky young
replacement, Foxx's Willie Beamen, breaks all the rules and can't
play well until he vomits in front of the fans and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Diaz's corporate mercenary Christina Pagniacci has
inherited the team from her late, old-school daddy, and all she can
think about is scoring points and the big bucks that go with them.
Sheer shrill pragmatism, she's constantly on weary Tony's case. And
Christina's not even the nastiest female in the movie. That prize
is reserved for Lauren Holly's Cindy Rooney, whose mania for
maintaining her husband Cap's status knows no restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stone displays unseemly relish whenever his movie
tackles women, his heart is really in the surrogate father-son
dynamics between D'Amato and Beamen. They don't like each other and
do not want to admit there are things they need to learn from one
another, but their relationship proves the movie's closest and
deepest. There's a terrifically written and performed scene about
midpoint in the movie when the two men articulately argue their
opposing views. The old guy's all for team-player ethics, the kid
enumerates the many ways in which minority athletes are exploited
and must look out for themselves, and they're both right and wrong.
All that damages this otherwise superb exchange is Stone's overkill
intercutting of footage from ``Ben-Hur.'' We're bludgeoningly
reminded that we're talking real gladiators here.
</P>
<P>
   The script is credited to Stone, John Logan and Daniel Pyne, and
it combines elements of several football-themed projects that have
been kicking around Hollywood for years. That might account for
much of the enjoyment that zigs in and out of ``Any Given Sunday,''
but the story line's increasing run to simplification seems more
purely Stone. His more serious, issue-oriented movies often came
down to relatively elementary delineations between good and evil.
This somewhat more frivolous effort just projects that strategy
onto the theme of winning and losing. &QL;

VERMONTERS WOULD PUT LID ON BEN &AMP; JERRY'S SALE

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ A poignant cry is rising from many a
Vermonter's heart these days, a plaint for local purity in the face
of cold cash and the forces of globalization: ``Say it ain't so,
Ben and Jerry!''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. announced on Dec. 2 that
it had received ``indications of interest'' from potential buyers
and was considering them, the entreaties of ``Don't sell out!''
have sounded from the Statehouse to the Internet to the streets of
this lakeside city where the company began in 1978 as a little ice
cream shop in a converted gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other for-profit company is so known for its green,
community-oriented virtue, typified by the 7.5 percent of pre-tax
profits it gives away. It would be hard to name another company as
symbiotically synonymous with its state. Ben &AMP; Jerry's sweet,
dappled-and-tie-dyed image helps market Vermont, and vice versa,
says Gov. Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere I go in the country or the world,'' said Dean, who is
fighting the possible sale, ``when you say, `I'm from Vermont,'
they say `Ben &AMP; Jerry's!' So it really is a signature corporation
for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   And the state is reacting in its signature utopian way _ with
homemade protests and calls to idealism. A street theater group
demonstrated outside the Ben &AMP; Jerry's shop here last week,
offering suggestions including the introduction of new flavors like
Chubby Bureaucrat, Funky Money and Two-Faced Swirl. Despite
diligent employees' scrubbing, the outside wall of the shop still
bears the faint scrawl, ``Don't Sell Out Vermont!''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Clavelle, the Progressive mayor of Burlington, went to the
protest, as did Rep. Bernard Sanders, the independent congressman
whose district includes Burlington. In an interview last week,
Clavelle said that ``Vermont is not for sale, nor should Ben &AMP;
Jerry's be.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Vermonters' concern is economic. Ben &AMP; Jerry's, Dean
said, buys 300 million tons of milk a year from local dairy farmers
at premium prices, and its ice cream factory attracts more visitors
than any other tourist site in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some also see the battle as a last stand by hippie idealism
against capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean, Clavelle and Sanders painted the current conflict a
bit differently. This fight, Dean said, is about globalization, and
the need to keep companies in the hands of Vermonters. As Clavelle
put it, ``Folks on Church Street in Burlington should have as much
or more control over our economy as those on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   One effort to stop the possible sale tries to use Wall Street in
the fight. Garret LoPorto, a Web designer based in Massachusetts
who has worked for Ben &AMP; Jerry's on social projects, is proposing
on a new Web site, www.savebenjerry.com, that people who care about
preventing the sale buy shares so they can vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   The site warns that ``gigantic multinational companies are
trying to take advantage of Ben &AMP; Jerry's undervalued stock
price,'' and want to ``skin the company alive and use its gentle
lambskin brand to fool unsuspecting consumers into purchasing their
soulless, profit-driven products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, LoPorto said in a telephone interview, is ``a way
for the board of directors to see that other people care. Ben and
Jerry have been doing this for over 20 years now. They're tired.
When you're a prizefighter, you need people to cheer you on to keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this hubbub, Ben (Cohen) and Jerry (Greenfield) have
maintained an atypical _ some would say ominous _ silence. Chrystie
Heimert, a company spokeswoman, said that neither she nor they
would comment on the possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   The only company word since the announcement came when Cohen,
who was asked about the sale in an interview on New Hampshire
Public Radio, said, ``It's my strong personal belief that the only
way that the company can actualize its progressive values is to
remain independent, so within the bounds of my fiduciary duties as
director, I am working hard to find a way to remain independent and
return adequate value to the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that ``adequate value'' for shareholders that is the rub.
The Dec. 2 announcement noted that potential buyers had indicated
they would pay significantly more than the company's stock value on
the Nasdaq. Industry analysts have been speculating that if the
company's board did not sell, it could lay itself open to legal
attacks from angry shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That disturbs Sanders. ``The directors of a company could
actually be sued because they are responsive to their employees, to
family farmers in our state and to the local economy,'' he said.
``That sounds to me to be quite unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to address just such a situation, the Vermont
Legislature recently enacted what is widely referred to as the Ben
&AMP; Jerry's law. It says that a company can consider factors beyond
profit when it is deciding whether to accept an offer. But
defenders of Ben &AMP; Jerry's worry because the law has not been
tested in court.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no official word on which companies are
interested in buying Ben &AMP; Jerry's. But reports, unconfirmed by the
companies, have included the giant Unilever and Dreyer's Grand Ice
Cream. Roncadin, an Italian manufacturer, told Dow Jones Business
News recently that it had been interested at first, but when other
big players started bidding, the price jumped too high.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Greenfield, along with a third director, Jeffrey
Furman, control about 46 percent of the voting stock, which gives
them effective control. They would thus seem to have the power to
reject an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said he had met with the Ben &AMP; Jerry's board to make his
pitch for ownership's remaining local. The members heard him out
and asked some questions but did not indicate their leanings, he
said. The governor said he believed this was a time of ``deep
reflection and deliberation about who they are as a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Others close to the company speculate that the board is riven by
disagreement, that the founders oppose the sale but others support
it, arguing that the company needs outside capital to ascend to a
new level of growth and competition.
</P>
<P>
   The internal nature of the decision-making has not stopped the
Vermont Public Interest Research Group, which organized the
Burlington rally, from pushing hard against a sale. Dave Rapaport,
the group's executive director, said that perhaps the state should
consider buying Ben &AMP; Jerry's. Ben &AMP; Jerry's officials have
announced no deadline for a decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many Vermonters, when asked about a sale, sounded
like Krista Reinhart, a forestry graduate student: ``I feel like
it's selling out, and it's against the initial mission of what we
all love about Ben &AMP; Jerry's.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Gallagher, an engineer, said, ``It would be a shame _ it's
an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Emily, also an engineer, agreed. ``It's like it's
gotten too big for those two goofy guys to run,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Vermonters are hoping those two goofy guys will come
through. ``I believe,'' Clavelle said, ``that at the end of the
day, the good guys will win. This has always been a good-guys
story, and it can't end being just another business sucked by
money-grubbers.''

BP AMOCO CLOSE TO REGAINING CONTROL OF PRIZED SIBERIAN OIL FIELD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)   By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ BP Amoco PLC, one of the biggest foreign investors in
Russia, has tentatively reached an agreement with a Russian oil
company to resolve a long-running conflict that threatened to
destroy the petroleum giant's half-billion-dollar investment in the
country, people close to the negotiations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which could be announced as early as Wednesday,
BP Amoco would regain authority over a prized Siberian oil field
sold in a questionable bankruptcy auction to the Russian company,
Tyumen Oil.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco's dispute with Tyumen has come to symbolize problems
that foreign investors have confronted in Russia. If the agreement
holds, it would mark an important if rare victory for BP Amoco,
which had not ruled out the possibility of leaving Russia out of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday night whether the deal was directly
related to broader pressure on Russia from the United States.
Earlier Tuesday in Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright ordered the U.S. Export-Import Bank to suspend approval of
$500 million in loans to Tyumen because of Russia's faltering
economic reforms, corruption and military action in Chechnya. The
agency left open the possibility that the loans could be approved
later.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, BP Amoco has plowed most of its Russia
investment into a 10 percent stake in Sidanko, a onetime oil
conglomerate that formerly owned some of the most valuable energy
assets in Russia, notably the Chernogorneft field in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, production subsidiaries of Sidanko have been
pushed into bankruptcy and sold off under controversial
circumstances, essentially leaving the parent company as an empty
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen bought Chernogorneft at a fraction of its value. BP Amoco
and others have accused Tyumen, which is nearly half-owned by the
Russian government, of tampering with the courts to influence the
bankruptcy proceedings and liquidation sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen acknowledges it was interested in acquiring
Chernogorneft, but denies using questionable methods.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the expected agreement, Tyumen would return
the Chernogorneft oil field to Sidanko, and in return receive an
equity stake in Sidanko of 25 percent plus one share, people close
to the deal said. BP Amoco, a British-based company with major
American assets, would keep the 10 percent stake it owns in
Sidanko, but its voting rights would be the same as Tyumen's. Such
holdings are known as ``blocking stakes,'' giving both companies
seats on the Sidanko board and sufficient leverage to influence the
company's business activities.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco would also get managerial authority over Sidanko and
its subsidiaries, essentially giving it control of the
Chernogorneft field.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the negotiations said it was still possible that
the agreement could fall apart. Spokesman for Tyumen, BP Amoco and
Sidanko declined to comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear if the acrimony between BP Amoco and Tyumen
could be quickly put aside so as to allow Sidanko to resume
functioning properly. All involved in the talks appear interested
in building the Chernogorneft field, situated in northwestern
Siberia, more than 1,500 miles east of Moscow, and adjoining other
Tyumen property.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism it has endured over the Sidanko dispute,
Tyumen Oil is considered a strong company that has worked hard to
develop its fields and refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think that Tyumen's push to refurbish its aging,
Soviet-built assets may have been one reason why it decided to
negotiate a settlement. And the Export-Import Bank loans to Tyumen,
whenever approved, would allow the company to overhaul an important
refinery and improve production at a major oil field.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Ex-Im keeps postponing the loans, and they're very
important to Tyumen,'' said Dmitri Avdeyev, oil analyst with the
United Financial Group, a Moscow brokerage firm. ``And they
probably realized that with the reputation they had gotten, foreign
capital markets would be closed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyumen Oil appears to have agreed to a solution that gives them
a stake in Sidanko worth far less than the Chernogorneft field.
``Twenty-five percent is too low for giving up Chernogorneft,''
said Ivan Mazalov, an oil analyst with the brokerage firm Troika
Dialog. ``Chernogorneft accounts for half the value of Sidanko.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have followed the BP Amoco-Tyumen struggle said
the Russian government might have brought pressure on the rival
parties, in light of the damage that has already been done to the
country's reputation as a place for investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight wasn't just bad for Sidanko,'' Avdeyev said. ``It
was bad for the whole market. And so any fair compromise will help
restore sentiment.''

CARREY BRIGHT BUT `MOON' WANING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' opens with a loopy five-minute prologue that
promises a movie that would positively delight its subject, the
late oddball comedian Andy Kaufman. Nervously facing the camera,
Jim Carrey's Kaufman (it might as well be Kaufman, the performance
is so completely encompassing) welcomes us to his movie,
apologizing (in a way, rightly so) for it being ``stupid'' and
``terrible.'' The end credits then roll and Carrey leaves the
screen, only to return shortly afterward to ask: ``What are you
still doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   What are we doing here, indeed? Well, we're not learning
anything about Kaufman, that's for sure. In bringing their latest
eccentric to the screen, writers Scott Alexander and Larry
Karaszewski (``Ed Wood,'' ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'') have
decided to let Kaufman's ``art'' speak for itself, making no
attempt at any point in the movie to get inside Kaufman's head. But
the film's shapeless script, combined with some surprisingly
listless direction from Milos Forman, renders Kaufman a complete
cipher. Ultimately, this is a movie that's remarkable only for
Carrey's uncanny channeling techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, ``Man on the Moon'' seems unconventional by its very
conventionality. Instead of evolving like a standard, three-act
biopic, ``Moon'' leaps almost directly into Kaufman's career, never
stopping for a moment to consider how he arrived there. Of course,
with Kaufman, one must wonder: Was there a there?
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the film, Kaufman complains to his girlfriend
(Courtney Love, more or less playing her public persona) that ``you
don't know the real me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a real you,'' Love retorts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's reply? ``Oh, yeah. I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly a legitimate point of view, but it doesn't make
for much of a movie. ``Man on the Moon'' plays like one long
performance reel of Kaufman's greatest bits: singing ``The Mighty
Mouse'' theme on ``Saturday Night Live,'' playing Latka on
television's ``Taxi,'' wrestling women on ``The Merv Griffin Show''
and indulging his alter ego, the obnoxious lounge singer Tony
Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's ``Taxi'' co-stars are on hand for some pretty creepy
scenes (Kaufman looks the same; everyone else _ despite valiant
makeup work _ is 20 years older) and Danny DeVito steps out of
character for some yeomanlike work as Kaufman's manager. But this
is Carrey's movie and he makes the most of what he can with the
thin material.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there are some priceless bits of comedy here, but
aside from the movie's opening moments, the whole thing is played
too straight. Despite its strained attempts to portray Kaufman as a
comedy outlaw, ``Moon'' comes across as a rather tame, shallow
portrait of an enigmatic man of dubious talent. Kaufman, whatever
you think of him, deserves better. &QL;

HARBISON`S `GREAT GATSBY': CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &LR;   &LR; _ ``You can't repeat the past,'' Nick Carraway sings
in Act 2 of John Harbison's new opera ``The Great Gatsby'' _ to
which Jay Gatsby replies, in all his thrilling, tragic myopia,
``Can't repeat the past? Of (set ital)course(end ital) you can!''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the crux of Harbison's well-made but futile
adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel, which had
its long-awaited world premiere Monday night in a splendid
production at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   If it were possible for Fitzgerald's self-made protagonist to
reclaim the lost love of the alluring Daisy Buchanan, his chosen
method _ lavish displays of wealth combined with a little emotional
arm-twisting _ would probably be the right one. But as generations
of high school English students have learned, Gatsby's romantic
dream of self-invention and renewal turns out to be a chimera.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if the traditional models for opera had any life left
in them _ if a composer could still craft a powerful dramatic work
through shapely arias, intricately woven ensembles, canny
orchestral writing and all the rest of the historical apparatus _
Harbison would be the one to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Setting his own libretto, Harbison has compressed and slightly
rearranged Fitzgerald's narrative with a sure sense of pacing. The
score is studded with lyrical numbers of arresting beauty, and the
skill with which he interweaves the sounds of the Jazz Age into the
musical texture is nothing less than astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monday's heralded premiere _ with the eyes and ears of the
whole musical world focused on the last new opera of the 1900s _
only confirmed Nick's unheeded reminder. Harbison's lavish
creation, like one of Gatsby's extravagant lawn parties, felt like
an attempt to recapture an unreachable past, when the
tried-and-true methods of writing an opera still worked.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``The Great Gatsby'' is simply an exercise in
pastiche-laden archaism, like the echoes of Mozart and Rossini that
coursed through an earlier Met commission, John Corigliano's
``Ghosts of Versailles.'' In fact, the strains of 1920s popular
music that run through the score probably constitute its most
fascinating feature.
</P>
<P>
   Between Gatsby's parties _ two of which feature prominently in
the opera _ and music streaming from radios, there's a constant
backdrop of fox-trots, two-steps, tangos and rumbas that do as much
as Jane Greenwood's costumes to establish the piece's period tone.
</P>
<P>
   The songs themselves are Harbison's own, with lyrics by Murray
Horwitz, and they're dazzlingly good exercises in period style
(Horwitz, in a program note, compares the process of writing these
songs to making antiques). Better still is the way the composer
grafts his character's sung dialogue onto those Jazz Age rhythms
and harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents are the ball that ends Act 1 of Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni'' and the opening scene of Verdi's ``Rigoletto,'' and
Harbison's effort belongs in that company _ especially in the
opera's most powerful scene, the party that begins Act 2.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that Daisy, who has just reconnected with
Gatsby after their aborted romance five years earlier, comes to
Gatsby's house for one of his extravagant bashes. While the
assembled guests dance a lively fox-trot, Daisy's husband, Tom,
vents his suspicions about Gatsby to the perpetual onlooker Nick
(just as faceless here as in the novel), and Gatsby and Daisy
inhabit a world apart, where the strains of the party can only just
be heard through the gauzy mist of their forbidden love.
</P>
<P>
   It's a display of remarkable virtuosity, and it's not the only
one. The overture, written in 1985 as a stand-alone orchestral
piece, captures the emotional essence of the piece with brilliant
efficiency. The tender lyricism of some of the set pieces _ Daisy's
first soliloquy, Gatsby's final reverie recalling the magic of
their first love, and even Nick's oddly minimalist evocation of a
winter train ride through Wisconsin _ can be heart-wrenching in its
power.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the whole enterprise feels deeply familiar.
The arias announce themselves too brazenly as such (sometimes
drawing the proceedings to a sudden halt), and the audience can see
them coming well in advance. ``Gatsby'' is full of affecting
moments, but never the ghost of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's production, nimbly staged by Mark Lamos and conducted
with panache by music director James Levine, at least makes a
committed case for the piece (it'll travel to the Lyric Opera of
Chicago next season). Michael Yeargan's sets, dexterously lit by
Duane Schuler, are impressively clutter-free yet convey the
requisite air of ostentatious wealth through high ceilings, broad
vistas and just a few well-placed sticks of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, too, turned out to be well-chosen in nearly every
case. In the title role, tenor Jerry Hadley gave eloquent voice to
Gatsby's romantic fantasies, singing powerfully in the ensembles
and with clarity in his solos.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal difficulty that plagued him so recently in September's
San Francisco Opera production of Charpentier's ``Louise'' raised
its head only briefly, in the form of some labor-intensive high
notes; otherwise, he managed Harbison's sinuous melodic writing
with alluring ease.
</P>
<P>
   As Daisy, soprano Dawn Upshaw managed to pack her character's
unearthly allure into her singing, producing a stream of
resplendent, brightly focused sound that drew listeners into her
aura.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the evening, though, was San Francisco's own
Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, making an incendiary Met debut as Tom
Buchanan's smoldering, lower-class mistress, Myrtle Wilson.
Myrtle's earthy eroticism is Fitzgerald's clich &LR; e &LR; , but the
unstoppable vibrancy and force of Lieberson's portrayal made it
instantly believable.
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo-soprano Susan Graham was nearly as entrancing as Daisy's
friend, Jordan Baker, in a performance that caught the character's
supercilious charm perfectly, and Mark Baker brought fearless
assurance to the heldentenor role of Tom Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Only baritone Dwayne Croft as Nick, with his bland tone and
inaptly Italianate diction, struggled to make an impression. But
there were strong performances by Richard Paul Fink as Myrtle's
cuckolded husband, Matthew Polenzani as the band vocalist at
Gatsby's parties and William Powers as the gambler Meyer Wolfshiem.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it's fitting that ``Gatsby'' will go into the history
books as the last new opera premiered in the 1900s. It is an expert
compendium of most of the operatic techniques that have been
mastered and digested during the past century and more, and in
terms of skill and resourcefulness, it is hard to fault. But now,
perhaps, it might be time for something new.

U.S. MAKES LAST-MINUTE DUES PAYMENT TO UNITED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to delete `R-Del.' in 6th graf, correcting to `Sen. Joseph
Biden of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat...') 
(mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With barely a week to go before the United
States would have lost its vote in the General Assembly for falling
too far behind in paying its back dues, the Clinton administration
came through Tuesday with a check for $51 million, the United
Nations said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, despite several recent payments totaling $247
million, a minimum of about $8 million remained to be paid by the
United States, the organization's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, had said
earlier in the day. The last-minute payment was consistent with a
pattern in recent years in which just enough money was found by the
United States to save its General Assembly vote. The Security
Council vote is not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations calculates the total outstanding American
debt at still more than $1 billion. The United States does not
accept that figure because of congressional decisions to lower
payments. Both sides agree, however, that a minimum of $255 million
had to be paid by the end of this year. Tuesday's check cleared
that mark comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative at the United Nations, praised a budget agreement in
Washington that finally freed $926 million for the United Nations.
He called the decision a ``terrain-changing event'' for the United
States here, where resentment against Washington for essentially
bankrupting the organization has been mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our judgment from the beginning that if we didn't get
the Helms-Biden bill passed,'' Holbrooke said, referring to the
budget agreement, ``the next year here in New York would have been
very unpleasant, and America's influence not only in the United
Nations but in all sorts of important issues around the world could
have been severely eroded. It was important to get this behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Helms-Biden compromise, agreed to by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware., the committee's ranking Democrat,
set the $926 million total for U.N. payments.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke is now faced with the task of putting some
congressional conditions to the test here. The money is being
released by Congress in installments, with the condition that
members of the United Nations agree to reduce American
contributions to 22 percent of the organization's budget from 25
percent. Congress has already unilaterally lowered contributions to
the peacekeeping budget to 25 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many other benchmarks are attached to the payments, but
Holbrooke says they are manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hays, an American diplomat with ambassadorial rank, has
joined the U.S. mission here to take on the budgetary and dues
negotiations. Holbrooke said the United States would like to
broaden the debate on dues to review not only American
contributions to the organization, but also those of many other
nations that are perceived to be paying too little or too much.
</P>
<P>
   Except for adjustments two years ago that lowered the rates of
membership for the smallest and poorest countries to $10,000 from
$100,000 annually, a readjustment of dues had not taken place for
more than a quarter of a century, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-six new nations have joined the U.N. since then,'' he
said. ``Some get richer, some poorer. Some nations have told us
privately that as part of a package they will increase their
contributions. Some nations said they would like to reduce. We are
calling for a general revision, not just a diktat from
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the organization needed to find only $38 million
annually to make up for the United States' reduction in payments.

FCC EXPECTED TO LET 1ST BABY BELL INTO LONG-DISTANCE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)  (Eds: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.)

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic on Wednesd become the first of the Baby
Bells allowed into the $80 billion long-distance market, signaling
a new era of competition in the communications industry, people
close to the decision said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement expected Wednesday from the Federal
Communications Commission would allow Bell Atlantic to sell
long-distance services to the 6.6 million households it serves in
New York state. Approval would mark the first time since the
breakup of AT&AMP;T 15 years ago that millions of consumers would be
able to get both local and long-distance phone services from an
offspring of Ma Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Bell Atlantic said the company planned to
mount a big marketing campaign beginning the first week of January
to promote the company's long-distance service. The company intends
to offer long-distance calling plans with low per-minute rates but
without monthly fees, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the communications business surges amid a flurry of
mergers, the explosive growth of the Internet and the
popularization of wireless phones, Bell Atlantic's long-distance
victory in New York would mark the beginning of a profound
reshaping of the industry's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, the FCC is expected to allow the Baby
Bells to enter the long-distance market in many states, presenting
AT&AMP;T as well as the other long-distance titans, MCI Worldcom Inc.
and Sprint Corp., which have agreed to merge, with powerful new
competitors who already enjoy relationships with tens of millions
of customers.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc., the largest local phone company, which
does business as Ameritech, Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell, is
expected to ask the FCC as early as the first week of January for
approval to offer long distance in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bells and for regulators, Bell Atlantic's long-distance
approval in New York would mean the beginning of the end of a
regulatory system that emerged as the old American Telephone &AMP;
Telegraph shed its local Bell companies under court supervision in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, it would also represent a major success for the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which Congress enacted largely to
break down regulatory barriers among communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dropping of the barrier keeping the local telephone
companies from the long-distance market is in fact the beginning of
the end of regulation,'' Reed Hundt, who resigned as chairman of
the FCC in 1997, said Tuesday in an interview. ``It's important,
the way that crossing the highest peak in any mountain range is
important. You're going down now, but you still have a long way to
go.''

&HT;        SOUTH TEXAS BORDER ON ALERT FOR TERRORISTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 - U.S. law enforcement officials along the
border between Texas and Mexico are beefing up security inspections
to varying degrees in a ``heightened state of alert'' for possible
terrorists seeking to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of several alleged terrorist activities, including
the announcement Tuesday of the arrest of an Algerian in Vermont
smuggling bomb-making materials across the Canadian border, South
Texas customs officials said they are moving personnel and asking
inspectors to work overtime in case of a terrorist entry there.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and border patrol inspectors are also on the look
out, but so far have not moved or added staff.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official who focuses on terrorism said while
there is no direct evidence of terrorist activity in any area of
the country, stepping up security just in case is a ``prudent
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the alert sent out by immigration and border agencies,
South Texas customs officials are likely to do twice as many
security inspections than usual in the area from Del Rio to
Brownsville, said Maria Reba, director of field operations in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Reba said customs officers started shifting administrative staff
into inspections roles this week, and have asked inspectors to work
double their normal working day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be a lot more vigilant,'' Reba said. ``We have
a heightened sense of alert.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be extra security measures, such as using two
dogs to sniff for drugs where one would normally be used, Reba
said. They are doing more preliminary inspections of vehicles
before they arrive at the first checkpoint - and doing more
searches inside and under the hoods of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Reba said those crossing the borders may find delays due to the
heightened security. ``We ask that people realize this is for
safety, we thank for their understanding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. customs officials Monday said they were adding 300
inspectors to work at various customs points around the country.
South Texas does not have plans to bring inspectors from other
precincts to its ten points of entry, Reba said.
</P>
<P>
   But those points, which employ 1,084 people, may need to add
more personnel because there are limits to how many extra hours
inspectors can work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Services, which checks
documentation of those entering the country at official entry
points, may decide to move personnel from one center to another,
and may ask employees to work overtime, but has no plans to deploy
additional officers, said Nicole Cheulick, spokesperson for INS
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Art Moreno, spokesman for the INS in Harlingen, Texas, said his
office had received the alert. ``They've been told to keep their
guard up,'' he said. ``There will be no operational changes [and]
it's going to be maintained at same integrity as far as
inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande Valley's Border patrol, which sweeps for illegal
entry to the U.S. in Starr, Hidalgo, and Cameron counties, is
looking out for suspicious people, but it's ``business as usual''
said Harry Bell, assistant chief patrol agent of the Valley's
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he doubted any terrorist from the Middle East or
Europe would try to enter the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to draw suspicion immediately,'' Bell said.
``Antennas and red flags are going to go up all over the place
along the Southwest border,'' he said. ``It's pretty easy for us
because the majority of our traffic is Mexicans, and someone from
Europe sticks out.''

 &HT;    Have yourself a dressy little Christmas
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On her way through a local department store Dec.
10, the colorful Christmas sweater caught her eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tickets to have brunch with Santa at the Racquet Club
the next day and my children were going to dress in holiday
clothes,'' recalls Jackie Williams. ``When I saw the sweater I
thought it would be fun for me to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year when folks get the urge to cover
themselves with candy canes and reindeer, sleighs filled with
presents and wreaths, nutcrackers and angels. Some don
battery-powered twinkling lights. Others opt for pins on their red
and green turtlenecks. Men take out their Christmas ties.
</P>
<P>
   The Scrooges among us assert that holiday garb looks more like
billboards than clothing and doesn't flatter anyone. But that
doesn't dissuade devotees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start wearing them right after Thanksgiving and wear
them through Jan. 1,'' says Peggy Cornwell, manager of the Acorn, a
Kettering, Ohio, women's shop that specializes in novelty sweaters.
This year her store in the Town &AMP; Country Shopping Center sold a
``Twelve Days of Christmas'' sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell says customers of all ages buy the festive holiday
sweaters _ some even collect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a Grinch sweater by Michael Simon that teachers really
liked,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Christmas attire, this year there's the added
attraction of millennium garb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done well with it and it's like a memento so people can
really wear it past the 2000 year,'' says Cornwell.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bukey, vice president/regional director of stores for
Elder-Beerman, says sales for holiday-motif clothing build every
year and that millennium merchandise also has been selling very
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that lot of people are doing it for the novelty of
it and having a lot of fun with it,'' he says. ``This year is so
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Williams _ whose cardigan boasts a Christmas tree, teddy
bear and presents_ says the sweater will be perfect for her
family's Christmas Eve celebration and that it brings smiles to
those who see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have business casual at work every day, wearing
holiday sweaters is a nice break from everyday business casual
dress,'' says Williams, who works at Reynolds &AMP; Reynolds. ``When I
wear it I feel a little more in the spirit of Christmas.''

CARREY CHANNELS THE ELUSIVE KAUFMAN IN `MAN ON THE MOON'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' may be the strangest movie biography ever
made. That's partly because of its subject and partly because of
the man who plays him.
</P>
<P>
   The film is, ostensibly, about the life and times of Andy
Kaufman, the guerrilla performance artist who masqueraded as, among
other things, a stand-up comedian in the 1970s and '80s. A put-on
specialist of the highest order, Kaufman didn't care if he made his
audiences laugh or not _ heresy in the comedy biz _ and even
actively provoked hatred with his quixotic ventures into wrestling
women and readings of ``The Great Gatsby,'' in full, to people who
thought they had bought tickets to a laugh party.
</P>
<P>
   But since Kaufman died suddenly in 1984 (some, quite naturally,
still believe he faked that, too), leaving a perplexing legacy of
unbroken poses rather than the usual accumulation of clues as to
what he was really like, his story could only honestly portray the
masks, not the man behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that stopped ``Moon's'' star, Jim Carrey, from
virtually channeling Kaufman. The superstar funnyman _ whose
trademark antic schtick is about as far from Kaufman's poker-faced
surrealism as two acts can get _ remained in character for the
entire shooting schedule, interacting with director Milos Forman
and cast and crew members exclusively as Andy. Or, on the really
freaky days, as Kaufman's abrasive lounge singer character, Tony
Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to consume me because it consumed Andy,'' an apparently
saner Carrey explains. ``I wouldn't work in that way for any other
project, I don't think. But Andy was that way, Andy was a person
who opened his eyes in the morning and the circus began. You didn't
go 'Action!' and Andy suddenly went into character. He came as the
character, and he was the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so committed, in fact, that people thought he was sick.
So, I thought, I'm a comic, and to do anything less than commit
like he did would be disrespectful or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect for Kaufman among big-time Hollywood players such as
Carrey, multiple Oscar winner Forman and producer/co-star Danny
DeVito was what got this decidedly quirky project off the ground.
Forman and DeVito, who had worked together more than two decades
ago on ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' reunited five years ago
at a birthday party for that film's producer, Michael Douglas,
where their mutual interest in Kaufman became the main topic of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito, of course, was a veteran of the hit TV sitcom ``Taxi,''
on which Kaufman played the lovable foreign mechanic Latka Gravas.
For his part, Forman had fond _ well, maybe distinct is a better
word _ memories of a live Andy performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Andy for the first time _ and the last time _ live at
the the Improv in, I believe, 1974,'' says Forman, the Czech-born
director of such diametrically different biopics as ``Amadeus'' and
``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' ``I was fascinated and, at the same
time, irritated. But I remained fascinated since.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the off-the-wall biopic
specialists who wrote ``Flynt'' and ``Ed Wood,'' had also been
fascinated by Andy. They were, naturally, the writers Forman and
DeVito turned to for their script, so with the entree to Andy's
friends and intimates the big names provided, Scott and Larry set
out to write the definitive Kaufman screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Which they did. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``This script was a nightmare to figure out,'' Alexander admits.
``We were trying to get a clean and simple bead on who Andy was,
but after four or five months of interviews we couldn't get a
straight answer. Plus, we also couldn't figure out how to tell the
story and be true to Andy. Then we hit upon the idea of there is no
real Andy, then we hit upon the idea of doing the film as a series
of puzzles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but what does that tell us about Kaufman?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a weird sense, what I think is interesting about Andy and
that keeps him interesting all these years later is that he is not
explainable,'' Karaszewski offers. ``That he is an enigma and that
he was a person who was not happy unless he was wearing a mask,
either on stage or off. If you went out to dinner with Andy, I
would say that seven times out of 10 he would talk to the waiter
with a German accent. He was all about performing, and every time
you thought that you'd gotten into the inner circle, whenever you
thought you were finally seeing the real person, you realized that
you were just being messed with again.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVito, who plays Kaufman's patient (if not always
understanding) manager, George Shapiro, in the movie, reveals that
even after working for five years with Kaufman, he had little
notion of his friend's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a very respectful and, genuinely, I thought, a
good guy,'' DeVito recalls. ``But honestly, my take on it was that
what he was doing as a little boy _ magic shows, sing-alongs, that
kind of solitary fantasy life that he led _ stayed with him. I
mean, really stuck; and this young man grew into an adult who loved
doing the same exact things he did as a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others involved in making the film, DeVito refers questions
about the real Andy to Shapiro and the late comedian's girlfriend
Lynne Margulies, who is played by Courtney Love in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a constant put-on artist, except in private life,''
Margulies more or less explains. ``But it's difficult to describe
what his private life was like. He was just a quiet, shy,
intelligent, you could almost say boring guy. He was almost, kind
of, not there. He wasn't cinematic in the slightest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In real life, I could have a conversation with Andy for three
or four hours,'' Shapiro, an executive producer of the film,
reveals. ``Totally rational, intelligent, he'd tell me what he
enjoyed doing in his life. And I enjoyed being with him,
one-to-one, as a person, talking about what his dreams were and
what he loves.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cared much for the obnoxious Clifton persona, however.
DeVito recalls Clifton showing up on the ``Taxi'' set _ the cast
was told he was a friend of the absent Andy's _ and totally
insulting everybody. The incident was re-created for the movie with
many of the original ``Taxi'' actors playing themselves (though
DeVito noticeably was not among them). Only this time Carrey
appeared in full Tony garb and bray, and with a coating of stinky
cheese all over him for good measure. He particularly enjoyed
hugging visiting Universal Studios executives that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very surreal, but when I saw what dedication Jim had
for this part, I felt blessed,'' notes DeVito, who can say that,
since he wasn't around for a Limburger embrace. ``I had a lot of
responsibility here because, first of all, I loved Andy and I'm
very good friends with George Shapiro and my company produced this
movie. I am thanking God that Jim totally, totally immersed himself
in that character. Jim himself only came to the set twice in, like,
four or five months, so everybody was able to do exactly what they
were doing back at the time when Andy was around.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kaufman was doing his thing, Carrey was a poor Canadian kid
just starting to struggle in the competitive comedy game. He
eventually succeeded beyond his wildest dreams, applying his
plastic-muscled ingenuity to the decade's most successful run of
comedy films _ ``Dumb and Dumber,'' ``The Mask,'' ``Liar Liar,''
the Ace Ventura pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though Carrey turned into a kind of ultimate
crowd-pleaser, he credits Kaufman as a key influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just opened up the doors,'' Carrey says. ``First of all,
you don't have to be funny _ whew! _ second of all, you just have
to be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a period when I stopped doing impressions and
wanted to explore other avenues,'' Carrey continues. ``There were
six months of my life when I went to the Comedy Store every night
and decided not to repeat something that I had said the night
before, and it was deadly. I mean, sweat was pouring down my face.
But when you saw people like Andy Kaufman taking the chances that
he took, (you realized that) failure was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a Golden Globe nomination and talk that he might be up
for the Oscar nomination that eluded him for ``The Truman Show''
last year, Carrey is still somewhat possessed by the Andy spirit
that so thoroughly consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever did win an Oscar or something, I wish that Andy
would run up and grab it out of my hands,'' Carrey says. &QL;

 &HT;    Nazareth of Jesus' time was primitive, perilous
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesus may have been the Prince of Peace, but if his life was at
all typical of his fellow Nazarenes in the first century, he didn't
live like royalty while he was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he would have lived under the same roof with a
few goats and, maybe, a cow and a couple of sheep. He would have
shared his bedroom with several members of his extended family. And
in the middle of the night, in winter, he probably used the same
chamber pot as the rest of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in first-century Galilee meant working around the
house from the time you were 4 or 5, grinding flour from wheat
grown on your own land and collecting animal dung to burn in the
family fire. It meant bathing weekly and rubbing yourself with
lemon rinds as a deodorant. It meant keeping an eye out for wild
boars when traveling and probably knowing a few people who had been
gored to death.
</P>
<P>
   It meant lugging water from central cisterns shared by everyone
in the community. It meant that if you broke your leg as a child,
you'd probably walk with a limp for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   And according to Eric Meyers, a professor of Judaic studies at
Duke University who has worked on digs around Nazareth for 20
years, it might have meant commuting to work.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jesus was born, Nazareth was rapidly becoming a
bedroom community of Sepphoris, which Herod Antipas _ the Jewish
ruler of Galilee _ declared his capital about the time Jesus was
born. That declaration set off a building boom that would continue
throughout Jesus' life.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus and Joseph, along with dozens of other local craftsmen,
probably walked the 3miles to Sepphoris to help construct the
homes, many for the wealthy, as well as public theaters and
government centers that were being erected.
</P>
<P>
   While Nazareth had a population of a few hundred and was more of
a hamlet than a town, Sepphoris was probably home to about 15,000
by the middle of the first century, Meyers said. In the last 20
years, archeologists have discovered a theater and about 50
mikvahs, or Jewish ritual baths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very religious community,'' Meyers said. ``Nazareth
was poor to middle class, but Sepphoris would have been a lot
wealthier, maybe middle class to upper class, with a lot more going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisans from out of town who were trained in working with
stucco or masonry would likely have lived in Sepphoris to take
advantage of the building boom. And since the city was at the
intersection of several trade routes, foreigners likely passed
through regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Sepphoris eventually grew into a major city and learning center:
The Mishnah, a well-known collection of Jewish laws, was edited
there in the third century. By the eighth century, the city was
taken over by Muslims. And in the 12th century, a decisive battle
that sent the Christians packing and ended the last of the Crusades
took place a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The city was taken over by Israel in 1948 and today is a
national park and one of the most popular tourist sites in Israel.
A replica of a first-century household in Nazareth is under
construction and may open this summer, Meyers said.

ALBRIGHT BLOCKS AID TO RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-ARMS) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Tuesday
ordered the Export-Import Bank to reject a $500 million loan for
Russia ``for the time being, '' arguing that the state-affiliated
oil company for which the loan was intended was an example of
resistance to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of frantic meetings in which Albright tried
unsuccessfully to persuade the independent agency to defer
consideration of the loan guarantees, she invoked a rarely-used law
to block the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The bank met behind closed doors late Tuesday afternoon after
receiving a letter from Albright, and did not proceed with its
previously planned approval of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said Albright's concerns were
entirely focused on questions about the rule of law in Russia and
had nothing to do with the country's military campaign in Chechnya,
though senior aides to President Clinton noted that the secretary
only became deeply involved in the loan issue after Russia's
attacks in Chechnya intensified.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of reports and allegations that raised
questions about the use of bankruptcy laws in Russia and about
shareholder and creditor rights,'' said Al Larson, the
undersecretary of state for economic affairs. ``This is
particularly important given the importance of promoting rule of
law, something we have discussed for many years, and particularly
in the past few months.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The denial of the loan will mean little for the Russian economy.
It simply stops American firms from selling oil-drilling and
environmentament to Tyumen Oil, a company that is 49.8
percent owned by the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolism is far greater. The action comes at a crucial
time in both Russian domestic politics and U.S. relations with
Moscow. Moreover, it reflects a hardening of the U.S. stance toward
the benefits of ``economic engagement'' with Russia during its
rocky transition to a market economy. In addition, American
companies considering doing business in Russia could easily be
scared off if they think it will become more difficult to obtain
guarantees from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have already been assailing Vice President Al Gore
for his leading role in the Russian aid packages of the past seven
years, charging that the taxpayer-supported economic assistance has
done little good. While the Clinton administration has defended its
approach, it has also slowed the money to a trickle while insisting
on major changes in the Russian economic and legal systems.
</P>
<P>
   Aid from the International Monetary Fund, for example, has been
strung along for months, with the administration insisting that
Russia first carry out its promised reforms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Export-Import Bank, James Harmon, a former
investment banker at Goldman Sachs, had turned the loan into a test
of the administration's stomach for continued economic engagement
with Russia. He angered many in the administration by refusing to
read the political tea leaves, and insisting that the loan should
go ahead if it met the bank's criteria _ which are economic in
nature, not political.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, the loan guarantees were politically
troublesome. Tyumen Oil has been in the midst of several nasty
commercial battles in which it was accused of fraud in dealing with
BP Amoco, with investor George Soros and with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco and Soros both retained powerful lobbyists to plead
their case, and Amoco used the loan issue to negotiate a deal
resolving its long-running dispute with Tyumen. That agreement is
expected to be announced this week, and its resolution might begin
to clear the way for the lifting of Albright's order, officials
suggested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement that will reportedly be signed Wednesday,
Tyumen will surrender a valuable oil production unit that it
obtained through a quickly-executed bankruptcy action from a
company called Sidanco. BP Amoco owned 10 percent of Sidanco and
originally believed that its investment was lost, leading to its
complaints to the Clinton administration. Now, under the agreement
reached hours before the Export-Import Bank's board was meeting, it
will control a quarter of the voting rights in Sidanco, making it
an equal partner with Tyumen.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether that will be enough to lift the order that
Albright issued Tuesday under the 1978 ``Chafee Amendment,'' named
for the late Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. The amendment empowers the
secretary of state to override any action by the bank that the
secretary determines is not in ``the national interest.'' The law
uses a country's human rights record as an example of a concern
that could lead to canceling a loan; it makes no mention of reform
of a nation's commercial legal structures.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the administration says motivated it to suspend
the loan, administration officials conceded Tuesday that the action
will be interpreted in Moscow as retaliation by the Washington for
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's refusal to back off from the
Chechnya campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This may really be all about promoting rule of law in
Russia,'' one of Clinton's economic aides said late Tuesday. ``But
I wouldn't bet that the Russians are going to read it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days and hours leading up to Albright's letter to the
bank Tuesday afternoon, Harmon came under extraordinary pressure to
back away from the loan. Lobbyists on both sides of the issue
cruised the halls of the Ex-Im bank, across Lafayette Park from the
White House. A series of senior administration officials broadly
hinted that Harmon should become more attuned to the political
difficulties of lending to Russia at a moment when Chechnya was
raging and Moscow was still resisting some of the reforms advocated
by the IMF, according to officials familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But Harmon said that by the criteria his bank was to apply _
putting together financing that will aid American workers with
loans and guarantees to creditworthy foreign firms _ the oil
project should be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted today that the order was
temporary. ``We have issues to work through,'' one senior official
said, ``and when that happens this arrangement will be able to go
forward.''

ARREST HEIGHTENS SECURITY ALERT AT US AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Security is being tightened at the nation's
airports after an Algerian man was charged last week with smuggling
bombmaking materials across the border from British Columbia,
fanning fresh fears about domestic terrorism as Americans prepare
for millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is sending in extra teams
trained to detect even the smallest amount of explosives and
additional FAA inspectors to help monitor security operations at
airports. The agency also said it will have on hand more
bomb-sniffing dogs and more uniformed police patrolling airports,
both inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beefed up patrols at the 301 points of entry into the
United States, including in Maine and Vermont, have already yielded
two arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Bouabide Chamchi, 20, an Algerian with refugee status living in
Montreal, and Lucia Garofalo, 35, a Canadian woman, were arrraigned
Tuesday in Burlington, Vt. on various immigration charges after
being arrested Sunday night by US Border Patrol officers in
Beechers Falls, in Vermont's northeast corner.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday travelers are being urged to arrive at the airport at
least one hour before domestic flights and two hours before
international flights, and to be prepared for strict enforcement of
parking rules. They can also avoid inconvenience by not gift
wrapping packages, the agency said, because they may have to be
opened if something suspicious is seen by x-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by the FAA and the Border Patrol are the latest in a
series of steps taken by the federal government to respond to what
officials have described as a ``heighted security risk'' against
Americans coinciding with the new year and following the arrest in
Washington state last week of Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, 32, who authorities have identified as an Algerian
national traveling on fake Canadian identity papers and linked to
extremists using Montreal as a North American base of operations,
was charged Friday in Seattle with carrying more than 100 pounds of
bombing-making supplies and a sophisticated detonating device
across the border in a rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are looking into whether Ressam was
affiliated with any terrorist group, including the Islamic group
linked to exiled Osama bin Laden, the millionaire Saudi militant
based in Afghanistan for whose apprehension the US State Department
has posted a $5 million reward.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's arrest has sparked concern about domestic terrorism and
apparently precipitated a two-hour meeting Monday at the White
House that included some of President Clinton's top advisers on law
enforcement and foreign policy _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, CIA Director George Tenet,
and General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joseph Lockhart said Clinton did not
attend the meeting, and he tried to play down its importance,
describing the meeting as a routine gathering of officials who
normally discuss terrorism issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I think we have made the case in the past that
the US is not invulnerable to domestic terrorism, but there's not
specific information now about particular targets here.'' He added,
``I don't think there is a scare mode.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other government officials continued to stress Tuesday
that they were unaware of any other specific threats against US
targets, other than the Seattle incident. However, they said the
State Department's travel advisory, warning caution for Americans
traveling abroad for the holidays, still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the Defense Department
has sent two advisories to military installations and commanders
around the world to help them make their own threat assessments and
to devise plans to protect American forces.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Pentagon had taken any extra precautions or
put any additional military assets on standby, Bacon responded,
``Just let me say that we are taking apppropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's deputy spokesman, James B. Foley, said
the U.S. Embassy in Quito, Ecuador, was closed Friday over concern
it might be targeted by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said the agency plans to
update the overseas travel advisory it issued 11 days ago, urging
Americans traveling internationally to take extra care and avoid
large crowds. The official said that update, which will come late
by Thursday at the latest, will include more details about the
plans of 13 members of a terrorist group linked to bin Laden that
Jordanian authorities arrested last week, saying they were planning
attacks against Americans and Israelis, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, which issued its advisory in a statement, said the
increased security is not expected to cause airport delays, but
will be noticeable to passengers. FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto
declined to discuss whether security will be tightened at all major
airports, saying,``That could compromise the very procedures
themselves.''

DAVID AND MADDIE, SO YOUNG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a match made in hell: she with the cool gaze and the
silky long legs, he with the rhythm `n' blues soul and that
incessant smirk. And from the moment Bruce Willis called Cybill
Shepherd a rude five-letter name and she returned the compliment
with a quick hand across his face, viewers were smitten by the
bickering sweethearts and their television love nest,
``Moonlighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, their chemistry seems as potent as ever.
Which is exactly what Bravo was banking on when it acquired 65
episodes of the ABC series and anointed them ``TV too good for
TV,'' an honor already bestowed on 1980s classics like ``Max
Headroom'' and ``Brooklyn Bridge.'' Next Sunday at 1 p.m., Bravo
will introduce its newest addition with a mini-marathon of the
first seven episodes before adding ``Moonlighting'' to its
weeknight lineup at 7 p.m., beginning the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ```Moonlighting' was ahead of its time, a natural,'' said
Frances Berwick, Bravo's senior vice president for programming, who
praises its ``crisp humor, inventive story lines'' and its stars'
lasting appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producer and writer, Glenn Gordon Caron, dreamed up
the series as a comeback vehicle for the model-turned-actress Ms.
Shepherd. ``Moonlighting'' created in her image an alter ego named
Maddie Hayes, a former cover girl left high and dry when her
accountant skips town with her liquid assets in tow _ leaving her
stuck with a money-losing detective agency headed by a
smart-mouthed charmer, David Addison, played by Willis in his first
big role.
</P>
<P>
   Maddie tried to get rid of him. Honestly, she did. But by the
end of the pilot, when David tossed down a blanket on the office
sofa and wagered that she might prefer spending the night at his
place, the audience was betting he wasn't far off the mark. And it
spent the next four years wondering, through sparkling banter, sly
innuendo and a weekly cat-and-mouse game, Would they ever?
</P>
<P>
   By the time they did, in a highly rated 1987 episode, the series
was deemed by critics the best thing to hit television that decade.
The Directors Guild of America, in an unprecedented occurrence,
nominated one episode for best comedy and another for best drama.
Willis won an Emmy. Both stars won Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are better left undone. When the sexual tension
waned, so did the audience's interest, and two seasons languished
beneath desperate plot devices, including a pregnancy for Maddie.
Then, in what felt like a heartbeat, they were gone. Ms. Shepherd
eventually played another version of herself in another sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Willis became one of Hollywood's biggest box-office draws. And
this season, Caron returned with ``Now and Again,'' a series about
a middle-aged man whose brain is transplanted into a young hunk's
body.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of viewers may find relevance in Maddie and
David's capers, a tale of love between two people so perfectly,
wonderfully wrong for each other.

HUD TAKES AWAY CONTROL OF A HOMELESS PROGRAM FROM NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban
development, said on Tuesday that HUD would take direct control of
a program that provides $60 million in federal money for services
for the homeless in New York City, because, he said, the
administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani could not be trusted to
distribute the money fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York
Senate race, said his decision was in response to a recent federal
court decision that found that the Giuliani administration had
improperly blocked an AIDS service organization from receiving
federal money, in retaliation for the organization's frequent
criticism of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow federal funds to be politicized,'' Cuomo said,
in announcing at a State Assembly hearing in Manhattan that city
officials would no longer be responsible for awarding grants under
HUD's Homeless Continuum of Care program. ``We're going to remove
the city of New York from a position of control of those federal
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani swiftly retaliated, accusing Cuomo of playing politics
with the nation's programs for the homeless. Giuliani is Mrs.
Clinton's likely Republican opponent in the Senate race, and her
campaign manager is Bill De Blasio, who until recently was theregional HUD director in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Andrew Cuomo runs a major league
political operation,'' the mayor said at his daily news conference.
``He wants to take over the handing out of money directly, which is
otherwise described as political patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo has made no secret of his political allegiance, and he
told reporters after Tuesday's Assembly hearing that ``Hillary
Rodham Clinton will be the next senator from New York.'' But in his
testimony and in subsequent interviews, he insisted that the
decision to take away the city's control of the program for the
homeless was in response to the recent court decision and other
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 12, Judge Allen G. Schwartz of Federal District Court in
Manhattan ruled that city officials had penalized an AIDS service
organization, Housing Works, for its attacks on the mayor, and
lowered the group's score on a list that prioritizes the city's
needs in regard to homeless services, making it impossible for the
group to win funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Continuum of Care Program provides grants to local nonprofit
social service organizations for a variety of programs that assist
the homeless, including outreach and prevention efforts, job
training, counseling and rent subsidies. Housing Works had sought
$2.4 million for programs for homeless people with AIDS, mental
illness or drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The federal housing agency awards the grants each year based on
a ranking of potential projects that is developed by the city in
consultation with an advisory group of social service providers.
The city is informed beforehand how much money is available so
officials are in a position to know which projects will receive
funding as they develop the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Works programs had initially received scores that
put them 30th and 33rd out of 71 New York City projects, according
to court evidence. Later the city lowered those rankings to 57th
and 60th knowing that the first 56 projects had requested a total
of $53.9 million out of a total of $54 million available for New
York City, Schwartz wrote in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Federal District Court judge says in very clear language
that the process has been politicized, that the group's criticism
of the mayor caused them to lose federal funds'' Cuomo said on
Tuesday. ``So once the federal court says the process is not
working, that the process is tainted, this department as
administrator of those funds must act.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cuomo said that his agency had received numerous complaints
since the program began in 1994 about New York City's role in
ranking projects, including a complaint last year by the Coalition
for the Homeless, another group that is frequently critical of
Giuliani. In a letter to the Coalition in July, housing officials
said the complaint appeared to be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that Cuomo acted too quickly because the city has
appealed the Housing Works case. ``We have learned often that cases
get overturned on appeal,'' he said. ``It happens very very
often.'' The mayor also pointed to previous allegations of
political dealing against Cuomo, including an investigator's
finding last year that housing workers were being used for
political public relations work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, it's quite apparent that he has brought his
politicizing of HUD to New York,'' Giuliani said. ``Now when his
representative who was the regional director of HUD has become
Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, it appears as if he is trying
to direct patronage to those people who are his political
supporters, possibly Al Gore's and others.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he would reconsider his decision if an appeals court
overturned the ruling by Schwartz. He added the mayor's political
charges were an effort to distract people from the real issue of
the city's role in awarding federal grants. ''This has always been
a concern that a city could retaliate against homeless groups by
using the federal funds and holding them hostage,'' he said. Howard
Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, said
that she had not been informed in advance about Cuomo's plan. ``We
had no involvement in the decision and the mayor's policies speak
for itself,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Arkansas state flag was run up the pole at
city hall this summer, New Yorkers were finally forced to
acknowledge the fact that our mayor is campaigning against the city
he was elected to serve The campaign has continued with assaults on
neighborhood parks, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the right to
exercise free speech on the steps of city hall.
</P>
<P>
   This hostility toward creative life _ the soul of New York _
could have the effect of a wake-up call. Our long day-dream of
complacency, our willingness to take culture for granted, could be
coming to an end. This would have a major impact on the city's
architecture. For too long, this art form has been riding on the
coattails of architectural preservation instead of generating the
forward movement on which a great city's vitality depends.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, brought a few welcome signs that New York's
architecture may be rousing itself from its Sleeping Beauty coma.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH TOWER The most important building to be completed in New
York in years. The French architect Christian de Portzamparc
reinvents the spirit of Art Deco for those who imagine that
repeating the 1920s ziggurat motif will bring back Jazz Age
glamour. The building, on East 57th Street near Madison Avenue,
isn't weighted with undue philosophical meaning. It's a pousse-cafe
with changing colors that wash across a faceted crystal facade. A
nos amours!
</P>
<P>
   PENN STATION
</P>
<P>
   Carved out of the interior of the Beaux Arts General Post Office
(James A. Farley) Building on Eighth Avenue, David Childs' design
features a glass and metal space frame arcing over the arrival hall
and waiting areas arrayed on platforms that cascade down to the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyside, Queens. Designed by Greg Lynn, Doug Garofalo and
Michael McInturf, who belong to a coming generation of designers
one might call the Polymorphs. Faced with the threat that advanced
computer technology will deliver architecture over to the world of
virtual reality, these designers are harnassing animation software
to shape real spaces of surprising free-form contour, like the main
sanctuary of this church.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPE STARCK
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Internet has not shattered the appeal of
physical proximity. Even computer companies like to gather in
Silicon Valley. And Stark's relocation from Paris to New York has
already given the local design scene a boost.
</P>
<P>
   CANADIAN CENTER FOR ARCHITECTURE PRIZE FOR THE DESIGN OF CITIES
</P>
<P>
   The first in a series of urban design competitions to be held
every three years in a different city around the world. Of the five
finalists, Cedric Price of Great Britain produced the most
surprising entry. A fusion of historic preservation, sustainable
design and public space, Price's design called for minimal
intervention in a 20-block site on the west side of midtown
Manhattan: a concrete platform encrusted with small glass spheres.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frightening moments of the year occurred at the
opening of the newly restored entertainment palace, when Ann
Margret came onstage and took credit for saving it. The theater
itself, completed in 1932, has been renovated with great fidelity
to detail by Hugh Hardy and now stands revealed as one the
century's greatest spaces.
</P>
<P>
   RIVER HOTEL
</P>
<P>
   Architecture don't get no respect around here. Community
opposition and a flawed master plan helped doom an exemplary design
by the French architect Jean Nouvel for a boutique hotel and
cineplex beneath the Brooklyn side of the Manhattan Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MATRIX''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated virtual sets turned Larry and Andy
Wachowski's sci-fi action movie into a classic urban study in the
tradition of ``Metropolis,'' ``Alphaville'' and ``Blade Runner.''
In this digital twist on City Beautiful design, beauty and city are
both in the eye (and brain) of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   350 MADISON AVENUE
</P>
<P>
   Another one bites the dust. Roger Duffy's stylish para-building,
a vertical addition to an existing midtown office block, took an
important step toward a new design vocabulary for a built-up city.
The design won a Progressive Architecture Award, an honor played up
in ads by the building's developers. Alas, only a fraction of the
design is being built.
</P>
<P>
   CITY HALL PARK
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid-schizoid urbanism at its creepy best. With gas lamps, a
two-tiered fountain and period-piece benches, the park resembles a
Currier and Ives print as interpreted by Tommy Hilfiger for a
Christmas window at Macy's. But this $30 million adventure in theme
park picturesque is actually camouflage for more of Mayor
Giuliani's security installations. Fences, gates, guardhouses and
who knows what manner of tough-guy hardware is buried beneath the
Victorian frou-frou. Nighttime lighting courtesy of Alcatraz.

HIGH DRAMA, REAL LOSS AND QUIZ MADNESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doesn't it seem ``The Sopranos'' has been around forever? And
that the Barbara Walters-Monica Lewinsky interview became part of
pop-cultural history long ago?
</P>
<P>
   The revealing detail about this year's most significant
television events is how quickly they have become absorbed, a
testament to the sound-bite speed of television and the
ever-quickening pace of the world it chronicles and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's impeachment didn't make this list because it
already seems like last year's story. And though the final
impeachment vote happened in 1999, in television terms it
(italics)was(end italics) passe; the long unfolding in 1998 was the
television story, not the deflated result.
</P>
<P>
   In entertainment, it took no time for ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' to raise ABC's fortunes and alter the entire
television landscape, which was desperate for change, any change.
But the copycat quiz shows arriving soon already seem behind the
curve.
</P>
<P>
   And if the most important television events seem distant,
imagine how quickly our collective amnesia will take care of the
non-events. In the new year everyone can be grateful for this: we
can say goodbye to all those tedious millennium wrap-ups (did
anyone stay awake through a single hour?), quietly hoping no one
plans to rerun them next year at this time. Here, in descending
order of their impact, are the most influential events of the
television year:
</P>
<P>
   `WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE'
</P>
<P>
   The cheap little show that came out of nowhere as a summer
replacement is, let's face it, retro and cheesy. But there is no
doubt about the quiz show's appeal, based on a feel-good
philosophy: families can watch together and everyone can sound
smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' gained the kind of humongous ratings a network
show rarely achieves anymore, in this era of splintered audiences
and dozens of cable choices. On the surface, it did nothing more
than unite the country around a dopey catch phrase (``Final
answer?''), but it also sent a message that audiences are hungry
for comfort shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COVERAGE OF JOHN F. KENNEDY JR.'S PLANE CRASH AND FUNERAL
</P>
<P>
   In the doldrums of a summer weekend, when John Kennedy's plane
disappeared, the all-news cable channels leapt in, followed by the
networks. For a full week, television went around the bend. A
legitimate, tragic story was covered as if it were a national
crisis; a promising but unfinished life was inflated to heroic
proportions; television crossed a significant line, creating the
story far more than it covered it, and raising questions about the
future of journalism. Will a celebrity-driven cable approach steer
all the news from now on?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BARBARA WALTERS-MONICA LEWINSKY INTERVIEW
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few people paid attention when the impeachment vote
was televised, but the Lewinsky interview drew an incredible
audience of 70 million and is already an iconic event. We can all
see her in our minds, with her slicked-back hair and giggle,
talking about her boyfriend the president. Ms. Walters allowed the
guest to reveal herself in all her self-delusion, and so made this
the ultimate (though not the final) word on everything Monica. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE SOPRANOS'
</P>
<P>
   The year's towering achievement and the most talked-about series
in years, ``The Sopranos'' deserves all the attention. It is that
rare thing, a work of art that is tough, intelligent and daring
enough to generate sympathy for a coldblooded killer. When the
original series begins running again Sunday night on HBO, it offers
a chance to appreciate how nuanced the story of Tony Soprano and
his families, nuclear and Mafia varieties, really is. The second
season begins on Jan. 16, facing insanely high expectations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOT-COM COMMERCIALS
</P>
<P>
   Television has become flooded with commercials for Internet
companies. Some are ordinary, with celebrity shills. William
Shatner urges viewers to buy everything from plane tickets to
groceries online. (``No deliveries,'' he cheers, as if that's a
good thing.) Others are mini-shows, like Amazon.com's campy
musicals for Christmas, with a chorus of men in Andy Williams
sweaters assuring us that the Internet is a cozy site for
old-fashioned holiday shopping. The inescapable dot-com ads are
harbingers of the changing world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COVERAGE OF THE COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTINGS
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the shootings, television became an ambiguous
force on the scene. Students who witnessed the killings were
quickly put on camera, and the spectacle eerily moved back and
forth across a line separating catharsis from self-aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
   The instant analysis made the entertainment industry the easy
scapegoat once more, as pundits shied away from the more difficult
issue: the difference between entertainment as a direct cause of
violent behavior, and as simply one factor among many. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE WEST WING' AND THE RISE OF DRAMAS
</P>
<P>
   With its acerbic view of politics and its textured depiction of
life among the White House staff, ``The West Wing'' has become the
season's best, most absorbing, most ambitious series (despite an
unrelenting mushiness in the form of its sappy fictional president,
played by Martin Sheen).
</P>
<P>
   Other dramas have filled the networks, too: the engaging
``Judging Amy'' has consistently improved, while ``Once and Again''
and ``Now and Again'' have floundered (so maybe you never will have
to tell them apart). And as dramas have risen, sitcoms have
crashed; not a single new comedy made any impact this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MORNING SHOW WARS
</P>
<P>
   ABC's sinking ``Good Morning America'' brought on Diane Sawyer
and Charles Gibson as co-anchors and unveiled a dazzling new studio
with a view of Times Square. And though NBC's ``Today'' remains at
the top of the ratings, the revitalized ``GMA'' now seems fresher
and livelier than its competition. Meanwhile, CBS built a new
morning show and extravagant studio around Bryant Gumbel and nobody
cared, as ``The Early Show'' at times tumbled in the ratings below
the scarcely watched version it had replaced.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY' (PBS) AND `STRANGE JUSTICE' (SHOWTIME)
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Fox's 10-hour PBS documentary about an interracial
family and Showtimes' fiery drama based on the Clarence
Thomas-Anita Hill sexual harassment hearings offered new
perspectives on both race and sex. These lively, accomplished works
prove that serious issues don't have to be treated in a deadly,
earnest way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NAACP BOYCOTT THAT WASN'T
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP had an excellent point about the lack of black actors
in leading roles this season, but the group seemed weakened when
its loudly threatened boycott of a-network-to-be-announced never
happened. Still, the networks scrambled to sign minority producers
and stars to contracts, offering at least the possibility of a more
equitable future.

MAYOR SEES A SAFE TIMES SQUARE AT NEW YEAR'S
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to rising concerns about possible
terrorist acts on New Year's Eve, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Tuesday that there was no evidence of any specific plot against New
York City and outlined painstaking plans to maintain order in Times
Square, where up to 2 million people are expected to ring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said there was no reason to avoid millennium
celebrations in Times Square, despite comments to that effect by
some law enforcement experts, most notably Jim Kallstrom, the
former head of the New York office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In television interviews and in an article in the New York Post
on Tuesday, Kallstrom said that he would avoid Times Square,
because terrorists gravitate to crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the New Year's Eve celebration, Giuliani said, ``I
think everybody but Jim Kallstrom is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Giuliani said, the city ``will be as safe on New
Year's Eve as it is on any other day of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that bomb-sniffing dogs would patrol tunnels
beneath the streets, workers who need to traverse the side streets
around Times Square would be required to have passes, and 7,000
uniformed and undercover police officers would mingle with the New
Year's Eve crowds, a duty usually handled by 4,800 officers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spoke at a news conference at City Hall that was
intended to spell out the work the city had done to cleanse its
computer systems of vulnerability to the Year 2000 computer
problem. He was flanked by his police and fire commissioners and
representatives of the city's power and telephone companies, all of
whom spelled out precautions being taken to keep things running.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that the city, after spending more than $350
million, had finished checking its hundreds of computers, 11,000
traffic lights and other equipment for malfunctions and said he was
confident that power, phones, elevators and the rest of the city's
electronic and electrical underpinnings would work.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said every
city computer had been checked three times. ``We could test things
again if we need to, but it would just be testing for testing's
sake,'' Lhota said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Questions at the news conference focused on whether the arrest
last week of an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, who was carrying
bomb-making materials as he tried to enter Washington state from
Canada, raised concerns about possible attacks on the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we live in a dangerous world and that
terrorism is a reality,'' Giuliani said. ``But I really think
people should not allow themselves to get overexcited about this.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said: ``We're in constant
contact with our federal partners. There's absolutely no indication
of any specific threat against New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   James G. Natoli, Gov. George Pataki's director of state
operations, said that investigations of possible movements of
terrorists from Canada into this country were noteworthy, but had
not led to any greater level of alert in New York state than
already existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think terrorism has certainly been something on our radar
scope,'' he said. ``That's part of prudent planning. But we're not
really concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the state and city would be in continual contact in the
hours before and after New Year's Eve with state troopers at the
city's police and emergency management command centers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected crowds, Times Square would make a poor
target for terrorism, said Brendan Sexton, president of the Times
Square Business Improvement District, one of the groups organizing
the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police start checking people a couple of blocks away,'' he
said. ``They are looking for alcohol, so people get a visual
once-over. Once you finally get here, there are more cops than
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Kallstrom echoed that view and said that his
earlier remarks were not intended to indicate that he knew of
specific threats to New York City. ``I wouldn't go to Times Square,
and I wouldn't go to downtown Philadelphia, but that's not because
I have some specific information,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is one of the best protected and best policed
cities in the world,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In parallel preparations, officials at the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey said its entire police force of 1,250 officers
would be deployed around New Year's Eve at the city's airports, at
Port Authority bridges and at other vulnerable spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our police will be on duty, and extra civilian personnel
will be on hand to ensure that everybody has a safe and happy New
Year's Eve,'' said Robert E. Boyle, executive director of the Port
Authority.

IN ISTANBUL A BIENNIAL OFFERS THE SOLACE OF ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Rome was ever Rome, and thus counts as
eternal. Istanbul bears a more recent name, but its history as
Constantinople and Byzantium goes back just as far. Here is a city
that has seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, New York was born yesterday. Which may account
for the uproar over Chris Ofili's ``Holy Virgin Mary'' at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art's much-scrutinized and reviled show
``Sensation.'' Could the same thing have happened on the Bosporus?
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Ofili was among the 56 artists from 32 countries
invited to the sixth International Istanbul Biennial this fall
(Sept. 17-Oct. 30). His hip, jazzy pieces gave the catalog its most
eye-catching pages. His unorthodox materials went unremarked.
Sacred or sacrilegious, this, too, would pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks, of course, had graver matters on their minds. On Aug.
17, the ground shook, claiming lives by the thousands. Sakir
Eczacibasi, the chairman of the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and
Arts, organizers of the Biennial, recalled the horror and its
effect on the show in a statement called ``The Earthquake
Biennial'': &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden the world shook, the earth split and the skies
fell. A convulsion. A convulsion followed by innumerable
after-quakes and shocks ... People lay entombed under the ground,
imprisoned in heaps of rubble, or submerged under water ... Towns
and villages were erased from the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement asked, ``In such conditions, could one think of
presenting an arts festival, an international biennial? What if
something should happen to Istanbul?'' It then quoted the show's
curator. ```The Biennial must take place,' said Paolo Colombo. Now,
more than ever, we are convinced, there is a need for the
solidarity and solace y the arts, the pleasures they provide
and the confidence they engender. All the artists invited are
actually participating in the Biennial. They are all coming to
share the grief, support the efforts and give comfort, in the most
sincere way possible, by donating their work.''
</P>
<P>
   In his day job, the intrepid Colombo directs the Centre d'Art
Contemporain in Geneva. That may be where he learned to cut a wide
swath through fashionable isms, from the neatly formalist to the
sloppily confessional. The theme of the Istanbul show was the
Passion and the Wave, an elaborate translingual allusion to the
city's cultural traditions and its strategic place on the seaways,
exploiting the pun between dalga (Turkish for wave) and dalgas
(Greek for passion). The poster for the show showed a clown napping
peacefully in the depths of the sea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had the foundation done a poor job getting the word out around
the world? Or was that simply not the point? In late October, I was
visiting Istanbul along with a group of American art correspondents
for an on-site preview of ``Palace of Gold and Light: Treasures
from the Topkapi,'' an exhibition opening at the Corcoran Gallery
of Art in Washington next spring. (It then travels to the San Diego
Museum of Art and the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)
</P>
<P>
   Our interests ranged from the ancient to the up-to-the-minute,
but not one of us had a clue the Biennial was going on until we
chanced upon a piece of it in the subterranean Yerebatan (or
Basilica) Cistern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Situated across a busy thoroughfare from Hagia Sophia, the
awesome Mother Church of Christendom, the cistern dates from the
reign of Justinian, in the sixth century. A palace reservoir, it
seems a palace in its own right. Hilary Sumner-Boyd and John
Freely's ``Strolling Through Istanbul,'' the locally published
English-language guidebook connoisseurs of the city swear by, gives
its dimensions as 460 feet by 230 feet. The columns, 336 of them
arranged in 12 rows of 28 each, stand about 26 feet high and 13
feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The columns,'' the book further notes, ``are topped by
Byzantine Corinthian capitals that have imposts above them which
support little domes of brick in a herring-bone pattern.'' It
leaves readers to discover for themselves two astonishing pillars
toward the back _ or rather the blocks they stand on, with sides
measuring about a yard, upon which is carved the face of the
sublime Medusa. One rests on a wet cheek. Her twin is upside down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the weeks of the Biennial, the Medusas were not the only
surprises. The most remarkable of them lay slightly below the line
of sight, not far from the walkway that leads the visitor pretty
much dry-shod above the cistern's mirror of black water. It
consisted of spheres of various sizes, arranged like planets in
their orbit on the ecliptic, palely colored in vaguely horizontal
bands.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the vaults, they appeared a sort of cosmos suspended in
the architecture of infinite space. Up close, the color resolved
into the blinking eyes of an installation called ``Refraction.'' It
was by an artist with whom the American art audience is well
acquainted: Tony Oursler, of New York, who projects films of living
faces on the blank faces of rag dolls (often with a quietly ominous
soundtrack).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Samples are on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art right
now, in Part II of ``The American Century.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only six of the nearly 60 Biennial artists showed at the
cistern. Of the other exhibits there, the most fetching was by the
South African William Kentridge, who used a convenient wall as the
screen for a folklike little shadow-play. It depicted what I
imagined to be victims of apartheid _ young and old, fit and
crippled _ dancing free from bondage. The context of antiquity lent
no extra resonance, but the generosity with which joy and outrage
were held in balance was remarkable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of other Istanbul monuments, Hagia Eirene, the
Church of the Divine Peace, is called a museum now, though in its
emptiness it scarcely feels like one. Here, too, on the site of
what tradition calls the oldest Christian church of old Byzantium,
the Biennial had set up shop with sparsely scattered works by some
20 artists.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Turk of Britain, a great recycler and deconstructor of
avant-garde precursors, delivered a life-size, disconcertingly
lifelike waxwork of himself as tramp, dressed in his own
urine-stained, sweat-soaked clothing. Instinctively, visitors gave
it plenty of space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian team of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller
constructed an empty movie theater in miniature, where they showed
a miniature thriller somewhat more polished than ``The Blair Witch
Project.'' On earphones, you could follow the mutterings of an
unseen couple at the movies increasingly unnerved by a possible
stalker.
</P>
<P>
   On a stage the full width of the nave, Ugo Rondinone of
Switzerland placed a poetic grove of wintry trees. On a balcony,
Ebru Ozcecen of Turkey weighed in with a chandelier heavy with
translucent fruit molded (it turned out) of sugar melted in water.
Whatever these things amounted to, they showed wit, craft and a
sense of play.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, it was only Oursler who married the
temporary-contemporary to the timeless, this time by projecting a
single blinking eye into the apex of the dome, from which it stared
down like the unsleeping eye of heaven. The early Christians would
have understood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not until the flight home was there leisure to study the
literature, which revealed that the other artists, roughly half the
elect, had been quartered in the Dolmabahce Cultural Center, a
gargantuan Second Empire palace, done up by the decorator of the
Paris Opera. The state rooms and royal apartments are fabled for
their chandeliers (including the world's largest) and a state
staircase in rock crystal by Baccarat, worthy of Cinderella. We
missed all this, but it will be there next time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or will it? One night in Istanbul, I slept through a tremor
registering a light 4-plus on the Richter scale. The next morning,
local residents were very spooked. On Nov. 12, three weeks after
our visit, Turkey was rattled by another major quake, topping 7.
Again, hundreds died. But the epicenter was nowhere near Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   A Turkish acquaintance in New York says that his parents, who
live there, are carrying emergency packs with them everywhere now.
``The seismologists predict that the next big one will hit the city
tomorrow or in 30 years,'' he tells me. ``What does that mean?
Nothing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life is short, they say, and art is long. Acts of God put lesser
things in perspective. Still, Colombo was right. Canceling tomorrow
is not an option.

 &HT;    To makers of 'Man on the Moon': Thank you very much
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Kaufman would have loved the opening of ``Man on the
Moon,'' director Milos Forman's compelling film biography of the
late comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey, whose performance is so spot-on that he looks to be
channeling Kaufman, appears as Andy's ``foreign man'' character and
shoos the audience out of the theater. It's absolutely hilarious
and perfectly captures Kaufman's anarchic spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as Latka on television's ``Taxi,'' Kaufman was an
innovative, eccentric comic who eschewed traditional setups and
punchlines in favor of off-the-wall routines that would have him
mouthing the words to the Mighty Mouse theme _ just the refrain,
mind you _ or leading the audience in a nonsensical
call-and-response sing-along.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're insane, but you may also be brilliant,'' his manager,
George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), tells him shortly after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, who died in 1984 at age 35 from a rare form of cancer,
could be considered the first performance artist or ``alternative''
comedian. He seems an unlikely subject for a feature film, but so
did Z-grade moviemaker Ed Wood and porn publisher Larry Flynt,
whose lives also were sharply translated to the screen by writers
Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as the acclaimed dramas ``Ed
Wood'' and ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   Forman, an Oscar nominee for the latter film and two-time winner
for ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Amadeus,'' presents
Kaufman's story in a highly entertaining manner _ thanks in no
small part to Carrey's astonishing performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' is funny, sad and unsettling _ much like
Kaufman's career _ and it stays with you long after you leave the
theater. Unless, of course, you exit at the comic's behest before
the movie begins.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet Kaufman as a television-obsessed youngster from
Long Island, N.Y., singing a children's song to his little sister.
Cut to a comedy club, where an adult Andy performs the same tune to
a dumbfounded audience as part of his act.
</P>
<P>
   The story unfolds in vignettes, re-creating career high and low
points with such actual participants as David Letterman, Lorne
Michaels, Jerry Lawler and the cast of ``Taxi'' playing themselves.
Paul Giamatti, who co-starred with Carrey in ``The Truman Show,''
portrays Kaufman's best friend and writing partner, Bob Zmuda.
Courtney Love, a Golden Globe Award nominee for ``The People vs.
Larry Flynt,'' plays girlfriend Lynn Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman enjoyed provoking people on and off stage, rarely
breaking character or letting his friends and audiences in on the
gag. Often he would carry a joke too far, as with his boorish
alter-ego, lounge singer Tony Clifton, and his bad-boy wrestling
persona.
</P>
<P>
   When Kaufman tells his inner circle that he has cancer, Shapiro
responds: ``That's in terrible taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey immerses himself in the role, impersonating Andy's
voices, expressions and mannerisms while more deeply conveying the
comic's fearlessness and passion. His wholly convincing performance
is sure to bring him an Oscar nomination for best actor,
compensating for last year's snub by the Academy for his fine work
in ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey develops nice chemistry with DeVito, who co-starred with
Kaufman on ``Taxi'' and produced the film. The role of Shapiro
allows DeVito to play a nice guy for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' doesn't give us a sense of what inspired
Kaufman's bizarrely amusing and often confrontation style, nor does
it convey who he was off stage. But then, his life was a
performance, and few people probably saw who he was inside. As
Margulies says, ``There is no real you.''
</P>
<P>
   The bittersweet finale lends credence to those who suspect that
Kaufman's death was just another elaborate put-on. Wherever Andy
may be, he's certainly laughing.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get the lists out of the way first. The year's handsomest
shows of old art, by medium: bronzes by the sculptor Adriaen de
Vries at the Getty, drawings and paintings by Ingres, and
photographs by Carleton Watkins, both at the Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise of the year: Frank Hurley's photographs, at
the American Museum of Natural History, from Ernest Shackleton's
epic 1914 expedition to Antarctica, one of the great stories of
modern exploration, which turned out to have produced remarkable
pictures of the end of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The most dutiful survey: the American Century exhibitions at the
Whitney. The best contemporary sculpture show: the same Richard
Serras that looked great in New York and Los Angeles last year
looked greater still in Bilbao, Spain; his ``Torqued Ellipses''
found their perfect home in the big ``fish'' room of Frank Gehry's
Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   The year's most peculiar and extravagant new work of art:
naturally, Matthew Barney's fourth and next-to-last installment of
his ``Cremaster'' film series, ``Cremaster 2,'' a highly personal
saga linked loosely to the story of Gary Gilmore, the murderer from
Utah, that caused the usual number of heads to be scratched while
confirming that Barney is, if nothing else, still very much
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hands down, the exhibition of 46 Cezanne watercolors at
Acquavella Galleries in New York was the local gallery show of the
year: a museum-quality display, which reminded everyone why
Cezanne, who died at the beginning of the century, at the end of
the century is still the most astonishing modern painter of
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   He could somehow make the white of a blank page evoke the
southern French countryside in springtime and turn a bunch of lumpy
rocks in the woods into the stuff of erotic dreams.
</P>
<P>
   A few shows made the world seem a little bigger and better:
``The Experimental Exercise of Freedom'' at the Los Angeles Museum
of Contemporary Art (it's still on view through Jan. 23), which
features Latin American avant-gardists of the '60s like Lygia Clark
and Helio Oiticica, and the current retrospective at the New Museum
in Manhattan of Cildo Meireles, the Brazilian artist, who followed
their lead. And Cai Guo-Qiang, the Chinese artist living in New
York who won a prize at this year's Venice Biennale, set off
fireworks over Vienna for a show that left a brief but indelible
mark in time.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Venice, the organizers of the Biennale finally
figured out how to deal with the circus atmosphere of the big
international survey: accept it. No summing up of the state of art
in the world. The new strategy is to cater to the appetites of
people who want to snack among hundreds of different works, people
who might prefer to be contemplating a steaming bowl of spaghetti
with clams or drinking a pink Bellini at Harry's Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The result: user friendly, quickly digestible, easily forgotten
videos, installations and sculptures. Video ruled because moving
images are attention magnets, but in all sorts of media the
biennale made clear that festival art, the late 20th century's last
hothouse art phenomenon, has become a peculiar kind of genre in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   This may turn out to mean nothing, but did you notice that in
mid-November, Jeff Koons' ``Pink Panther'' sold for $1.8 million
and a Martin Kippenberger painting of a man in boxers fetched
$717,500 at Christie's? An intoxicated art market suddenly seemed
as if it were reprising that moment just before the crash a decade
ago, when crazy people were paying crazy amounts for what turned
out to be crazy investments, and shortly ended up losing fortunes.
One dealer at this auction suggested that there is ``just too much
money around.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn and ``Sensation'': enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Although, while we're on the subject of collectors' collection
exhibitions, the best show of the kind this year: ``The Eye of
Duncan Phillips,'' in Washington (through Jan. 23), a celebration
of a man who first thought modern art was a sham, then was
converted to it and became one of the most passionate, articulate,
perceptive and generous collectors in American history. Phillips
loved painting especially, and the show, like his museum, which was
the first in the country dedicated to modern art, conveys his lyric
and joyous sensibility. Phillips proves that that it always pays to
keep your eyes, and mind, open.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two deaths: Paul Mellon, who died in February, was one
of the last, and the greatest, of the patrician patrons of the
postwar period in America, a man who quietly gave nearly $1 billion
over the years to what he loved and what he also thought would
benefit the country: to the National Gallery of Art, which had been
founded by his father, to the Yale Center for British Art, which he
had founded himself, to the restoration of Monticello, to various
libraries, to the Bollingen Foundation to publish literature, and
to many other serious projects.
</P>
<P>
   He never wanted his name carved on a building, figuring that no
one else would want to give money to something that said Mellon on
the outside of it, but also because he valued privacy almost as
much as he loved paintings and race horses. He was a gentleman who
turned benefaction into an art, and his death, at 91, ended an era.
</P>
<P>
   An era also ended with Leo Castelli's death at 91 in August. He
helped to put American Pop, Minimalism, Post-Minimalism and
Conceptualism on the international map, and did so with style _ a
certain suave, calculating, late Austro-Hungarian Empire style _
which is to say he was a cunning businessman as well as a believer
in the new.
</P>
<P>
   He had an eye, but more to the point, he had good ears,
listening to what people were talking about. The ultimate
cosmopolite, he was the supreme salesman in this country of and for
contemporary art who became the most coveted dealer among artists
because he treated them with the respect he also gave to
collectors. At a time when it was nearly unheard of, he put artists
on stipends, buying their loyalty (at least for a while) and
letting them be productive even if they weren't selling.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Trieste, trained as a lawyer in Milan, Castelli worked
for an insurance company in Bucharest and as a banker and then an
art dealer in Paris until World War II, when he served in the
United States Army, after which he took his time before opening a
gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Richard
Serra and Frank Stella were a few of the obvious reasons his place
became a magnet and lightning rod. It stayed that way during some
of the most important and tumultuous years in the third quarter of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``One does not have to like it, but one cannot discard it,'' he
said about the work he represented. ``One can lament a certain
fashion, but one ... just cannot say: `This is not art, it will go
away.'''

`GOALS 2000' SCORECARD: FAILURE PITCHES A SHUTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Lessons Column) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1989, President George Bush and the nation's governors set
six education goals for the year 2000. In 1994, with President
Clinton's endorsement, Congress adopted them, adding two more.
</P>
<P>
   We can now declare defeat, having flunked all eight goals we
were to reach by the millennium. What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Some ``Goals 2000'' were ridiculous in the first place. Others
required substantial resources to accomplish, and these were not
provided. Still others required far more than 11 years to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The very leaders who set these national goals now demand
accountability from districts and schools: principals and teachers
should suffer consequences for not meeting state targets that
sprang from the nationwide goals. But when national leaders fall
short of goals, why do they not face similar sanctions? Policy
makers' lack of candor about the irresponsible way the goals were
set can breed local educators' contempt for the entire standards
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The goals were these:
</P>
<P>
   _By 2000, all children will start school ready to learn.
</P>
<P>
   _Ninety percent will graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   _All will demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter
in English, math, science, foreign languages, civics, economics,
the arts, history and geography.
</P>
<P>
   _The United States will be first in the world in math and
science.
</P>
<P>
   _All adults will be literate.
</P>
<P>
   _No school will have drugs, violence, firearms or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   _Teachers will have needed skills.
</P>
<P>
   _All schools will get parents involved.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with unmet goals, it is easy to maintain that sincere
effort was all that mattered. That is the approach taken by the
National Education Goals Panel, an agency run by governors, members
of Congress, state legislators and federal education officials.
Ducking accountability, the panel earlier this year proposed
changing the name ``Goals 2000'' to ``America's Education Goals,''
dropping any mention of deadlines. Then, in its 1999 report, it
stated that its ``bold venture'' had worked, because the goals had
``helped stimulate reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, declaring victory may be OK for dieters who lose 5 pounds
after aiming for 15, but defining success downward is dicier for
national goals to improve education. If we are serious about making
schools accountable, then the lack of consequence when we set
national goals and fail to meet them sends educators the wrong
message. Will we permit schools to claim that standards were met if
they merely ``stimulate reforms''?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most irresponsible goal was the one calling for the
nation to be first in math and science. We shouldn't want first
place even if we could have it. Koreans and Japanese score high not
only with curriculum we might emulate but also by subjecting
children to intense cramming and competitive test pressure. These
days Japan's news media are agonizing over the murder of a
2-year-old by the jealous mother of another toddler, who had scored
less well on preschool exams. If this is what ``first in the
world'' entails, we don't want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should aim for fifth, not first. Or perhaps we should
seek absolute standards and ignore international ranking. The
glibness of ``being first'' is worrisome, because it invites
districts and schools also to set glib goals. Can we expect them to
be more responsible than presidents, governors and Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A better goal, but one that was set without necessary resources,
was that all children start school ready to learn. The goals panel
says this meant that by 2000, all would ``have access to
high-quality and developmentally appropriate preschool.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the national political leaders who set this goal have also
failed, since 1989, to finance such programs. France, on the other
hand, finances quality preschool for all 3-to-5-year-olds. If we
really want first-in-the-world status, here is a more worthy
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Universal adult literacy was another goal where lack of
financing made a mockery of our ambition. To fulfill it would have
required expanded community and public-library programs, evening
schools and instruction based in the workplace. Financing these was
never on goal-setters' agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Academic proficiency is what most people want goals to inspire,
but here we can't monitor national progress because while Congress
set goals for achievement, it couldn't agree on national standards
or tests to measure it. Thus, each state (except Iowa, which
declines to participate) now sets its own standards. What is
``competent'' in one state is not in others, so we can't know how
far we are from ``all'' students' demonstrating ``competency over
challenging subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Standards-setting is serious business, and carefully reasoned
goals can spur achievement, entitling those meeting them to
rewards. Goals we can't (or shouldn't) meet only promote cynicism.
To reform the school reform movement, holding those accountable who
so recklessly established ``Goals 2000'' might be a good place to
start.

DEADLY ORE WAS SHIPPED AROUND U.S., CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The asbestos-tainted ore that killed and sickened hundreds of
miners and their families in Libby, Mont., didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of pounds of the ore were shipped from a mine near
Libby to at least 60 processing plants throughout the United States
and Canada, causing workers at many of those plants to become ill
and die, a Post-Intelligencer investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
   As they did with the miners, the W.R. Grace Co. and the earlier
owners of the vermiculite mine on Zonolite Mountain kept
information about the lethal nature of the tremolite asbestos
fibers from the men expanding and processing the brownish-pink
vermiculite into insulation, potting soil, fireproofing, cement
mixtures and dozens of other products.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers and family members killed by asbestosis,
lung cancer and mesothelioma at these vermiculite plants will
probably never be known, because of the transient nature of the
work force and because in many cases, as in Libby, the deaths were
attributed to a litany of other diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grace had a difficult time pinning down the number of
employees affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among expansion-plant employees, the high employee turnover
and a variety of past exposures make conclusions difficult,'' says
a May 1977 internal report on tremolite in vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   However, one fact in that Grace report did offer an alarming
indication of the possible scope of the danger:
</P>
<P>
   ``Among 14 employees with 10 or more years of service in
expanding plants which have used Libby ore, 28 percent exhibited
asbestosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers and their families never suspected that
asbestos was making them sick, because they were not told there was
asbestos in the vermiculite ore they worked with.
</P>
<P>
   A P-I investigation published last month documented the
devastation to miners and their families in Libby, a small
northwestern Montana town. The stories showed that Grace, the
Zonolite Co. before it and government regulators ignored the signs
of widespread asbestos contamination that doctors and health
officials say will be killing people for many years to come. The
mine was open from 1924 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enormity of the atrocities committed by Grace on the
citizens of Libby is too great to fathom,'' said Donald Judge, the
head of the Montana AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we're just now discovering, it not only happened to the
citizens of Libby, but dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of
workers throughout the nation are also dead or dying because no one
told them about the danger they were breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge, who earlier this month apologized before an emotional,
packed town meeting for the union's failure to do enough to protect
Libby's miners, said Grace could have protected its workers without
major effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``By simply telling the workers what they were handling and then
taking appropriate safety measures, it wouldn't have happened,''
Judge said. ``It didn't have to happen. The cover-up perpetrated by
Grace is not only immoral, but should be criminal, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's vice president of corporate communication declined
requests to answer questions for this story. In a letter responding
to the P-I's detailed request, William Corcoran said that Grace
personnel were too busy ``helping the people of Libby'' to address
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one left''
</P>
<P>
   Information gleaned from worker compensation offices, health
departments, death certificates, government archives and thousands
of court documents shows that workers at many of Grace's Zonolite
processing plants died or became ill from exposure to asbestos
contained in the Libby ore, or from asbestos added to the products
they were making.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of company documents, letters, memos and reports
collected by the P-I show that the Zonolite Co. and Grace, which
bought the mine from Zonolite in 1963, knew that workers were at
risk. Workers and managers at the expansion plants say they weren't
told.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never were told a thing about that ore being dangerous or
having asbestos in it. Nobody never told me nothing about this
stuff being able to kill you,'' said Arland Blanton, a plant
manager and superintendent of the vermiculite plant in North Little
Rock, Ark., from 1951 until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he knew the ore from Libby was dangerous,
Blanton's normally strong voice dropped to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about the only one left,'' the 82-year-old man said.
``Most of the rest of them are dead. The asbestos got them. All of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe the dust from that vermiculite. It was so
thick that you couldn't see your hands at times,'' Blanton said.
``Had a boy that worked for me that lived in a house nearby and he
used to say that he would have to shake his sheets out every
morning to get the dust off.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them, Zonolite and Grace, just said there was nothing
in that dust that can hurt you. There's a lot of people dead today
who would still be alive if we were told the truth about that
ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton says he does not know how many Little Rock workers were
exposed to the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually had about a dozen workers a day, maybe up to 30
when we ran three shifts,'' he said. ``A whole bunch of men moved
through there over the years. I wonder how many of them are still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Grace's managers criticized the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good company,'' said Courtland Lowe, a former Grace
regional manager in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace did everything they could to comply with all the laws
and regulations at the time,'' Lowe said, declining to discuss it
further.
</P>
<P>
   The company provided the P-I with a list of 51 plants the
company either owned or contracted with to process the vermiculite
ore. Several independent firms that processed the raw ore were
identified from court documents, and former Grace managers say
there were dozens of other such high-volume customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an old gypsum plant in Seattle received large
amounts of Zonolite, but like so many others, does not appear on
Grace's list. At least 59 plants in 29 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and four provinces of Canada are known to
have processed Zonolite ore from Libby.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the ore shipped to the expansion plants, usually
about 300 million pounds a year, came from Libby. A much smaller
percentage came from Grace's mine near Enoree, S.C., which is still
in operation. Grace officials say there is little or no tremolite
in the ore from the Enoree mine.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of most of the expansion plants was a furnace or oven,
where the vermiculite ore was baked at about 2,000 degrees. The
microscopic amount of water between the layers of the vermiculite
boils and expands or exfoliates each piece of ore into a puff 12 to
15 times larger.
</P>
<P>
   The material was then bagged and sold as roof or wall insulation
or soil expander or mixed with clay, gypsum, commercial asbestos
and pigments to produce fireproofing and various construction
products. They also made a product called Verxite, an ingredient
for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never told the workers''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sheeran worked for Grace for 22 years. He began as a
salesman in the Dearborn, Mich., plant and wound up in 1991 as
sales manger for the Dallas operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Grace's vermiculite products sold like mad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of bags of that stuff from Libby was sold in Michigan
as attic fill insulation,'' he recalled. ``They couldn't get it
fast enough. Most of the homes in Flint are filled with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he may have liked selling the products, he had little
positive to say about the management.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never told the workers the vermiculite was hazardous, or
even the pure asbestos they were adding to some products, never
said a word, absolutely not,'' Sheeran said. ``It was purely
economics. It would have cost them money to make the operation
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas plant, he said, was in an area called Little Mexico
and bordered a large black neighborhood. Most of the workers were
transient blacks or Hispanics who crossed the border to work,
Sheeran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grace management has had a stonewall attitude all their
lives and they don't think much of little people,'' Sheeran said.
``The way they treated their workers was a huge injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheeran recalled that at one point, the Libby plant started
shipping the raw ore to Dallas with a coating of soybean oil, to
avoid the railroad having to put skull and crossbones on the bulk
cars. ``It all smelled like french fries when they expanded it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Junker was the treasurer and superintendent of the Dallas
operation where Sheeran worked. In court documents filed in 1991,
he said that he had discussions with Grace about asbestos, ``but we
didn't discuss it with the men that worked in it'' because Junker
didn't want to ``get them all shook up about maybe nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy says you get asbestosis from asbestos, but that
doesn't necessarily mean you do,'' he said. ``I didn't want to
cause a lot of uproar because nothing was official. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go out to a couple of black men on the line and tell
them that they're going to die tomorrow from asbestos breathing and
expect them to even come into the plant tomorrow. You just don't do
it,'' Junker said in a deposition taken in a civil suit against his
company.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for Zonolite and Grace for 31 years. He began as a
bookkeeper for Zonolite in Chicago and in San Antonio and wound up
running the Texas Vermiculite Co.
</P>
<P>
   Junker had equally strong views about a company's need to warn
consumers about a potentially dangerous product.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the public about a potential hazard _ that's what this
is, a potential hazard _ is kind of asinine,'' the plant
superintendent said in his deposition. He added, ``It's bad for
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he mourned the day in 1973 Grace managers ordered the
company to stop marketing products containing added asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had a good thing until they said it was not,''
Junker said. ``It broke all of our hearts because it cut profits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious health hazard''
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents show that the company knew there was a
significant health hazard to the workers handling the ore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, R.M. Vining, the head of the company's construction
products division, wrote a detailed report on vermiculite to the
company's president, Peter Grace.
</P>
<P>
   A major program was needed to ``eliminate a serious health
hazard caused by the presence of vermiculite and asbestos dust in
the mill and expansion plants,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust problem is particularly serious since the vermiculite
ore from Libby contains tremolite asbestos. This material is
difficult to separate from the vermiculite in the mill and is
usually part of the rock remaining in the concentrate when shipped.
Tremolite asbestos is a definite health hazard at both the Libby
operation and at the expansion plants using the ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet documents show that managers from plants using Zonolite as
far away as Australia and Winnipeg were told there was nothing
harmful in the ore. Grace frequently responded by talking about
``nuisance dust.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, seven years after Vining's memo to Peter Grace, the
company told the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration that tremolite was not hazardous and did not cause
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Health questions had surfaced in the 1960s from private
companies licensed by Grace to use the vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson Insulation in Great Falls, Mont., used ore from Libby
for more than a half century, from the early 1930s through 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The ore would arrive in 40-foot-long boxcars, each containing 50
tons of vermiculite. As the demand increased, 100-ton cars were
added. About 2,000 tons a year was delivered to the small plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take two men a day to unload and it was extremely
dusty,'' Floyd Gebert, the plant's general manager, said in court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always dust around vermiculite, whether it's expanded
or unexpanded.''
</P>
<P>
   While the workers may not have known what they were handling,
Gebert said he knew there was asbestos in the vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was asbestos in the mountain and they were trying
to mine it and sell it,'' he recalled, admitting that he was
puzzled about the hazard labels on the box cars hauling the ore to
Robinson's plant in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sign on the boxcars warning the ore may contain
asbestos,'' Gebert said. ``You know, I never saw a sign on any of
the cars that came to Great Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebert said the first official notice of dangers of asbestos
from Grace was in January 1973. He was told by his doctors in the
early 1980s that he had asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the small work force at the Great Falls plant, four have
died of asbestos-related diseases and four others currently have
the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At least four former employees of the Burlington Northern
railroad who say they handled the ore from Libby have become ill
with asbestosis. Another died last year of mesothelioma, said two
lawyers in Dallas and Houston who are representing the former
railroad workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just dropped the ball''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, one of Grace's largest customers, The Scotts Co.,
makers of potting soil and lawn products, documented health
problems among its workers using the vermiculite ore from Libby.
Severe respiratory problems among 12 workers at the Scotts plant in
Marysville, Ohio, led to an investigation by the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health to study the impact of
tremolite. During the 1960s and '70s, Scotts often received as much
as 25 percent of the vermiculite produced by the Libby mine.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Bierman, vice president for corporate relations for The
Scotts Co., said, ``We don't use that product any more.'' Bierman
added that he had no other information about the ore and workers'
health because it all occurred before he started working for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   While the NIOSH study documented the hazards from the tremolite,
the federal government agency did nothing to inform workers using
the material of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Robbins, who headed NIOSH during this period, says
his agency made a mistake not informing the Libby workers and those
at Grace's expansion plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mindset among some in the agency that their
responsibility was just to publish their finding,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working very hard to change that philosophy to let the
workers know what risks they were facing. When it came to this
study on vermiculite, we just dropped the ball,'' said Robbins, who
was fired by President Reagan early in Reagan's presidency because
of his zealous and vocal stance on worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Grace's answer to those who questioned the safety of
their vermiculite ore was that it was only ``nuisance dust'' and
presented no other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases the company stalled in even addressing the
dust problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in 1971, 20 of the expansion plants were in
violation of pollution control laws in their respective states,
according to a Grace internal document.
</P>
<P>
   In a September 1971 memo, Grace's Construction Products Division
said it could not afford to fix all the plants: ``They plan to
tackle them singly, as they are forced to comply, and buy as much
time as possible,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents present a puzzling picture of what the company
told their plant managers when it came to keeping their operations
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is safe to say that I have procrastinated on answering this
notice of violation,'' F.W. Easton of the Zonolite plant in
Weedsport, N.Y., wrote in November 1971 to his superiors about a
pollution violation from the New York state investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1971, the operator of a California Zonolite plant in
the San Francisco Bay Area told headquarters he was nervous when
pollution inspectors questioned him on how much 4 Zonolite ore _ a
particularly dusty grade _ they were processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ur ``friendly inspector'' will be by frequently for
the next few weeks'' he wrote, and added that the plant will be
``getting as much 4 out at night as we can.'' When the inspector
wouldn't be around.
</P>
<P>
   Questions from Canada
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. health and environmental agencies largely ignored the
problem, the Canadian government was questioning the health hazards
from the Libby ore as early as 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents show that between 15 million and 40 million
pounds of ore was shipped from Montana to contract plants in Canada
each year. About 8 million pounds usually went to Europe and the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the health department in the Canadian province of
Alberta raised concerns about the content of the heavy quantities
of vermiculite dust coming from a Grace-licensed plant in Calgary
using the ore from Libby. They reported that in examinations of
nine workers, seven had breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This number of men with breathing abnormalities is most
unusual and puzzling,'' wrote Dr. H. Siemons, director of Alberta's
division of industrial health, who asked Grace if there were any
other similar reports from other Western Canadian plants expanding
vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, investigators from the same department found
asbestos in the dust, but their report was discounted by Grace's
local management.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in December 1968, N.F. Bushell, Grace's
Zonolite manger in Vancouver, wrote headquarters about a worker in
their Winnipeg plant that had asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is asbestos in the ore we receive from Libby. I'm afraid
that we may still be exposing our employees to an unnecessary
health hazard,'' Bushell wrote and asked if the company had
measured the amount of asbestos in the air where the Zonolite was
bagged. If not, he asked, when was Grace going to do so?
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Grace, he urged the company to test for
asbestos. ``Get someone on this subject before we get closed down
or slapped with some pretty large claims from employees or their
heirs. It won't take many more biopsy reports before we get
fingered,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another early warning
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Dr. W.E. Park of the Minneapolis City Health Department
voiced concerns about the death of a worker at a Minnesota
vermiculite plant.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote to C.A. Pratt, the head of Western Mineral Products in
Minneapolis, saying the death of a worker ``who had long exposure
to vermiculite dust has renewed our interest in the importance of
vermiculite dust in the causation of lung disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked for specific information about asbestos in the
vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Documents show that Pratt had been concerned about the
contamination for years.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1961, he wrote to Earl Lovick, the manager of the
Libby mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an effective improvement can be made at the mine, in
reducing the asbestos dust, this will of course benefit every plant
that receives the ore and will minimize the hazards to hundreds of
employees in the various plants,'' Pratt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Moody, a Little Rock lawyer who has handled the lawsuits
of dozens of workers at Grace expansion plants, said, ``Grace had
no interest in protecting their workers. None. The documents prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon after Grace took over they started giving annual
physicals and X-rays to these workers,'' Moody said. ``Not one, and
I've handled almost 50 cases, has ever been given a report from
Grace on what the X-rays, breathing function tests, indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they knew they were sick, they never told them a
word.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ His domestic political base cemented by Sunday's
parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Tuesday
signaled that he wants to mend relations with the West by calling
for ratification of the nearly-seven-year-old START II nuclear arms
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin pressed for approval of the accord in a meeting with
leaders of the newly elected Parliament, as Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott arrived here for talks on arms control and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, which will hold the largest number of seats
in the Parliament, immediately rejected Putin's proposal. But after
a year of East-West estrangement which seemed to have placed the
treaty in a political deep freeze, it was notable that Putin
publicly raised the issue at all.
</P>
<P>
   START II, which calls for the reduction of Russian and U.S.
nuclear stockpiles, has languished in the Parliament since 1993,
blocked by Communists and nationalists during dips in U.S.-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Communists' hold on power seriously weakened by
Sunday's election results, ratification now seemed a genuine
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I think it is possible that they will be
able to form a legislative majority without the Communists,'' said
Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat who is now a Russia expert at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 98 percent of all ballots counted, election
officials said the Communists had captured 24.3 percent of the
popular vote for the new lower house of Parliament, known as the
Duma. That is but a whisker above the 23.2 percent that went to a
new pro-Kremlin coalition dubbed Unity.
</P>
<P>
   A second pro-Kremlin bloc, the Union of Right Forces, took 8.6
percent, and a third faction, the Zhirinovsky bloc, took 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Putin's government was certain to pick
up more support among independent legislators and other smaller
factions in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the only other major party leaning toward the
Communists, the Fatherland-All Russia coalition, won 13.2 percent
of the vote, well below its original expectations. Late Tuesday
leaders of the Fatherland faction said that they would split from
All Russia and form their own bloc in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers constitute a victory for President Boris Yeltsin
and especially for Putin, now the runaway favorite to succeed
Yeltsin in elections next summer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By waging a successful war in Chechnya and projecting an image
of competence and strength _ something rare lately in Russian
politics _ Putin became the political star to which many of the
pro-Kremlin blocks hitched their wagons in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few experts wonder whether that diverse mixture of
political groups can really be knitted into a workable legislative
force, particularly if the war in Chechnya turns sour for the
Kremlin or Putin stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   But at his meeting with parliamentary leaders Tuesday, Putin
acted like a man in command. ``The nation is pinning great hopes on
the new Duma, the more so since there are many problems that need
to be solved,'' he told them. ``The composition of the new Duma
shows that people want renewal _ not only new faces but also new
results, new ideas, new decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has indicated that he will push for economic reforms of
the sort long advocated by Western economists but never fully
carried out here.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of START II was the most specific issue discussed
at Tuesday's session, and Talbott said on arrival in Moscow that he
was pleased at the ``reactivation'' of the Russian government's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and President George Bush signed START II in January
1993. Under its terms, both nations would reduce their nuclear
forces to no more than 3,500 warheads by 2003 _ a drastic cut for
the United States, which now has nearly 8,000 warheads, and for
Russia, with about 6,700.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved the treaty, and the Russian military has
supported it, in part because it can no longer afford the huge
expense of keeping up a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Parliament was poised to approve the treaty a year
ago, but balked when the United States resumed bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma was again prepared to ratify the treaty last spring,
but the U.S.-led war against Serbia provoked even the Kremlin to
cancel that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's announcement Tuesday was not completely unexpected. A
senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the Kremlin has long said privately that it hoped to win approval
of START II after this month's elections, even if relations with
Washington were less than optimal.

<P>
   ``It's following through on what they said they'd do,'' the
official said. ``I hope it shows some serious willingness to engage
in arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is always for the ratification of the START II treaty
because we believe it is important for the national interests of
Russia,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin. ``To
promote the process of strategic disarmament would be beneficial to
Russia, first of all, and to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some serious obstacles still remain, and Putin noted them
Tuesday. They include the U.S. proposal to abandon the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so that it may build a limited
defense against missiles launched by rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical military officials in Russia and China argue that the
United States' real goal is to build a defense against the shrunken
nuclear force that Russia would possess once START II and future
arms-control treaties are implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry has informally proposed setting up
a joint commission to study the nuclear threat posed by unstable or
terrorist nations. But the Kremlin has bitterly protested the White
House's proposal to change the anti-ballistic missile treaty,
saying it is the foundation of arms control because its assurance
of mutual destruction in a war reduces all nations' incentives to
build more weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the military's foreign affairs
department, repeated that Tuesday, saying the government is
categorically opposed to changing the structure of the arms-control
regime.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Talbott is likely to discuss START II and
the anti-ballistic missile treaties during visits this week with
Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, among others.
</P>
<P>
   He is also likely to discuss Russia's political and economic
situation and the course of the war in Chechnya, which was entering
a crucial stage this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was briefed on the Chechnya war Tuesday by Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who later said the government is
establishing temporary police departments to restore order in areas
under its control.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya, Russian troops were said to be locked in a fierce
battle with rebels near Serzhen-Yury, a village about 18 miles
south of the capital, Grozny. The village sits at the mouth of a
gorge that leads into the Caucasus mountains, where rebels maintain
supply bases and headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials also repeated that they had captured
Grozny's civilian airport, but said they had yet to secure the
field because it was mined. Last week the army occupied a military
airfield just east of Grozny.

EX-CHAIRMAN OF INVESTMENT BANK CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla., Canada)  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last spring, in the midst of a boom year for
companies going public, the respected investment bank Keefe,
Bruyette &AMP; Woods abruptly scrubbed its plans for a stock offering _
and refused to say why.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the mystery was solved. Federal prosecutors in
Manhattan charged the firm's former chairman, James McDermott, with
insider trading in a bizarre case in which he was accused of
leaking information about potential billion-dollar bank deals to an
X-rated-movie actress he was dating.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, who lived in the world of sky-high Wall Street
salaries, is not accused of making any illegal profits himself. In
fact, all the suspected illegal profits were paltry indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, Kathryn Gannon, was accused of illegally earning
$88,000 stemming from trades based on inside information provided
by McDermott about six bank mergers, all involving the firm's
clients. She was described by the government as an escort, exotic
dancer and actress in adult movies who uses the screen name Marilyn
Star. The trades were made in 1997 and 1998, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gannon, 30, was also accused of passing information about
the deals to a New Jersey businessman, Anthony Pomponio, 45.
Pomponio was charged with making $86,000 in illegal trading
profits, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for someone of McDermott's generation, who lived
through the high-profile insider-trading cases of the '80s, to face
such a charge, said Thomas Newkirk, a high SEC official.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors revealed in the criminal complaint that Keefe,
Bruyette had canceled its offering in June after McDermott, who is
married, disclosed to its directors that a friend of his _ he did
not name Ms. Gannon at the time _ was under investigation by the
SEC for trading in stocks he had recommended to her.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was expected to raise $85 million, documents show,
and McDermott, whose salary was nearly $4 million, stood to
increase his stake to roughly $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott also resigned at the firm's request, and as part of
his severance agreement, both he and Keefe, Bruyette agreed not to
comment on his resignation, the complaint said. The firm said he
was leaving for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McDermott remained silent, entering no plea, as
federal Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz told him of his rights, and
ordered him released on $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, one of his lawyers, Denis McInerney, sharply
criticized the prosecution, saying that McDermott had been unaware
of the criminal investigation until Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McDermott is shocked by the government's action today,''
McInerney said. ``The government has never asked to speak to Mr.
McDermott, or reached out to his attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that the government chose to proceed in this fashion
without having the benefit of hearing from Mr. McDermott,''
McInerney continued. ``We will respond to the allegations in due
course, and are confident that Mr. McDermott will be exonerated
when the facts are known.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gannon, a resident of Miami, was believed to be in Canada,
where she is from, said the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan. A warrant has been issued for her arrest.
Her lawyer did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio, of North Caldwell, N.J., was released on $50,000 bond.
His lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said his client would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says that Pomponio told the SEC that Ms. Gannon
frequently boasted to him that ``she fraternized with individuals
who worked on Wall Street, and that her clientele included
high-powered investment bankers and lawyers on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said that McDermott's relationship with Ms.
Gannon lasted about 14 months, and that he had told her of six
upcoming deals. They involved Sun Trust, National Australia Bank,
Central Fidelity Banks, First Commerce, First Commercial and
California State Bank (West Covina).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gannon and Pomponio opened brokerage accounts, the
government said. She bought securities in advance of all the deals,
and he in five.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the complaint said, Ms. Gannon bought 1,800 shares
of the stock of Barnett Banks of Miami after she learned from
McDermott that Sun Trust was seeking to acquire it. A few days
later, on Aug. 29, 1997, Barnett stock surged 24 percent after it
was announced that it was being taken over by Nationsbank instead.
Ms. Gannon sold her Barnett stock for a profit of $30,400.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the investigation put an abrupt halt to Keefe,
Bruyette's ambitious plans, the new charges show.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, May 6, its executives and their investment bankers
were wrapping up plans to take the firm public. More than 4.7
million shares were scheduled to be priced the following Monday and
sold to investors before the market opened Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At a proposed price of about $18 a share, the offering would
have raised about $85 million for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But in a hastily called meeting that Thursday, McDermott told
the other directors that he had a personal problem that might
affect the offering. On Sunday, he told them more, the complaint
said, and the directors decided to cancel the offering.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that McDermott revealed that the SEC was
investigating stock trades made by a friend based on information he
had passed on. But, they contend, McDermott said that the
information was not confidential, and he described the profits the
friend had made as $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever McDermott told the board that day was a closely guarded
secret for six months. Many people were curious about the unusual
last-minute cancellation and McDermott's subsequent resignation on
June 30 after 21 years at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's other officials did nothing to squelch
speculation that the sale was withdrawn in favor of a plan to sell
the firm to another company.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Harry Keefe, one founder, knew why his former protege
left. Keefe, now in his 70s and long gone from Keefe, Bruyette,
said he hired McDermott as a bank-stock analyst and eventually
promoted him to director of research. Keefe said he helped make
McDermott one of the most-quoted bank analysts in the country by
insisting that only McDermott could field calls from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe said he found out about the charges when one trader at his
money-management firm read out a newswire headline that said
``Former CEO of Keefe Bruyette charged with insider trading.'' He
said he was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing more, he said: ``I'm heartbroken. My name's on the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation grew out of an SEC inquiry into trading of the
stock of Barnett Banks, said Newkirk, the SEC's associate director
of enforcement. The commission has already brought an enforcement
action against two young men who worked on Wall Street over their
trading of Barnett stock.
</P>
<P>
   That case reinforced the SEC's theory that the insider trading
of the 1990s was done by people too young to have learned the
lessons of the high-profile insider prosecutions of the 1980s. But
this case, Newkirk said, is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody that was in this business in the 1980s should have
known better,'' he said of McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Newkirk said he found it ``shocking and dismaying'' that a chief
executive of an investment bank would get caught up in an
insider-trading case.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Keefe, Bruyette said, ``KBW has always
prided itself as having the highest ethical standards, and we have
long had strict policies in place regarding the handling of
confidential information.'' It went on to say, ``KBW has not been
charged with any wrongdoing and we are cooperating with the
authorities in their investigation of Mr. McDermott.''
</P>
<P>
   David Berry, a director, said that these events had not hurt the
firm's business. He said the firm has talked with other companies
that showed interest in buying Keefe, Bruyette but that no such
talks are going on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might imagine when an IPO gets pulled, the phone does
ring,'' he said, but added, ``The firm is not trying to be sold.''

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC'S `ADVENTURES' IN POINTLESSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wonder of wonders _ a National Geographic special on NBC that's
practically unfettered by point or purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Some would call that perfect TV.
</P>
<P>
   The program, airing Wednesday, is ``Adventures in Time: The
National Geographic Millennium Special'' (8 p.m. on Channel 4) and
yes, it's an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   It's an adventure in the way that emptying the fridge, tossing
the contents into a casserole dish and serving the thing with great
fanfare would be an adventure. Mmmmm, leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC calls its special a ``fast-paced and visually captivating
... look at the march of time.'' You'd call it something like that,
too, if you had no mortal clue what the show was about.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true in a sense. We watch dozens of clips culled from
past National Geo specials and, sure enough, time marches. The
clips were actually filmed in the same millennium, if that'll
suffice for a theme.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are reminded yet again that our sun is ``an unremarkable
star.'' They should stop saying that on TV. It's a common
misconception.
</P>
<P>
   Our sun is a most remarkable star. People remark about the sun
constantly. You might have remarked about the sun already this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are willy-nilly shots of foul animals devouring
each other, great white sharks out in the Farallon Islands,
lizards, polar bears, chimps, turtles, lions, tigers and strange
rodents. Some of the rodents will be hosting their own syndicated
talk shows in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Egyptian mummies are being opened and great mountains
climbed. Primitive people whoop it up in Papua New Guinea, and
there's a neatly edited sequence of folks dancing all over the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Then organs are cloned, genetic diseases conquered, and we're in
the next century, in spirit. Geologist Roger Bilham predicts
catastrophic earthquakes destroying great cities in the next few
decades, and merry Christmas to him, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Inasmuch as the program has extended itself into the
21st century, it's out of recycled clips. Say buenos noches and
bring on ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A PBS special later Wednesday does have a purpose. It's to
reminisce about TV Sundays before pro golfers and the NFL swiped
Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omnibus: Television's Golden Age'' celebrates the weekly
program ``Omnibus'' (born 1952, died 1959), which, as its name
suggested, was about everything _ music, dance, drama, science,
comedy, even politics and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Omnibus'' host, Alistair Cooke, and others chat about a
program that was a commercial TV anomaly even during TV's eclectic
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The old clips are inhabited by Leonard Bernstein, Jonathan
Winters, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Frank Lloyd Wright, Hume
Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Eartha Kitt, Gene Kelly, Benny Goodman,
Sugar Ray Robinson, Les Paul and Mary Ford, John F. Kennedy and
Victor Borge.
</P>
<P>
   It's Borge, seeing music as his comic foil, who observes that
``Clair de Lune'' translates into English as ``Clear the Saloon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Omnibus'' didn't just make smart choices. Its secret was to
make inventive use of its choices. It was a program about process.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein visits Beethoven's mind as he wrote his Fifth
Symphony; he eliminated the flute, ``a delicate lady at a club
smoker,'' from the symphony's famous opening. Kelly constructs a
dance from the movements of pro athletes. Paul and Ford demonstrate
their pioneering recording technique.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's documentary also makes a donation to the
Ronald Reagan trivia bank. Seems that CBS, early on, wanted to
replace the urbane mid-Atlantic Cooke with the unmistakably
American Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omnibus'' producer Robert Soudek held firm. Reagan went to
``General Electric Theater'' instead to bone up on television.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal law enforcement agencies Tuesday ordered
heightened security at U.S. airports, borders and docks amid fears
of increased terrorist activity home and abroad during the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, in an effort to discourage
terrorists, said it will increase the number of inspectors and
bomb-sniffing dogs at U.S. airports and will be more diligent in
checking passengers for explosives. The Customs Service said it
already has added 300 inspectors at various ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Border Patrol also said they will increase their
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Sparking the government's apprehension is the coming of the new
millennium and the recent arrest of a foreign national suspected of
sneaking into the United States with bomb-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, Customs Service, FBI and Border Patrol, though
acknowledging their personnel increases in key areas, declined to
provide specific numbers or tactics, citing the need to keep
security measures confidential.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton's spokesman Joe Lockhart
downplayed any immediate domestic threat posed by the Dec. 14
capture of a suspected Algerian terrorist in Washington state.
Lockhart said law enforcement officials had not yet found any
specific threat against a particular American target.

<P>
   ``I don't think there is a scare mode,'' he said. ``We're not
advising people to change their plans and not follow through on
what they've planned to do for their millennium celebrations,
whatever that might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said a State Department advisory remains in effect for
people traveling abroad. The United States has received credible
information, from arrests made in Jordan, about potential terrorist
attacks overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made clear that there is a travel advisory, people
should exercise caution, and if people are planning to travel, they
should be in touch with the consulate or embassies, wherever
they're planning to go, to get further information,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Foley echoed Lockhart's
comments in urging Americans traveling overseas to be careful but
not unreasonably afraid of the terrorism threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a yellow light; it is not a red light,'' Foley said of
the department's travel advisory. ``We are urging Americans to be
vigilant and cautious as they travel, but we are not recommending
to Americans that they change their plans and that they not travel
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Defense
Department last week cautioned U.S. military commanders about
terrorist threats against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide advisories provided ``information'' relevant to
the security of U.S. forces, Bacon said, declining to be more
specific. ``We're taking appropriate action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, besides adding inspectors and dogs, also called for
strict local enforcement of parking rules near terminal buildings
and greater caution by travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All passengers are encouraged to be alert for any suspicious,
unattended bags, parcels or other items, and report them
immediately to airport personnel,'' the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers can avoid inconvenience by not gift-wrapping items
they are taking with them,'' the agency added. ``While the FAA does
not expect the increased security to cause delays, travelers should
check in for their flights at least one hour early for domestic
flights and two hours early for international flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service chief Raymond Kelly declined to state
specifically where additional agents would be stationed, saying
only that they would be positioned at ``remote ports.''
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, bureau spokesman Bill Carter said agents had already
taken steps to increase security in light of federal concern that
terrorists might strike at U.S. interests at the dawn of the new
millennium
</P>
<P>
   The moves by U.S. law enforcement followed a meeting Monday at
the White House among a handful of top administration officials,
who discussed the terrorism concerns and how to respond to them.
Among those at the two-hour meeting were Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and CIA
Director George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart would not confirm details of the session, saying only
that a group of people who work to combat terrorism meet regularly
to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as we lead up to the millennium and the issues that
brings on, and with some of the things that have been in the news,
the group, you know has been meeting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring the increased federal attention to the terrorism
concern was the Dec. 14 arrest of an Algerian national, Ahmed
Ressam, whom Custom Service agents caught in Port Angeles, Wash.
Law enforcement officials said they found nitroglycerin and other
potential bomb-making equipment in his car.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Canadian police are seeking another man who is believed
to have stayed with Ressam in a Vancouver, B.C., motel before the
Algerian's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in Beecher Falls, Vt., Border Patrol agents Monday
arrested another Algerian national, Bouabide Chamchi, who allegedly
tried to sneak into the United States from Canada using a fake
passport.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating whether the two men are
connected and whether either is linked to a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas and a critic of U.S. efforts to stem
illegal immigration, said the Washington state and Vermont episodes
should serve as a warning to U.S. and Canadian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is the best wake-up call that either Canada or the
U.S. (is) going to get about our porous, shared border,'' said
Smith, who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration
and Claims. ``We have twice arrested individuals who entered the
U.S. from Canada with the apparent intent to commit acts of
terrorism. How many near misses can we tolerate?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRI) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom the United States has also
accused of promoting terrorism, said Tuesday that he was unaware of
any attack planned on Americans. But Gadhafi, interviewed on
CBS-TV's ``The Early Show,'' said ``the U.S. government is hated.
All the people in the world are against it, therefore there is a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will not happen in this new year,'' Gadhafi said.
``I have no knowledge about this.''

<P>
   One thing the 20th century has left us with is electronic music.
The first electrical machines for making sounds were built just
before, but lasting possibilities of producing music by electronic
means arrived and grew during the century now ending.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and '30s came the earliest electronic instruments
that would survive: some are still in occasional use, including the
theremin and the ondes martenot, both generating the weird effect
of voicelike sounds coming from inexplicable sources, and the
electronic organ.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the '40s, Pierre Schaeffer in Paris opened the
door to a fully electronic music with his musique concrete, made by
recording sounds on disk, playing them back in some unorthodox
manner, and re-recording the result. The spread of the tape
recorder, soon after, increased the range and convenience of such
processes, and the development of computer technology, especially
from the mid-'60s to the early '80s, brought another widening and
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, most of the leading composers now working in the
Western classical tradition make little or no use of electronic
means, and electronic music has become a separate culture, of
composers creating and exchanging their music without need of any
larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   The increased power of computers, putting all the facilities of
a 1970s electronic music studio onto a couple of square feet of
desk space, has furthered the rise of this culture, and the
Internet is doing more. But in the public world, it is almost as if
electronic music had never been invented.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the outstanding pieces of the last decade, for instance,
have been for that great 19th-century institution, the symphony
orchestra. Olivier Messiaen, in his huge last achievement,
``Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela,'' used a vast assembly of instruments,
with whole ensembles of flutes and clarinets, to communicate
``visions of the beyond,'' where heaven transmutes the sounds of
earth: mountainous chorales for the wind group, long adagios in
which strings are idealized human voices, noises of wind and water,
and everywhere the calls and songs of birds. The sounds are in a
sense recorded, but this is musique concrete made entirely without
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Other composers in the '90s used a regular symphonic outfit and
still found the means to make new sounds. John Adams' Violin
Concerto starts with the violin singing against rippling
backgrounds that keep timbre and tonality in perpetual fluctuation,
and the finale creates the same kind of magical puzzles with
rhythm, in a hoedown.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ades' ``Asyla'' is a lustrous symphony, having places of
beauty _ high-register cavortings, laments above exotic percussion
_ and also of danger, with the frenzied third movement reaching
simultaneously up to elation and down to mindlessness: ecstasy or
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Harrison Birtwistle's piano concerto ``Antiphonies'' is,
like all his longer pieces, rugged, but it is also delicate, like a
giant reaching down to pick a flower. The piano, a dreamer, resists
the efforts of the orchestra to interrupt her dreaming but finally
has to realize that it is the orchestra on which her imagination
draws, and that the orchestra has dreams of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Carter's ``Symphonia'' is a symphony for the end of the
century by a composer who has lived through most of it: a big
statement of enthusiastic energy, multiplicity, diversity and new
sonic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Still other composers of the last decade have found new things
to do with the piano. Like many beginning pianists, Gyorgy Ligeti
sees the instrument as a recalcitrant machine _ but on a virtuoso
level. His Etudes are based on rather simple figures in rather
simple processes of imitation and movement up or down in register,
except that the extreme densities and speeds of events throw up
contradictions, and the mechanical surfaces erupt, explode or
dissolve in poetic confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Babbitt's ``Preludes, Interludes and Postlude,''
contrastingly complex on the surface, nevertheless sparkle with a
similar elegance and oddity. The piano sounds new in its sharp
attacks, at once unpredictable and exact, its characteristic
wobbles of repeated notes and its electric activity in the top
couple of octaves.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s was also a good period for quartets and solo string
pieces, especially in the output of Gyorgy Kurtag, and for choral
music. Heinz Holliger's ``Scardanelli-Zyklus,'' for chorus and
small orchestra, is as beautiful, delicate and poignant as frost.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Bach Passion for the present time, in chorales and
canons that sing on through deflation and exhaustion, and with the
protagonist now Friedrich Holderlin, whose late, mad poetry
provides the texts. At the same time, the oldest instrumentalist
figure of all, the solo percussionist, found a decisive
reincarnation in Steven Schick, and in music written for him by
Brian Ferneyhough and David Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Beside all these, electronic masterpieces of the last decade
were few, though they would certainly include Pierre Boulez's ``...
explosante-fixe ...'' for electric flute and small orchestra. Like
Ariadne in a labyrinth of mirrors, the solo flutist follows paths
amid distorted images of herself, these coming from the orchestra
while her own voice is magically and beautifully transformed by a
digital system. Eventually she reaches the way out, through
gateways of cadences.
</P>
<P>
   They are perhaps also gateways to the future, pointing to the
electronic music of the 21st century. Or perhaps the real musical
function of electronics has been to make the music of instruments
and voices more widely available, for all the wonderful music
described above is electronic music in another way, to be heard at
the spin of a CD.

TERRORISM CONCERNS SPUR MORE VIGILANT BORDER CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With TERROR-ARREST) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The light was fading fast at the U.S.-Canada
border, and the line of idling cars eager to cross the Peace Bridge
into this city was perhaps twice, maybe three times, the normal
length. But that did not stop Inspector Brian Murphy of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service from doing a thorough check
on this frigid, windy afternoon, car after car, person after
person.
</P>
<P>
   Out came his flashlight, peering into the back seats. Up popped
the trunk, so Murphy could sift through mundane tools and Christmas
gifts. And on went the questions, more probing than usual, about a
driver's citizenship, destination, residence, everything.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, not only at each of the half-dozen or so
inspection stations here, but also at dozens of border crossings
around the country, turning what is typically a cursory, routine
matter into something more laborious and vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   For months, federal officials have disseminated cautious
warnings about the chaos that could be wreaked by terrorists or
computer glitches at millennium's end. But the arrest last week of
a man who the authorities say tried to slip into Washington state
with a cache of bomb components might well have driven home the
notion of how susceptible the nation could be, prompting officials
from Buffalo to Seattle, Miami to California, to redouble their
inspection efforts this week.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service added 300 employees to remote locations
along the Mexico and Canada borders to increase security.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that
it would add bomb-sniffing dogs and uniformed police at the
nation's airports and rely more heavily on devices that check
airline passengers for trace amounts of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Defense Department sent two advisories to U.S.
military commanders worldwide highlighting cautions about terrorist
threats against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Pentagon had taken any new precautions or put
additional military assets on standby, a spokesman, Kenneth H.
Bacon, said, ``We're taking appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   The man arrested last week, Ahmed Ressam, was stopped on Dec. 14
as he attempted to enter Port Angeles, Wash., on a ferry from
Victoria, B.C. Authorities said Ressam, who tried to flee, had
nitroglycerin and other combustible and potential bomb-making
materials in the trunk of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to say how long the heightened security alert
would last beyond the holidays. But at numerous border points
Tuesday, there was ample evidence to suggest that the people on the
front lines were taking these warnings to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just looking out for something that doesn't seem
normal, like a license plate from a different state,'' said Murphy,
the inspector at Peace Bridge, who has been assessing faces and
cars at border crossings for nine years. ``You want to know, `Does
their story make sense? Are they nervous in their responses?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, motorists reported that while it was a
breeze traveling from the United States to Canada, the return trip
was a chore, with lines that were much longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
   At the Peace Bridge here, the single busiest checkpoint along
the Canadian border, typical delays of, say, 5 minutes during the
holiday season have stretched now to 15 minutes and beyond, said
Lenore M. Belzer, port director of the immigration service office
in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   There were more highway patrol officers at the nation's busiest
crossing in San Ysidro, Calif.; the same was true in Texas and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely a sense that there is a heightened risk
and we are taking it very seriously,'' said Gurdit Dhillon,
director of field operations for the Customs Management Center in
El Paso, Texas, which supervises 800 miles of the nation's
2,000-mile border with Mexico. ``We are looking at all of our
remote ports and moving people around, adding resources and
authorizing overtime to meet the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything went smoothly, particularly for those of Arab
descent. In Boston, Mourad Aribi _ an Algerian native who lives in
Manchester, England, and is married to a Maine native _ said he was
detained for more than 20 minutes upon his arrival at Logan
International Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's racism,'' said Aribi, 26. ``They see the color of your
skin and they go through each piece of luggage you have.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Peace Bridge, where people normally shuttle
seamlessly to eat and shop on both sides of the border, most
motorists were taking the delays in stride, saying the inspectors
were doing their best to be thorough without being disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Davies, of Thorold, Ontario, was driving a friend to the
Buffalo airport, something he does from time to time. When an
inspector noticed several pieces of luggage in the back of Davies'
green truck, the inspector asked Davies to pull into the customs
and immigration offices and undergo further screening.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to be here if something happens,'' Davies said. ``I
don't mind.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popular music was running out the clock throughout 1999. No one,
it seemed, wanted to squander an original idea this year, lest it
be tossed out with the entire passe 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop's dominance was incontestable; it's as pervasive now as
the blues was in the 1960s. Although hip-hop's musical vanguard is
no longer its commercial front line, its rhythms and strategies are
now at the core of all best-selling popular music except country.
</P>
<P>
   Boy bands lead their audiences in hip-hop chants; hard rock
bands use hip-hop cadences and sound effects. Instead of the
ingenious wordplay and textural dementia of the best hip-hop, most
borrowers have taken the easy stuff: limited melodies, unlimited
egos and aggressive bad-boy poses, including a newly unbridled
misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Women joined the renewed battle of the sexes in 1999, but with
more wit than their antagonists. There were other promising
directions this year, particularly the surge of Latin music.
</P>
<P>
   But the major changes were about marketing. Old styles were
gussied up in bright colors and big smiles to be sold to ever
younger consumers in the form of kiddie-pop, aimed directly at the
population of unjaded 8-to-15-year-olds. Behind the curtain, newly
consolidated recording conglomerates were frantically making deals
and alliances to position themselves for sale of music over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Technology departments scrambled to control whether recordings
could be copied. But in the front offices, no one has figured out
how to reverse the increasing disposability of current pop.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 reminiscences of popular music in 1999: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HORMONE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone. It was a man's year, full of backlash against
female authority. With Limp Bizkit leading the charge, never have
so many tattooed, pumped-up rock songwriters yelled so loud and
felt so sorry for themselves, while placing all the blame on ``The
Nookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangsta rappers like DMX and Jay-Z celebrated male bonding
through mayhem while Eminem and Kid Rock clowned their way through
raps that alternated self-mockery with crass chest-thumping. The
male preening of video-friendly boy acts _ Ricky Martin, the
Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, 98 Degrees _ was a different display of
testosterone, but just as commercially effective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORRECTIVE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Women's rhythm 'n' blues. Leaving male performers to their
fantasies of gangsta machismo and conspicuous consumption, women
followed through on Lauryn Hill's ambition: to reclaim the old
soul-music alchemy of honesty, fun and uplift. Mary J. Blige, Macy
Gray, Destiny's Child, Angie Stone, T.L.C., Me'shell Ndegeocello
and others delivered songs that were heartfelt, grounded in
realism, musically ingenious and unafraid to be deep. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BANDWAGON OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The Latin tinge. It took Ricky Martin's grin and Jennifer
Lopez's rump to make radio stations and mainstream listeners pay
attention to salsa. The demographics of a growing Spanish-speaking
population helped. And in a year when American hitmakers were
determined to sacrifice all subtlety or grace, it was well past
time to notice the cornucopia of Caribbean rhythms one more time
and to recognize the romantic fervor of Spanish-speaking singers.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, this latest Latin wave _ which also brought a
comeback for Santana and an English-language hit for Marc Anthony _
will open more North American ears to the madcap hybrids of rock en
espanol bands like Cafe Tacuba and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   APPARITIONS OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wilson, fighting his stagefright and backed by pop
scholars who recreated ``Pet Sounds'' arrangements, emerged for his
first tour without the Beach Boys; the partnership behind it has
already collapsed into lawsuits between singer and producers. Tom
Waits made his first tour since 1987, proving he's still his own
best character. Jesse Winchester quietly re-emerged after a decade
of writing songs for other performers.
</P>
<P>
   Most unlikely of all were the Monks, a band formed by former
American soldiers in Germany, who released one album, in 1966, of
clattery, dissonant, astringent, howling protopunk songs, complete
with feedback and antiwar lyrics. The original lineup, electric
banjo and all, finally made its United States debut, with its first
performances since 1967. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUFFERING ARTIST OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Trent Reznor. For five years the man who is Nine Inch Nails
procrastinated, produced other bands, sank into clinical depression
and worried about whether his next bass line would save rock. And
he holed up in the studio until he came out with ``The Fragile,'' a
marvel of solitary despair on which every sound is made to wound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EMINENCE GRISE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Max Martin. Behind the smiling faces and multimillion sales of
kiddie-pop are catchy songs, and Max Martin, ensconced in Sweden,
keeps cranking them out as writer and producer. He's the master of
the ambiguous ``it'' who came up with the Backstreet Boys' ``I Want
It That Way'' (along with most of their ``Millennium'' album) and
Britney Spears' ``... Baby One More Time.'' Lately, breaking the
age barrier, Celine Dion recorded one of his songs. Abba should
brace for competition.
</P>
<P>
   MOST D TRADEMARK OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista Social Club. The Cuban musicians who got together on
the 1997 album reappeared in Wim Wenders' documentary film, then
fanned out with their own albums and tours. Ibrahim Ferrer, Ruben
Gonzalez, Omara Portuondo, Eliades Ochoa, Compay Segundo and
Barbarito Torres gave United States audiences a chance to separate
out the urban and rural styles that were entwined on the album and
listen more closely. Americans rightly grabbed the opportunity.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOST TARNISHED TRADEMARK OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock Festival. The Woodstock name will no longer be
automatically associated with the peace, love and cheerful chaos of
the original 1969 festival. At the 30th-anniversary version, the
chaos was hostile, with male aggression boiling over from the mosh
pit and ending up in rapes, vandalism and fires.
</P>
<P>
   There's blame aplenty to be divided: ineffective security,
resentment over high prices and fans who took rowdy music as
excitement. Will anyone take a chance on Woodstock 2004? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDEAD STYLE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Grunge. Flannel shirts have been laughed out of fashion, and all
the leading Seattle bands except Pearl Jam are gone. But down-tuned
guitars and weight-of-the-world brooding still made their way to
No. 1 for Creed and Korn.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDING SPIRIT OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington. A century after his birth in 1899, Ellington
received well-deserved tributes: a year of punctilious programs
from Jazz at Lincoln Center, the CD release of his entire RCA
Victor recordings, continuing scholarship and performances that
sought to recreate the letter of his music or extend its spirit.
Both musicians and listeners rediscovered music that entertained as
it experimented, that anticipated countless ideas, and that merged
grand ambition, musicianly camaraderie and lapidary detail. It was,
after all, Ellington's century.

COIN ON A ROLL: TREASURY MAKING A MINT ON COMMEMORATIVE QUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ There are 325 oak branches on the new
Connecticut quarter, and Irene Wu is checking each one with a 7x
magnifying glass. Wu is a coin press operator at the San Francisco
Mint, where precision is expected because a collector may be
checking this same coin with a 100x microscope, searching for the
slightest blemish.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton signed the 50 States Commemorative Coin
Program Act into law on Dec. 1, 1997, quarters have become a coin
to save, not spend. According to a Mint survey, 15 million American
kids are collecting the quarters.
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, an estimated 60 percent of the American
population will be involved in the hunt, making the 50 state
quarters ``the hottest collectible product in several
generations,'' says Philip Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint in
Washington, D.C. ``We've sold 100 times the number that Pokemon
cards have.''
</P>
<P>
   The heads side of the new quarters is still George Washington,
though his hair has been textured as if there were gel in it.
Replacing the eagle on the tails side are designs submitted by each
state and produced five a year in the order in which the states
were admitted to the union, starting with Delaware last winter and
ending with Hawaii in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut,
quarters were issued this year. Next year, coins honoring
Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Virginia
will be added.
</P>
<P>
   The state quarters program has put a shine on the San Francisco
Mint, the gray granite fortress that looms above Market Street.
Running at low idle since it ceased production of circulation
currency in 1981, San Francisco is the only mint entrusted with
pressing the commemorative quarters that come sealed in proof sets.
</P>
<P>
   These coins, marked with an ``S,'' represent ``the peak of coin
artistry,'' according to Diehl. They are subject to much more
careful workmanship and scrutiny than the general-circulation state
quarters minted in Denver and Philadelphia and marked with a ``D''
or ``P.'' The state designs will completely replace the eagle until
the program ends in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   To meet demand for the 1999 proof set of the first five states,
production at the San Francisco Mint has already doubled to 36
million coins and will rise to 50 million when the new Sacagawea
golden dollar is rolled out next year.
</P>
<P>
   The quarters-only proof sets, available in regular copper-nickel
for $13.95 and all silver for $31.95, are expected to sell out. The
coins are sealed in plastic for the numismatists who will not keep
a coin that has been touched by a human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has given new life to the Mint in San Francisco,
the (U.S.) Mint in general and coin collecting,'' says Diehl. ``It
was considered a dying hobby until this year. A hundred million
Americans would consider themselves new recruits to coin
collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, each new collector has 12 quarters, according to a
Mint survey. To get them out of dishes and drawers, the Mint also
sells a handsome fold-out map for $24.95 with a slot for each
state's quarter, and historical and geographical information about
the states and the Mint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bringing a tremendous number of new people into coin
collecting,'' says Ritchie Clay, manager of the Coin Broker in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Farino of Portola Valley, Calif., bought five albums,
including one each for her kids. ``They're always looking for the
different states,'' Farino says. ``It's hard to make sure each
child has one of each.'' The kids, ages 10, 7 and 4, are always
snooping in her coin purse, but Farino doesn't mind. ``I think it
ties into the history of the country and learning how to collect
and take care of something,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The financial point of the program is to make money for the U.S.
Treasury: Each state quarter costs the Mint just 4 cents to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Each state's coins are minted for 10 weeks, and that is it. For
the first three _ Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey _ about 750
million of each were put into circulation, and they are already
disappearing. Production was doubled for the last two _ Georgia and
Connecticut, and that's why pocket change is lousy with them.
Pennsylvania seems to be the scarcest out West.
</P>
<P>
   The quarters can also be bought at face value in bags of 100 or
1,000 from the Mint's Web site. In October, when the Connecticut
quarter was launched, 7 million quarters sold out in 4 1/2 hours.
This level of commerce has moved the Mint into the top 25 retailers
over the Internet, and it has expanded into ancillary products like
quarter-based jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But buying in bulk over the Internet is a passionless way to
collect, like buying a full set of baseball cards in a binder. It
takes the sport out of it. It is more rewarding to collect them in
change, and more rewarding still to collect them in the state they
honor. There is satisfaction in, say, getting a Pennsylvania
quarter in change from a pumpkin and cider farmer in the
Pennsylvania Dutch country.
</P>
<P>
   Over the life of the program, a conservative estimate is that
the 50 state quarters will earn the Treasury between $6 billion and
$8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's real money that goes in and lowers the deficit,'' says
Diehl. ``It's just like tax money but a lot less painful to
raise.''

A VETERAN DIRECTOR STILL FIGHTS THE GOOD FIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for HURRICANE-FILM)  
(af) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Norman Jewison is not Hollywood hip. At the age of
73, the director of such films as ``Moonstruck,'' ``Fiddler on the
Roof,'' ``A Soldier's Story'' and ``In the Heat of the Night''
(which won an Academy Award in 1968 as best picture) is hardly on
the current A-list of trendy directors pursued by studio executives
and producers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, executives at Universal Pictures, which is releasing
Jewison's newest movie, ``The Hurricane,'' were skittish about
hiring him to direct the somber drama about Rubin (Hurricane)
Carter, the boxer wrongfully accused of murder (portrayed by Denzel
Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said, `Go young with this movie, find some MTV
director, find some new young guy and bring a youthful,
contemporary, stylish point of view to this story,' which is a
period piece set in the '70s,'' said Armyan Bernstein, one of the
screenwriters and chairman of Beacon Communications, which produced
the film. ``I said: `This is one of the youngest guys I've ever
met. His fire hasn't gone out. In fact it's blazing.'''
</P>
<P>
   At an age when many of his contemporaries are no longer working,
Jewison is facing the odd prospect of a career resurgence in a
business notorious for its obsession with youth. A trim,
bespectacled and restlessly enthusiastic man, Jewison said he would
probably work in films as long as he could stand. ``I know I'm
getting old,'' he said with a laugh, seated in his office at a
production facility in west Los Angeles. ``But I also know that
it's worth it to keep going, worth it to keep fighting and
hammering away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian-born filmmaker, who first won notice in the United
States as a television director, has been hammering away for 50
years, often driven by old-style liberal convictions that have
shaped some of his most noted films. Racial prejudice and racial
issues stir Jewison. In fact, Jewison said, he views ``The
Hurricane'' (which opens on Wednesday in New York, Los Angeles and
a few other cities in order to qualify for Academy Award
consideration) as his third movie of a personal trilogy about race.
</P>
<P>
   The first was ``In the Heat of the Night,'' about a black
Philadelphia policeman helping to investigate a Mississippi murder;
next came ``A Soldier's Story'' (1984), about a black officer at a
Southern military base in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   His fascination with racial issues dates back to the time when
he first crossed the Canadian border to visit the United States.
``I hitchhiked through America when I was 17, 18,'' he said. ``I
went down to New Orleans, to Mississippi, Tennessee. Alabama,
Louisiana, Arkansas. I couldn't believe what I saw. It was
apartheid. People couldn't get a cup of coffee or a Coke at
Woolworths. They couldn't drink from a fountain on the street. Had
to sit at the back of the bus. I was kind of shocked. I was so
naive, this kid from Canada. It always stayed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The current film, written by Bernstein and Dan Gordon, is based
on two books: ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' by Sam Chaiton and
Terry Swinton, and ``The 16th Round,'' Carter's own account of his
dream of winning the middleweight boxing title and how it was
destroyed when he was arrested, along with a young fan, John Artis,
for murdering three people in a New Jersey bar.
</P>
<P>
   The boxer was convicted and sentenced in 1967 to three life
terms in prison, where he channeled his despair into writing and,
essentially, isolated himself from the outside world. The case
became a cause celebre briefly during the 1970s, inspiring
demonstrations and a Bob Dylan song used in the movie's soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts how four people who were convinced of the
boxer's innocence _ an alienated black American teenager living in
Canada and his three social-activist guardians _ helped spark a
full-scale campaign to free Carter from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, federal Judge H. Lee Sarokin overturned Carter's second
trial conviction after finding the prosecution committed ``grave
Constitutional violations.'' Sarokin said the convictions were
based on ``racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than
disclosure.'' Carter spent nearly 19 years in prison. ( Artis, who
also maintained his innocence, had been released from prison in
1981 after serving 15 years).
</P>
<P>
   Jewison's involvement in the Carter story began in the 1980s,
after he read a Sports Illustrated story about the boxer and began
discussing a project on his life with the producer, David Picker.
The project foundered, because of financing issues. Four years ago
Bernstein and Beacon stepped in. (The film cost about $30 million
and was made mostly in Toronto.) ``I'm glad they called me,'' said
Jewison.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Denzel Washington played an important role in hiring
Jewison. It was Jewison who saw the then unknown actor on stage in
Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, ``A Soldier's
Story,'' in the early 1980s and cast him in the film version.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a simplicity about his direction,'' Washington said.
``He knows what he wants. When I worked with him 15 years ago on
`Soldier's Story,' I was young and wasn't aware of how good he was.
He's a real actor's director.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sought to play Hurricane Carter for nearly a
decade, and endured a sometimes grueling physical regimen for 18
months, including a weight loss of 35 pounds. ``This is an
extraordinary story and it's obviously a great part,'' said
Washington. ``And Norman was the perfect director. Not just for his
talent but his stance on racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison and his wife, Dixie, now spend most of their time on a
big farm, with 100 head of cattle, near Toronto. (They have three
grown children). Although the couple have a home in Los Angeles,
Jewison said that living in Canada has served to shield him
somewhat from the pressures of Hollywood and enabled him, unlike so
many directors who live in L.A., to distance himself from the
town's obsession with box office and what's hot.
</P>
<P>
   Jewison's own career, while enduring and very successful, has
had some off moments. (``He remains unpredictable, a gadfly among
directors,'' wrote David Thomson, in ``A Biographical Dictionary of
Film.'') A successful television director on CBC in Canada in the
1950s, Jewison was invited to New York and became an even more
successful, and Emmy Award-winning, director of such variety shows
as ``Your Hit Parade'' for CBS, and ``The Andy Williams Show,'' as
well as special shows featuring Harry Belafonte, Danny Kaye and,
most notably, Judy Garland.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jewison directed and-or produced at least a dozen Judy Garland
shows _ and he keeps several pictures of Garland and him in his
office. Jewison says that even in the final years of her career,
Garland was a mesmerizing talent who was exploited by managers and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had such a good sense of humor about herself that no
matter how difficult things got for her, with her husband and her
family and her problems and her health and addictions, there was a
personal courage about her that I admired,'' he said. ``I became
very protective of that talent. I don't know what it was. It's hard
for me to describe. I wasn't in love with her. I mean, I was her
director. She trusted me. And sometimes I think I was the only
person to tell her the truth, not lie to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison's debut as a film director came with the successful 1963
comedy ``40 Pounds of Trouble,'' with Tony Curtis. This was
followed by three more comedies at Universal, including two with
Doris Day. Jewison then co-wrote and directed ``The Cincinnati
Kid'' (1965), a drama about card sharks starring Steve McQueen. And
then came movies like the satire ``The Russians are Coming! The
Russians are Coming!'' and ``... And Justice for All,'' with Al
Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Jewison also directed the stylish caper ``The Thomas Crown
Affair'' (1968) with McQueen and Faye Dunaway. He said he could not
bring himself to see the recent remake. ``I tried _ I got right up
to the door, I had my Cineplex pass out and I couldn't do it,'' he
said. ``I went to see another movie. Can you understand that?''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison's political commitments altered his life in 1970. He
packed up his belongings in Los Angeles and moved his family to
London. ``I kind of lost my confidence in the American dream,'' he
said. ``I was losing my sense of humor. I had marched. The war was
going on. Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated. Reagan was governor.
Nixon was president. I handed in my green card and moved.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Europe for about eight years, Jewison made the
successful screen versions of Broadway's ``Fiddler on the Roof''
and the rock opera ``Jesus Christ, Superstar.'' He also made the
futuristic ``Rollerball.'' In recent years, Jewison's films have
included ``Agnes of God,'' ``In Country'' and ``Other People's
Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison, who has made 23 feature films, has been nominated four
times for an Oscar, and his movies have received 45 nominations and
12 Academy Awards. At last year's Oscar show he won the prestigious
Irving Thalberg award for his directorial achievement.
</P>
<P>
   (His disappointments included ``F.I.S.T.,'' a 1978 drama
starring Sylvester Stallone as a Jimmy Hoffa-style labor leader,
which he blames partly on Stallone's efforts to revise the script
written by Joe Eszterhas.)
</P>
<P>
   Jewison said he hoped his next film would be a musical, although
he declined to discuss the details. ``I'm working at it,'' he said.
``I'm trying to convince people to give me a shot. I even liked
Woody Allen's musical, that everybody didn't like. I loved it. I
just don't think he knows how to make musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison, walking from his office to a nearby restaurant at
lunchtime, said with a laugh that, yes, he yearned for the old
days. ``The decision to make `Moonstruck' was made between Alan
Ladd Jr. and myself,'' he recalled, of the former MGM studio chief.
The movie went on to win three Oscars, including best actress and
best original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a price of what I thought I could do the film for,
and told him I was going to go after Cher to play the lead. No
other major stars. And he called me up and said, `OK.' And I never
saw him again, until I told him that the film was finished and I
wanted him to see it. That doesn't happen anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first came to Hollywood, Jewison was mentored by great
filmmakers like Fred Zinnemann, George Stevens, Billy Wilder and
William Wyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember Willie Wyler when he was dying of emphysema
and I went to see him and I asked him, `When's it all over,
Willie?''' recalled Jewison. ``And he says, `It's all over when
your legs give out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison laughed heartily. ``My legs are pretty good,'' he said.

 The following story was reported by Craig Pyes, John Kifner, John
F. Burns and Sam Howe Verhovek, and was written by Burns  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When U.S. customs officials arrested Ahmed Ressam near Seattle
last week after he came off a ferry from Canada in a car they say
was loaded with jars of nitroglycerine, timing devices and other
bomb-making materials, American intelligence officials knew little
about him.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest set off alarms in France, where anti-terrorist
officials had been focusing on the 32-year-old Ressam because of
his connections to a radical Islamic group that French
investigators suspect had carried out in 1996 a series of attacks
on supermarkets, armored security vehicles and banks in northern
France.
</P>
<P>
   French officials declined to provide specifics and did not
suggest that Ressam himself was involved in those attacks, but one
senior French law enforcement official said that Ressam had links
to Fateh Kamel, an Algerian veteran of the Afghan war. The French
have implicated Kamel in the 1996 attacks, which left several
bystanders and several Islamic radicals dead and netted a cache of
high-powered weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the French identified Said Atmani, an
Algerian with a Bosnian passport who once roomed with Ressam in a
Montreal apartment, as another figure with links to Kamel. French
officials said they sent a delegation to Canada in October to
interview Atmani and Ressam, but neither man could be located..
</P>
<P>
   Much about Ressam remains unknown as officials in three
countries trace his movements in an effort to learn what he planned
to do with the explosives he was accused of bringing into the
United States. But from interviews and a review of public records
in Canada, a picture is emerging of a man who moved easily from
country to country with falsified passports.
</P>
<P>
   At the modest, $85 per night hotel where he lived for two weeks
in Vancouver, British Columbia, workers recalled that he was
traveling with another man, who was lighter in complexion and spoke
English with no discernible accent.
</P>
<P>
   American officials now say they have unconfirmed intelligence
reports that Ressam had been seen in training camps used in the
1980s by Islamic militants fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ressam told Canadian authorities that he had been falsely accused
in Algeria of being an Islamic radical, and tortured, according to
immigration records.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials acknowledgeesday that Ressam had taken
advantage of lax procedures and loose cooperation between the
police and immigration authorities to obtain his false papers.
Reviewing the case, one Montreal police investigator, Claude
Paquette, this week said that the loose rules had turned Canada
into ``a Club Med for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's investigation into the affair has established, among
other things, that Ressam arrived in the country in 1994 with a
fake French passport in an assumed name. Later, after being ordered
arrested and deported, he went underground and obtained a Canadian
passport in a false name using only a Roman Catholic baptism
certificate, a procedure said to be common in Quebec. When arrested
in Seattle, Ressam was carrying a Canadian passport in the assumed
name of Benni Antoine Norris.
</P>
<P>
   The group to which French investigators have linked Ressam is
part of a new trend in Islamic radicalism in which small, loosely
linked bands of militants collaborate in attacks on Western
targets, often financing themselves by what the French call
``gangster-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking French official who outlined what he called
``the globalization of Islamist terror'' said there were probably
20 to 50 Islamic groups that have planned or carried out terrorist
attacks worldwide in countries like Canada, France, Belgium,
Turkey, Malaysia and Australia, as well a dozen or more other
nations. Few of these groups, he said, belonged to a coherent
terrorist network, although many maintained loose links with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   What most of these groups have in common, French and American
officials say, is a heritage from the Islamic ``holy war'' against
Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s, when thousands of young
Muslims from across Europe, the Middle East and Asia were
indoctrinated with a militant brand of Islam, and trained in
weapons techniques and bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Islamic terror groups are not centrally directed,
anti-terrorist officials in the United States and other Western
countries say they are linked by many things, including their
fiercely anti-Western system of Islamic beliefs and common
experiences and operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leaders fought, or at least were trained, in
Afghanistan. Most see the United States, with its secular political
tradition, its military and economic power, and its backing for
Israel, as the prime target for terrorist attacks. Many radicals
use false passports, and work from the same terror-training
manuals, some of them adapted from CIA-supplied training materials
used in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining whether Ressam is linked to the most
notorious figure to emerge from that war, Osama Bin Laden, the
wealthy 42-year-old Saudi Arabian exile who lives in hiding in
Afghanistan. American authorities have identified Bin Laden as the
mastermind of the August 1998 bomb attacks on American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in which 220 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One American official said there were reports that Ressam had
met with several people in Canada tied to Bin Laden. It was unclear
what significance, if any, these contacts had. French officials
have concentrated their recent investigations on Kamel, whom they
described as ``important in the world of Islamic terrorists'' and
as a frequent traveler to Bosnia, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and
Jordan among other places.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan on Tuesday, a high-ranking official of the Taliban,
the militant Islamic group that rules most of Afghanistan, scoffed
at American suggestions that Bin Laden may have continued to play a
role in terror attacks since the embassy bombings, which prompted
the FBI to place Bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list and post a
$5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden doesn't even have access to a telephone or a fax,''
Sayed Mohammed Haqqani, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, told a
news conference.

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Rassem arrived in Canada's Mirabel Airport on February 20, 1994,
and claimed he was fleeing a government that had unjustly accused
him of arms smuggling and Islamic radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   His French passport bore the name of Tahar Medjadi, but he
readily admitted to authorities that the document and his birth
certificate were fake. He asked for refugee status and asylum.
</P>
<P>
   On his application form he stated the Algerian military
`'considered me to be nothing but an Islamic terrorist, even though
I have no connection to Islamic movements.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was tortured with rags, soap, ladders and a desk
drawer, made to sign false confessions, and held in administrative
detention for 15 months. After two years of legal wrangling,
Canadian officials rejected his claim for refugee status, and
ordered him deported.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, his lawyer Dennis Buron said, the government
had a policy of not deporting anybody to Algeria because of the
harsh battles there between Islamic insurgents and the military
rulers. So he remained in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Charbonneau, a Canadian Immigration spokeswoman, said
that there was no grounds to hold Rassem. ``At that time, we had no
proof that he was linked to any terrorist group. If we had proof,
we would have kept him in detention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rassem then slipped from official view, living under two false
names, Benni Antoine Noris, and Mario Roig.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb 8, 1998, an arrest warrant was issued for Ressam, for
allegedly stealing a computer from a parked car. He served eks in jail.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a deportation order was issued for
Rassem, apparently on the basis of three outstanding criminal
arrest warrants, two for theft from cars, and one for breaking and
entering. In May 1998, a nationwide immigration warrent was issued
for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, last February Rassem sought and obtained a
government-issued Canadian passport in the false name of Benni
Antoine Noris. Even though he had been fingerprinted during his
refugee application, there was apparently no cross check with
police, immigration or intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Those fingerprints remained on file. And when Ressam was
arrested last week crossing the border into Washington, American
authorities lifted his prints and learned his true identity.
</P>
<P>
   France's interest in Ressam appears to have been prompted by the
arrest in Jordan this spring of Kamel, the Algerian-born Afghan
veteran who has been linked by French investigators to the group
that carried out a series of attacks in the Northern French city of
Roubaix.
</P>
<P>
   French anti-terrorist officials have said that they have
established that Kamel provided ``religious leadership'' to Islamic
groups, in France that carried out the robberies, which terrorized
the French city for three months in early 1996. In one attack, the
Islamic radicals shot dead a French Muslim who was slow in handing
over the keys to his Mercedes after the gang had bungled a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French investigation, the robberies netted the
gang only about 70,000 francs, a little more than $10,000, money
that the French say was used to finance the activities of the
Islamic groups Kamel is said to have led.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery spree ended with a shootout in the Roubaix suburb of
Alma in March 1996, in the course of which four gang members were
killed, two after fleeing across the border into Belgium. It is not
clear what direct evidence, if any, exists linking Kamel to the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest this year, Jordan extradited him to France and
Kamel has been held ever since under a French law providing for the
detention of suspects under investigation for alleged involvement
in a ``terrorist enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, following leads that arose from the Roubaix inquiry,
French anti-terrorist officials visited Canada, where they hoped to
question Ressam and Atmani, his former roommate in Montreal. A
French law enforcement official described both as ``lieutenants''
of Kamel in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians were unable to locate either man. Atmani had been
deported to Bosnia, where he had previously obtained his own
passport. Ressam had assumed his new identity and was living
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investigators did turn up evidence suggesting that the
Islamic groups with which Ressam and Atmani may have been
associated, in Montreal, were practicing their own, less violent

</P>
<P>
   According to the Canadians, police in Montreal arrested 11
Muslim men this fall on suspicion of stealing laptop computers and
cellphones from parked cars, and selling them in front of the
city's mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ressam's arrest, the Canadians have said that they believe
the proceeds were funneled to Algerian-based Islamic grincluding the Armed Islamic Group, a guerrilla organization that
has been responsible for many of the 100,000 deaths in the Algerian
civil war that began in 1992.

BASEBALL'S REPUTATION SUFFERS ANOTHER BLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Somewhere, this morning, a father gift-wraps a new
baseball glove, thinking about the simple virtues the sport will
teach his boy.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, this afternoon, kids hit and throw and try to outrun
baseballs in the summer-in-December weather, delighting in the
simplicity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, at any time of day, a motorist sneaks a glance at one
of the college, high school and Little League diamonds that willspring back to life in the next few weeks, and marvels at the
simple beauty of white lines and close-cropped grass.
</P>
<P>
   It's a special time of year for baseball fans. All of a sudden
we are as close to the pitchers-and-catchers reporting date as we
are to the last out of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Then we read about Adrian Beltre and our reverie ends. Why does
The Simple Game have to be so complicated?
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the kind of thing that turns people away from
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   A team is found to have broken a scouting rule. A player's agent
presses the case because it could make his client rich.
</P>
<P>
   The league investigates. The investigation drags on, but not
because the facts of the case are in much doubt.
</P>
<P>
   League officials weigh and reweigh their options against
economic and political ramifications. Weeks later the league
contrives just the right legalese to ... dump the whole mess in the
lap of an arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty club gets to keep its ill-gotten property. The agent
and the players' union vow to appeal. The process drags on ....
</P>
<P>
   If you want to read about home-run champions and promising
rookies, you've come to the wrong moment in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   There are no heroes in the Beltre controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Dodgers, whose representatives in the Dominican Republic
altered Beltre's birth certificate in order to sign him in 1994
before the age-16 minimum and before the Yankees and Braves could
get ahold of him.
</P>
<P>
   Not Beltre, agent Scott Boras and the major league players'
association, who'd like the now-20-year-old third baseman declared
a free agent so he can raise his salary from $220,000 in 1999 to
something in the $7 million range.
</P>
<P>
   And not the baseball commissioner's office, which replaced
justice with economics and politics and ignored the proper _ and,
yes, simple _ punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers should have lost Beltre, because they acquired him
through nefarious means. When the violation was revealed in
mid-November, Dodgers executives expected to lose him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when baseball's ruling was announced Tuesday in New
York, the team was hit with a combination of fines and scouting
restrictions but Beltre remained a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because the last thing owners want is a 20-year-old who's never
batted .280, hit 20 home runs or knocked in 70 in the big leagues
going out in the free market and signing a $50 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   And because the next thing Major League Baseball executive vice
president Sandy Alderson _ who conducted the Beltre investigation _
wants is to be the owners' commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball said it delayed the ruling so it wouldn't interfere
with last week's winter-meetings tradefest, confirming the
expectation that Beltre would be declared free.
</P>
<P>
   Now baseball has made a ruling that guarantees an appeal to an
arbitrator, meaning Beltre remains in limbo as spring training's
Feb. 18 opening approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity? Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 10, I read about Denny McLain being suspended for his
role in a bookmaking operation. I was confused; what's wrong with a
pitcher doing a little publishing on the side?
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old fan of today probably understands the
complexities of the real world better than I did. Unfortunately,
sports don't give him much alternative.

 UNDATED: to go.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the old AT&AMP;T agreed to spin off its local phone operations
as the seven Baby Bells in 1984, the Bells were prohibited from
selling long-distance services, which could have enabled them to
use their local monopolies to extend into a new market.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act, however, said that the Bells would
be allowed into the long-distance market on a state-by-state basis
as they persuaded the FCC that they had opened their local networks
to competitors. The Bells are required to sell access to parts of
their networks, notably the copper lines that run into homes,
because it would be next to impossible for any new local phone
company, no matter how well heeled, to fully replicate the systems
the Bells have spent decades building.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Bell local phone companies, like GTE, which has agreed to
merge with Bell Atlantic, and Southern New England
Telecommunications, which has been acquired by SBC, are also
required to sell access to their systems. But because those
companies were never part of AT&AMP;T, they have been allowed to sell
long-distance services without facing the tests the Bells must
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no Bell has passed. New local phone companies and the
long-distance giants have consistently maintained that the Bells
have hindered their ability to sign up and serve local customers.
Under Hundt and his successor, William Kennard, the FCC has agreed
with that assessment, denying applications in Oklahoma, Illinois,
Louisiana and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic has appeared to go far beyond the other Bells
in taking the steps to open its network in New York. For at least
18 months, the New York Public Service Commission has pressed the
company to open its systems; the negotiations between the company
and the New York regulators delayed Bell Atlantic's federal
long-distance filing for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some legislators who passed the Telecommunications
Act, and even some who voted against it, have voiced impatience
with the FCC for what they see as the slow pace of results from the
act (aside from mergers). They have pressed the FCC to begin
allowing Bells into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's long-distance aspirations took an unexpected
blow last month when the Justice Department, which has an advisory
role in the application process, said the company had not yet
completely opened its network. The Justice Department said the
commission could approve the application subject to conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the process said Tuesday that it was not
likely that the commission would apply major conditions. Instead,
they said, the commission was poised to outline heavy fines that
would be imposed on Bell Atlantic were the company to slow or
reverse its progress in opening its systems.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman and FCC spokeswoman declined to
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that Bell Atlantic's success in New York
could become a template for the other Bells. But Hundt, the former
FCC chairman, said Tuesday that New York could prove to be a
special case.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many consumers in New York may not be aware that
they have a choice of local phone provider, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom
have recently begun to expand their push into the local phone
market in New York. Business customers in New York, especially in
New York City, already enjoy a wide range of options for local
communications.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Bell Atlantic has already paid much of the price
for opening its network. Other Bells in states where competitors
have not already made much progress may have less of an incentive
to open their systems, some analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as important, the long-distance market in New York is
especially lucrative because a large amount of the nation's
international communications begin or end in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that the other Bells, or even Bell Atlantic
outside New York, will want to make the same effort,'' Hundt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the quick pace of consolidation, coupled with the
crumbling of regulatory barriers, may all but ensure that the
communications market of the future is dominated by a handful of
behemoths that compete across myriad markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will have been in everybody else's markets,'' Hundt
said, ``and competition will be self-policing.''

CUBANS FREED   FROM U.S. JAIL   RETURN HOME   TO NEW PRISON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Cuban government has jailed six Cubans who
returned home as part of a deal with the United States that led
them to end a hostage standoff at a Louisiana jail last week,
Clinton administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, the officials said, were taken off an American
government jet at Havana's international airport in handcuffs and
chains on Monday night and driven to prison. Administration
officials said they had no information on what charges, if any,
might be brought or how long the six might be incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Fidel Castro said in a statement that it had
agreed to the unusual deal with the United States, which has no
formal diplomatic ties to Cuba, to avoid ``a bloody outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   A seventh Cuban who was involved in the hostage incident,
Roberto Villar Grana, 31, was not returned to Cuba, though his
mother had served as a go-between in the negotiations that ended
the six-day siege at the jail in St. Martin Parish, La.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say Villar, who was originally supposed to
join the others on the flight to Cuba, was detained in Louisiana
after a female inmate who was among the hostages said he had raped
her.
</P>
<P>
   Villar is awaiting sentencing Jan. 6 elsewhere in Louisiana for
the attempted murder of a police officer and for cocaine
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials were eager Tuesday to make
clear that the six Cubans who were returned, far from being granted
their freedom, simply faced another jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors in Louisiana said the Cubans inmates should
have been prosecuted for kidnapping, not granted free passage from
the United States. The prosecutors said the deal between Washington
and Havana could encourage other Cubans being detained in American
prisons to consider uprisings as a way to win freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The six Cubans came to the United States in 1980 during the
Mariel boatlift, which included hundreds of criminals freed from
jail by the Castro government and allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Many who arrived in the boatlift were later convicted of crimes,
which made them subject to deportation. The Castro government has
allowed them to be returned to Cuba case by case, a process that
has kept many in prison in the United States for more than a
decade, awaiting the flight home.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has identified the
Cubans who returned to Cuba on Monday as Jorge Ramirez Acosta, 45;
Lazaro Orta Elisalte, 48; Jonne Ponte Landrian, 28; Mario Mora
Medina, 32; Gerardo Santana Morales, 26; and Juan Miranda Salot,
45.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no intention of following
up on the treatment of the six by the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not American citizens and never were,'' one official
said. ``They are subject to the laws of Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   An eighth man, a Bahamian whose name has not been released by
the immigration service, was also involved in the prison uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the man's deportation to the
Bahamas was not required under terms of the agreement reached with
the Cubans, and that he would be returned to the Bahamas under
routine procedures.

<P>
   The year took its time before delivering its best. The delay is
understandable, given the millennial nature of the moment. Some of
the best experiences came from abroad: from the Salzburg Festival
and from festive reopenings at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris and
the Royal Opera House in London. But New York may have ended up
with the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   There was the new production of ``Tristan und Isolde'' at the
Metropolitan Opera, an event that might become a landmark. Marked
as well was the beginning of a Carnegie Hall season extraordinary
for its concentration of the best the passing century has had to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the special events was Pierre Boulez, who in his 70s
has ripened into one of music's more rewarding polymaths: teacher,
composer, theorist, conductor. I didn't hear all of his concerts
and workshops last month, but what I did hear deeply affected me.
</P>
<P>
   Operas experienced in Paris and London during the fall brought
splendid music surrounded by sights one did not always want to see.
Robert Wilson's brilliance extends uneasily to the special problems
of operas of a certain age, but what a revelation to hear Gluck on
successive nights and to savor in large doses the wonderful
directness of this music.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Graham Vick's conception of Verdi's ``Falstaff'' was
vivid and unfailingly cute, but it looked equally uneasy next to
Bryn Terfel's quiet, subdued, astonishingly effective re-creation
of the title role.
</P>
<P>
   I liked Busoni's ``Doktor Faust'' in Salzburg because of, not
despite, its plainness. New Yorkers will have a chance to judge for
themselves; the production and its excellent principal Thomas
Hampson are headed for the Met. Also well remembered is Salzburg's
extravagant fantasy in its production of ``Les Boreades'' by
Rameau, beautifully conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.
</P>
<P>
   `TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' AT THE MET
</P>
<P>
   Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner are the new hopes for two of
Wagner's demanding title roles. The opera's celebration of the
spirit and the flesh has seeped into the corners of every music
lover's sensibility. So overwhelming is its music that it is often
better remembered or dreamed about. But what a joy, after a long
absence, to have ``Tristan'' onstage just to reassure us that it
really exists.
</P>
<P>
   James Levine was a deliberate yet inspired conductor. Dieter
Dorn's production solved many problems with grace and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   GLUCK IN PARIS
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its renovation and reopening, the Theatre du
Chatelet hit on the clever idea of doing ``Orfeo ed Euridice'' and
``Alceste'' in their French versions. Thus satisfied were
patriotism, history and the desire for beautiful music. Sir John
Eliot Gardiner conducted both operas, combining his big musical
heart and his finicky attentions to period practice.
</P>
<P>
   None of the principals were real stars, but the melody flowed
almost without end for two consecutive nights. Recreating Wilson's
sense of gracefully suspended time is really an art in itself.
Opera singers approach it awkwardly, or, at least, most did here.
</P>
<P>
   `DOKTOR FAUST' IN SALZBURG
</P>
<P>
   Busoni worked endlessly on this opera; and though he is not
ultimately a man of the theater, he invests the orchestra part with
a dramatic life that one can almost see. Hampson was splendid in
the title role, and the Salzburg Festival's dark, dingy, ominous
production, with its railroad tracks and handcars, underlined the
inner turmoils that the opera contemplates.
</P>
<P>
   `LES BOREADES' IN SALZBURG
</P>
<P>
   It was a riot of shiny surfaces and glittery decor and costumes.
Given was less Rameau's work from start to finish than an essay on
the elements of Baroque opera. The dances listened to the music and
rethought Baroque style in their own modern terms. Under Sir
Simon's baton, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment played
with great joy. A happy evening.
</P>
<P>
   `FALSTAFF' AT COVENT GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   Here was another reopening and another celebration of
renovations just completed, at the Royal Opera House in London.
Vick's production of Verdi's opera created a colorful and
topsy-turvy world with occasional sly touches. But with Terfel's
dignified and restrained portrayal of Falstaff himself, all the
acrobatics and sight gags seemed a little out of place. Terfel was
a wonder: clear, unforced singing and a total immersion in the
part.
</P>
<P>
   `ARIODANTE' AT THE CITY OPERA
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Opera can now put on sophisticated productions
of Handel operas and supply the singers to do them with style.
``Ariodante'' was given a simple, stately staging by John Copley.
An American contingent of singers led by Bejun Mehta, Amy Burton
and Lisa Saffer was strong, but it was the phenomenal English
mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, in the title role, who caught the
imagination. The voice is dark and true, remarkably flexible and
filled with the required heat.
</P>
<P>
   BOULEZ CONDUCTS SCRIABIN
</P>
<P>
   Scrupulous care and rationality from a great French conductor
have made clear the sensual if somewhat mad beauties of a Russian
composer in a recording from Deutsche Grammophon. The paradox is
delicious, but there it is nonetheless, in Scriabin's ``Poem of
Ecstasy,'' Piano Concerto and ``Prometheus.'' Boulez keeps the
excesses of the Chicago Symphony in check. The excellent pianist is
Anatol Ugorski.
</P>
<P>
   `MOSES UND ARON' AT THE MET
</P>
<P>
   I may dispute the ultimate greatness of Schoenberg's only big
opera, but the Met's production, conducted by Levine, was an
important event for lovers and nonlovers. The opera lives in its
chorus parts, and they are difficult and wearing indeed. The Met's
ensemble singers did wonderfully, and an important piece of history
is firmly in the company's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   `RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' No blast of sheer pleasure
could be more welcome after a year of pondering the verities of art
and music. The precision and swiftness of this two-hour review are
astonishing, and I am afraid the Rockettes have snatched my heart
forever. Note, especially, the small army of dancing Santas. This
will be on my list next year as well.
</P>
<P>
   CHOPIN: NOTHING
</P>
<P>
   The silence at the 150th anniversary of Chopin's death has been
surprising but perhaps salutary. There have been a few recitals,
often in the context of local music schools and conservatories.
What are we to do otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   Chopin is among the most original, accomplished, beloved and
performed of all composers, and music celebrates his presence
continually, regardless of memorials by the calendar. I am happy to
commemorate the anniversary by wishing Chopin the blessing of
silence.

DEMOCRATS ADOPT GOP TACTIC TO SKIRT REGULATIONS ON `SOFT MONEY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., La., Mich., Fla., Mo., Calif., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic Party has established a half-dozen
committees to channel large, unregulated contributions to Senate
candidates, hoping to circumvent bans on using such money for
individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The party has created so-called ``victory funds,'' similar to
committees established for some Republican Senate candidates, to
collect unrestricted ``soft money'' donations for Senate races in
New York, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, Florida, Missouri and
California. While the funds were ostensibly created to aid
state-level Democratic campaigns, the so-called joint committees
are all incorporated at the party's national headquarters in
Washington and run by national Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said the funds, which seek to collect
millions of dollars, are intended to circumvent Federal Election
Commission rules that limit the size of contributions to individual
candidates and bar the national parties from raising and spending
soft money contributions on specific campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said
the funds are legal and do not attempt to disguise their purpose,
although they made no effort to publicize them when they were
created over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint committees allow us to fully comply with FEC
regulations. They provide our donors with a convenient vehicle for
contributions and help the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
with administrative ease and simplification,'' said David
DiMartino, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who first devised this type of fund-raising
committee two years ago, have set up two such funds this year, for
Senate candidates in Pennsylvania and Missouri, said Stuart Roy, a
spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is no fund for New York City Mayor Rudolph . Giuliani, who
is expected to seek the Republican senatorial nomination, but
national party officials did not rule out establishing one next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The fund set up for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination, has collected ``several hundred thousand
dollars,'' DiMartino said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Election law experts said that the committees themselves are
probably legal, but could run afoul of federal election law if the
spending is too closely coordinated with individual candidates or
if donors are somehow deceived about the purpose of their
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not illegal for a candidate to raise money for a soft
money account of the party, and then if that money finds its way
back into the state committee apparatus and is spent consistent the
rules,'' said Kenneth Gross, an election law specialist in
Washington. ``The jeopardy is greater on the spending side, but the
Federal Election Commission has shown a great deal of latitude on
spending by state parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The committees permit individual donors to contribute more than
the $2,000 limit that federal law allows for so-called hard money
donations from individuals to political candidates in the primaries
and general election. A corporate or union political action
committee can contribute up to $10,000 per election cycle and a
party committee, such as the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, can give $17,500 in direct assistance to a candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new state-level victory funds can take in much larger
donations outside the limits of the federal election law. For
example, if a contributor wants to give $100,000 (or even $1
million) to Mrs. Clinton's New York Senate campaign, the donor
cannot give a check of that size directly to the campaign. The
donor would instead be steered to an entity called Victory in New
York 2000, a soft-money account that can accept unlimited
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   That committee _ incorporated at national committee headquarters
in Washington and run by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee _ will then apportion the funds under terms of a tacit
agreement with the Clinton campaign, officials of the party's
senate committee said. A formal agreement to earmark the money
solely for the Clinton campaign would be a violation of federal
campaign finance law that bars spending soft money on individual
candidates, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, Victory in New York 2000 takes in the
contribution, and then sends some of it back to the Clinton
campaign as hard money. Some of the money may be sent to the New
York Democratic Party, some may be used for television advertising
in New York or nationally and some may be distributed to other
states with competitive Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows you to have a donor write one check,'' said a
Democratic official involved in the process who explained the
program on condition his name not be published. ``The joint
fund-raising committee serves as kind of a shell, it takes the
money and divides it out to the different committees.''
</P>
<P>
   The committees are obligated to disclose contributions of $200
or more and must file reports every six months; the first filings
are due in mid-January. DiMartino said that in addition to the
money raised for Mrs. Clinton in New York, there are several
hundred thousand dollars in the accounts of the other six
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the Democratic party had never before used
this mechanism for raising and spending political money.
</P>
<P>
   The first fund-raising committee of this type was created by the
Republicans on behalf of Matt Fong, the unsuccessful Republican
candidate for Senate in California in 1998, a Republican official
said. The Republicans used a variant of the joint fund-raising
system in several states in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning from them,'' DiMartino said.
</P>
<P>
   The development comes soft money comes under attack in the
presidential campaign and as Senate contest have become increasing
expensive. Each side in New York's U.S. Senate race, for example,
is expected to spend as much as $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current system of financing political campaigns
said the fund-raising committees operate in a legal gray area
because they clearly are designed to funnel unregulated soft money
into campaigns for individual candidates. Federal law allows such
contributions only to be used for so-called party-building
operations such as get-out-the-vote drives, polling and voter
education programs. But the Federal Election Commission, which has
a relatively weak enforcement record, could have difficulty closely
monitoring the spending of state political groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Cooper, a former senior FEC official who now runs a
campaign-finance watchdog group called Public Disclosure Inc., said
the committees are a new wrinkle in the old game of collecting
unrestricted money at the state level, routing it through a federal
committee and then sending it back to the states with instructions
on how it is to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the newly crafted version,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that recent FEC filings illustrate how the system
works. In October, one fund-raising entity for Mrs. Clinton
transferred $200,000 in soft money contributions to the Democrat
Senate committee. Shortly thereafter, the national committee
transferred $100,000 to the New York Democratic Party, which paid
for an advertising campaign on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in November,
the federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably legal,'' Cooper said. ``But it's still a
scheme.''

COIN ON A ROLL: TREASURY MAKING A MINT ON COMMEMORATIVE QUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
 By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ There are 325 oak branches on the new
Connecticut quarter, and Irene Wu is checking each one with a 7x
magnifying glass. Wu is a coin press operator at the San Francisco
Mint, where precision is expected because a collector may be
checking this same coin with a 100x microscope, searching for the
slightest blemish.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton signed the 50 States Commemorative Coin
Program Act into law on Dec. 1, 1997, quarters have become a coin
to save, not spend. According to a Mint survey, 15 million American
kids are collecting the quarters.
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, an estimated 60 percent of the American
population will be involved in the hunt, making the 50 state
quarters ``the hottest collectible product in several
generations,'' says Philip Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint in
Washington, D.C. ``We've sold 100 times the number that Pokemon
cards have.''
</P>
<P>
   The heads side of the new quarters is still George Washington,
though his hair has been textured as if there were gel in it.
Replacing the eagle on the tails side are designs submitted by each
state and produced five a year in the order in which the states
were admitted to the union, starting with Delaware last winter and
ending with Hawaii in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut,
quarters were issued this year. Next year, coins honoring
Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Virginia
will be added.
</P>
<P>
   The state quarters program has put a shine on the San Francisco
Mint, the gray granite fortress that looms above Market Street.
Running at low idle since it ceased production of circulation
currency in 1981, San Francisco is the only mint entrusted with
pressing the commemorative quarters that come sealed in proof sets.
</P>
<P>
   These coins, marked with an ``S,'' represent ``the peak of coin
artistry,'' according to Diehl. They are subject to much more
careful workmanship and scrutiny than the general-circulation state
quarters minted in Denver and Philadelphia and marked with a ``D''
or ``P.'' The state designs will completely replace the eagle until
the program ends in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   To meet demand for the 1999 proof set of the first five states,
production at the San Francisco Mint has already doubled to 36
million coins and will rise to 50 million when the new Sacagawea
golden dollar is rolled out next year.
</P>
<P>
   The quarters-only proof sets, available in regular copper-nickel
for $13.95 and all silver for $31.95, are expected to sell out. The
coins are sealed in plastic for the numismatists who will not keep
a coin that has been touched by a human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has given new life to the Mint in San Francisco,
the (U.S.) Mint in general and coin collecting,'' says Diehl. ``It
was considered a dying hobby until this year. A hundred million
Americans would consider themselves new recruits to coin
collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, each new collector has 12 quarters, according to a
Mint survey. To get them out of dishes and drawers, the Mint also
sells a handsome fold-out map for $24.95 with a slot for each
state's quarter, and historical and geographical information about
the states and the Mint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bringing a tremendous number of new people into coin
collecting,'' says Ritchie Clay, manager of the Coin Broker in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Farino of Portola Valley, Calif., bought five albums,
including one each for her kids. ``They're always looking for the
different states,'' Farino says. ``It's hard to make sure each
child has one of each.'' The kids, ages 10, 7 and 4, are always
snooping in her coin purse, but Farino doesn't mind. ``I think it
ties into the history of the country and learning how to collect
and take care of something,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The financial point of the program is to make money for the U.S.
Treasury: Each state quarter costs the Mint just 4 cents to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Each state's coins are minted for 10 weeks, and that is it. For
the first three _ Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey _ about 750
million of each were put into circulation, and they are already
disappearing. Production was doubled for the last two _ Georgia and
Connecticut, and that's why pocket change is lousy with them.
Pennsylvania seems to be the scarcest out West.
</P>
<P>
   The quarters can also be bought at face value in bags of 100 or
1,000 from the Mint's Web site. In October, when the Connecticut
quarter was launched, 7 million quarters sold out in 4 1/2 hours.
This level of commerce has moved the Mint into the top 25 retailers
over the Internet, and it has expanded into ancillary products like
quarter-based jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But buying in bulk over the Internet is a passionless way to
collect, like buying a full set of baseball cards in a binder. It
takes the sport out of it. It is more rewarding to collect them in
change, and more rewarding still to collect them in the state they
honor. There is satisfaction in, say, getting a Pennsylvania
quarter in change from a pumpkin and cider farmer in the
Pennsylvania Dutch country.
</P>
<P>
   Over the life of the program, a conservative estimate is that
the 50 state quarters will earn the Treasury between $6 billion and
$8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's real money that goes in and lowers the deficit,'' says
Diehl. ``It's just like tax money but a lot less painful to
raise.''

   Bell Atlantic Seen Entering Long-Distance Market
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic on Wednesday will become the first of the regional
Bell companies allowed into the $80 billion long-distance market,
signaling a new era of competition in the communications industry,
people close to the decision said. The announcement expected from
the Federal Communications Commission would allow Bell Atlantic to
sell long-distance services to the 6.6 million households it serves
in New York State. Approval would mark the first time since the
breakup of AT&AMP;T 15 years ago that millions of consumers would be
able to get both local and long-distance phone services from an
AT&AMP;T offspring.

   Ex-Investment Bank Chief Charged
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the respected investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods mysteriously scrubbed plans for a stock offering _ and
refused to say why. The reason became clear when federal
prosecutors in Manhattan charged the firm's former chairman, James
J. McDermott Jr., with insider trading in a case in which he was
accused of leaking information about potential billion-dollar bank
deals to a pornographic movie star.

   Stocks Surge on Decision by Fed
</P>
<P>
   Two broad stock market gauges leaped to records, with the Nasdaq
gaining 127.28 points, its biggest one-day gain ever, to 3,911.15,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbing 15.34 points, to
1,433.43. The Dow Jones industrial average also was higher, closing
at 11,200.54, up 56.27 points. The bulk of the gains came after the
Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates alone.
</P>
<P>
   Government bond yields were down moderately but stayed near
their two-year highs. The yield on the 30-year issue rose to 6.46
percent from 6.44 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Posts Record Profit
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group said it posted record profit of $723
million, or $1.48 a diluted share, in its most recent quarter,
beating Wall Street's forecasts after suffering a slight loss a
year earlier when a financial crisis rippled around the globe.

   FTC Lets Nuclear Ads Continue
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has agreed that advertisements by
the nuclear industry made unsubstantiated claims about the benefits
of nuclear power, but the commission said the ads were a form of
political speech that would be allowed to continue.

   Fraud Alleged in Azerbaijan Venture
</P>
<P>
   An investment promoter who made a fortune from questionable
stock dealings in his native Czech Republic has been accused of
fraud in an Azerbaijan venture that has attracted $450 million from
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys Backs Off Merger
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, announced that its
directors had rescinded its recommendation that the company be sold
to Genzyme General for $350 million in stock. The reason is that
Cell Genesys' 19 percent of Abgenix, worth about $130 million when
a merger with Genezyme General was agreed to in October, has nearly
tripled in value, to about $370 million, more than Genzyme would
pay for all of Cell Genesys. Shares of Abgenix, have soared because
of investor enthusiasm for its Xenomouse technology, a line of mice
that have had their genes modified so they can produce human
antibodies.

   New York Called Year 2000 Ready
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that New York, after spending more
than $350 million, had finished checking its hundreds of computers,
11,000 traffic lights, and other equipment for any glitches and
said he was confident that power, phones, elevators, and the rest
of the city's electronic and electrical underpinnings would work
when clocks switch to 2000.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An 80-year-old actress sheds decades to become a
fierce middle-aged tigress with unsheathed claws; classic dramas
shed decades of accumulated tarnish to glimmer like newly polished
silver, and even the American musical sheds its decades-old status
as an endangered species, with shows that instead reflected its
singular role as a mood elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Below, an assortment of uppers that affirm the theater's
distinctive powers of self-rejuvenation in the last year of the
century, plus one major downer, standing in (alas) for many other
productions of the same sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   `WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'
</P>
<P>
   Edward Albee's masterpiece rematerialized, like a Brigadoon
built of fire, for just one night, in a benefit for the HB
Playwrights Foundation and Theater. And, oh, what a night it was.
Uta Hagen brilliantly reclaimed the role she created nearly four
decades ago _ of Martha, the cannibal earth mother _ with a pro's
authority and a neophyte's zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pryce and Mia Farrow (who should both take up permanent
residence on Broadway), plus the ever-game Matthew Broderick,
helped Ms. Hagen turn what was nominally a staged reading into the
year's most dazzling evening of theater.
</P>
<P>
   `CONTACT'
</P>
<P>
   And you thought they didn't make 'em anymore. Susan Stroman's
three-part ode to the redemptive powers of dance is indeed a
real-live newborn musical. And unlike most new offerings in the
genre, which tend toward dourness and dissonance, this one is
unabashedly joyous. Along with ``James Joyce's `The Dead''' _ a far
more imbalanced but equally original work _ ``Contact'' happily
demonstrates that the American musical, which had been looking as
stunted as a bonsai, still has room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   `KISS ME, KATE'
</P>
<P>
   The big, flashy revival that got the formula right. Michael
Blakemore (director), Kathleen Marshall (choreographer) and a
justifiably self-delighted cast led by Brian Stokes Mitchell and
Marin Mazzie bring a pulsing immediacy to Cole Porter's classic.
Theatrical ham, it seems, never spoils if it's properly seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   `DEATH OF A SALESMAN,' `THE ICEMAN COMETH' and `NOT ABOUT
NIGHTINGALES'
</P>
<P>
   The three productions that made this the best season for vintage
drama that Broadway has known in many a year. Two mythic salesmen,
Arthur Miller's Willy Loman and Eugene O'Neill's Hickey, were
reincarnated in the formidable persons of Brian Dennehy and Kevin
Spacey, while Elizabeth Franz's Linda Loman brought electric
complexity to a character long dismissed as a human doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Nunn, in the meantime, achieved a glorious act of
resurrection in his passionate but delicate direction of
``Nightingales,'' a long-lost study in heartbreak by the young
Tennessee Williams that deserved a longer run than it got.
</P>
<P>
   `THE WEIR' and `THIS LIME TREE BOWER'
</P>
<P>
   Two deeply felt, intricately structured studies in the
impossibility of separating the teller from the tale, from the
young Irish playwright Conor McPherson. Seen both on Broadway
(``Weir,'' in an exquisitely acted import from London) and Off
(``Bower,'' in a more awkward domestic incarnation), these plays
established McPherson as an irresistible force in contemporary
drama, while reminding audiences of the distinctive powers of
theater as a vehicle for storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   `HOUSE/LIGHTS'
</P>
<P>
   The Wooster Group, the venerable experimental theater troupe
directed by Elizabeth LeCompte, took its mixed-media style to new
heights of sophistication with a show that translated Cubism into
flamboyantly theatrical terms. With an ensemble led by the peerless
Kate Valk, as the automaton spirit of modern times incarnate, the
production blended a Gertrude Stein opera libretto about Faust with
a hokey but sinister 1960s cult movie to consider the dehumanizing
deals contemporary culture has made with the devils of technology.
</P>
<P>
   `VIA DOLOROSA'
</P>
<P>
   David Hare, the most widely represented playwright on Broadway
this spring (``The Blue Room,'' ``Amy's View''), courageously
turned actor for his fascinating one-man show about the Gordian
knot that is the Middle East. Oddly enough, this first-person piece
of reportage was steeped in a provocative ambiguity lacking this
season in Hare's fictional dramas. And with the help of the
director Stephen Daldry, Hare ingeniously made a compelling
theatrical style out of his very stiffness and self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   `BETTY'S SUMMER VACATION'
</P>
<P>
   The triumphant return of Christopher Durang to the ranks of
America's most incisive living playwrights and a vivid testament to
the fact that satire, shaped with enough idiosyncratic charm, can
sear like no other form. Directed by Nicholas Martin, this surreal
comedy of television, tabloids and domestic homicide brought a
whole new spin to the idea of a culture that is entertaining itself
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Also heeding the muse of satire with exceptional flair: David
Lindsay-Abaire, who made a spectacularly promising debut with
``Fuddy Meers,'' a memorable comedy of amnesia, and the redoubtable
Dame Edna Everage (aka Barry Humphries), currently giving Broadway
a lesson in what it means to be a star.
</P>
<P>
   AUDRA MCDONALD
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Marie Christine,'' the highly anticipated musical
by Michael John LaChiusa, failed to enchant, its star once again
showed herself to be a theatrical sorceress of the first order.
Playing a late-19th-century Medea-like woman scorned, Ms. McDonald
parlayed her remarkable fluency in assorted musical vernaculars
into a breathtaking character portrait, all the more compelling for
its implicit contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   `SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER'
</P>
<P>
   The year's most resounding example of everything wrong with the
contemporary Broadway megamusical. A literal-minded retelling of
the 1977 movie, this dreary show managed to eliminate every vestige
of the rebellious energy and sensuality that made the film a hit,
while turning the show's dance-loving characters into an assembly
line of lead-footed androids.
</P>
<P>
   As a lesson in dehumanization, it's on a level with
``House/Lights,'' though this could surely not have been what the
creators of ``Fever'' had in mind.

   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Bomb-sniffing dogs detected traces of what
might be explosives in the car of a couple who were detained after
trying to enter the United States from Canada with a forged French
passport, but no explosives were found in the car, the authorities
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Bouabide Chamchi, 20, an Algerian, and Lucia
Garofalo, 35, of Montreal, were arrested Sunday night at a border
post at Beechers Falls, Vt. They were charged with conspiring to
use a false passport and other immigration violations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were led to question the pair and search Ms.
Garofalo's car because she had appeared at border stations three
times in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI forensics team is investigating the vehicle, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Trist Coffin said at hearing on Tuesday in Federal
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Charles Tetzlaff said there was no evidence of a
connection between the pair and Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian charged
last week with carrying bomb components into Washington state from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin argued that both Chamchi and Ms. Garofalo pose a
significant risk of fleeing the United States because of their lack
of ties to this country and their connections to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin said that Ms. Garofalo is married to a man of Algerian
descent who was deported from Canada and is living in Italy. He
said that federal officials did not know why he was deported.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for an expedited detention hearing, Maryann E. Kampmann,
Ms. Garofalo's court-appointed lawyer, said her client has three
children who are staying in Montreal with Ms. Garofalo's
72-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   During their inspection at the border station on Sunday, customs
agents found a false French passport in a coat in the car. The
passport carries the name of Boudjemaa Ben Ali.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FBI affidavit, Chamchi denied ever having seen
the passport, but Ms. Garofalo is said to have told officials at
the border that she had given the passport to Chamchi to hold. The
passport had been given to her by someone else, Ms. Garofalo told
investigators.

   WASHINGTON _ I'm flipping through the Neiman Marcus catalog. The
store's Christmas book has always been a wonderful anthropological
document, defining standards of extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   In this gilded IPO age, in this week in which Time magazine has
decided that the most important man of 1999 was the one who started
Amazon.com, in this season in which the New York auction houses are
breaking records every 20 minutes or so, I am curious about the
outer limit of conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Neiman's has offered such outlandish his-and-hers
big-ticket items as a pair of Beechcraft airplanes, a pair of
diamonds cut from a single rough stone totaling 77 carats,
his-and-hers hot air balloons, a matching Jaguar coupe and jaguar
coat, Chinese junks, submarines, dirigibles, camels, Egyptian mummy
cases, Chinese Shar-pei puppies, ermine bathrobes, robots,
windmills, buffalo calves, Hummers and chunks of adoptable rain
forest.
</P>
<P>
   How over-the-top would its top-of-the-line present be in this
fin to end all siecles?
</P>
<P>
   I eagerly turn to the last page, ``1999 His &AMP; Hers: A Lasting
Legacy.'' And underneath _ could I be seeing things? _ a picture of
the Clintons! In the fetching photo in front of the White House
Christmas tree, Bill has on his Christmas tie and Hillary has on
her red-and-green plaid frock.

   It had finally happened. After all these frantic years of
borrowed money, funny money, soft money, hard money, owed money, no
money, the Clintons had been forced to put themselves on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich in history and holiday tradition, the Clintons are living
heirlooms,'' the Neiman's blurb reads. ``You've admired them. Now
you can help the federal government support them. If you purchase
the Clintons, even quiet family dinners would be an event. Think of
the unique experience of seeing these two `interacting.' No party
could resist an ice-breaker of such memorable proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golden couple of politics is now available to take home,
if you have enough gold. Why settle for a Waterford millennium bowl
($3,500, p. 134) or an original copy of the beloved 1822 poem ``The
Night Before Christmas'' by the Rev. Clement C. Moore ($795,000, p.
38) when you can have the ultimate luxury goods?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let others dally with the politics of authenticity. We can
FedEx you the politics of cupidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider some of the things that make this offering so
deliciously irresistible. The arc of the Clintons' lives, their
transformation from hicks to the most expensive couple in American
political history, is truly remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a saga of unsurpassed his-and-hers chutzpah. Hillary's
nascent New York campaign and jaunt to Israel have been happily
placed on the public tab. And over the weekend, the Clintons
floated a priceless trial balloon suggesting that they might
actually seek reimbursement from the federal government for their
$5 million in legal fees in the Monica Lewinsky mess. Now that's
moxie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton has a finely tuned eye for trompe l'oeil,
creating inventions worthy of the Old Masters. This is your chance
to become a true patron of the black arts, to underwrite the lie
that cost more people more money than any other lie in history!
</P>
<P>
   ``This special purchase comes with an exciting bonus: free
advice from the president's bankroller/best friend, Terry
McAuliffe, who will be grateful to you for lifting from his
shoulders the Herculean burden of filling the Clinton money pit.
Before this unprecedented offer, McAuliffe was the sole proprietor
of the first couple, raising more than $275 million for the
president's library and the Clintons' campaigns and legal bills,
and guaranteeing $1.35 million for their first mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But McAuliffe is, after all, only one man. And Hollywood is,
after all, only one well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why spend a fortune on Di's dresses and Marilyn's nighties
when you can have a living, breathing, conniving piece of
Americana?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a gift to future generations. Do you really
want the American public to have to pay $5 million on top of the
$47 million Starr investigation and on top of hundreds of thousands
in reimbursements for the legal fees of Clinton aides _ just
because Bill Clinton couldn't admit in a timely fashion that he
fooled around with an intern?
</P>
<P>
   ``A gift that will keep on taking, for a mere $200,000,000,000.
Allow eight weeks for delivery.''

IMAGINE `RIVERDANCE' VIA THE DANUBE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (af) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Budapest Ensemble calls its touring folk dance program
``Csardas: The Tango of the East.'' A producer of the show readily
volunteers comparisons with the popular Irish revue ``Riverdance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a few bets are being hedged here. But scratch the
surface of the marketing campaign and genuine passion and pride are
quickly evident. The csardas is not only the Hungarian national
dance, but also an embodiment of Hungarian soul and the country's
respect for dance in all forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Csardas'' opens its monthlong tour of the United States and
Canada on Jan. 14 at the State Theater in New Brunswick, N.J.,
followed by other New York-area performances at the Tilles Center
in Brookville, on Long Island (Jan. 15), at Lehman Center in the
Bronx (Jan. 16) and at Queensborough Community College in Queens
(Jan. 22). The show loosely follows a romantic tale that Zoltan
Zsurafsky, the director of the Budapest Ensemble, calls ``East Side
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings together a chain of these beautiful dances,''
Zsurafsky said in a recent telephone interview from Hungary. ``I
was able to bring in the authentic dances of Hungary and
neighboring countries that also adore the csardas.'' The show will
also include dances like the verbunk, which was traditionally used
by the military, along with a little free wine, to recruit
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians place folk dance, unusually, in the same category as
high-art dance forms like ballet. Still, Hungarian folk dance has
had its troubles enduring the past two centuries. ``Every region
has its own style and motifs, its own `dance dialect,''' said
Zsuzsa Kaan, the editor of Tancmuveszet magazine in Budapest, also
speaking from Hungary by telephone. ``Each of the villages very
specifically maintained these treasures. Between and after the
world wars this folklore was integrated into the general life of
the people. But then it died slowly in the villages, with
influences from cities and Western culture.''
</P>
<P>
   What saved folk dance in Hungary was the tanchaz (dance house)
movement in the 1970s, when young Transylvanian villagers began to
hire musicians and gather each week simply to dance. The movement
survives today not only in Hungary but throughout the United
States, where there are regular tanchaz parties and workshops in
New York and most of the nation's other large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, folk dancers, musicians and ethnologists
started to fan out across Hungary and neighboring countries to
collect examples of authentic folk dance and music. Their models
were the composers Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly and the research
they conducted into Hungarian folk tunes. Zsurafsky, then a member
of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble and later its director, was
one of the young collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian dance is now struggling to survive the decline in
state support for the arts that followed the lifting of the Iron
Curtain and the election of a democratic government in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With those changes came a growing involvement in contemporary
dance techniques. Hungarian dancers and audiences are now as
familiar with the work of George Balanchine, Maurice Bejart and
Frederick Ashton, which they began to see in the 1970s, as they are
with Soviet classics and ballets by leading Hungarian
choreographers like Gyula Harangozo and Laszlo Seregi.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about dances like the csardas that make them so
enduringly popular? ``The csardas is basically very simple,''
Zsurafski said. ``Two steps to the left, two steps to the right.
But it is also a very individual dance. It allows a great amount of
improvisation, as well as the resolving of personal tensions. The
csardas connects neighboring countries in Europe. And, like the
tango, it is essentially very erotic. Like dervishes, the dancers
spin together into another level.''

MARKETPLACE: MCCOY PAYS THE PRICE AT BANK ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ John McCoy, the chief executive who helped transform
Bank One Corp. from a regional bank into the nation's
fourth-largest bank holding company through big mergers, stepped
down Tuesday after a tumultuous year at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's board said that McCoy, 56, had decided to retire as
chief executive and chairman of the board effective immediately.
His duties will be assumed by Verne Istock, 59, the president of
Bank One, who will serve as acting chief executive until a
successor is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bank One, which have been severely depressed for
months, soared on the news, climbing $3.375 to $33.375 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's decision to step down from Bank One, which is based
here, comes after a series of executive departures tied to a
yearlong earnings slide that was largely attributed to the
company's First USA credit card and consumer lending division,
which accounts for about one-third of the bank's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which surprised many on Wall Street, also underscores
the great difficulties that banks and other large institutions are
facing after a wave of expensive mergers and acquisitions that have
put increasing pressure on top executives to integrate diverse
corporate cultures and then create the kind of earnings growth that
would justify such deals.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said that McCoy had promised great things
from the new Bank One, which merged last year with First Chicago
NDB Corp. A year earlier, Bank One acquired First USA, one of the
nation's largest credit card issuers, with more than 64 million
customers and about $70 billion in assets in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   First USA was supposed to be the growth engine, helping to power
a big national bank. But First USA began sliding earlier this year,
partly because of increased competition but also because of growing
attrition rates, high penalty fees compared with rivals and poor
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The profit declines in the First USA division hit Bank One hard,
creating two quarters of disappointing earnings, and there have
been warnings from the company about more bad news to come.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of Bank One is down about 50 percent from its
high of $64.875 in April 1998, and below the level it was before
the Bank One merger with First Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Dickson, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, says that
Bank One profit warnings have punished the stock. For 2000, profit
expectations have been cut by 32 percent, accounting for about $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, shareholders have taken a bath, analysts said, with
the bank losing more than $30 billion in market value. And there
have been rumors that the bank's stock collapse made it a possible
takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   A group of shareholders has already filed a class-action
lawsuit, saying that the company concealed earnings information,
and the board, which included at least one huge shareholder, grew
disenchanted with McCoy, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some on the board thought they had been sold a pig in a
poke,'' said Nancy Bush, a banking analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``I
was told the move today cleared the logjam on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision came after a series of resignations and
shake-ups. Earlier this year, two vice chairmen retired and the
head of the First USA division resigned. In October, the board
reshuffled management duties, giving McCoy oversight of First USA
and Istock control over the day-to-day duties of most of the other
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the problems went far beyond First USA. There
were high expectations and failed promises, management missteps and
a clash of cultures between the ambitious, risky Bank One group and
the more risk-averse First Chicago executives.
</P>
<P>
   John Rau, the chief executive at Chicago Title Corp. and former
employee of First Chicago, said that the board of Bank One got
impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it said there are different skills necessary in
driving a series of community banks through a series of deals and
riding this big train,'' he said. ``They had this First USA deal
and it seems they hitched too much to that star.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, who was with the bank for more than 29 years and served
as chief executive for the last 15 years, retired without making
any statement. He got his start in Columbus, Ohio, where Bank One
had been based until this year. And he was the third member of his
family to head the bank. His grandfather was a bank executive in
the 1930s, and his father, John G. McCoy, created the Banc One name
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Istock, the former chief executive at First Chicago, is said by
analysts to be more averse to risk, and in the interim, while the
bank searches for a replacement, he may be exactly what the company
needs _ something steady. The bank said it expected to complete its
search for a chief executive in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Istock said he had to withhold comment
until January, when the bank plans to meet analysts to offer
details about its financial situation and the problems at First
USA.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the company might be considering a spinoff of
the First USA division or a sale or merger of the company, but the
consensus now is that the bank must right its ship first.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marshall Weber started reading the Bible Tuesday and
he just kept going.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn on the winter solstice, Weber stood at the front of the
city's oldest active synagogue, took a sip of ginseng-gingko-ginger
tea, adjusted his flowing garments, opened a weathered,
leather-covered volume to Genesis and began the reading.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a nap upon completion of the Old Testament sometime
Wednesday night, Weber, a full-bearded, 39-year-old performance
artist and publisher of art books, does not intend to stop until
Friday at dawn. By then, he reckons, he will have read the entire
work _ all 66 books, 31,000 verses, 800,000-odd words. Plus the
Apocrypha.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Partly because it is there, and because Christmas and
Revelations' day of reckoning are just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I always wanted to do,'' said Weber, who has
read aloud Nietzsche's ``Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (24 hours) and
Joyce's ``Ulysses'' (33 hours) and once read William T. Vollmann's
``The Rifles'' in 22 hours inside a 15-degree refrigerated truck at
a Canadian arts festival.
</P>
<P>
   But Weber, who considers himself a nontraditional Jew, said the
reading _ at the Orensanz Center for the Arts, housed inside the
150-year-old temple of the Shul of New York on the Lower East Side
of Manhattan _ was also a way to explore the place where the
secular and the religious intersect.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the act of devotion is really on a cultural and
literary level,'' he said in his apartment in Greenwich Village on
Monday night. ``But given the amount of mental and physical and
psychical energy this is going to take, I'm prepared for any kind
of spiritual experience in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1:12 p.m. Tuesday, Weber had progressed to Exodus 21 _ the
often overlooked part just after the Ten Commandments that deals
with what to do if someone else's ox falls into your uncovered pit.
He had been temporarily banished to the building's drafty basement
because Modern Bride magazine had rented the ornate German-Romantic
sanctuary upstairs for a photography session. He read in a quiet,
almost boyish tenor, pausing occasionally to cough and blow his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Other than two friends and a couple of reporters, there was no
one in attendance, perhaps because Weber was unable to raise money
to promote the reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious people were scared that there might be some kind
of offensive component, and the art world was scared that there
would be some kind of offensive component that would backlash to
them,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider his performance particularly radical. The
reading aloud of scripture is, after all, the basis of most
religious services. But the president of the National Bible
Association, Thomas May, said he had never heard of one person
reading the entire Bible more or less in one sitting. The
association, a nondenominational group based in New York, has
sponsored Bible-reading marathons for years, but those affairs are
relays involving hundreds of people reading a few pages each.
</P>
<P>
   While he expressed puzzlement with Weber's purpose and doubt
that he would be able to finish in the allotted time, May wished
him Godspeed. ``I don't think it's ever a bad thing to read the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   As straightforward as Weber's project may seem, he has been
preparing for it for a year. He spent months searching for the
perfect Bible, settling on a folio-sized King James version printed
in 1873, illustrated by Gustave Dore. To cultivate the proper Old
Testament look, he said, he has not taken a blade to a hair on his
body since last December. For the last few days, he has tried to
sleep as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lose my voice, because I modulate it very well,'' he
said, ``but after 30 hours, fatigue sets in, in terms of visual
hallucinations. When I was reading `Ulysses,' I had a hallucination
that I was at a copying machine, copying the pages as I read them,
and I asked myself, `Why am I copying them?' and it turned out I
wasn't. But it didn't interrupt the reading.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:42 p.m., Weber read the last verse of Exodus and stood up
abruptly, knocking over a heater and his tea kettle. He had been
reading for seven and a half hours and was less than one-tenth of
the way through the Bible. His legs wobbled like a weary boxer's.
</P>
<P>
   But as he slurped down a container of chicken soup from Katz's
Delicatessen, he seemed to revive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more law coming in Leviticus,'' he said, ``but at
least we're done with the ark. It kind of gets more lyrical from
here on.''
</P>
<P>
   He blew his nose and sat down to Leviticus. A landscape of
blood, burnt offerings and lepers lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rocks,'' he said as he began to read. &QL;

   BC-WEB-PATENTS-ART-NYT (moved on Friday, Dec. 10)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, Dec. 10,
about the rise in Internet-related patents referred to one recently
granted to LinkShare, a New York company. The article said the
patent gave LinkShare the right to block other Web sites from using
an arrangement in which they earn commissions from purchases by
users they refer to online stores. The article described the
LinkShare patent as a technique for doing business, a claim with
potentially broad implications, rather than a narrow technological
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The article should have attributed the description of the
patent's breadth to LinkShare. No legal claims have yet arisen, and
LinkShare's competitors say they feel the patent has a more limited
scope.

A LIFE FILLED WITH THE SHEER JOY OF PLAYING THE PIANO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Rubinstein was 42 and had long been famous when he made
his first recording, on March 9, 1929, at the studios of the
Gramophone Company, or HMV, in London. Before this he had disdained
existing recording technology, which, he said, made the piano sound
like a banjo.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of electrical recording, with its greater
fidelity, in 1925 changed his mind. When Rubinstein heard the
results of his first session, a performance of Chopin's Barcarolle,
he had tears in his eyes, he later recalled: ``It was the kind of
performance I dreamed of, and the sound reproduced faithfully the
golden tone of the piano. This was a very important day. A new life
had begun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it had. Rubinstein continued making records, extensively,
almost compulsively, for nearly 50 years. He started recording in
1940 for RCA Victor, then an HMV affiliate, and became one of that
company's best-selling artists. Finally, in 1976, at 89, he made
his last recording (Schumann's ``Fantasiestucke'' and Beethoven's
Sonata No. 18) and retired.
</P>
<P>
   The same qualities that distinguished his artistry on the
concert stage made him ideally suited to the recording studio:
seemingly endless stamina; a keen intelligence, which enabled him
to commit a vast repertory to memory and keep it there; rich,
singing tone, which carried beautifully even in pianissimo
passages; a special combination of elan and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   No pianist of this century conveyed more sheer joy in playing
the piano, and few gave more concerts. You cannot imagine
Rubinstein plagued by stage fright or finger strain.
</P>
<P>
   He was even more relaxed in the recording studio. Max Wilcox,
one of Rubinstein's producers at RCA, has left a vivid account of
recording the pianist in all 14 Chopin waltzes at a studio in Rome
in 1963. On that breezy summer night, Rubinstein played the affable
host, as if for a evening of music at his home. His younger son,
the actor John Rubinstein, then 17, turned pages.
</P>
<P>
   RCA had scheduled sessions for several evenings. But on the
first night, the 76-year-old pianist started at 6:45 and, pleased
with the results, kept going, finishing the final waltz at 11:15.
``We were all limp _ but not Rubinstein,'' Wilcox writes. ``The
party on the Via Veneto lasted until 2:30 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Now RCA Red Seal has released the pianist's entire discography
in a deluxe boxed set, ``The Arthur Rubinstein Collection'': 94 CDs
in 82 volumes, more than 106 hours of music, making it one of the
biggest and most expensive special collections yet issued. (Retail
cost is about $1,300.) Everything is here: the early HMV
recordings; many RCA recordings that have long been absent from the
catalog; all of the many chamber and concerto performances;
recordings of live concerts that were released commercially; and
some items that have never previously been issued.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Rubinstein's legacy is clear just from looking at,
not to mention lifting, the collection, which comes in a gray,
clothbound, 15-by-20-inch case, with flaps that open to reveal two
crammed rows of CDs. All the recordings have been carefully
remastered.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Rubinstein was a major musician of this century.
Still, this collection raises nagging questions: What is it for?
Who is the target buyer?
</P>
<P>
   The set is not ideally organized for archives or libraries. The
recordings are generally presented in chronological order, though
many volumes offer mixed programs drawn from different periods.
Inexplicably, no index is provided. A 376-page accompanying book,
printed in three languages (English, German, French), offers essays
and reminiscences by colleagues, and lists the contents of each
volume. But there is no way to look up, for example, how many
recordings Rubinstein made of Chopin's Second Concerto without
leafing through the entire catalog. (The answer is four.)
</P>
<P>
   The collection could have provided a critical guide to the
discography, recording by recording, explaining the circumstances
under which each was made and giving an informed evaluation of the
results. The model for such a reference source is the critic John
Ardoin's book ``The Callas Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   RCA's deluxe limited edition, released in time for the holidays,
would seem to be a luxury purchase for moneyed consumers. It will
certainly attract attention in an owner's living room. But do even
Rubinstein's greatest admirers need to have, for example, all four
of his recordings of Brahms' Second Concerto?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is easy for a critic who got this set free to
forget how much pleasure it might bring to a music lover who must
pay a lot for it. There is a wealth of magnificent music-making on
these discs by an artist sometimes overlooked in debates about the
pantheon of 20th-century pianists.
</P>
<P>
   This collection should set that neglect right. I was surprised
to realize how many of these recordings were familiar from my
having grown up with them. In the interest of full disclosure I
should state that I have not listened to anything close to all 106
hours and probably never will. Still, my generous sampling, though
sometimes stupefying, was gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein's first recordings are particularly fascinating for
what they reveal about his subsequent development. Later in life,
he was candid about his young years as a prodigiously talented but
cocky and careless pianist.
</P>
<P>
   In the second volume of his memoirs, ``My Many Years,''
Rubinstein calls his childhood practice regimen a ``cheat and a
fake'': ``My technical facility allowed me to learn in no time a
concerto, a sonata or some shorter pieces, which I dared to play in
concerts with the greatest aplomb, covering technically difficult
passages with an intelligent use of pedal or with some dynamic
impacts which gave the innocent listener the idea I had played the
piece to perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks the pianist was exaggerating should listen to
his first recording of Brahms' Second Concerto, from 1929, with the
London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Albert Coates, the premiere
recording of the concerto. Rubinstein brings dash and brio to a
work often treated today like some weighty monument of the Germanic
repertory. The tempos are brisk, and the textures are light. The
account is exciting and sunny.
</P>
<P>
   But there are whole handfuls of wrong notes and audaciously
faked passages. It is not that Rubinstein lacked technique, as the
brilliance of his playing in a 1932 recording of Falla's ``Ritual
Fire Dance'' makes clear. But he didn't work hard enough here to
conquer the technical challenges of the unwieldy Brahms concerto.
In comparison, the Falla was a splashy work that he could dispatch
with his trademark fervor and panache.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he wowed audiences with his arm-blurring
rendition of the ``Ritual Fire Dance,'' as he recalled in a 1969
French documentary about his life. Sitting with a self-satisfied
smile in his beautiful Paris villa, Rubinstein said: ``That piece
bought me this house.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, after a six-year courtship, Rubinstein married Aniela
Mlynarski, the 23-year-old daughter of a fine Polish conductor. In
the summer of 1934 their first child, Eva, was born, while they
stayed in a French mountain village. Becoming a family man in his
late 40s must have shaken him. He may also have been taken aback by
the increasing fidelity of recordings, which revealed his technical
shortcomings all too plainly. That summer he shut himself into a
stable room with an upright piano and worked maniacally on his
technique, up to nine hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged a transformed pianist, as recordings from that time
make clear. In his 1937 account of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No.
10, he sounds like a technical phenomenon. The fingerwork is fleet
and crystalline, and the repeated octave passages are supple and
delicate. The performance is filled with color and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The recording of Chopin's First Concerto from the same year,
with John Barbirolli conducting the London Symphony, is also
splendid: rhapsodic, lyrical, with pearly passagework and crisp
rhythmic vitality. Barbirolli takes a huge cut in the long
orchestral exposition that begins the first movement, but such
practice was not uncommon at the time.
</P>
<P>
   There are other rarities to admire, like the 1947 recording of
Beethoven's Fourth Concerto, with Thomas Beecham conducting the
Royal Philharmonic. Rubinstein's playing is scintillating and
exciting. Interestingly, in the first and third movements he
performs cadenzas composed by Saint-Saens, which are almost
Lisztian in their Romanticism yet tasteful and effective. This
performance makes the Fourth seem as aristocratic as the mighty
``Emperor'' Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   There is no straying from Beethoven's score in a 1944 recording
of the Third Concerto with Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC
Symphony Orchestra. Rubinstein is on his best behavior here,
playing everything scrupulously for the exacting maestro yet with
Classical refinement and lots of verve.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly numerous recordings of 20th-century works put
Rubinstein's relationship to his own time in perspective. As a
young man, he played and championed music by composer colleagues,
including Ravel, Falla, Albeniz, Villa-Lobos, Rachmaninoff,
Milhaud, Prokofiev and, especially, his beloved Polish countryman
Karol Szymanowski. He later kept these works in his repertory but
did not play new works by younger composers, a fact that led to his
being considered old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   I heard him intelligently challenge this simplistic
characterization in an interview late in his life. When he was
young, he said, he played music that was new, as young people are
wont to do. ``The music of today is for the young,'' he said, ``not
for me. I don't understand it. But I don't criticize it either. You
cannot criticize what you do not understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Rubinstein recordings, his numerous accounts of
Chopin's works are probably the most familiar. RCA has kept many of
these available, with good reason: Rubinstein set the standard in
this century for Chopin playing. In these performances he achieves
an uncanny balance between freedom and structure, between long-line
lyricism and harmonic color, between pianistic elegance and musical
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   He brings an almost Classical quality of restraint and
refinement to music often subjected to emotive distortions in the
name of rubato. There is a virile yet cool quality to his
expressivity, which somehow makes the music even more melancholic.
And his feeling for Polish dance rhythms is authentic and
infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone ever played the 51 mazurkas better? Both the complete
recording from 1952-53 and the slightly more autumnal version from
1965-66 are landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The set includes three interviews that Rubinstein did in the
1960s but not my favorite conversation, which took place two
decades later on public television, when he was 90. The
interviewer, Robert MacNeil, remarked that though a famous bon
vivant, Rubinstein was now at an age when it was impossible to
resist facing mortality. MacNeil asked the pianist for his thoughts
on the matter. Did he, for example, believe in life after death?
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein answered that for him, as an intellectual man, this
was a concept he could not accept. Then, his eyes twinkling, he
said, ``Of course, if I am incorrect, I will be delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   He would no doubt be delighted to live on through ``The
Rubinstein Collection.'' Now I just have to find a place in my
apartment to put the thing.

 _ SF CHRON  
 AT&AMP;T Slams Pac Bell for Tactics to Snatch Back Local Customers  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
AT&AMP;T accused Pacific Bell yesterday of a ``systematic and
fraudulent campaign'' to monopolize California's telephone market
by illegally causing thousands of customers who picked AT&AMP;T for
local-toll call service to switch back to Pac Bell.
<P>
   In a formal complaint filed with the California Public Utilities
Commission, AT&AMP;T charged that Pac Bell and its parent, SBC
Communications, used scare tactics and other illegal methods to get
80,000 AT&AMP;T local-toll customers switched back to Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an unscrupulous effort to maintain a monopoly grip on
local-toll service, Pacific Bell has thwarted competitive choices
of thousands of California residents,'' AT&AMP;T Pacific Region
President president  &LR; Lois Hedgpeth said in a news release.
``SBC/Pacific Bell's actions demonstrate that it is not willing to
compete on a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell, however, denied the allegations and fired back
charges that AT&AMP;T was guilty of the same practice of ``slamming,''
or switching customers without their permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of the pot calling the kettle
black,'' said John Britton, Pac Bell corporate communications
director. ``This industry and this company helped create the
fraudulent practice of slamming, and they've done it to many of our
local-toll customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is another skirmish in the battle to open up
California's lucrative local telephone market to competition. And
if proven, AT&AMP;T's accusations could sour Pacific Bell's upcoming
request to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC in May ruled that California phone customers could sign
up with any phone company as their local-toll carrier. Previously,
Pacific Bell was the main provider of local-toll calls, which are
calls made to regional numbers more than 12 miles away but not
long-distance. Until the May PUC ruling, customers who wanted to
use a different carrier for local-toll calls had to dial a
cumbersome seven-digit code before each call.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Costa, telecommunications research director for the
ratepayer advocacy group The Utility Reform Network, noted that
Pacific Bell has previously said it has recorded about 70,000
complaints of long-distance carriers illegally switching customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tries to make itself look like the good guy,'' Costa said.
``Pacific Bell keeps information on the behavior of other companies
but does not keep information on its own improper behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Jame Peterson said his company was suspicious of
Pac Bell's claims and had its service representative begin
follow-up surveys of customer who had switched to AT&AMP;T and then had
switched back to Pac Bell for local-toll service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said it found evidence that Pac Bell switched customers
without their consent, used marketing representatives calls and
letters to scare or confuse customers into thinking their service
would be disconnected, and ``circumvented'' a third-party
verification system set up by the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Pac Bell tried to charge AT&AMP;T about $1 million to AT&AMP;T &LR; 
 &LR; to recover the cost of switching customers who had complained
about being slammed, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Billingsly, an analyst with the PUC's Office of
Ratepayer Advocates, said she had not seen the formal complaint or
the evidence gathered by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to doubt that this is happening, although I
have not personally seen any of the data on it,'' Billingsly said.
``It's the kind of behavior that we were worried about when we
devised the rules that governed how you handle customers changing
their service, especially the way Pacific Bell handles it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell has filed for PUC permission to offer long-distance
service, but first has to prove it has done all it could to open
the local market to competition.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T's allegations are true, ``it would cast an unfortunate
pall on (Pacific Bell's) attempts to show they really have done
everything they were supposed to do and are not trying to impede
competition,'' Billingsly said.

 BUSINESS TRAVEL: B &AMP; B's DRAW CORPORATE TRAVELERS; SURVEYS;(Duplication warning: also moving in `t' travel file.) 
(bl) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My own impressions of the bed-and-breakfast culture are limited
to a couple of scattered personal experiences reinforced by scenes
in movies like ``Groundhog Day,'' where Bill Murray is trapped for
eternity in one, and ``Flirting With Disaster,'' where the
overbearing proprietor denounces a hapless New York City couple,
Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette, for disobeying a rule. ``You are
not B &AMP; B people!'' she hollers.
</P>
<P>
   B &AMP; B's don't usually turn up much in business travel
discussions. But in fact, a small but growing number of business
travelers are booking B &AMP; B's, said Eric Goldreyer, the founder and
president of BedandBreakfast.com, a company based in Golden, Colo.,
that lists information and provides an online link to book
accommodations at about 27,000 bed-and-breakfast inns, many of them
in or near major business centers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldreyer, himself a longtime B &AMP; B person, began the company in
1994 after he decided that comprehensive B &AMP; B information was
sparse and mostly available only in regional brochures of uncertain
vintage and reliability. Even assuming you found a place that
seemed right, booking a room was often a matter of making a phone
call and hoping someone would pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``B &AMP; B information is usually out of date soon after it's
printed,'' he said. His idea to go online with a huge number of
national listings was successful enough that the company was
acquired last June by WorldRes Inc., an online travel network that
operates a booking engine that serves small hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The B &AMP; B site is easy to navigate and has very detailed
listings (www.bedandbreakfast.com). About two-thirds of the site's
registered users are women, Goldreyer said. This includes women who
travel on business who have little taste for skyscraper hotels with
the waterfalls in the atrium and the sales team roaming the lobby
in tasseled loafers and name tags.
</P>
<P>
   Melisa Harder, the company's marketing director and a frequent
business traveler, said that personal service was a main reason
some female travelers turned to B &AMP; B's. On one recent business
trip to Los Angeles, she said, an airline lost a bag that contained
an outfit she needed. ``I checked into a B &AMP; B worried about what I
was going to wear,'' she said. ``But the innkeeper personally
washed all of my clothes for me and returned them to me cleaned and
ironed while I waited in the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying Travel
</P>
<P>
   Four of every 10 business travelers are women, according to the
1999 National Business Travel Monitor, an annual survey conducted
for the travel industry by Yesawich, Pepperdine &AMP; Brown/Yankelovich
Partners. The survey suggests that the travel industry, especially
the hotel business, needs to pay more attention to serving women.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating a business hotel, women place a greater emphasis
than men on such things as personal service, understated elegance,
secure electronic door locks, express check-in and check-out, a
selection of good in-hotel restaurants and free airport shuttle
service, the survey shows. Women are also considerably more hard
nosed than men about overall room price and such annoyances as
hotel telephone surcharges. Even when the company is paying the
bill, women resent it far more than men when a hotel tacks on a
75-cent or $1 fee every time they use the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels aside, men and women express roughly the same preferences
when it comes to airlines and car rentals: better service, a wider
range of personal choices and prices, reliable on-time performance,
dependability of brands, comfort and ease of making arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The current survey, incidentally, shows a sharp change in
attitude among business travelers about the prospects of life on
the road. In 1998, 70 percent of business travelers agreed that
innovations in technology would ``reduce business travel in the
future.'' This year, reality seems to have hit. Only 42 percent now
agree with that proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding suggests that travel agents and online travel
companies alike need to think harder about how to provide
information that is considered credible and free of promotional
hype. Among business travelers, word-of-mouth _ anecdotal
information from friends and colleagues _ is the single most
important influence in choosing travel services. Travelers are also
increasingly inclined to go online to check travel recommendations
against the opinions of others in consumer-oriented travel chat
rooms. ``If the feedback is not positive, they are likely to move
to the next alternative,'' the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Business air fares in the United States shot up 6 percent in
October over the comparable period in 1998 _ and were 49 percent
higher than in January 1996. That's according to American Express
Travel Related Services. In 2000, the National Business Travel
Association predicts, business air fares will take off again,
rising 7.7 percent over this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those fare increases, more workers are traveling on
business than ever before. In 1998, nearly 44 million Americans
took at least one business trip, a 14 percent increase over five
years, a survey by the Travel Industry of America finds. Other
findings: The duration of the average business trip was three
nights, and about one in five business travelers rented a car. &QL;

 Biotech Firms' Merger Plan Hits a Snag  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In an unusual case of seller's remorse, the board of directors of
Cell Genesys has advised shareholders in the biotech firm to vote
down a $350 million acquisition by Genzyme Corp. that it had
announced in October.
<P>
   Since October, Foster City's Cell Genesys has seen shares of its
publicly traded spin-off, Abgenix Inc. of Fremont, roughly triple
in value, giving Abgenix a market capitalization of $1.69 billion _
and making Cell Genesys' 22 percent stake in Abgenix worth more
than Genzyme's acquisition offer.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse announcement yesterday, Cell Genesys said it had
tried to renegotiate the deal but had been rebuffed by Genzyme.
Cell Genesys said it would hold a shareholders vote in February.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Cell Genesys spokeswoman, if Genzyme calls off
the merger before the vote, it can demand a $15 million
cancellation fee. But if it allows the vote to proceed and loses,
Cell Genesys walks away for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme, which is based in Massachusetts, refused to comment
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger tiff puts a spotlight on the recent success of
Abgenix, which was spun out of Cell Genesys in 1996 to
commercialize a new technology for making drugs based on human
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Abgenix Chief Financial Officer Kurt Leutzinger explained the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Antibodies are a natural defense against disease. They act like
guided missiles, targeting and destroying specific bacteria or
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   But people's bodies don't always make the correct antibodies,
and in recent years, several biotech firms have assisted nature by
removing antibodies from mice and modifying these mouse antibodies
to fight human diseases. Drugs like the cancer-fighting agent
Herceptin are an example of this.
</P>
<P>
   Leutzinger said Abgenix has taken this strategy one step
further, by creating a special breed of mouse, called the
XenoMouse, that produces human antibodies rather than the mice
variety. Abgenix is now conducting early clinical trials to prove
that its XenoMouse human antibodies work better than the previous
generation of modified mouse antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began to notice Abgenix in July, after the company
reported positive results in a test of its antibody drug for
psoriasis and began a clinical trial of an antibody to fight
several types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to developing its own remedies, Abgenix has licensed
its XenoMouse technology to firms like Pfizer and Amgen, and stands
to earn royalties on drugs they discover using its technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take years, but Abgenix has the technology to grow
into a top-tier biotech firm,'' said Richard van den Broek, an
analyst with Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But van den Broek, a fan of Abgenix, questioned the ``crazy''
market valuations that has driven Abgenix's shares up from around
$20 in July. Shares of the Fremont firm gained $5.25 to close at
$112 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys, which has been overshadowed by its spin-off,
slipped 44 cents yesterday to close at $10.88. Genzyme gained $3.81
to end the day at $42.

 BUSINESS TRAVEL: B &AMP; B's DRAW CORPORATE TRAVELERS; SURVEYS;(Duplication warning: also moved with `f' code.) 
(bl) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My own impressions of the bed-and-breakfast culture are limited
to a couple of scattered personal experiences reinforced by scenes
in movies like ``Groundhog Day,'' where Bill Murray is trapped for
eternity in one, and ``Flirting With Disaster,'' where the
overbearing proprietor denounces a hapless New York City couple,
Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette, for disobeying a rule. ``You are
not B &AMP; B people!'' she hollers.
</P>
<P>
   B &AMP; B's don't usually turn up much in business travel
discussions. But in fact, a small but growing number of business
travelers are booking B &AMP; B's, said Eric Goldreyer, the founder and
president of BedandBreakfast.com, a company based in Golden, Colo.,
that lists information and provides an online link to book
accommodations at about 27,000 bed-and-breakfast inns, many of them
in or near major business centers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldreyer, himself a longtime B &AMP; B person, began the company in
1994 after he decided that comprehensive B &AMP; B information was
sparse and mostly available only in regional brochures of uncertain
vintage and reliability. Even assuming you found a place that
seemed right, booking a room was often a matter of making a phone
call and hoping someone would pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``B &AMP; B information is usually out of date soon after it's
printed,'' he said. His idea to go online with a huge number of
national listings was successful enough that the company was
acquired last June by WorldRes Inc., an online travel network that
operates a booking engine that serves small hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The B &AMP; B site is easy to navigate and has very detailed
listings (www.bedandbreakfast.com). About two-thirds of the site's
registered users are women, Goldreyer said. This includes women who
travel on business who have little taste for skyscraper hotels with
the waterfalls in the atrium and the sales team roaming the lobby
in tasseled loafers and name tags.
</P>
<P>
   Melisa Harder, the company's marketing director and a frequent
business traveler, said that personal service was a main reason
some female travelers turned to B &AMP; B's. On one recent business
trip to Los Angeles, she said, an airline lost a bag that contained
an outfit she needed. ``I checked into a B &AMP; B worried about what I
was going to wear,'' she said. ``But the innkeeper personally
washed all of my clothes for me and returned them to me cleaned and
ironed while I waited in the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying Travel
</P>
<P>
   Four of every 10 business travelers are women, according to the
1999 National Business Travel Monitor, an annual survey conducted
for the travel industry by Yesawich, Pepperdine &AMP; Brown/Yankelovich
Partners. The survey suggests that the travel industry, especially
the hotel business, needs to pay more attention to serving women.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating a business hotel, women place a greater emphasis
than men on such things as personal service, understated elegance,
secure electronic door locks, express check-in and check-out, a
selection of good in-hotel restaurants and free airport shuttle
service, the survey shows. Women are also considerably more hard
nosed than men about overall room price and such annoyances as
hotel telephone surcharges. Even when the company is paying the
bill, women resent it far more than men when a hotel tacks on a
75-cent or $1 fee every time they use the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels aside, men and women express roughly the same preferences
when it comes to airlines and car rentals: better service, a wider
range of personal choices and prices, reliable on-time performance,
dependability of brands, comfort and ease of making arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The current survey, incidentally, shows a sharp change in
attitude among business travelers about the prospects of life on
the road. In 1998, 70 percent of business travelers agreed that
innovations in technology would ``reduce business travel in the
future.'' This year, reality seems to have hit. Only 42 percent now
agree with that proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding suggests that travel agents and online travel
companies alike need to think harder about how to provide
information that is considered credible and free of promotional
hype. Among business travelers, word-of-mouth _ anecdotal
information from friends and colleagues _ is the single most
important influence in choosing travel services. Travelers are also
increasingly inclined to go online to check travel recommendations
against the opinions of others in consumer-oriented travel chat
rooms. ``If the feedback is not positive, they are likely to move
to the next alternative,'' the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Business air fares in the United States shot up 6 percent in
October over the comparable period in 1998 _ and were 49 percent
higher than in January 1996. That's according to American Express
Travel Related Services. In 2000, the National Business Travel
Association predicts, business air fares will take off again,
rising 7.7 percent over this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those fare increases, more workers are traveling on
business than ever before. In 1998, nearly 44 million Americans
took at least one business trip, a 14 percent increase over five
years, a survey by the Travel Industry of America finds. Other
findings: The duration of the average business trip was three
nights, and about one in five business travelers rented a car. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Overtime, Sick Leave Law Changing 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: What are the chief California legislative issues that will &LR; 
 &UR; affect small businesses in the new year? &LR;
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Two major changes in overtime and sick leave will go into
effect January 1. In addition, the Legislature is expected to
tackle major proposals for workers' compensation, unemployment
insurance and minimum wage, according to the California Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   First, the regulations that go into effect January 1:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Overtime &LR;  _ California returns to daily overtime in 2000. Overtime
will be paid after eight hours worked in a day rather than after 40
hours worked in a week. Time-and-a-half will be paid after eight
hours worked in a day and double time after 12 hours in a day.
</P>
<P>
   The new law does provide for makeup time at a regular rate of
pay for employees who work fewer hours one day and more time
another so long as the time is made up in the same week and the
employee works no more than 11 hours in a single day. Makeup time
also requires a written agreement between the employer and
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate work schedules, such as the four-day work week, are
also permitted as long as no more than 10 hours is worked in a day.
Alternate schedules must be approved by a two-thirds secret ballot
vote of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Sick Leave &LR;  _ Employers who provide paid sick leave must now allow
employees to use up to half of it for care of a sick parent, child
or spouse. Employees can use this sick leave for any family
illness, including colds and flu. Note: The new law does not
require employers to provide paid sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   The dawn of Y2K also means that employers must update their
employee handbooks and employee notices to reflect changes in state
disability insurance, COBRA, Cal/ OSHA information and
discrimination. The California Chamber, (800) 331-8877, sells
updated employment law kits for $189. You can also get information
at its Web site (www.calchamber.com). &LR; cq
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Turning to what happens beginning January 3, the second year
of the 1999-2000 legislative session, debate is expected on a
number of issues affecting employers. Here are three of the top
ones, according to the California Chamber:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Workers' Compensation _ &LR;  A bill that would have increased workers'
compensation premiums for employers by $2.1 billion was rejected by
Gov. Gray Davis earlier this year because he felt that the added
costs would seriously hurt the state's economy. It is expected that
labor unions and others will be back in 2000 with another bill to
substantially increase workers' compensation benefits. The chamber
and other employer groups want any benefit increases to be offset
by cost-saving reforms to help streamline the workers' comp system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Unemployment Insurance &LR;  _ A labor union-sponsored bill to increase
unemployment insurance was put on hold earlier this year. Senate
Bill 546 is expected to be taken up again when the Legislature
reconvenes. According to a Senate Appropriations Committee
analysis, the bill would increase employer unemployment insurance
taxes by more than $700 million a year. Employer groups oppose the
increase unless there are major reforms to the nation's largest
unemployment system, which is entirely financed by employers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Minimum Wage _ &LR;  Historically, California's minimum wage has been
set by the California Industrial Welfare Commission, which reviews
wage policy every two years. The commission met on December 15 in
Los Angeles to take public comment. Labor unions have made raising
the minimum wage, which is $5.75 in California, as compared with
$5.15 nationwide, a top priority. San Francisco and some other
cities are also looking at requiring a higher minimum wage for
businesses with whom they have contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing only on increasing the minimum wage as a way
to offset the increased costs of living in California, the
California Chamber would support programs to make child care,
housing and health care more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Home Office Tips &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a homeowner and use one room exclusively to do all the
administration work for my small business. However, I sell computer
components and do not meet clients at my home, so can I still
deduct the costs to maintain my office?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: You're in luck. For taxable years beginning after 1998, the
term principal place of business was amended and expanded to
include where the taxpayer does administrative or management tasks.
So long as you don't have another location where you do substantial
administration or management work, you can deduct the portion of
your costs associated with your home office. However, CPA Mary Jo
Murphy of M.J. Murphy &AMP; Associates in San Mateo notes some
limitations: Your deduction for the current year basically cannot
exceed the net income derived from the business conducted from your
home office. Any disallowed portion, though, can be carried forward
to subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy adds that an important consideration in deciding to take
the home office deduction is what happens when you sell your
principal residence. If you have claimed and depreciated your home
office, you will have to recognize a gain on any depreciation
adjustments in connection with business use of the residence after
May 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This can get complicated and you might want to consult a
professional. Suffice it to say that if you expect your income to
go up to a higher tax bracket and you think you may sell your home
at that time, you may want to reconsider taking the home office
deduction now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CREDIT CARD NOTE: In last week's column, I mentioned some business
credit card recommendations but gave a wrong name/Web address.
Check out www.cardweb.com. &LR; cq &LR;  Also, reader Larry Templeton
recommends the Quicken credit card for business, not because it's
the cheapest but because it allows him to download the details of
all credit card transactions directly into his Quicken accounting
program, thus easing the burden of bookkeeping.

 _ SF CHRON  
 An Unconventional Place for Holiday Shopping  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
As the Christmas clock ticks down, last-minute shoppers can go to a
mall or department store and battle their way to the cash register.
Or they can go online and take their chances.
<P>
   But for an alternative shopping experience, how about a festive
holiday lap dance? Or a tattoo? Or a visit to a pawnshop?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come to pawnshops at this time of year,'' said
Paula Newhouse, manager of the Best Collateral pawnshop on San
Francisco's Mission Street. ``They know they'll get good value.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, visits to a number of downtown pawnshops revealed that
monthly sales rise by about 30 percent every December as customers
seek out bargain-priced jewelry, electronic goods, musical
instruments and other stuff to give as holiday presents.
</P>
<P>
   And, surprisingly, an increasing number of those sales are
taking place online.
</P>
<P>
   At Best Collateral, large red letters spelling out ``Merry
Christmas'' hang on the wall beneath a big red bow. Above the bow
is a neon sign promising ``Money Loaned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is always a good month,'' Newhouse said as customers
browsed among items such as an Aiwa stereo selling for $199.95, a
gold pocket watch costing $399.95 and a five-piece drum set priced
at $599.95.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though just about everything in the place goes for
something-ninety-nine-ninety-five. This isn't a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All prices are negotiable,'' Newhouse revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Pawnshops, in other words, are the Turkish bazaars of the U.S.
retail world. Haggling is customary, and only the most naive
shopper makes a purchase without first driving the price down as
much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the pawning process, it works like
this: A person brings in an item as collateral and receives a cash
loan. By law, the item must be held for four months and 10 days
before being put up for sale by the pawnshop.
</P>
<P>
   Interest is steep, starting at about 14 percent for the first
three months of a $100 loan, then tapering off. After four months,
a customer can either redeem or renew his or her loan, or can opt
to walk away and let the pawnshop take possession of the item.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of pawned items end up for sale.
Newhouse said most are eventually redeemed, and some remain in
storage for years, their owners using the pawnshop as a high-price
safe-deposit box by continually renewing the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner at Pacific Loan Co. on Sixth Street, owner
Michael Krasow said jewelry, DVD players and TVs are the hot
holiday gifts among his customers this year.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the shop are decorated with tinsel and Christmas
lights, and ``Happy Hannukah'' has been painted on the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``This month has been pretty good,'' Krasow said. ``But
generally, we don't see a big increase in sales until the last week
before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pawnshop patrons, he speculated, are among the worst offenders
when it comes to last-minute shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is good, the pawnshop business is good
because people know they'll have money to get their stuff back,''
Krasow observed. ``And when the economy is bad, the pawnshop
business is still good because people need money.''
</P>
<P>
   One might think that the biggest threat to the pawnshop business
is the Internet. Customers who might have previously prowled
pawnshops in search of one-of-a-kind items and collectibles can now
turn instead to eBay and a host of other online flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Krasow offered a sly grin. Rather than being a threat, he
explained, the Net actually has expanded his customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put all my best stuff on eBay,'' Krasow said. ``I average
five or six pieces a month, and I almost always get a better
price.''
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down at Midtown Loan Office, owner Ralph Kazanjian
agreed that eBay is one of the biggest advances to hit the pawnshop
trade in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some Disney animation cels recently,'' he recalled.
``Who's going to come down here for Disney cels? The Internet
allowed us to take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Midtown is celebrating the season with gold tinsel on the walls
and ``Happy Holidays'' painted on the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the sidewalk, the atmosphere is a bit less jolly. Things
may have been different decades ago, when about a half-dozen
pawnshops took root in the neighborhood. These days, Sixth Street
isn't the most welcoming part of the city for holiday shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, the Internet plays a role. ``If we can't get people
down here, the Net is a way for us to get to them,'' Kazanjian
said. ``It exposes us to a whole new market.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of exposure, over at the Crazy Horse Gentleman's Club
on Market Street, an employee who gave his name only as ``John''
said it's not uncommon for patrons to buy friends a complimentary
lap dance as a way of commemorating the season.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted that business falls off a bit at this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to spend time with your family,'' John noted. ``You
don't want to be a horn-dog.''
</P>
<P>
   For truly alternative shopping, head down Market a few doors to
the Underground Smoke Shop, where Manager Al Salem will insist with
a straight face that sales of his products soar as Christmas
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a lot of T-shirts at this season,'' he said.
``Especially Grateful Dead shirts. And we sell a lot of Jerry
Garcia statues.''
</P>
<P>
   Other popular items include studs as stocking stuffers for
people with a pierced this or that, and big, fat skull rings for
those of a more heavy-metal bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And lava lamps, of course,'' Salem pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Across town on Haight Street, Muneer Hyat(cq) &LR; , a salesman at
Ashbury Tobacco Center, said sales of his wares are up as well. He
said this while standing in front of shelves stacked high with all
manner of ``water pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Back when some of us were in high school, these things were
known as ``bongs,'' and they weren't used for tobacco. Times, and
laws, have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Hyat pointed to a big sign insisting that ``these are water
pipes and are intended to be used for tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast his eyes over display cases full of other brightly
colored pipes, the kind that don't require water, as well as other
paraphernalia once more commonly associated with marijuana than
Marlboros.
</P>
<P>
   ``For tobacco,'' Hyat said with a slight smile.
</P>
<P>
   The big sellers this month are handblown glass bongs _ er, water
pipes _ ranging in price from $60 to $300. Hyat also pointed out
that smaller, handheld pipes make fabulous stocking stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone spends more than $500,'' he said, ``we give them a
discount card.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street at Mom's Body Shop, owner Barnaby Williams said
he issues quite a few gift certificates during the holidays. A
piercing, for example, will run about $25, while tattoos run $120
an hour, with more elaborate productions requiring as many as 30
hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, a gift certificate will be for a minor,'' Williams
said. ``A lot of parents will ask if their grades have been good
and will then get a gift certificate as a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no Christmas decorations up in the small shop. But
Williams himself is rather jovially decorated on his arms and neck,
and undoubtedly elsewhere as well.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that business slows somewhat in the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the awareness of body,'' he explained. ``In the winter,
you're not looking so much at your arms and legs. You aren't
thinking about skin.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who are, though, small Japanese characters are popular
these days, as are retro renderings of pinup girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tattoo makes a good gift,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   And considering how hard it is to get the suckers off, they're
perhaps the one gift you know won't be immediately returned.

   At dawn, Weber stood at the front of the city's oldest active
synagogue, took a sip of ginseng-gingko-ginger tea, adjusted his
flowing garments, opened a weathered, leather-covered volume to
Genesis and began the reading.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a nap upon completion of the Old Testament sometime
Wednesday night, Weber, a full-bearded, 39-year-old performance
artist and publisher of art books, does not intend to stop until
Friday at dawn. By then, he reckons, he will have read the entire
work _ all 66 books, 31,000 verses, 800,000-odd words. Plus the
Apocrypha.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Partly because it is there, and because Christmas and
Revelations' day of reckoning are just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I always wanted to do,'' said Weber, who has
read aloud Nietzsche's ``Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (24 hours) and
Joyce's ``Ulysses'' (33 hours) and once read William T. Vollmann's
``The Rifles'' in 22 hours inside a 15-degree refrigerated truck at
a Canadian arts festival.
</P>
<P>
   But Weber, who considers himself a nontraditional Jew, said the
reading _ at the Orensanz Center for the Arts, housed inside the
150-year-old temple of the Shul of New York on the Lower East Side
of Manhattan _ was also a way to explore the place where the
secular and the religious intersect.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the act of devotion is really on a cultural and
literary level,'' he said in his apartment in Greenwich Village on
Monday night. ``But given the amount of mental and physical and
psychical energy this is going to take, I'm prepared for any kind
of spiritual experience in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1:12 p.m. Tuesday, Weber had progressed to Exodus 21 _ the
often overlooked part just after the Ten Commandments that deals
with what to do if someone else's ox falls into your uncovered pit.
He had been temporarily banished to the building's drafty basement
because Modern Bride magazine had rented the ornate German-Romantic
sanctuary upstairs for a photography session. He read in a quiet,
almost boyish tenor, pausing occasionally to cough and blow his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Other than two friends and a couple of reporters, there was no
one in attendance, perhaps because Weber was unable to raise money
to promote the reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious people were scared that there might be some kind
of offensive component, and the art world was scared that there
would be some kind of offensive component that would backlash to
them,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider his performance particularly radical. The
reading aloud of scripture is, after all, the basis of most
religious services. But the president of the National Bible
Association, Thomas May, said he had never heard of one person
reading the entire Bible more or less in one sitting. The
association, a nondenominational group based in New York, has
sponsored Bible-reading marathons for years, but those affairs are
relays involving hundreds of people reading a few pages each.
</P>
<P>
   While he expressed puzzlement with Weber's purpose and doubt
that he would be able to finish in the allotted time, May wished
him Godspeed. ``I don't think it's ever a bad thing to read the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   As straightforward as Weber's project may seem, he has been
preparing for it for a year. He spent months searching for the
perfect Bible, settling on a folio-sized King James version printed
in 1873, illustrated by Gustave Dore. To cultivate the proper Old
Testament look, he said, he has not taken a blade to a hair on his
body since last December. For the last few days, he has tried to
sleep as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never lose my voice, because I modulate it very well,'' he
said, ``but after 30 hours, fatigue sets in, in terms of visual
hallucinations. When I was reading `Ulysses,' I had a hallucination
that I was at a copying machine, copying the pages as I read them,
and I asked myself, `Why am I copying them?' and it turned out I
wasn't. But it didn't interrupt the reading.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:42 p.m., Weber read the last verse of Exodus and stood up
abruptly, knocking over a heater and his tea kettle. He had been
reading for seven and a half hours and was less than one-tenth of
the way through the Bible. His legs wobbled like a weary boxer's.
</P>
<P>
   But as he slurped down a container of chicken soup from Katz's
Delicatessen, he seemed to revive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more law coming in Leviticus,'' he said, ``but at
least we're done with the ark. It kind of gets more lyrical from
here on.''
</P>
<P>
   He blew his nose and sat down to Leviticus. A landscape of
blood, burnt offerings and lepers lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rocks,'' he said as he began to read. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ His domestic political base cemented by Sunday's
parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Tuesday
signaled that he wants to mend relations with the West by calling
for ratification of the nearly-seven-year-old START II nuclear arms
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin pressed for approval of the accord in a meeting with
leaders of the newly elected Parliament, as Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott arrived here for talks on arms control and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, which will hold the largest number of seats
in the Parliament, immediately rejected Putin's proposal. But after
a year of East-West estrangement which seemed to have placed the
treaty in a political deep freeze, it was notable that Putin
publicly raised the issue at all.
</P>
<P>
   START II, which calls for the reduction of Russian and U.S.
nuclear stockpiles, has languished in the Parliament since 1993,
blocked by Communists and nationalists during dips in U.S.-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Communists' hold on power seriously weakened by
Sunday's election results, ratification now seemed a genuine
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I think it is possible that they will be
able to form a legislative majority without the Communists,'' said
Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat who is now a Russia expert at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 98 percent of all ballots counted, election
officials said the Communists had captured 24.3 percent of the
popular vote for the new lower house of Parliament, known as the
Duma. That is but a whisker above the 23.2 percent that went to a
new pro-Kremlin coalition dubbed Unity.
</P>
<P>
   A second pro-Kremlin bloc, the Union of Right Forces, took 8.6
percent, and a third faction, the bloc led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
took 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Putin's government was certain to pick
up more support among independent legislators and other smaller
factions in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the only other major party leaning toward the
Communists, the Fatherland-All Russia coalition, won 13.2 percent
of the vote, well below its original expectations. Late Tuesday
leaders of the Fatherland faction said that they would split from
All Russia and form their own bloc in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers constitute a victory for President Boris Yeltsin
and especially for Putin, now the runaway favorite to succeed
Yeltsin in elections next summer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By waging a successful war in Chechnya and projecting an image
of competence and strength _ something rare lately in Russian
politics _ Putin became the political star to which many of the
pro-Kremlin blocks hitched their wagons in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few experts wonder whether that diverse mixture of
political groups can really be knitted into a workable legislative
force, particularly if the war in Chechnya turns sour for the
Kremlin or Putin stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   But at his meeting with parliamentary leaders Tuesday, Putin
acted like a man in command. ``The nation is pinning great hopes on
the new Duma, the more so since there are many problems that need
to be solved,'' he told them. ``The composition of the new Duma
shows that people want renewal _ not only new faces but also new
results, new ideas, new decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has indicated that he will push for economic reforms of
the sort long advocated by Western economists but never fully
carried out here.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of START II was the most specific issue discussed
at Tuesday's session, and Talbott said on arrival in Moscow that he
was pleased at the ``reactivation'' of the Russian government's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and President George Bush signed START II in January
1993. Under its terms, both nations would reduce their nuclear
forces to no more than 3,500 warheads by 2003 _ a drastic cut for
the United States, which now has nearly 8,000 warheads, and for
Russia, with about 6,700.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved the treaty, and the Russian military has
supported it, in part because it can no longer afford the huge
expense of keeping up a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Parliament was poised to approve the treaty a year
ago, but balked when the United States resumed bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma was again prepared to ratify the treaty last spring,
but the U.S.-led war against Serbia provoked even the Kremlin to
cancel that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's announcement Tuesday was not completely unexpected. A
senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the Kremlin has long said privately that it hoped to win approval
of START II after this month's elections, even if relations with
Washington were less than optimal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's following through on what they said they'd do,'' the
official said. ``I hope it shows some serious willingness to engage
in arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is always for the ratification of the START II treaty
because we believe it is important for the national interests of
Russia,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin. ``To
promote the process of strategic disarmament would be beneficial to
Russia, first of all, and to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some serious obstacles still remain, and Putin noted them
Tuesday. They include the U.S. proposal to abandon the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so that it may build a limited
defense against missiles launched by rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical military officials in Russia and China argue that the
United States' real goal is to build a defense against the shrunken
nuclear force that Russia would possess once START II and future
arms-control treaties are implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry has informally proposed setting up
a joint commission to study the nuclear threat posed by unstable or
terrorist nations. But the Kremlin has bitterly protested the White
House's proposal to change the anti-ballistic missile treaty,
saying it is the foundation of arms control because its assurance
of mutual destruction in a war reduces all nations' incentives to
build more weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the military's foreign affairs
department, repeated that Tuesday, saying the government is
categorically opposed to changing the structure of the arms-control
regime.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Talbott is likely to discuss START II and
the anti-ballistic missile treaties during visits this week with
Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, among others.
</P>
<P>
   He is also likely to discuss Russia's political and economic
situation and the course of the war in Chechnya, which was entering
a crucial stage this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was briefed on the Chechnya war Tuesday by Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who later said the government is
establishing temporary police departments to restore order in areas
under its control.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya, Russian troops were said to be locked in a fierce
battle with rebels near Serzhen-Yury, a village about 18 miles
south of the capital, Grozny. The village sits at the mouth of a
gorge that leads into the Caucasus mountains, where rebels maintain
supply bases and headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials also repeated that they had captured
Grozny's civilian airport, but said they had yet to secure the
field because it was mined. Last week the army occupied a military
airfield just east of Grozny.

SPORTS COLUMN: THEIR FEATS ARE SIMILAR, NOT THE TIMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl Lewis and I spoke recently about the passage of
time and the transformation of images. Specifically, we spoke about
Muhammad Ali and his canonization in the mainstream media over the
last decade. Ali was like a neighborhood once avoided, generally
disparaged, now home to trendy coffee shops and well-to-do
residents who boast of living in the ``inner city.''
</P>
<P>
   This was at the Chelsea Piers sports center in Manhattan, where
Lewis was taking part in a program with General Motors and the
United Auto Workers to give cars to 100 U.S. Olympic hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' name had come up earlier that morning at the New York
Athletic Club as an older generation of track stars gathered to
watch footage of Jesse Owens in conjunction with ESPN's announcing
Owens as its sixth-ranked athlete of the century.
</P>
<P>
   John Woodruff, Owens' teammate on the 1936 Olympic team and a
gold medal winner in the 800 meters, rated Paul Robeson, Jackie
Robinson, Owens and Joe Louis as his top four black athletes of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old Woodruff said that Lewis, in many ways, was
better than Owens. ``When you compare what Jesse did back in his
time and what Carl Lewis has done, Carl is the better athlete,''
Woodruff said. Owens endures ``because of the times that he did
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling among some Owens supporters that Lewis does
not properly respect Owens. In 1985, Lewis won the Jesse Owens
International Amateur Athlete Award. In 1996, he skipped the Owens
dinner at which all living 100-meter gold medalists were honored.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how Lewis truly felt about Owens, an athlete with
whom he is inexorably linked. Each won four Olympic gold medals at
age 23 _ Owens in Berlin in 1936, Lewis in Los Angeles in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with all of his politics,'' Lewis said of Owens,
an evident reference to Owens' conservative stands on a wide range
of issues from student protests of the 1960s to activism among
athletes. ``It would have been interesting for me If I'd been
around Avery Brundage. You couldn't change things, but sometime I
wish that I could have been brought around earlier. After what I
had to go through on a different level with the media, it would
have been interesting to give me that forum to go against those
kind of situations. I do believe that no matter what, I would have
had a solid agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis earned millions after his Olympic performance. After the
1936 Games, while the rest of the U.S. team barnstormed through
Europe, Owens elected to go home to his family. The Amateur
Athletic Union suspended him from all further amateur competition.
The lucrative offers made in the heat of Owens' Olympic feats
disappeared. Owens, financially strapped, spent the next five years
racing for money against horses, dogs and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Owens did not rock the boat. He smiled, bore the burden and
burned inside. ``He didn't fight the system,'' Woodruff said. ``We
accepted it at the time. We went on and made the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that Jesse was a little lost,'' Lewis said. ``I
never felt that he had that base that he could always fall back on.
My base is my parents, my coaches, my family; they have always been
a strong backbone for me. I didn't see that with Jesse, in Jesse.
So therefore when it came time to really be strong, I didn't see
him have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff said that competitive running was the base to which
Lewis referred. When the track establishment took that away, Owens
lost some of his resolve. ``I don't know what happened to Jesse,''
Woodruff said. ``Jesse was a highly conscientious athlete. It seems
as though when he got out of it, he was missing something, so he
started smoking and imbibing alcohol. That's what killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis fought for better drug testing and more money for
athletes. He promoted the sport with a bravado completely lacking
in the self-effacing Owens, an attitude not expected-or tolerated
from African Americans _ athletes or otherwise _ in previous
generations.
</P>
<P>
   At Chelsea Piers, Carl Lewis said that he would not remain close
to the sport, would not become a spokesman for the U.S. track
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, he said, has left an indelible impression. ``Here's a guy
who was chastised by his sport,'' Lewis said. ``Everything was
taken from him, and now, the minute he drops, that very sport has
used his name left, right, up, down. in, out. And they're going to
tell me: ``We'll, you're like him, so you come too _ we're going to
do the same thing to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily,'' Lewis said, ``I had a vision, I know what's going
on and it's not going to happen twice.''

   BRASOV, Romania _ Ten years ago, the Romanians rose up against
communist rule and the grinding dictatorship of a personality cult.
But the prosperity that had vanished under Nicolae Ceausescu's
regime now seems more remote than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This often-overlooked country of 22 million, bigger than most of
its East European neighbors, is going through harder times than
most of them. The average wage has slipped to $80 a month, and
one-third of the country lives on less than $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn in Bucharest, the capital, groups of children emerge
from the sewers to beg, just as they do in the capital of Angola.
While Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and even tiny Estonia are
a jump away from joining the European Union, Romania lingers with
the underachievers, proud to be invited to qualify in a later
round.

   Mihai-Cristian Grigore, 32, a citizen of Brasov, an industrial
city in the Carpathian Mountains, knows Western-style
reorganization from the sharp end. A high school dropout, he was a
machinist in a factory that made hardware for doors before the 1989
revolution. That could have been a job for life. But in 1990,
Grigore recalled, ``our boss bought it from the state, dismissed
everybody and hired his own family.''
</P>
<P>
   His next job lasted five years and ended with a layoff. Six
months later, he found work at a screw factory where his mother
spent her career. But it was shrinking, and he was laid off again.
He wound up tiling sidewalks for a pittance. But that winter was
snowy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Grigore lives on $15 a month from temporary welfare, help
from relatives and the $14 a month that his wife makes selling
fruit on the street.
</P>
<P>
   He took a truck-driving course, but the police officers who
administered the exam were in a hurry at the end, and no one in his
class finished. Now he, too, hopes to obtain a license to sell
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying all I can to improve my life,'' Grigore said. ``But
this is the way we live now. If I could go overseas, I would.''

</P>
<P>
   Romanians are bitter. In November, in a poll that stunned the
government, 61 percent said that life had been better under
Ceausescu and his prominent wife, Elena, who were so hated that
they were tried and shot on Christmas Day in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Life then was lousy. Apartments were heated less than four hours
a day. Food shortages were so bad that people lined up for hours
and literally fought one another over rare supplies of chicken
parts with almost no meat, and television was two evening hours
simply glorifying the ruling couple.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployed remember that everyone had jobs under
Ceausescu, despite his North Korean-style tyranny. A visitor
constantly hears this refrain: ``Then we had money, but there was
nothing to buy. Now the shops are full, but we have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the government nor President Emil Constantinescu,
elected in 1997 with great hopes for change because it was the
first peaceful transfer of power in Romanian history, is planning a
nationwide celebration of the 10th anniversary of the revolution on
Wednesday. They fear that any spark could set off rioting.
</P>
<P>
   The government itself, a fragile, bickering multiparty
coalition, is in turmoil, accused of corruption and bungling the
economy. In what a local political commentator called ``a typical
Romanian circus,'' Constantinescu dismissed Prime Minister Radu
Vasile on Dec. 14, after most of his cabinet had resigned. Vasile
was defiant, saying the president had no such power, then
succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Mugur Isarescu, an economist who had run the
central bank since 1991 and is in no political party. Isarescu is
highly regarded. He was reported to have taken the job reluctantly
and to have asked Parliament to guarantee him his old job back
after the elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   Violent strikes reminiscent of the dictator's waning days have
returned, and some marchers have taken to carrying Ceausescu's
picture. On Nov. 1 in Brasov, angry workers from the Roman truck
factory invaded and vandalized a government building. Their plant,
which once supplied much of the Soviet bloc, has shrunk, to 9,100
workers from 21,000 in 1990. The Tractorul tractor plant did the
same, and feels stabbed by both East and West. The NATO blockade of
Yugoslavia hurt sales just as the Soviet collapse did.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By some lights, the truck factory is where the 1989 revolution
began. In 1987, workers furious at working on Sundays for no pay
cut the electricity and marched on the building, where they found a
groaning buffet table set out for a Communist Party fete. They
rioted. For two years afterward, the factory floor was full of
security police officers in workers' clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The spies are gone. Hard times are not. A union president, Gabor
Fanica, said his members spent 90 percent of their salaries on
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possibility to buy new clothes or keep up your
apartment, to allow yourself to make phone calls, let alone to go
away on vacation,'' Fanica said. The laid-off go to soup kitchens
or move in with rural relatives and eat what they grow.
</P>
<P>
   Aged pensioners have it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's pension amounts to 7 pizzas a month,'' said Mircea
Irimie, 58, a retired railway engineer in the western city of
Timisoara. ``Who can live on that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These beautiful buildings?'' he added, waving at the town's
Orthodox cathedral with an odd German roof. ``They're all a facade,
my friend. Romania used to export wheat to the world. Now it
exports only prostitutes.''

</P>
<P>
   Economists and politicians cite many reasons for Romania's
agony.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, Romania was almost entirely agrarian, unlike
East Germany or Czechoslovakia. As collective farming ends and
property seized under communism is restored, peasants are receiving
small plots rather than shares in big farms. Vegetable farming
thrives. But mechanized wheat farming cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ceausescu, any business spirit was throttled by a
Stalinist system more severe than any East European regime outside
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Before communism fell, said Silviu Brucan, a once-ardent
communist economist and former ambassador to the United States who
became disillusioned with Ceausescu and joined the ruling council
that replaced him, there was a ``potential middle class in training
for capitalism'' _ people who owned homes, cars, saw Western
movies, vacationed abroad, perhaps even did some private business.
</P>
<P>
   In Czechoslovakia, Brucan said, that was 30 percent of the
population, in Hungary 20 percent and in Poland 15 percent. In
Romania, it was less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a peasant who wanted to slaughter his pig before
Christmas had to ask permission of the local militia,'' Brucan
said, ``because the number of pigs raised was an important
indicator,'' measured by state planners, to trumpet communism's
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Ceausescu's megalomaniacal industrial projects distorted the
economy. Romania built mills to produce more steel than France and
refineries for 35 million tons of crude oil a year, while the
country pumped 7 million. Now they lie rusting.
</P>

   By contrast, even by 1989, almost no Romanian owned a computer.
Typewriters were treated the way guns were. Each had to be
registered with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Romania has had little appeal to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a German car manufacturer, where would you invest,
Hungary or Romania?'' asked Martin Taylor, director of the European
Emerging Markets group for Baring Asset Management in London. ``In
Hungary, you get high literacy, a seven-year tax break, no tariffs
and very clear commercial law. In Romania, you have corruption,
lower literacy, law that makes it hard to prove ownership, tariffs,
poor infrastructure, and it's further away. Besides, you'd want a
domestic market, and 10 million rich Hungarians will buy more cars
than 20 million poor Romanians.''

   Ion Iliescu, the former communist who was president from 1990 to
1996 and is leading in preliminary polls for the vote next year,
argues that the economy nosedived from 1990 to 1993, but that he
turned it around by gradually cutting subsidies and government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The current government's shock therapy sent it spinning down
again, Iliescu says. His opponents say that he ran up deficits that
would have meant bankruptcy and that their cost-cutting and
privatization will save the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old story,'' said Petre Roman, an early
post-communist prime minister who became first deputy premier and
foreign minister in the cabinet shuffle last week. ``Those who do
the reform lose the sympathy of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some Romanians note, only amnesiacs could think that
life was better in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandru Ioan Pop, head of the union in the Brasov tractor
plant, sat in a well-stocked bakery with a foreign reporter and
drew the comparison. ``They sold pastry here before the revolution
too,'' Pop said. ``But then there were only two refrigerators and
three kinds of pastry, and the Securitate would have arrested us in
five minutes. In 1989, I wasn't even allowed to stand in the street
and shout, `All I eat is pigs' feet!'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By striking a political balance, President Clinton
on Tuesday was able to announce the costliest environmental
regulations of his presidency without facing major criticism. The
new air pollution rules will require automakers to build cleaner
vehicles and oil companies to refine cleaner gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The president's original proposal, issued last spring, was
modified in three ways to make it more palatable Tuesday to
automakers, oil companies and environmentalists. With Republican
and Democratic presidential candidates trying to portray themselves
as friends of the environment, the new rules have also won support
across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has the enthusiastic backing of
the oil and auto industries, set the political tone earlier this
month when he said in a debate in New Hampshire that he supported
the Environmental Protection Agency's plans for tougher rules. He
then asked Texas regulators last week to tighten state rules on
auto pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, Bush's leading rival for the Republican
nomination, said through a spokesman that he supported the new
rules, provided that they did not turn out to impose unacceptable
costs on consumers. Both candidates for the Democratic nomination,
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have long
advocated tighter auto pollution rules.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A year of political balancing by the Clinton administration, a
few last-minute adjustments to the regulations and a split within
the auto industry produced an extremely rare chorus of support
Tuesday for the regulations _ or at least acceptance of them _ from
automakers, oil companies and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, the lobbying arm of the oil
industry, said that while oil industry officials still disliked
some details of the plan, they would comply. ``This is going into
effect, and we're going to do our part to make it work,'' said
William Hickman, a spokesman for the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers also said Tuesday that they were not planning to
block the new regulations. Officials at General Motors Corp., which
has lagged rivals in reducing pollution from sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks and which had lobbied against the new rules, said
Tuesday that they had decided against filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the rule is there, we have to get on with the job of
meeting the standards,'' said William Noack, a GM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were the most enthusiastic. ``This rule was
No. 1 on our Christmas wish list,'' said Angela Farleigh, an
activist at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which inflated
a 15-foot-high, red balloon shaped like a sport utility vehicle
outside the elementary school in northeast Washington where Clinton
announced the plans. The group has lugged the inflatable vehicle,
dubbed the Exterminator, to protests in two dozen cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday at an elementary school in a low-income
neighborhood of northeast Washington, Clinton presented the new
rules as necessary for public health as Americans drive ever more
miles and increasingly buy sport utility vehicles, which produce
several times more pollution per mile than cars. He said the new
rules would prevent 4,300 premature deaths a year and 173,000 cases
a year of asthma and other respiratory illnesses among children.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma has become a scourge of inner-city children, for reasons
that are not entirely clear but seem to be linked to air pollution.
Gloria Hickman, the nurse at the elementary school, said that 25 of
the school's 315 students suffered from the ailment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They come in frightened, short of breath, scared,'' she said
in an interview. ``It tugs at my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of sport utility vehicles, which tend to pollute the most,
have leveled off at about 17 percent of the market over the last
three years, but are still climbing as a percentage of vehicles in
use, from about 8 percent now. Automakers are working on car-like
models that look like sport utilities, like the Subaru Forester,
but do not have the environmental and safety problems of
traditional, pickup-based sport utilities; General Motors, Ford
Motor and DaimlerChrysler all plan to introduce such vehicles next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimated that automakers and oil companies would spend
$5.3 billion complying with the new rules over the next few years,
but that cleaner air would reduce the nation's medical bills and
other health-related costs by $25.2 billion. That would make the
clean air rules the biggest of the Clinton presidency in terms of
costs and benefits by a wide margin, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs will be so widely spread that opposition to the
rules never really coalesced. The EPA said that the rules would add
$100 to the price of a car, $200 to the price of a sport utility
vehicle and a couple pennies to the price of a gallon of gasoline.
The new rules will reduce allowable pollution from cars by 77
percent in the 2004 model year and then require so-called light
trucks _ sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans _ to
meet car standards in the 2007 to 2009 model years. Light trucks
currently emit several times as much pollution per mile.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress from oil-producing states had posed the
biggest political threat to the new regulations, threatening last
spring to block the new rules through legislation. But the
administration tempered that criticism Tuesday by giving small
refineries two extra years to produce cleaner gasoline; Sen. James
Inhofe, R-Okla., who had led previous criticisms of the plan and
held hearings, welcomed the changes Tuesday, although he said that
he still had some misgivings about the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution rules on large sport utility vehicles were made even
more stringent than under the original proposal. The very largest
models, like the Ford Excursion, will be counted as family vehicles
for the first time instead of medium-duty trucks. This delighted
environmentalists, who had sent more than 100,000 postcards and
letters to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also postponed until sometime next year any
action on diesel vehicle pollution, to the relief of automakers,
who nonetheless remain worried about the possibility of tighter
regulations someday. Automakers want to start equipping more sport
utility vehicles with fuel-efficient diesel engines so as to meet
federal fuel-economy regulations. But environmentalists want much
stricter emissions rules on diesels, because some research has
suggested that the emissions may be carcinogenic.

TWO DETROIT PAPERS GET A SPLIT LABOR VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Detroit newspapers and the company that runs their joint
business affairs have been ordered to reinstate 50 striking workers
who were discharged in the course of labor protests, but the papers
and the company have simultaneously been upheld in the firing of 35
others.
</P>
<P>
   That split decision was issued in Detroit on Friday by Richard
Scully, an administrative law judge for the National Labor
Relations Board. But it was not made public until Tuesday,
confirmed by both the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, a
Detroit labor coalition, and Detroit Newspapers Inc., which runs
the business operations of The Detroit News and The Detroit Free
Press under a joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was the latest in an often bitter dispute that began
in July 1995, when 2,370 employees struck Detroit Newspapers and
the two publications over a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
   The strike lasted 19 months, and before it was settled the 85
workers whose jobs were at stake in the decision made public
Tuesday were fired for a variety of protests at the newspapers'
offices or plants.
</P>
<P>
   Scully issued decisions on those workers _ some in news, others
in production or distribution _ on a case-by-case basis, said Polk
Laffoon IV, vice president for corporate relations at Knight-Ridder
Inc., which owns The Free Press. The 50 employees reinstated,
Scully held, must be taken back within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Ellwood, a spokeswoman for Detroit Newspapers, said that
``we were obviously pleased that there were as many discharges
upheld as there were'' but that ``it's too soon for us to say what
action we might take next.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Laffoon said: ``We are reviewing the
155-page decision. In all likelihood, we will appeal the cases we
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Ellis, a union spokesman who is one of the employees set
for reinstatement under the ruling, said, ``What this community is
hoping for is that the newspapers would take this opportunity once
again to abide by the administrative law judge, return these
workers to their jobs and abide by the previous rulings that have
come down and begin returning real journalism back to Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and Ms. Ellwood disagree on the number of workers already
awaiting reinstatement as a result of the agreement by the six
striking unions to end the walkout in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers said then that they would not discharge
replacement workers but would hire the former strikers as jobs
became available. Ms. Ellwood said 329 people were on the list of
workers to be hired back; Ellis' count is twice as high.

EARNINGS AT GOLDMAN SACHS WIDELY EXCEED FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Demonstrating how powerfully financial markets have
rebounded in a year, the Goldman Sachs Group said Tuesday that it
posted a record profit last quarter after suffering a slight loss a
year earlier, when much of the world was still feeling the effects
of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, which went public in May, said it earned $723 million,
or $1.48 a diluted share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended
Nov. 26. Its performance well exceeded the $1.25 a share expected
by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings of Goldman, one of Wall Street's foremost
investment banks, have been skewed in the last year by its
conversion from a private partnership to a public company. Adjusted
for that change, Goldman said, its earnings last quarter were $756
million, or $1.54 a diluted share, up from $8 million, or 2 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's net revenue _ its total revenue minus interest
expenses _ came to $3.47 billion, up 280 percent from $915 million
a year earlier and 13 percent from the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Goldman sustained some big losses trading bonds and
commodities as the financial turmoil caused by Russia's summer
default on some of its debt rippled into Latin America and hurt
East Asian countries already in crisis. The value of all but the
safest of bonds sank fast, wiping out Goldman's profit from its
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which reported surprisingly
strong earnings on Monday, Goldman has benefited this year from a
global boom in mergers and acquisitions and investors'
extraordinary appetite for new stock offerings. Goldman ranks first
in the value of mergers and acquisitions announced worldwide this
year and first in the amount of money raised through stock
offerings in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be the leader in the highest-margin
businesses,'' said David Viniar, the bank's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The profitability of Goldman's franchises in stock underwriting
and advising on mergers was evident in its 31 percent return on
equity, which is a key measure of profitability on Wall Street.
Goldman promises investors that it will earn at least 20 percent on
their equity almost every quarter; in the last three quarters, it
has outdone that by half, earning returns of at least 30 percent on
equity.
</P>
<P>
   Fees from advising on mergers rose 50 percent, to a record $622
million from a year earlier, though up just 1 percent from the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also showed big gains from its asset management
business, especially from deposits into its investment funds from
wealthy individuals. The firm's trading businesses recorded big
profits, though declines from the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good quarter for Goldman relative to
expectations,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch. But Kraushaar added that the investment bank's profit had
been exaggerated last quarter by two unusual factors: a
lower-than-normal tax rate and lower-than-normal expenses for
paying its well-heeled employees. Goldman sets aside money every
quarter to pay year-end bonuses to investment bankers and traders,
who receive the bulk of their annual pay in a lump sum after the
end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   It expects to pay out about half its net revenue to its
employees as compensation and benefits. This year, though, after
deciding how much to pay each employee, the firm had spent just
48.4 percent of its revenue.

DODGERS' DOMINICAN BASE CLOSED; BELTRE IS REFUSED FREE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding the Los Angeles Dodgers guilty of a foreign
transgression for the second time in six months, Commissioner Bud
Selig shut down their base of operations in the Dominican Republic
for a year on Tuesday, but allowed them to retain the good young
third baseman they had signed a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Selig did not declare the third baseman, Adrian Beltre, a free
agent because, he said, the investigation of the underage signing
turned up evidence that Beltre knew well before this year that the
Dodgers had falsified his birth date and that he himself had used
the falsified date on a variety of documents.
</P>
<P>
   A players association lawyer said the association would study
the ruling before deciding if it would challenge that part of the
commissioner's decision through a grievance. Besides closing the
Dodgers' highly rated baseball academy at Campo Las Palmas, a blow
to the organization's player development program, Selig prohibited
the Dodgers from scouting or signing first-year players who live in
the Dominican Republic. He also fined the club $50,000 and
suspended a current employee and a former one, both of whom have
been integral to the Dominican operation, for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's actions was yet another black eye for an organization
that under previous ownership portrayed itself as the epitome of
purity. Yet it was under that ownership that the transgressions
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Last June an investigation found that the Dodgers had illegally
scouted two players in Cuba, which is off limits to baseball
organizations, and spirited them from Cuba to the Dominican
Republic, where they said they had found and signed them. The
players were declared free agents and the Dodgers were fined
$200,000 and banned from signing foreign players for six months.
That period ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed Beltre on July 7, 1994. They listed his birth
date as April 7, 1978, which would have made him the requisite 16
years old when he signed. But Beltre was actually born a year
later, meaning he was 15 when he signed. Altered documents were
found in the Dodgers' files.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, Beltre's agent, contended that the player should be
declared a free agent, like other Latin players before him who were
found to have been signed prematurely. But Selig awarded Beltre
$48,500 ($33,000 plus interest) as the difference between the
$17,000 signing bonus he had received and the $50,000 he might have
received a year later. Boras has said that Beltre learned only last
March that he had been too young to sign with the Dodgers. But
Selig said documents uncovered in the investigation established
earlier knowledge and put Beltre well beyond the one-year statute
of limitations established in baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-page letter to Beltre, a copy of which was obtained by
The New York Times, Selig cited five specific documents that the
player filled out and signed on which he listed the falsified birth
date. They included a sports service questionnaire in 1996, two
club physical examination questionnaires in 1997 and 1998, and U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization forms in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents,'' Selig wrote, ``demonstrate your awareness
that the Dodgers had falsified your birth date and that you, at
least at times, were cooperating in that deception.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Selig reminded Beltre of the representation he had
from his father and an amateur coach in negotiations or talks with
the Dodgers and other organizations, including the Yankees, in
1994. Those talks, the commissioner said, ``belie any naivete you
may claim toward the signing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras declined to comment on the ruling or the ``allegations''
of prior knowledge ``because this is going to grievance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, was not
prepared Tuesday to say the union would file a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read the opinion and I think it raises some questions
that require some analysis on our part,'' Orza said. ``We'll make
up our mind in the next 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers weren't challenging anything. They are ecstatic just
to be able to keep Beltre, who in his first full season in the
major leagues hit .275 and drove in 67 runs.

FTC SAYS NUCLEAR POWER ADS ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED YET PERMISSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission has agreed with an
environmental group and the Better Business Bureau that
advertisements by the nuclear industry made unsubstantiated claims
about the benefits of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, the commission said it would not ban the ads
because they were aimed at least in part at ``opinion leaders'' and
thus were political speech protected by the First Amendment, rather
than being commercial ads subject to close regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau, through its National Advertising
Division, appealed the case to the commission after mediation
failed. Acting on a complaint brought by the Natural Resources
Defense Council, a nonprofit group, the Better Business Bureau
determined in May that the nuclear industry had made ``overly broad
claims,'' but the industry continued to run the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said the ads were an
attempt by the nuclear industry to compete with companies that
owned windmills and solar generators in an effort to get the
business of environmentally minded consumers in states that have
deregulated the utility industry, allowing households to choose
their electricity suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC, in a Dec. 15 letter to the Nuclear Energy Institute,
the trade group that placed the ads, said the ad campaign had
``failed to substantiate its general environmental benefit claim.''
The ads, for example, said that nuclear power was ``environmentally
clean,'' but the letter said that hot water discharged from the
plants hurts the environment.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims had been made in a direct mail campaign to
consumers, the letter said, they would clearly have been
``commercial speech'' and thus not protected by the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's letter, from Joan Bernstein, director of the
Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the industry should ``take to
heart the evaluation of its advertising that has been rendered by
its peers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Natural Resources Defense Council, Kit Kennedy, a lawyer,
said the decision was sending ``a clear warning shot'' to the
Nuclear Energy Institute. ``They cannot make these claims of
environmental benefit in any type of retail advertising,'' Ms.
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the nuclear group, Scott Peterson, a spokesman, said,
``When they began the investigation, it was to determine whether
NEI had engaged in unfair or deceptive practices; by dismissing
that, they concluded we did not.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, ``If you're going door to door, you need to be
careful in terms of how you portray environmental benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads appeared in The New Republic, The Atlantic Monthly, The
New York Times and two papers published on Capitol Hill, Roll Call

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Buffeted by one of Asia's most persistent
and ingenious insurgencies, Sri Lankans voted in large numbers on
Tuesday in a presidential election whose candidates offered little
real hope of peace.
</P>
<P>
   A large field of candidates, headed by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga and her main challenger, Ranil Wickeramasinghe,
competed in a campaign that was overwhelmed by a surge of violence.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of themselves, the guerrillas may have created a
sympathy vote for the president, who was wounded Saturday in a
suicide bombing that took at least 24 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a second explosion killed 12 people at an
opposition rally on the other side of town. A total of 187 people
were wounded. The guerrillas, who are members of the country's
Tamil ethnic minority, are fighting for an independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks brought home to the capital a distant war in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula, where the insurgents, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have been fighting for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Storming back onto the offensive after a pause of a year and a
half, the insurgents in the last seven weeks have retaken much of
the territory captured by the army in 1995 and 1996. Retrained and
resupplied, they have augmented their well-practiced guerrilla
tactics with devastating artillery barrages.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, 500 government troops have been killed as the
guerrillas try to cut off Elephant Pass, Jaffna's only link to the
rest of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive pushed aside issues of economic hardship and
galvanized an election campaign that Mrs. Kumaratunga called in
October, one year before her term was up, in the full expectation
of an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of issues to begin with, but the principal
issue now is on the battlefield,'' said Saravana Muttu, who heads
the Center for Policy Alternatives, an independent policy group.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the attempt on Mrs. Kumaratunga's life,
which sent shrapnel into her face and left her with a white patch
over her right eye, may have improved her chances in the close
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was leading when the election started, but by the time the
bomb went off she was losing,'' said Kingsley da Silva, executive
director of the International Center for Ethnic Studies, a private
organization that seeks to find formulas for conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Such suicide attacks are a vivid demonstration of the commitment
of the Tamil separatists, many of whom are young women and many of
whom carry cyanide tablets in case of capture.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaign-rally attacks attributed to the Tamil
insurgents have killed other Sri Lankan politicians, as well as a
former Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Either because she was recuperating or because she feared an
attack, Mrs. Kumaratunga did not travel to her polling place just
outside the capital Tuesday but had her ballot papers flown in by
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the electoral process, and disdaining even to comment on
it directly, was a man who over the years has become a leading
figure in Sri Lankan affairs, the guerrilla leader Vellupillai
Prabhakaran, 45. He has a reputation as a man who ``thrives on
war,'' and he is said to inspire the movement's suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   With Prabhakaran apparently uninterested in compromise, neither
of the leading presidential candidates has offered a creative or
persuasive approach to resolving the long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war began in 1983, it has taken more than 60,000 lives
and displaced perhaps a million people in this nation of 18
million. Total defense spending has been estimated to consume as
much as one-fourth of the national budget. Tourism, foreign
investment and domestic industry have all suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga came to office four years ago on a wave of
euphoria with a promise of peace. But her early overtures to the
rebels made little headway and were replaced by what some analysts
now say was an over-ambitious, over-extended military campaign that
was distorted and weakened by the government's political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's promises of peace, da Silva said, ``If
you look at the number of soldiers killed in the whole war, 4,000
were killed before 1995 and almost double that since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The president now proposes a constitutional amendment that would
offer greater freedoms to the Tamils in the northeast. But the
amendment is general in its terms and unlikely to offer concrete
solutions, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief opponent, Wickeramasinghe, has taken a more
conciliatory line, offering a pause in the fighting and the
possibility of talks. But Prabhakaran has in the past rejected more
generous peace-making overtures, including those of Mrs.
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils are in a minority of just 3.2 million, but they have
close links to a far larger Tamil population just a few miles
across the sea in southern India, where they benefit from sanctuary
and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Their grievances run deep, with roots in the British colonial
administration that favored the Hindu Tamils as bureaucratic
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   With independence in 1948, the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who
make up 74 percent of the population, struck back, imposing
discriminatory laws, making Sinhalese the national language and
withdrawing the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict as deep and intractable as that of Northern
Ireland, said da Silva, and one that requires the kind of
painstaking, drawn-out negotiations that produced a peace agreement
there.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he said, no one seems ready to take a deep breath
and seek real compromise.

CITY SEEKS WAYS AROUND RULING ON X-RATED SHOPS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a tree-lined residential street on Manhattan's
Upper West Side, just half a block from a Starbucks and Zabar's, is
a neighborhood video store decorated with Christmas wreaths and
lights, piped-in holiday jingles and shelves filled with features
like ``The Kermit and Piggy Story,'' ``Barney in Concert'' and
``Suzanne Somers' Thighmaster Exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   But customers at Les Hommes video store Tuesday afternoon were
not there for the family entertainment or even for the sprinkling
of Hollywood classics. Videos like ``Summer Sex Splash,'' ``The
Orgy in Budapest'' and ``In the Name of Leather'' are instead the
big sellers, a fact that infuriates Mayor Rudolph Giuliani but
which the state's highest court ruled unanimously on Monday was
perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling undermines a 1995 law that was supposed to
shut down most of the city's pornography-dominated stores,
particularly in residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that the city was
being too broad in its enforcement of a guideline derived from the
law, which requires that stores in most of the city devote no more
than 40 percent of their business to pornographic materials. The
city has maintained that many stores have circumvented the law by
filling shelves with inoffensive and inexpensive videos they know
will not sell, in order to remain in business.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Tuesday that they were looking for ways to
overcome the setback. One possibility, they said, was for store
sales and not just inventory to account for the 60 percent of
porn-free material.
</P>
<P>
   But civil libertarians and backers of the porn industry called
the decision a major victory in a battle that until now Giuliani
had been consistently winning. Since July 1998, when the U.S.
Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the zoning law,
allowing it to go into effect, 62 of the city's 144 sex-related
businesses have either been forcibly closed or gone out of
business, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision should send Giuliani a message that the courts
are not going to stand for his intolerance and tyranny,'' said
Martin Hodas, the man who popularized peep shows in Times Square in
the 1960s and '70s and who is still an investor in sex-related
businesses in New York. ``Sex is not evil. It was given to us by
God to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals decision came after the city tried to shut
down Les Hommes, one of dozens of outlets in the city that added
stocks of mainstream films and other nonsexually oriented
merchandise after the new zoning law went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The second-story shop at 217 West 80th Street has no obvious
street-level signs or other markings to indicate what is upstairs.
Sex toys are displayed in a glass case at the entrance, but most of
the store's compact sales floor is taken up by shelves filled with
dated Hollywood titles, karate films, sports videos and a large
collection of children's videos.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer who represented the owner of
Les Hommes, said that the store did not have many of the latest
Hollywood films because it did not have the buying power of the big
video chains and could not afford to buy too many videos that did
not sell.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Xtremes video store, at 763 Eighth Avenue, near 46th
Street, an entire basement floor is dedicated to action, horror,
comedy, romance and children's films, with a sign on the main floor
vaunting the array of ``Kid Cartoons!!'' for $5.99. But the shelf
marked ``new releases'' carries such titles as ``Great Moments in
Basketball'' from 1988 and ``Romantic Comedy'' (1983) starring
Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, all 17 customers pursuing the shelves at
Xtremes were upstairs in the adult sections, where movies with
titles like ``Candy's Girls'' and ``Samurai Fantasy Voyeur'' were
being rented or sold. A man who identified himself as the store
supervisor, but who declined to give his name, said the store was
scrupulously adhering to the 60 percent nonadult requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We comply with the law,'' he said. ``Giuliani asked for it. He
got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Haroules, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union in
New York, said that any move by the city to expand the 60-to-40
rule by regulating the actual material the stores sell would not
stand up to a court challenge, since it would violate the
constitutional rights of owners and clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in and try to rewrite the guidelines or zoning
regulation, you open the door to a new round of constitutional
challenges,'' she said. ``You may have `101 Dalmatians' and it is
full of dust and over there you have `Debbie Does Dallas' and you
can't keep it in stock. But that is not at all relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Saffran, executive director of the Center for the
Community Interest, and city Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a
Queens Democrat who serves as chairman of the council's zoning
subcommittee, rejected Ms. Haroules' argument, noting that the
Court of Appeals judges had all but invited the city to revise its
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling notes that ``in the end, we must enforce the city's
administrative guidelines as written.'' But ``there may indeed be
situations where what a store is selling or renting cannot be
considered stock under the city's guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in remarks to reporters Tuesday, said that the city
would make such changes.
</P>
<P>
   The court ``did not strike down the zoning change, thank
goodness,'' Giuliani said. ``The bad news is that we have to go
back and rewrite the regulation.''

INVESTOR ACCUSED OF FRAUD IN AZERBAIJAN VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LeVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ An investment promoter who made a fortune
from questionable stock dealings in his native Czech Republic years
ago has now been accused of fraud in an Azerbaijan venture that has
attracted $450 million from foreign investors. Some investors are
prominent Americans, including former Sen. George Mitchell and Leon
Cooperman, a Wall Street fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud accusation against Viktor Kozeny was contained in a
civil lawsuit filed Friday in London by one of the investors,
Marlwood Commercial Inc., a subsidiary of American International
Group, a diversified insurance company. The suit seeks $15 million,
the amount of Marlwood's investment.
</P>
<P>
   London's High Court sealed the suit, but some details were
disclosed Monday in a routine notification filed with the High
Court clerk's office. The filing alleged fraud and breach of duty
involving the long-stalled privatization program of Azerbaijan, an
oil-rich Caspian Sea nation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asserted that Kozeny fraudulently persuaded
investors that they could buy, among other properties, part of the
extremely valuable Azerbaijan state oil company, a concern that
Azeri officials say they never promised to sell. In addition, the
lawsuit asserted, Kozeny grossly inflated the price of
privatization ``options'' necessary for bidding on the properties,
charging investors $25 apiece when he paid as little as 25 cents
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the lawsuit said, some of Kozeny's clients believe their
investment has plummeted to less than 10 percent of its original
value, or a loss exceeding $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D'Alessandri, a lawyer for American International Group,
said the company would not comment on its lawsuit, which has also
been filed in the Bahamas. Legal action was taken in London and the
Bahamas because Kozeny owns property in those places that
plaintiffs could move to seize.
</P>
<P>
   The group of about 30 American investors also included the real
estate billionaire Richard Friedman, who owns a Martha's Vineyard
estate where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have
vacationed, and Frederick Bourke, chairman of Dooney &AMP; Bourke, the
handbag company.
</P>
<P>
   With $180 million in investments from institutional and other
clients, Cooperman, chairman of New York-based Omega Advisors, is
thought to have the greatest exposure to the Azerbaijan venture.
Cooperman is not a party to the suit, though he said in a telephone
interview that ``it doesn't mean we can't be down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman said that he and Kozeny were no longer working
together. Cooperman also said that he was still trying to persuade
the Azerbaijan government to proceed with a significant
privatization. The Azerbaijan government recently said it would do
so, but would not yet include any part of the state oil company.
Diplomats have described the company as a lucrative source of cash
in a corrupt government that is unlikely to be sold anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viktor brought us the investment through a friend,'' Cooperman
said. ``We were not happy with his deportment. He became a
lightning rod of resentment in the country. So we went our separate
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Americans have described the Harvard-educated
Kozeny, 36, as a gifted, charismatic salesman. He has attracted as
much publicity for his spending binges as his investment
promotions, including a 1997 London meal on which he spent $20,000,
including $8,000 for a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny owns a mansion in London and a ski chalet in Aspen,
Colo., though he usually lives on the Bahamas island of Lyford Cay.
Several attempts to call Kozeny on Lyford Cay were unsuccessful.
His lawyer, Jacqueline Miller, did not return three phone calls to
her office in Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Azerbaijan affair bears a resemblance to one earlier this
decade involving Kozeny in the Czech Republic, from which he
emigrated to the United States as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1991, Kozeny went on television and promised
enormous returns for Czech citizens who turned over their
privatization coupons _ every adult was entitled to them _ to the
company he then ran, Harvard Capital and Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 Czechs eventually did so. By 1996, Kozeny had
earned a fortune estimated to exceed $200 million, while his
clients' investment had plummeted. Some press articles called
Kozeny ``The Pirate of Prague,'' a moniker that endures there.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech government investigation resulted in a finding of
wrongdoing by his company, which was fined and ordered to reimburse
$6.8 million of investors' money improperly spent on advertising
and consulting fees. Kozeny was never criminally charged with
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kozeny shifted his attention to Azerbaijan. That year
in Aspen, Kozeny threw a lavish party where, according to several
accounts, he delivered an extremely vivid account of a coming
windfall in Azerbaijan privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny said he intended to buy the gems of the Azerbaijan
economy _ the telecommunications company, the natural-gas
distribution company and, especially, the state oil company, known
by its acronym, SOCAR. With its refineries, pipelines and oil
fields, SOCAR is said to be worth well into the billions of
dollars. Those who heard the pitch told friends, and Kozeny
suddenly had much American investment.
</P>
<P>
   In Baku, Kozeny's company, Minaret Group, rented two floors in
the Landmark, one of the most expensive office buildings in the
then-booming Azerbaijan capital. Although Baku as yet had no stock
market, he built a computerized ``trading floor'' of computer
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who invested an undisclosed sum, appeared in April
1998 as Kozeny's marquee guest at Minaret's catered grand opening
at Baku's premier hotel. Mitchell's Washington law office said the
former senator was traveling Tuesday and was unavailable for
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Minaret Group established itself, Azeri
officials began delaying the privatization. Earlier this year,
Minaret abandoned much of its office space, and condensed its
operations into three rooms in the Landmark.

GOTCHA! SPACE SHUTTLE CREW CAPTURES BROKEN TELESCOPE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After a spirited chase across the sky, the space
shuttle Discovery grabbed the Hubble Space Telescope with its robot
arm Tuesday, retrieving the observatory to begin a critical repair
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle, which had been chasing Hubble since being
launched on Sunday, spent the day closing in on the observatory
from below through a series of rocket firings.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Curtis L. Brown of the Air Force, the mission
commander, and Lt. Cmdr. Scott J. Kelley of the Navy, the pilot,
maneuvered the two spacecraft together until they linked up 369
miles above the Gulf of Mexico. At 7:34 p.m. Eastern time,
Jean-Francois Clervoy, the French astronaut operating the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm, snared Hubble as the craft flew in formation at
17,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good capture,'' Clervoy said with enthusiasm, ``We
have Hubble grappled.''
</P>
<P>
   Clervoy slowly lowered the 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long
observatory to a rotating cradle in the Discovery's cargo bay,
where it was latched in place by three clamps for a critical period
of inspection and repair. Hubble has been out of operation for more
than six weeks, since four of six stabilizing gyroscopes failed,
making it impossible for the telescope to lock onto celestial
targets for scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   If the much-delayed repair mission, originally scheduled for
October, is successful, scientists hope to have Hubble back in
operation sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the telescope begins an intensive three days of work
for the seven-man shuttle crew, focusing on three work-packed
spacewalks. The shuttle's weather-delayed launching forced the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to drop plans for a
fourth spacewalk and compress the original 10-day mission into
eight. NASA wants the shuttle on the ground and all mission
equipment powered down by the end of the year to avoid any computer
problems associated with the year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
   During the first spacewalk, scheduled to begin on Wednesday
afternoon and last six and a half hours, the astronauts Steven L.
Smith and John M. Grunsfeld are to perform the primary repairs of
the mission. The astronauts, one perched at the end of the
shuttle's robot arm, will open the telescope and replace three Rate
Sensor Units, enclosures that each contain two of the critical
gyroscopes needed to point and steady the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Working within the close quarters of the telescope, the
astronauts must be careful not to bump or jostle Hubble's delicate
optics and other instruments while making the equipment switches.
</P>
<P>
   Also, insulating material inside and outside the telescope is
aging and becoming brittle, posing the risk of debris that could
get into the observatory and damage instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want to rub up against it because it would
create little particles,'' Smith said before the flight.
</P>
<P>
   After replacing the six gyroscopes, the astronauts are to
install voltage regulator kits on Hubble's six aging batteries to
keep them from overcharging and overheating in periods of low power
use. They will also service a valve on an instrument cooling
system.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, C. Michael Foale, a NASA astronaut, and Claude
Nicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut, are to take more than
six hours for several tasks, including the replacement of Hubble's
central computer with a new model, which is more than 20 times
faster and has six times the memory of the current one. The
spacewalkers then will swap one of the telescope's three Fine
Guidance Sensors with a refurbished unit. These devices allow the
telescope to remain locked on a target for hours or days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ham, the lead flight director for the mission, said NASA
could call the mission completely successful if the astronauts
completed the tasks planned for the first two spacewalks.
``Anything after that is added value,'' Ms. Ham said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third spacewalk, set for Friday, Smith and Grunsfeld are
to replace a failed radio transmitter and install a new data
recorder, which stores information on computer chips instead of the
tape reels of the unit it replaces. Unlike other Hubble parts, the
transmitter was not designed to be replaced by astronauts, and the
spacewalkers will have to use small bolts and cables that could be
difficult for their stiff, gloved hands to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The last planned task of the third spacewalk involves putting
new metallic covers over some of the worn, torn insulation covering
the observatory. A decade in space, during which Hubble was exposed
to sunlight and other harsh elements, has weathered the exterior of
the observatory, designed to operate in space for 20 years with
periodic upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The canceled fourth spacewalk was to involve more work on the
exterior insulation and numerous smaller jobs. In an interview from
space on Monday, the astronauts said it might be possible to do a
few of the minor jobs planned for the fourth walk on earlier
excursions if they finished more important work ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is due to release Hubble back into space on
Christmas, and to land back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
on Monday.

STOLEN IN '92, RUBENS PORTRAIT WORTH $3.1 MILLION IS FOUND IN NEW
JERSEY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A portrait painted four centuries ago by the
Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and stolen seven years ago from
its owner in Belgium has been recovered from a New Jersey collector
who did not know it had been stolen, the authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The oil portrait, ``Unidentified Man Wearing a Ruff,'' was
painted by Rubens between 1600 and 1609, said Carey S. Chin,
special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark office. He said the
Belgian authorities valued the painting at $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agency displayed the 20-inch-by-30-inch painting Tuesday in
the incongruous surroundings of a 15th-floor conference room, where
it was encased in a foam-padded wooden box standing on a metal
easel. The subject, a middle-aged man with a goatee, wears a dark
coat with a delicate white ruff, and a wide-eyed, slightly amused
expression. Agent Stephen Siegel of the FBI Newark Interstate Theft
Task Force, who retrieved the painting on Friday from the
unidentified collector, wore latex gloves to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said the painting had not been authenticated by art
authorities since it was retrieved by the FBI. He said it was
stolen in Belgium in 1992 from a Brussels man, Dirck van Wylinck,
whose family had owned it since 1927. van Wylinck sought to start a
publishing house in Prague, and turned over the painting to two
people as collateral for a business loan, Chin said. But, he added,
they soon disappeared with it.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by Belgian law enforcement officials eventually
led them to a collector in New Jersey, who had bought the painting
in Belgium in late 1992 along with a group of drawings by other
well-known artists, Siegel said. He said the Belgian authorities
contacted the FBI's legal attache in Brussels, asking that agents
in New Jersey recover the painting. Chin said that agents in New
Jersey had no direct contact with the Belgian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said the Belgian authorities are investigating the two
people who took the painting as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Chin refused to identify the collector or say whether he had
kept the painting in a home or gallery. The collector bought the
painting in good faith, apparently unaware of its value until he
had it appraised after he bought it, Chin said. He said the
collector had cooperated in the investigation and was not likely to
be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said that Belgian authorities would come to Newark next
month to claim the painting and return it to van Wylinck.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Maurice, deputy consul general at the Belgian
consulate, said he was told Tuesday afternoon of the painting's
recovery by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, of course, are happy that the American authorities were
able to find a valuable Belgian work of art,'' Maurice said.
``Especially because Rubens was one of Belgium's finest masters of
all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubens (1577-1640) was among the most prominent of the Flemish
and Dutch masters of the 17th century. His contemporaries included
van Dyke, a student of Rubens, and Rembrandt. Rubens' ``Head of
John the Baptist Presented to Salome'' sold last year for $5.2
million.

RENO CALLED INQUIRY TOO FOCUSED ON SCIENTIST
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno told Congress in June
that she thought federal investigators had prematurely focused on
the weapons scientist Wen Ho Lee in their initial inquiry into
whether China had stolen U.S. nuclear secrets, according to newly
declassified Senate testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Reno said
that an administrative inquiry conducted in 1995 by the Department
of Energy, with help from the FBI, had failed to adequately
investigate others who had access to classified information about
the United States' most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88,
according to a transcript of the hearing released by the committee
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elimination of other logical suspects, having the same
access and opportunity, did not occur,'' Reno told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's testimony came in defense of the Justice Department's
1997 decision to reject an FBI request to seek a court-authorized
wiretap of Lee, who was then a scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After being the focus of a three-year federal investigation into
China's apparent theft of data related to the W-88, Lee was fired
from Los Alamos this March for security violations. The FBI
discovered later that he had conducted unauthorized transfers of
vast amounts of secret material about nuclear weapons from the
laboratory's classified computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arrested on Dec. 10 and charged with mishandling
classified information. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held
without bail pending trial. He has not been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the government has proceeded with its criminal case
against Lee, government officials have acknowledged that the
original espionage inquiry was not properly handled.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Reno and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh ordered
federal agents to broaden the W-88 investigation beyond Lee and Los
Alamos to other possible sources of the secret information. Yet the
newly released testimony shows that Reno was concerned that
investigators had prematurely focused on Lee for months before she
ordered the broadened inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 inquiry focused on Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore
national laboratories, the two laboratories that design the United
States' nuclear weapons. The W-88 was designed at Los Alamos. The
theft related to the W-88 was believed to have occurred between
1984 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the Justice Department turned down the FBI's request
for the wiretap in that inquiry because other laboratory employees
had not been adequately investigated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her testimony also provided new insight into Lee's activities in
the early 1980s, when he first came under scrutiny in a separate
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the FBI questioned Lee after a wiretap picked up a
phone conversation he had with a scientist from Lawrence Livermore
who had been fired in connection with the government's
investigation into China's theft of neutron bomb secrets. On Dec.
20, 1983, Lee told the FBI that he had been in contact with
Taiwanese nuclear researchers since 1977 or 1978, and had done
consulting work for them in addition to giving them unclassified
research papers, according to Reno's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lee told the FBI at the time that he had contacted the Lawrence
Livermore scientist because he thought he had been fired for doing
the same thing that Lee had been doing for Taiwan, Reno testified.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 24, 1984, Lee took a polygraph exam, answering questions
about whether he had ever passed classified information to a
foreign government and about the nature of his contacts with the
Lawrence Livermore scientist and the Taiwanese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polygraph confirmed that he had not passed classified
information to any foreign government, and the accuracy of his
claims concerning the nature of contacts'' with the scientist and
the embassy, Reno testified.

TIPS FOR ADULTS SEEKING NEW DEGREE
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The third time is proving to be the charm for
Susan McQuilkin. After two previous attempts at being a college
student, the 51-year-old mother of three is only seven classes away
from obtaining her bachelor's degree at California Lutheran
University in suburban Ventura County, north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Working full time while working toward a degree in higher
education is no easy feat, but McQuilkin of Moorpark said the pros
outweigh the cons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put a lot of things on hold, but pursuing an
education is something I do for myself. I don't have time to
participate in hobbies or do pleasure reading, but going to school
gives me such a feeling of accomplishment,'' said McQuilkin, who
works as the assistant to the school's vice president of university
advancement when she isn't taking classes.
</P>
<P>
   McQuilkin is one of a growing number of people who are returning
to school, whether to finish a degree they never completed or to
take classes in an entirely new field. They're going to school to
enrich their lives, or to get a degree that'll give them the raise
or the new job they covet.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with a half-dozen different people from experts in
the education field to people pursuing a new degree offer the
following advice:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Take classes that are relevant to what you want to do as a
career or to what you are already doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take something that applies to what you're doing, it's
a hook and it has more meaning,'' McQuilkin explained.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Be dedicated because you are doing this for yourself and
not anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to be there, school is fun and exciting and
stimulating,'' McQuilkin said.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Take classes through an adult program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have struggled more in classes with 18- and
19-year-olds,'' McQuilkin said. ``The structure of an adult evening
program helps because you are in class with other working adults
and we keep each other going.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of LaVerne targets working adults by only
offering classes at night at its campuses across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Classes meet one night a week from 5 to 10 p.m. for 10 weeks,
with two classes considered full-time attendance. Prospective
students are required to be at least 25 years old or have a minimum
of 30 college credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume all of our students are working full time,'' said
Jennifer Siefken, an academic counselor for the university. ``I'm
not going to say it's easy to go to school while working, but we
try and work with the students' schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   One way the university does this is by letting prospective
students do most of their admissions paperwork through the mail and
doing admissions consultations over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Siefken said the university also offers off-campus library
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of commitment, but it's worthwhile. It's also a
great way to meet people; we like to call it `intelligent
nightlife,''' said Siefken with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kunze, an assistant in Glendale Community College's adult
re-entry center, said the first thing she tells re-entry students
is to take things slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first semester is about getting adjusted. A class may only
meet once a week, but there are papers and reading you have to do
outside of class,'' said Kunze, who is working toward her
bachelor's degree at California State University, Los Angeles.
``You just have to set your priorities and take it one step at a
time.''

KINGS WORK ON ROLE PLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three brutal losses followed by three days off
leaves the coaching staff with time to find a remedy, and Los
Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray attempted it do so with intense
practices and team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in less than 60 hours and the fourth time in
five days the Kings held a team meeting. This time it was to
discuss roles and to make sure everyone understood theirs heading
into tonight's game at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went around the room and told every single player what we
expected of them,'' Murray said. ``So they know what a Glenn Murray
should being doing, what they can count on a Donald Audette for,
Rob Blake knows what he can count on Mattias Norstrom for. It's not
only a matter of that individual player knowing his role now. It's
a continuing of redefining and reinforcing roles.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd that 30 games into a season players can suddenly
forget their roles. But several players said injuries to marquee
players, and their subsequent return, caused players to drift from
the system that made the Kings the top team in the Western
Conference a few weeks ago. Instead, players were caught out of
position, particularly in the defensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people forgot their roles,'' Kings center Ian
Laperriere said. ``We're the same players, the same group of guys,
so what's wrong? Sometimes you try to do too much. Sometimes I
tired to do my winger's job. Sometimes the winger tried to do my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting strong: During the three-game losing streak the Kings
were outscored 13-1 in the first period, which contrasts to how
they played most of the season. The Kings outscored their opponents
28-17 during their 16-8-6 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware that we have to come out and play hard, but this
is also the time to show some mental toughness, that if we do get
down a goal we're not going to let it turn into something ugly
again,'' defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. ``I think to get out of
a slump like this, hard work is the way to do it. You change
systems, you can change this and that, but if you want to win bad
enough, you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Line tinkering: Murray said he wasn't planning any major changes
against San Jose, but added the coaching staff is taking a hard
look at it's ``energy line.'' Two-thirds of the Kings' fourth line
Jason Blake (post-concussion syndrome), Brad Chartrand (groin) and
Steve McKenna won't be available because of injuries. Murray was
unhappy with the Kings' lack of toughness Saturday against Chicago,
and he may opt to go with a burly line of McKenna, Dan Bylsma and
recently recalled Bill Huard, a physical presence from Lowell
(Mass.) of the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Faceoffs: Murray said Jaroslav Modry would be the sixth
defenseman against San Jose. ...Jozef Stumpel was pain free after
practice and is expected to play for the first time in seven weeks.

EAGLE RESCUED BY HUNTER SOARS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bald eagle's heartbeat was strong; the doctor could feel it.
</P>
<P>
   A raptor once near death now perched on the arm of veterinarian
Tom Del Pico. But the eagle was stressed Tuesday on the drive to a
release point at Smithville Lake, making its heart pound and its
tongue wag.
</P>
<P>
   That the eagle was alive was a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Its life hinged on a deer hunter's keen eye and sure shot, a
wise conservation agent and a veterinarian who admires and treats
birds of prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she flies,'' Del Pico said. ``I hope she doesn't crash
to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, the eagle would have to enter a rehabilitation
program, and the stress of travel and strange surroundings could
make its fate uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive to the lake, Del Pico momentarily lifted a towel
covering the bird. Eyes flashed fiercely. But wing strength was the
doctor's concern.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was rescued Dec. 12, when Bill Tott of Waldron was
hunting deer with a black powder rifle in the Missouri River
bottoms northwest of Parkville. From a distance, he spotted the
eagle dangling upside down in a cottonwood tree near the river.
</P>
<P>
   When Tott reached the cottonwood, the eagle was motionless, with
a wing snarled in limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was dead,'' Tott said. ``Then I noticed its eyes
were green.''
</P>
<P>
   An eye blinked, and he knew the bird was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tott hiked out of the bottoms, called authorities and returned
to the cottonwood with a more powerful rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on his back, he fired at the tree limb and missed. He
switched aim to a bigger limb and fired again. The limb began
falling.
</P>
<P>
   As it did, the eagle slipped free and glided to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too weak to run or to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nichols, a Missouri Department of Conservation agent,
arrived as Tott was shooting down the limb. Together they
approached the eagle and placed a hunting vest over it to hold and
calm it. It was too weak to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a bald eagle tangled up in a tree before,''
Nichols said. ``I'd venture to say very few people have rescued a
bald eagle they found dangling from a wing.''
</P>
<P>
   An unusual twist of two limbs snagged the wing. Tott is saving
the limbs as a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle would have died quickly from a lacerated wing,
dehydration and hypothermia, Del Pico said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Pico and his staff in Smithville treated the wing and began
force-feeding the eagle rainbow trout. At first the bird was bowed,
with few signs of pride.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next few days it became more active. A hunter
provided ducks for food, and the bird began to hold itself more
upright. Soon it was clucking and looking for an escape.
</P>
<P>
   So on Tuesday its rescuers and some onlookers gathered at a
parking lot near the Smithville Lake dam to release the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Del Pico lifted the towel from the white head. Wings thrashed
skyward, so the doctor set his patient free.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle promptly glided to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But wings flexed again, and in a creaky flight the eagle sailed
into the air and over a cove, scattering a flock of Canada geese.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was over the main lake and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, look at her go,'' Del Pico said. ``This is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Tott tracked the eagle through binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``Look at her climb. She's way up there
now.''

GOOD TIMES HELP ALMOST EVERYBODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's great inequality debate never lacks for serious
attention by those willing to ignore how statistics can be used to
support specious contentions.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst what's manifestly the most prosperous era in U.S.
history, some would have us believe Americans below the highest
income levels are worse off than they were a generation ago. Before
you buy into this pretext, however, ponder reality: Americans are
on track to spend about $6 trillion this year on personal
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is substantial inequality if you measure such
concepts by the income gap between bosses and workers and the
amount of wealth controlled by the richest households. But to
equate such disparities with declining working-class fortunes is
pseudo-intellectual fatuousness.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite statistic in these circles shows the bottom fifth of
American families experiencing a small decline in real income over
the past two decades while the top fifth has enjoyed real-income
growth of nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming accurate data, there are explanations that put this
development into economic perspective. One is that families at the
bottom of the ladder tend to be single-parent households much more
often than families at the higher levels. More household
bread-winners equal more income.
</P>
<P>
   When assessing real-income growth, those pursuing these studies
also should account for the damage done by rising payroll taxes.
These hit the first dollar earned and thus are especially
burdensome for low-wage workers. In 1979, the rate was only 6.13
percent on the first $22,900 of wages. Since 1990 the rate has been
7.65 percent, and this year's wage cap was $72,600 for Social
Security, with no limit on the Medicare portion. As a result of
these tax increases, more than three-quarters of taxpayers now pay
more in payroll taxes than income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the implication that those at the bottom live wretched
existences, some statistics provide strong mitigating arguments.
While life at the bottom may not be plush, even those below
government's officially decreed poverty line are not nearly as bad
off as the characterization suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Federal data show that some 40 percent own their own homes, 70
percent of poor households own cars (27 percent own two cars), 97
percent have a color television set (nearly 75 percent have a VCR),
two-thirds have air-conditioning, some 85 percent say their
families have enough to eat, and the average poor American has a
third more living space than the average Japanese and four times
more living space than the average Russian.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say some Americans don't have it rough. Like any
other human society, America has its share of serious material need
and want.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any other society in history, however, America has
created a level of prosperity unmatched in human experience that
benefits most of society's members. Just because we aren't all
millionaires doesn't mean the system is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   This is merely the way the real world works. In 20th century
America, though, it has worked much better than it ever has before.
The holiday season is a much better time to count blessings than
bemoan cruel fates that often are either overstated or nonexistent.

OF MICE AND GENES: A MERGER IS KILLED BY SOARING VALUATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Abgenix Inc. has a valuable mouse, and Tuesday its
roar was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, announced that its
directors had rescinded their recommendation that the company be
sold to the Genzyme General Corp. for $350 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that Cell Genesys' 19 percent of Abgenix, worth
about $130 million when the merger with Genzyme General was
announced in October, has nearly tripled in value, to about $370
million. That is more than Genzyme would pay for all of Cell
Genesys.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Abgenix, which is based in Fremont, have soared
because of investor enthusiasm for its XenoMouse technology, which
modifies the genes in a line of mice so they can produce human
antibodies rather than mouse antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Monoclonal antibodies are versions of the proteins used by the
body to fight disease-causing agents and are highly promising as
drugs. But mouse antibodies do not work well as drugs because the
patient's immune system attacks them as foreign invaders. Abgenix,
whose technology is not used in any monoclonal antibodies now on
the market, says its antibodies are fully human. It says 15
companies, including the drug giant Pfizer, have agreed to use its
technology to make 20 different drugs, the first of which will
enter clinical trials next year. Two antibodies from Abgenix itself
are already in clinical trials _ one for cancer and one for
psoriasis, the skin disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Abgenix said it had agreed to pay $47 million to gain
exclusive rights to XenoMouse from a joint venture partner, Japan
Tobacco Inc. Abgenix shares closed Tuesday at $112, up $5.25. The
stock was at $40 when the Genzyme acquisition of Cell Genesys was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Abgenix, which does not expect to be profitable for two more
years, was spun off from Cell Genesys in 1996. Genzyme General,
part of the Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., was interested in
Cell Genesys for its gene therapy technology, not its stake in
Abgenix. ``They didn't even mention us on the conference call''
announcing the acquisition, Kurt W. Leutzinger, chief financial
officer of Abgenix, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But as Abgenix shares have risen, the deal became ``untenable,''
said Jim McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter.
Though Genzyme does not want to give up the acquisition, he said it
would probably drop its bid or perhaps agree to pay a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, sensing that Genzyme would have to renegotiate, had
already bid Cell Genesys stock higher than the $10 a share that
Genzyme was supposed to pay. Tuesday, however, Cell Genesys shares
fell 43.75 cents, to $10.875, a sign that some investors think the
deal will collapse. Genzyme General shares rose $3.8125, or 10
percent, to $42.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES CALL FOR BOOSTING SECURITY MEASURES AT
AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities, increasingly concerned about the
possibility of a holiday terrorist attack, took additional steps
Tuesday to safeguard Americans by adding inspectors to monitor
security operations at airports.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said that travelers should
expect stricter enforcement of parking regulations, and that it
would make more use of devices to check airline passengers for
small traces of explosives. Additional bomb-sniffing dogs and
uniformed police also will patrol airports as the new year
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns come after last week's arrest of an Algerian who
brought bomb-making material into Washington state from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Still, federal authorities say they have no evidence about
specific terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to overly concern people,'' said Jeff Lanza,
spokesman for the FBI's Kansas City office. ``The chances of
anything happening are very slim, but we want to take every
precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City International Airport officials have not planned any
additional security measures for the new year. KCI spokeswoman Tara
Smith said Tuesday that the existing security measures at KCI
already are very strict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this an advisory rather than a mandate,'' Smith
said of the FAA's action.
</P>
<P>
   Airport police do not allow people to leave unattended vehicles
at the curb. Numerous security cameras are mounted throughout KCI,
and airport police have two dogs that can sniff suspicious-looking
bags.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, KCI officials advise holiday travelers not to
gift wrap items to carry aboard planes and to check in at least an
hour before takeoff on domestic flights and two hours before
international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Kansas City are allocating more manpower as the
New Year approaches and are working with planners of large-scale
events.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 5,000 partiers will celebrate in Union Station,
perhaps the area's biggest bash. Revelers will pay up to $500 for a
black-tie dinner, live music and fireworks. Up to 10,000 will
celebrate in tents outside.
</P>
<P>
   Event organizer Stacy McCullough said police have worked with
organizers from the start, even sitting in on planning meetings.
Police and private security will work at the event.
</P>
<P>
   Partiers will pass through metal detectors as added protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope people keep things in perspective,'' McCullough said.
``We're very comfortable with what we're doing. We're doing
everything on our end to ensure a safe environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's local office will set up a command post to monitor
criminal activities over New Year's and will contribute agents to a
Federal Emergency Management Agency command post that opens this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, like many businesses, has limited out-of-town travel
among agents so they will be available.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Police Department plans to call most of its
officers in to work 12-hour shifts throughout the holiday. They
will be deployed throughout the city, not necessarily at
high-profile events.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, field supervisors have randomly
participated in responding to mock critical incidents from Y2K
problems to natural disasters, said Officer Steve Young, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors are asked how they would utilize resources such as
the Missouri Highway Patrol, MAST or the city's public works
department. Police also have met regularly with city and health
officials, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are doing is everything we can to be ready for
anything,'' Young said.

FAMILY SAID TO SETTLE CAR-SEAT SUIT FOR $16 MILLION  
(DW)

<P>
   The family of a 7-year-old boy in Orange County, N.Y.,gwho was
paralyzed after his car seat broke during an accident has settled a
lawsuit for nearly $16 million, their lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sum is believed to be the largest personal injury settlement
for a single plaintiff in state history, said the lawyer, Ed Souto
of Goshen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the boy, Jeremy Griffin, sued the manufacturer,
the Evenflo Co. of Vandalia, Ohio, after the seat broke during an
accident in which the car Jeremy was riding in collided head-on
with another on Sept. 30, 1993. Jeremy, who was seated in the rear
of the car, suffered spinal cord injuries when a harness broke on
the Ultara 1 model car seat. The boy was thrown head first against
the back of the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in September 1996 in State Supreme
Court in Orange County, charged that Evenflo had failed to advise
consumers on the proper way to secure the seat and had known of
potential problems with the seat but did little to alert consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the safety seat has three sets of slots through
which a shoulder harness may be routed. The bottom two slots are
not reinforced with metal, as they are designed for use with
infants and only when the seat is in the rear-facing position. A
problem arises, Souto said, when the safety seat is facing forward,
a position that requires the harness to be routed through the top
slots because they are the only ones reinforced with steel.
</P>
<P>
   The harness on Jeremy's seat had been routed through the middle
slots. The boy, who was a year and a half old at the time of the
accident, is paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   Souto said Evenflo did not recall the seat but altered the
design in later versions. A spokesman for the company could not be
reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Souto said the suit was settled for $15.7 million a few weeks
ago and the settlement was approved Dec. 10.

FCC EXPECTED TO LET 1ST BABY BELL INTO LONG-DISTANCE MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bell Atlantic oj Wednesday will become the first of
the Baby Bell local phone carriers allowed into the $80 billion
long-distance market, signaling a new era of competition in
telecommunications markets, people close to the decision said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the communications industry continues its torrid pace of
consolidation, the announcement expected Wednesday from the Federal
Communications Commission would allow Bell Atlantic, already the
No. 2 local phone company, to expand into a broad new market
covering long-distance services ranging from phone calls to
advanced data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Competition among the big long-distance carriers has decreased
in recent years, with MCI being acquired by Worldcom Inc. and with
the combined MCI Worldcom agreeing to acquire Sprint Corp. While
the announcement expected Wednesday would cover only New York
state, the approval could spearhead a broad invasion of the
long-distance business by other Bells, allowing consumers across
the country to buy local and long-distance services from the same
company.
</P>
<P>
   Approval would mark the first time since the breakup of AT&AMP;T 15
years ago that millions of consumers would be able to get both
local and long distance phone services from an offspring of Ma
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement expected Wednesday would allow Bell Atlantic to
sell long-distance services to the 6.6 million households it serves
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Bell Atlantic said the company planned to
mount a big marketing campaign beginning the first week of January
to promote the company's long-distance service. The company intends
to offer long-distance calling plans with low per-minute rates but
without monthly fees, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has filed with Massachusetts regulators to offer
long-distance services in that state and could file a Massachusetts
application with the FCC within months. Executives close to Bell
Atlantic said Tuesday that the company expected to follow with
applications for Pennsylvania and then New Jersey, and that it
hoped to offer long-distance service in all three states by the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the communications business surges amid a flurry of
mergers, the explosive growth of the Internet and the
popularization of wireless phones, Bell Atlantic's long-distance
victory in New York would mark the beginning of a profound
reshaping of the industry's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, the FCC is expected to allow the Baby
Bells to enter the long-distance market in many states, presenting
AT&AMP;T as well as the other long-distance titans, MCI Worldcom Inc.
and Sprint Corp., which have agreed to merge, with powerful new
competitors who already enjoy relationships with tens of millions
of customers.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc., the largest local phone company, which
does business as Ameritech, Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell, is
expected to ask the FCC as early as the first week of January for
approval to offer long distance in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bells and for regulators, Bell Atlantic's long-distance
approval in New York would mean the beginning of the end of a
regulatory system that emerged as the old American Telephone &AMP;
Telegraph shed its local Bell companies under court supervision in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, it would also represent a major success for the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which Congress enacted largely to
break down regulatory barriers among communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dropping of the barrier keeping the local telephone
companies from the long-distance market is in fact the beginning of
the end of regulation,'' Reed Hundt, who resigned as chairman of
the FCC in 1997, said Tuesday in an interview. ``It's important,
the way that crossing the highest peak in any mountain range is
important. You're going down now, but you still have a long way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the old AT&AMP;T agreed to spin off its local phone operations
as the seven Baby Bells in 1984, the Bells were prohibited from
selling long-distance services, which could have enabled them to
use their local monopolies to extend into a new market.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act, however, said that the Bells would
be allowed into the long-distance market on a state-by-state basis
as they persuaded the FCC that they had opened their local networks
to competitors. The Bells are required to sell access to parts of
their networks, notably the copper lines that run into homes,
because it would be next to impossible for any new local phone
company, no matter how well heeled, to fully replicate the systems
the Bells have spent decades building.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Bell local phone companies, like GTE, which has agreed to
merge with Bell Atlantic, and Southern New England
Telecommunications, which has been acquired by SBC, are also
required to sell access to their systems. But because those
companies were never part of AT&AMP;T, they have been allowed to sell
long-distance services without facing the tests the Bells must
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no Bell has passed. New local phone companies and the
long-distance giants have consistently maintained that the Bells
have hindered their ability to sign up and serve local customers.
Under Hundt and his successor, William Kennard, the FCC has agreed
with that assessment, denying applications in Oklahoma, Illinois,
Louisiana and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic has appeared to go far beyond the other Bells
in taking the steps to open its network in New York. For at least
18 months, the New York Public Service Commission has pressed the
company to open its systems; the negotiations between the company
and the New York regulators delayed Bell Atlantic's federal
long-distance filing for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some legislators who passed the Telecommunications
Act, and even some who voted against it, have voiced impatience
with the FCC for what they see as the slow pace of results from the
act (aside from mergers). They have pressed the FCC to begin
allowing Bells into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's long-distance aspirations took an unexpected
blow last month when the Justice Department, which has an advisory
role in the application process, said the company had not yet
completely opened its network. The Justice Department said the
commission could approve the application subject to conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the process said Tuesday that it was not
likely that the commission would apply major conditions. Instead,
they said, the commission was poised to outline heavy fines that
would be imposed on Bell Atlantic were the company to slow or
reverse its progress in opening its systems.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman and FCC spokeswoman declined to
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that Bell Atlantic's success in New York
could become a template for the other Bells. But Hundt, the former
FCC chairman, said Tuesday that New York could prove to be a
special case.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many consumers in New York may not be aware that
they have a choice of local phone provider, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom
have recently begun to expand their push into the local phone
market in New York. Business customers in New York, especially in
New York City, already enjoy a wide range of options for local
communications.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Bell Atlantic has already paid much of the price
for opening its network. Other Bells in states where competitors
have not already made much progress may have less of an incentive
to open their systems, some analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as important, the long-distance market in New York is
especially lucrative because a large amount of the nation's
international communications begin or end in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that the other Bells, or even Bell Atlantic
outside New York, will want to make the same effort,'' Hundt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the quick pace of consolidation, coupled with the
crumbling of regulatory barriers, may all but ensure that the
communications market of the future is dominated by a handful of
behemoths that compete across myriad markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will have been in everybody else's markets,'' Hundt
said, ``and competition will be self-policing.''

COURT ORDERS A GUARD WHO FLEW THE NAZI FLAG REINSTATED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A corrections officer at a prison in upstate New York who was
suspended three years ago for flying a Nazi flag on his porch
should be reinstated with full back pay and benefits, the state's
top court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the state Court of Appeals in Albany
said that while the behavior of the prison guard, Edward M. Kuhnel,
43, was ``reprehensible,'' the state would have to abide by an
arbitrator's finding in Kuhnel's favor. State officials had agreed
to binding arbitration in the matter two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As abhorrent as Kuhnel's personal conduct is,'' Judge Richard
Wesley wrote for the court, ``judges cannot reject the factual
findings of an arbitrator simply because they do not agree with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhnel, who had worked as a state corrections officer for 18
years, was suspended on Dec. 12, 1996, from his job at the Eastern
Correctional Facility in Napanoch, a maximum-security prison, after
the Middletown Times Herald-Record published a photograph of the
swastika-emblazoned flag flying outside his home in Stone Ridge,
N.Y., about 60 miles south of Albany, said Richard Casagrande, his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Kuhnel raised the flag on Dec. 10,
1996, the 55th anniversary of Hitler's declaration of war on the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhnel's union, the New York State Correctional Officers and
Police Benevolent Association, immediately contested his
suspension, Casagrande said. Based on the terms of the union's
contract with the state, the dispute was submitted to a binding
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, the arbitrator concluded that although Kuhnel's
behavior was not to be condoned, his off-duty conduct would not
disrupt his performance on the job and ordered that he be allowed
to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   State officials appealed the ruling in two lower courts in 1998
and earlier this year, although they paid Kuhnel his yearly salary
of $41,500 during the appeals process. The state contended that
Kuhnel had violated a regulation banning employees of the state
Department of Correctional Services from any behavior that would
reflect badly on the department and that his apparent neo-Nazi
leanings could incite racial problems in the prison. The state lost
in court both times; the appellate court upheld those rulings
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhnel, reached at his home Tuesday, would not discuss the
ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said Tuesday
that the governor believed that it was ``absolutely absurd to allow
this type of hate-mongering in our prison system.'' McKeon added
that state officials would look into ``legislative and
administrative remedies,'' but refused to say what those remedies
might be.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of corrections, Glenn S. Goord, will decide how
to reinstate Kuhnel after he reviews the court ruling, said James
B. Flateau, a spokesman for Goord. But Flateau added, ``The
arbitrator now carries the responsibility for ordering the
department to return an avowed Nazi to a position of authority in a
maximum security prison.''

EX-CHAIRMAN OF INVESTMENT BANK CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change spelling of Marilyn to Marylin in 4th graf.) 
(mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last spring, in the midst of a boom year for
companies going public, the respected investment bank Keefe,
Bruyette &AMP; Woods abruptly scrubbed its plans for a stock offering _
and refused to say why.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the mystery was solved. Federal prosecutors in
Manhattan charged the firm's former chairman, James McDermott, with
insider trading in a bizarre case in which he was accused of
leaking information about potential billion-dollar bank deals to an
X-rated-movie actress he was dating.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, who lived in the world of sky-high Wall Street
salaries, is not accused of making any illegal profits himself. In
fact, all the suspected illegal profits were paltry indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, Kathryn Gannon, was accused of illegally earning
$88,000 stemming from trades based on inside information provided
by McDermott about six bank mergers, all involving the firm's
clients. She was described by the government as an escort, exotic
dancer and actress in adult movies who uses the screen name Marylin
Star. The trades were made in 1997 and 1998, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gannon, 30, was also accused of passing information about
the deals to a New Jersey businessman, Anthony Pomponio, 45.
Pomponio was charged with making $86,000 in illegal trading
profits, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for someone of McDermott's generation, who lived
through the high-profile insider-trading cases of the '80s, to face
such a charge, said Thomas Newkirk, a high SEC official.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors revealed in the criminal complaint that Keefe,
Bruyette had canceled its offering in June after McDermott, who is
married, disclosed to its directors that a friend of his _ he did
not name Ms. Gannon at the time _ was under investigation by the
SEC for trading in stocks he had recommended to her.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was expected to raise $85 million, documents show,
and McDermott, whose salary was nearly $4 million, stood to
increase his stake to roughly $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott also resigned at the firm's request, and as part of
his severance agreement, both he and Keefe, Bruyette agreed not to
comment on his resignation, the complaint said. The firm said he
was leaving for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McDermott remained silent, entering no plea, as
federal Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz told him of his rights, and
ordered him released on $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, one of his lawyers, Denis McInerney, sharply
criticized the prosecution, saying that McDermott had been unaware
of the criminal investigation until Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McDermott is shocked by the government's action today,''
McInerney said. ``The government has never asked to speak to Mr.
McDermott, or reached out to his attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that the government chose to proceed in this fashion
without having the benefit of hearing from Mr. McDermott,''
McInerney continued. ``We will respond to the allegations in due
course, and are confident that Mr. McDermott will be exonerated
when the facts are known.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gannon, a resident of Miami, was believed to be in Canada,
where she is from, said the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan. A warrant has been issued for her arrest.
Her lawyer did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio, of North Caldwell, N.J., was released on $50,000 bond.
His lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said his client would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says that Pomponio told the SEC that Ms. Gannon
frequently boasted to him that ``she fraternized with individuals
who worked on Wall Street, and that her clientele included
high-powered investment bankers and lawyers on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said that McDermott's relationship with Ms.
Gannon lasted about 14 months, and that he had told her of six
upcoming deals. They involved Sun Trust, National Australia Bank,
Central Fidelity Banks, First Commerce, First Commercial and
California State Bank (West Covina).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gannon and Pomponio opened brokerage accounts, the
government said. She bought securities in advance of all the deals,
and he in five.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the complaint said, Ms. Gannon bought 1,800 shares
of the stock of Barnett Banks of Miami after she learned from
McDermott that Sun Trust was seeking to acquire it. A few days
later, on Aug. 29, 1997, Barnett stock surged 24 percent after it
was announced that it was being taken over by Nationsbank instead.
Ms. Gannon sold her Barnett stock for a profit of $30,400.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the investigation put an abrupt halt to Keefe,
Bruyette's ambitious plans, the new charges show.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, May 6, its executives and their investment bankers
were wrapping up plans to take the firm public. More than 4.7
million shares were scheduled to be priced the following Monday and
sold to investors before the market opened Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At a proposed price of about $18 a share, the offering would
have raised about $85 million for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But in a hastily called meeting that Thursday, McDermott told
the other directors that he had a personal problem that might
affect the offering. On Sunday, he told them more, the complaint
said, and the directors decided to cancel the offering.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that McDermott revealed that the SEC was
investigating stock trades made by a friend based on information he
had passed on. But, they contend, McDermott said that the
information was not confidential, and he described the profits the
friend had made as $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever McDermott told the board that day was a closely guarded
secret for six months. Many people were curious about the unusual
last-minute cancellation and McDermott's subsequent resignation on
June 30 after 21 years at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's other officials did nothing to squelch
speculation that the sale was withdrawn in favor of a plan to sell
the firm to another company.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Harry Keefe, one founder, knew why his former protege
left. Keefe, now in his 70s and long gone from Keefe, Bruyette,
said he hired McDermott as a bank-stock analyst and eventually
promoted him to director of research. Keefe said he helped make
McDermott one of the most-quoted bank analysts in the country by
insisting that only McDermott could field calls from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe said he found out about the charges when one trader at his
money-management firm read out a newswire headline that said
``Former CEO of Keefe Bruyette charged with insider trading.'' He
said he was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing more, he said: ``I'm heartbroken. My name's on the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation grew out of an SEC inquiry into trading of the
stock of Barnett Banks, said Newkirk, the SEC's associate director
of enforcement. The commission has already brought an enforcement
action against two young men who worked on Wall Street over their
trading of Barnett stock.
</P>
<P>
   That case reinforced the SEC's theory that the insider trading
of the 1990s was done by people too young to have learned the
lessons of the high-profile insider prosecutions of the 1980s. But
this case, Newkirk said, is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody that was in this business in the 1980s should have
known better,'' he said of McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Newkirk said he found it ``shocking and dismaying'' that a chief
executive of an investment bank would get caught up in an
insider-trading case.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Keefe, Bruyette said, ``KBW has always
prided itself as having the highest ethical standards, and we have
long had strict policies in place regarding the handling of
confidential information.'' It went on to say, ``KBW has not been
charged with any wrongdoing and we are cooperating with the
authorities in their investigation of Mr. McDermott.''
</P>
<P>
   David Berry, a director, said that these events had not hurt the
firm's business. He said the firm has talked with other companies
that showed interest in buying Keefe, Bruyette but that no such
talks are going on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might imagine when an IPO gets pulled, the phone does
ring,'' he said, but added, ``The firm is not trying to be sold.''

JOE HIGGS, REGGAE PERFORMER WHO TAUGHT A GENERATION OF SINGERS,
DIES AT 59  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Jamaica )   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Higgs, the mentor to a generation of socially conscious
reggae singers, died on Saturday at Kaiser Hospital in Los Angeles.
He was 59 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his biographer, Roger Steffens.
</P>
<P>
   Higgs sang, wrote songs and taught singing and stagecraft to
major performers including Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley and the
Wailers. As a singer, he brought a streak of jazz syncopation to
reggae rhythms, and he was a strong proponent of songs that held
messages about faith and resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggae is a confrontational sound,'' he said in ``Roots Rock
Reggae'' a 1977 documentary film by Jeremy Marre. ``Freedom _
that's what it's asking for. Acceptance _ that's what it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgs grew up in Kingston, Jamaica. He made his first single,
``Oh Manny Oh,'' in a duo, Higgs and Wilson, with Roy Wilson, in
1960, and it sold 50,000 copies. It was one of the first records
pressed in Jamaica; its label, West Indian Records, was owned by
Edward Seaga, who became prime minister in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In Mr. Higgs's yard in Kingston's Trench Town area, he began
tutoring Marley as a singer and performer in 1959 and worked with
other members of the Wailers, including Bunny Wailer and Peter
Tosh, as the group began recording in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 Higgs won Jamaica's Tourist Song competition with
``Invitation to Jamaica,'' receiving a trip to New York for his
first American performances. When Bunny Wailer left the Wailers in
1973 Higgs replaced him for an American tour. He wrote ``Stepping
Razor,'' which became Tosh's signature song.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s Higgs was the band leader for Cliff, touring
internationally and recording duets with him, including ``Sound of
the City'' and ``Sons of Garvey.'' He also made his first album,
``Life of Contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgs continued to record in Jamaica. In 1983 ``So It Go,''
which protested the plight of the poor, was banned from radio
airplay, and he could not get bookings to perform. He went to Los
Angeles, where he remained in self-imposed exile. He tutored
American-based reggae musicians and toured North America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Wailers band accompanied Higgs on his 1990 album ``Blackman
Know Yourself.'' Recently he had been working at U2s Dublin studio
on ``Green on Black,'' a collaboration between reggae musicians and
Celtic performers.
</P>
<P>
   Higgs is survived by 12 children, among them a daughter, Marcia
Higgs, a rapper, and a son, Peter, a studio guitarist.

JACKSON CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Extended winning streaks. A league-best record. An
MVP candidate. Dominance at home. Success on the road.
</P>
<P>
   To the world, the Los Angeles Lakers are looking a lot like NBA
championship material. Even now, in late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this week,'' coach Phil Jackson said of his team's
readiness to win a title. ``I think we've improved a lot, and I
think if we continue to improve in the next couple months, we're
going to be a pretty good team.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, they already are.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of seven-game winning streaks (with one loss sandwiched
in between) has given them a 22-5 record _ the Lakers' best start
since the 1985-86 team went 24-3. Through Monday's games, no other
NBA team had more than 18 wins.
</P>
<P>
   At this pace, the Lakers would win 67 games, and Shaquille
O'Neal would nearly be a shoo-in for MVP. A championship would be a
realistic expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a team that has that kind of ability,''
Jackson said. ``I'm still amazed at some players, like A.C. Green
and Rob Horry, doing a great job, kind of a tandem-team at the
(power forward), a spot where we're supposed to be weak. And we're
getting great performances out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm impressed with Glen Rice's every-night experience out
there. He has an occasional off night, but he's been great. And
Shaq and Kobe (Bryant) have been terrific, and we're finding a way
to make point guard with Harp (Ron Harper) and Fish (Derek Fisher)
work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a really good defensive team, simply because we
make teams shoot jumpshots, and we're cleaning up the boards.
Shaq's done a great job rebounding, and that's been a difference
for us. We're not giving up fast-break points a lot, except maybe
in turnover situations. That's been the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be really good later on. I don't know how good we can
be, but I think we're pretty stagnant at times.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they're not getting carried away with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have any expectations, that's how were
playing,'' Bryant said. ``Our attitude is just taking it game by
game and that's all we're doing _ OK, we've got this game, knock it
down, then go into San Antonio, see if we can knock that down.
We're playing it one game at a time, that's all we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Down time: After playing four road games in five days and five
games in seven days, the Lakers get a bit of a break.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday, they go four days without a game before
playing the defending-champion Spurs on Christmas day at Staples
Center. They'll only practice every other day until then.
</P>
<P>
   After playing the Spurs, Dallas (Dec. 27) and Phoenix (Dec. 29),
all at Staples, the Lakers will get a five-day break. That means
they'll play just three games in a 14-day span. They won't travel
again until a Jan. 8 game at Seattle.

PATAKI AND ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATS COMPROMISE ON LOBBY LAW
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and the Democratic majority in
the state Assembly agreed Tuesday night on a measure to tighten the
state's lobbying law, forging an unusual alliance on an issue that
has put lawmakers on the defensive in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The measure features several new provisions, including a
requirement that lobbyists in counties and some municipalities
disclose their activities for the first time. But the two sides
declined to adopt major new restrictions on the gifts that
lawmakers can accept from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The measure received a cool reception from the Republican
majority in the state Senate, whose members took a pledge last week
to refuse most gifts from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also unanimously passed its own lobbying measure,
setting up a clash among the two houses and the governor that could
throw the regulation of lobbyists into disarray. The current law
expires at the end of the month. The propriety of accepting the
gifts has become a flash point in the talks over the lobbying law
because of reports about the extensive efforts by Philip Morris,
the cigarette giant, to win favor in the Legislature by treating
members to meals and other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, lawmakers are prohibited from accepting gifts
of $75 or more if it can be reasonably inferred that the gifts were
intended to influence. The new measure would prohibit gifts of $75
or more, doing away with the need to determine intent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between Pataki and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, represents a surprising turn of events because the
Republican governor typically works closely with the Senate
majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, an upstate Republican. But the
lobbying issue has created tensions between all three.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the provision regulating local lobbying, the
measure supported by the governor and Silver would give the state
lobbying commission the authority to conduct random audits of
lobbyists' records, increase penalties for violations of the law
and impore more disclosure requirements on lobbyists and clients.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would not require more reporting of lobbying of
state agencies, a move backed by Bruno but opposed by Pataki.
Pataki said in a statement that the measure represented ``real
reform that will build public confidence in our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said it would ``help restore the public's trust in
government.'' After the measure was announced, Bruno declined to
comment on its content, other than to say that the Senate would not
act on it at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, an expert on the lobbying law and legislative
director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, called
the measure inadequate. ``The bad news is the stunning absence of
any agency lobbying and a gift ban,'' Horner said. ``We're shocked
that the Assembly refuses to give up the goodies from lobbyists,
and we can't understand why the governor doesn't want the public to
know who's lobbying the state agencies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The leaders of both houses had planned to renew the current weak
lobbying law without any changes, but they were pressured into
strengthening the law by the disclosures about Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   In July, The New York Times reported that a lobbyist for Philip
Morris had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on gifts, like
expensive meals and theater tickets, for at least 115 current and
former legislators. The lobbyist, Sharon T. Portnoy, had failed to
report much of that spending to the lobbying commission, in
violation of state law. Philip Morris later agreed to pay a $75,000
fine, the largest in the commission's history, and Ms. Portnoy paid
a $15,000 fine and was banned from lobbying in New York for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was the first to respond with a plan, proposing a ban on
gifts worth more than $25, though with several exceptions and a
rule generally prohibiting lawmakers from accepting meals from
lobbyists. His plan also would have extended the disclosure rules
to lobbying of state agencies for contracts, an area of vast
expenditure that is now beyond public scrutiny, and to lobbying of
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats questioned Bruno's sincerity in proposing his
bill, which Silver rejected outright, Bruno said the Senate
Republicans would voluntarily abide by its provisions, and even
make them the official rules of the chamber. The Senate Democrats
quickly followed suit, increasing the pressure on Silver and the
Assembly to take action.

NO FOUL PLAY SEEN IN DEATH OF YALE SENIOR FOUND IN RIVER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Conn.)   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The death of a Yale University senior whose body was
found in the Harlem River last month was not the result of foul
play, university officials and the New Haven, Conn., police said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Norris, 21, an economics major from Omaha, disappeared
from the New Haven campus midway through the fall semester. After a
fruitless search in Connecticut, the authorities retrieved his body
on Nov. 16 on the Bronx shoreline. He was identified late last week
with dental X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case was being handled as a missing-person case, and now
that he has been identified it will be closed out,'' said Douglas
P. MacDonald, assistant chief of the New Haven Police Department.
``It is not being handled as a criminal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris was last seen on Oct. 31. Railroad workers in New Haven
reported early that morning that he was acting strangely in a train
station. They called the New Haven police, who arrived and found
him on the platform, apparently under the influence of either drugs
or alcohol, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers coaxed him into an ambulance that took him to
Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was treated in the emergency room and
checked himself out, said Kenneth Best, a spokesman for the
hospital. Best declined to elaborate on Norris' care.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Norris' family became concerned and notified the
university. ``His parents reported him missing when they couldn't
contact him,'' said Thomas P. Conroy, a Yale University spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, the police searched in New Haven and at Yale,
interviewing students and faculty members. On Nov. 11, The Yale
Daily News, the campus newspaper, reported that Norris had left two
letters _ one for his ister, one for his parents _ in his
university suite before he disappeared. The contents of the letters
have not been publicly disclosed, and Norris' mother declined to
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   How and why Norris traveled to New York remained unknown
Tuesday. The police said only that his body was spotted by a
Metropolitan Transportation Authority foreman in mid-November and
retrieved from the river by the crew of a police harbor patrol
vessel. It remained unidentified in a city morgue for weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an open letter to the Yale student body on Monday, Richard H.
Brodhead, dean of Yale College, wrote that Norris' body had been
found. ``This is a grievous loss to our community,'' he wrote.
``I'm sure that you join me in extending our love and prayers to
Greg's family at this painful time.'' Although the New York medical
examiner's office said Tuesday that it had not determined the cause
of Norris' death, Brodhead's letter said that the ``police report
that there were no signs of foul play.''  &QL;

UCLA BEATS MAINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAIE, Hawaii _ The UCLA Bruins debuted Tuesday on Oahu's famed
North Shore, home of Sunset Beach and the Banzai Pipeline, and they
brought along a slew of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Barnes, rescued from academic suspension at the
last minute, made his first appearance of the season. Earl Watson
actually played like a point guard, passing first and shooting
second, and the Bruins unveiled dark blue, road-only uniforms with
a snazzy script ``UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise of all was their inspired play.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the opponent is Santa Clara or Vanderbilt, whether the
place is Maui or Anchorage, UCLA has a history of lethargic
performances in these early-season tournaments. (It hasn't won one
since the 1990 Great Alaska Shootout.)
</P>
<P>
   But the No. 18 Bruins were in fine form Tuesday, running and
dunking and overpowering Maine with a 83-62 victory in the first
round of the Pearl Harbor Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Steve Lavin) told us that UCLA has gone to tournaments
in Maui and Alaska and Puerto Rico and not played well,'' Bruins
forward Rico Hines said. ``We've been lackadaisical in the past,
and our junior class has never won a tournament. We stressed all
week that we had to come here and execute on offense and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins broke the game open with a 33-7 surge midway through
the first half. Reserve guard Ryan Bailey was the catalyst, just as
he was against DePaul. He checked in with UCLA trailing 12-10 and
immediately found Watson on an alley-oop. Ten minutes later, UCLA's
margin was 41-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bailey) gave us a real lift in the first half,'' Lavin said.
``I told him I would have gotten him more minutes (he played 17),
but with a comfortable lead I didn't want to push it with his
(tendonitis).''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey joined Watson and Ray Young to give the Bruins a
three-guard attack. They pressed and trapped and unleashed the fast
break. The Black Bears happily complied by shooting quick and
playing fast _ a style custom-made for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely today's opponent, Colorado State, will let the
Bruins play at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally took us out of anything we wanted to do with our
offensive structure,'' said Maine coach John Giannini, whose team
shot 32.1 percent in the first half. ``It was very difficult to run
our offense. I couldn't have been more impressed with their defense
in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half was another matter. With a 20-point lead, the
Bruins got sloppy. Their shooting deteriorated and their defense
wilted as Maine shot 55.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happened against Gonzaga,'' Lavin said. ``We're
trying to avoid that and get them to play with sustained intensity
for 40 minutes. We just lost concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   The sloppy second half failed to overshadow several impressive
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Maine power forward Nate Fox, who plays like Stanford's Mark
Madsen but looks like Steve Forbes, led all scorers with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA forward Jason Kapono, who's one-fourth Hawaiian, made 3 of
4 shots from 3-point range and once again played a deft floor game.
When he's not on the court, it's noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Big men Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric dominated the smaller
Black Bears, combining for 29 points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes had eight points and a career-high 10 rebounds in 10
minutes, although his rebound total is debatable. (The local
statisticians, overwhelmed by the pace, initially credited Kapono
with 21 minutes played in the first half.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt exceeded my expectations in terms of how quickly he
appeared comfortable at both ends of the floor,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's makeover was remarkable. After poor decision-making and
horrendous shooting (4 of 24) against Gonzaga and DePaul, he
finally played like a point guard. The tempo probably helped _
Watson's always more comfortable in chaos _ and perhaps Bailey's
pass-first approach is resonating.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Watson did not attempt a shot until 3:44
remained in the first half, and he finished with 10 assists and two
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked in general terms about wanting to move the ball
quicker,'' Lavin said. ``As the point guard, Earl understands it
begins with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Watson does it against a disciplined team like Colorado
State _ not to mention Arizona and Stanford _ remains to be seen.
But for one balmy afternoon on the North Shore, the Bruins had
reason to smile.

STATE DEPARTMENT INTENSIFIES WARNING ON TERRORISM
</HEADLINE>
  (With TERROR-ARREST, TERROR-BORDER, TERROR-VERMONT) 
(nk)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department intensified its alert Tuesday
night for Americans traveling overseas, warning that terrorists may
be planning attacks against large groups in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that official Americans and ordinary
citizens alike should be cautious, and that groups gathered for
religious services or to commemorate the new millennium might be at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The department's alert was similar to one issued on Dec. 11 but
considerably more specific, especially in its references to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that possible sites in Jordan may have
included hotels, tour buses and tourist sites,'' the latest
advisory said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the advisory did not say where the department got its
information, it seemed all but certain that much of it came from
the questioning by Jordanian authorities of 13 suspected terrorists
who were arrested in recent weeks in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said the suspects had
links to Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi-born militant who is
blamed for the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in
August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's State Department advisory followed an
acknowledgment by Pentagon officials that American military posts
around the world had been warned to be extra careful.
</P>
<P>
   The latest alert suggested that Americans abroad check the State
Department Web site for advisories. And while it used low-key
language and did not advise against travel, it warned Americans
overseas to review their own security practices, to avoid large
crowds and to vary their routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rule out the possibility that attacks still may be
planned for this and other parts of the world,'' the alert said,
referring to Jordan.

EX-STUDENT TO GET NEW TRIAL IN INTERNET SEX-ASSAULT CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An appellate court Tuesday ordered a new trial for a
Columbia University graduate student who was convicted in 1998 of
kidnapping, torturing and sexually abusing a Barnard College
student he had met over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the trial judge had wrongly invoked the state's
rape shield law to bar explicit e-mail messages the woman wrote to
the man before they met.
</P>
<P>
   The former doctoral student, Oliver Jovanovic, 32, has always
maintained that his encounter with the woman, then 20, was
consensual. He has served 20 months of a 15-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who could appeal the decision to the state's
highest court, the State Court of Appeals, declined to comment on
the ruling Tuesday. It was unclear whether Jovanovic's accuser, who
spent six days on the witness stand in the trial, would be willing
to testify again. Legal experts said they had not yet had time to
review the decision and could not say what effect it would have on
the use of the shield law in other rape cases.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1975, the law was intended to encourage rape victims
to come forward by restricting which aspects of their sexual
history could be made public by defense lawyers in a trial. For
example, the law states that evidence of an extramarital affair is
irrelevant at a rape trial. But other sexual conduct, such as a
prior sexual relationship between the accuser and the accused, can
be presented to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Judge David B. Saxe of the State
Supreme Court harshly criticized Justice William A. Wetzel's
decision to use the law to prevent the jury from seeing four e-mail
messages the woman sent to Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the highly intimate nature of some of this
information,'' Saxe wrote, ``the statements, as a practical matter,
should be viewed as the equivalent of `prior sexual conduct with
the accused.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was not meant to undermine the rape shield law, the
ruling said. But in a dissenting opinion, Judge Angela M.
Mazzarelli warned that the ruling would make it easier for defense
lawyers to sully the reputations of rape victims. He said the
ruling ``would only serve to turn the clock back to the days when
the main defense to any such charge was to malign the
complainant.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority held that Jovanovic's trial had been unfair.
Saxe said the trial judge's failure to admit the e-mail messages as
evidence or to allow defense lawyers to ask the young woman about
sadomasochistic relationships she may have had, had an ``enormous''
impact on Jovanovic's ability to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling included the e-mail messages; in one, sent two
days before the attack, the woman wrote Jovanovic that she was
dating a sadomasochist. ``Now I'm his slave,'' she wrote, ``and
it's painful, but the fun of telling my friends `Hey, I'm a
sadomasochist' more than outweighs the torment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent e-mail, the woman responded affirmatively to a
question from Jovanovic about whether she was ``submissive.'' In
another, she used the slang term for a submissive partner in a
sadomasochistic relationship to describe herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the case stood, Jovanovic was precluded not only from
bringing out the degree to which the complainant seemed to be
inviting sadomasochism,'' the judge wrote, but from exploring the
possibility that she was ``a less-reliable narrator of events than
she appeared to be at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of Jovanovic's, who have lobbied for a
reversal of his conviction, hailed the ruling as long overdue
justice. Sabina Jovanovic, his mother, said she had spoken with her
son Tuesday and hoped to have him home for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very much relieved, just relieved and happy that this
one stage is over,'' she said. ``It's been a trip to hell and
back.'' The case stirred debate about the safety of anonymous
meetings over the Internet. According to his accuser, Jovanovic
lured the woman on a date after an extended e-mail correspondence,
tied her to a futon in his Washington Heights apartment, and
tortured her for more than 20 hours. The woman said Jovanovic had
threatened to kill her, bit her until she bled, burned her with wax
and beat her with a stick. But Jack Litman, a defense lawyer,
accused her of making up a story about what was a consensual sexual
encounter.

HILLARY CLINTON SEEKS NEW SEX AND VIOLENCE RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OYSTER BAY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday called for
scrapping the existing array of entertainment rating systems and
replacing it with a uniform system intended to warn parents about
sex and violence in video games, movies, television and music.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, a candidate for U.S. senator from New York,
condemned the ``culture of violence'' that she said infused some
video games and other forms of entertainment aimed at children, and
said it was a cause of the recent rash of shootings involving
teen-agers. The first lady said that parents trying to guard their
children against such violence or sex in entertainment were being
frustrated by the disjointed voluntary rating systems now in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an epidemic of violence in our country, and the
violence is everywhere,'' Mrs. Clinton told parents and children at
a forum in Oyster Bay. ``A parent who is a conscientious parent,
looking for information about what to do, is totally confused.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate her point, Mrs. Clinton began reading the
different ratings used for movies, cable television, video games
and music. The audience laughed as Mrs. Clinton rambled through the
various combinations of letters and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings should be the same,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the issue, Mrs. Clinton took a page from one of the
most successful tactics of President Clinton's 1996 campaign for
re-election, in which he embraced issues that captured the interest
of middle-class voters, but offered few specific proposals beyond
identifying the problem, thus minimizing political risk.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said that she was not endorsing mandatory rating
systems that some congressmen have proposed, though her spokesman,
Howard Wolfson, later said the first lady was not ruling out
supporting such legislation. Instead, Mrs. Clinton said the
industry should move to adopt regulations on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's idea came under quick attack. Carolyn Rausch, the
senior vice president for the Interactive Digital Software
Association, representing manufacturers and publishers of video
games, said her group would vigorously oppose such a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' she said. ``Consumers are
well aware of the existing rating system. Implementing a totally
new system, where they have to learn a whole new run of new letters
and numbers, will only lead to confusion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican opponent, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, declined to comment on the first
lady's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same event here, Mrs. Clinton also appeared to signal her
displeasure with an appellate court's decision to move the trial of
four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou
Diallo from the Bronx to Albany, citing a potentially prejudicial
atmosphere. Giuliani has applauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate that the trial, apparently for legal
reasons, had to be moved,'' Mrs. Clinton said during a brief news
conference here. She ended the news conference without taking
further questions on the topic, and her aides declined to say
whether she actually was disagreeing with the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   In her comments on violence, Mrs. Clinton urged more parental
involvement to protect their children, saying: ``We could save a
lot of children's lives if all of us were not embarrassed to call
any parent whose child plays with our child and say, `Do you have
guns in your home? And if you do have guns, where do you keep them?
Are they under lock and key?'''
</P>
<P>
   She also asked how many people had visited a video arcade.
``It's a very revealing and sobering experience,'' Mrs. Clinton
said. ``I couldn't help but be upset when I read about the two boys
from Columbine being obsessed with the game Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady found her arguments challenged from an
unexpected source _ Ben Levine, a poised, 14-year-old student who
appeared with her on a panel. He first said that a good student who
``really thinks about things before he does them'' was not about to
be turned astray by a James Bond game. The boy then asked what the
Clintons had done to keep tabs on what Chelsea Clinton played, a
question that stopped Mrs. Clinton, but only for a moment. ``I have
to say one of the best things about Bill being president is that
she was surrounded by Secret Service agents,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, though, Ben returned with a question that seemed
to stump even the first lady: ``Would you rather have a kid being
at a movie that is `R' rated, or would you rather have him at a
party doing drugs, getting drunk and getting arrested?'' he asked.
Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the question with a smile and a nod. She
than called on someone else to speak.

COLUMN: WELCOMING DIALLO CASE TO ALBANY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Since last week, when Albany was named the future
site of the trial of four officers charged with murdering Amadou
Diallo, most analysis has focused on whether a jury drawn from an
overwhelmingly white county will be more sympathetic to the
officers than a Bronx jury would have been.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the city of Albany, where about 20 percent of the
104,000 residents are members of minority groups, residents wonder
how the trial and the inevitable protests surrounding it will
affect a debate over how to deal with allegations of homegrown
police abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders and politicians in this city's minority
neighborhoods have tried for years to focus attention on what they
say is police abuse of African-Americans. Last month, police
officers searching for a suspect in the shooting of two fellow
officers were accused of manhandling a poor neighborhood, using
racist language and roughing up residents on the street. A grocery
store surveillance camera appeared to have captured police officers
shoving and kicking one person and pushing a man in handcuffs
against a store window. The tape was broadcast repeatedly on local
television.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the search in the neighborhood, Arbor Hill,
drew quick responses. Four officers face disciplinary charges and
support has grown for the formation of a civilian board to
investigate allegations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's neighborhood leaders and minority politicians had
gotten the attention they wanted on police conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, with the Diallo decision, they had much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is perfect for the city of Albany,'' said Carolyn
McLaughlin, a city councilwoman who sponsored a civilian review
board proposal. It's unfortunate that Diallo's family will have to
travel here for the trial, she said, but added, ``I think we're
going to see things, hear some things that will wake up this whole
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Mair, president of an Arbor Hill neighborhood group,
called the Diallo case ``an object lesson of what we can expect if
we don't correct the current situation.'' Yet, he said, he's
concerned that blurring of the local debate and the Diallo road
show led by the Rev. Al Sharpton could hurt. ``If they do the New
York City rant and rave, you're going to lose the whole
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, Albany is the last outpost before New
York's North Country, a city where lobbyists and legislators swarm
around a castle-like Capitol and all other signs of life are frozen
in the stories of William Kennedy and the lore of the Corning
dynasty. But inside the ornate chamber of the Common Council on
Monday night, at a hearing on the police proposals, a side of
Albany was on display that echoes the angry rhetoric heard in many
cities and towns with significant minority populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Albany Police Department's relationship with
African-Americans is replete with stories, incidents and events
that indicate a clear pattern of disrespect, misunderstanding,
discrimination and racism,'' the Rev. H. Ward Greer, of the
African-American Clergy United for Empowerment, told the council.
Speakers invoked past cases, including the 1984 police killing of
an unarmed, mentally handicapped black man, which remains a
rallying point for critics.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for a civilian complaint board have come and gone over
the years, but now the possibility seems greater. It is not lost on
officials here that New York City has both a civilian board and the
Diallo case, but they say a well-designed board can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, who previously opposed the idea, set
up a panel to review proposals. He said citizens need to feel their
complaints about the police would be heard, although he said he did
not favor the proposal to give a civilian board subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor defended the police, both in general, and in their
behavior in Arbor Hill. ``We had two officers shot,'' he said.
``They had to sweep a neighborhood and look for an unarmed man.''
But he said officers who are overly aggressive will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped for little overlap between the Diallo trial and
the local debate. He said he thought Albany would stay focused on
its concerns. As for the Diallo protests, he said he called
Sharpton last week and was reassured. ``He said, `I have nothing
against your city,''' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday Sharpton said he was eager to know more about the
debate in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the first things we'll look at,'' he
said.

OLD NETS RESURFACE AGAINST TORONTO, SELFISH AND SOFT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Stephon Marbury was shaking his head as the horn
welcomed him back into what had ceased being a game, oh, about five
minutes after it started.
</P>
<P>
   Was he upset that Coach Don Casey had kept him out of action
from the end of the first quarter until there was only 4 minutes 23
seconds left in the first half of the Nets' 116-87 thrashing at the
hands of the Toronto Raptors? Or was he bothered that he had to go
back in to play what amounted to 28 minutes of garbage time, with
the Nets trailing by 24 points?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear; it didn't matter. After a stretch of decent
play against some lesser lights, the old Nets, the selfish, soft
ones, were back with a vengeance in Toronto Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played terrible tonight,'' a frustrated Marbury said
afterward. ``There's no excuse for tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he surprised that the ugly Nets had reared their heads again
after their recent run of six victories in eight starts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only won eight games,'' he said. ``We didn't win 15 in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury did not sound surprised at all by the turn of events.
``We beat teams coming off four games in five nights, teams that
were struggling,'' he said. ``We haven't beat a contender yet. We
haven't established ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly not. The Nets may be concerned that any of their good
work may have been undone. Casey had cause to keep Marbury, his
mercurial everything guard, on the sidelines for an extended
first-half rest. By the time Marbury had checked but in the first
place, the Nets were trailing by 43-24, their worst defensive
effort for one quarter this season.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Marbury had played out the second quarter, they were
down by 75-45 and had allowed the Raptors their best offensive
output for a half this season.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto (14-11) shot a stunning 65.2 percent for the half and
connected on four of five from beyond the 3-point line. Toronto's
Vince Carter had 24 points to lead all scorers, and Doug Christie
chipped in with 20 in only 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to us,'' Casey said. ``But I know
they had a lot to do with it. They were in such a comfort zone,
they had a nice flow and a nice rhythm and we couldn't do anything
to disrupt it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' misery was shared across the box score. While Johnny
Newman managed 22 points off the bench, providing a brief spark,
and Jamie Feick continued his determined play, notching 12 points
and 12 rebounds, 6 of them on the offensive glass, the team
statistics were grim.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McIlvaine, the Nets' starting center, had to leave the game
after a collision with Carter's elbow early in the first quarter.
He was found to have a mild concussion and taken to Toronto Western
Hospital for observation, although it was not considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the lucky one,'' Casey said. ``He didn't have to watch
the massacre.''  &QL;

EVEN WITHOUT HASEK, SABRES NO MATCH FOR PUNCHLESS RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the past, the Rangers could have blamed their
inability to defeat Buffalo on Dominik Hasek. Tuesday night the
Sabres demonstrated that it does not matter who protects their
goal.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12th consecutive time over three-plus seasons, the
Rangers proved no match for the younger, faster Sabres, who carved
out a convincing 3-1 victory at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie goaltender Martin Biron dominated this game from the
beginning of the second period to the end, making 28 saves. He was
helped by Curtis Brown's power-play goal midway through the second,
Miroslav Satan's tally at 7 minutes 8 seconds of the third period
and Dixon Ward's short-handed deflection two and a half minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is 8-0-4 in its last 12 games against the Rangers and
5-0-2 in its last seven at the Garden. The Rangers have not
defeated the Sabres at home since Oct. 27, 1996, and they have not
beaten Buffalo at all since Dec. 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could not pick up any ground on the Sabres or the
rest of the Eastern Conference, mustering only Mike Knuble's
power-play goal with 5:35 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, which has struggled this season in defending its
conference crown, was playing without Hasek, out indefinitely with
a severe groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that his team was losing control of the game, Rangers
Coach John Muckler used his only timeout 3:49 into the second
period. At the time, the game was scoreless and the move seemed
curious. But Muckler's feeling was correct; the momentum had
shifted to Buffalo. But no matter how loudly Muckler yelled at his
players during the timeout, the Sabres kept control all period
long.
</P>
<P>
   They outshot the Rangers by 14-6 in the second and scored the
game's first goal 12:08 into the period. It belonged to Brown and
came from the Sabres' power play that has been even more
ineffective than the Rangers'. Buffalo came into the game with the
worst unit in the National Hockey League, scoring at a rate of only
8.8 percent. The Sabres were 0 for their last 31, 1 for the last 47
and had not scored a power-play goal in their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were already 0 for 2 Tuesday night when Jason Woolley
tossed a wrist shot on net from the right point with Mathieu
Schneider in the penalty box for holding the talented rookie right
wing Maksim Afinogenov. The penalty was the third whistled on
Schneider; the other two had negated Rangers power plays.
</P>
<P>
   This time, all Schneider could do was watch from the box as
Brown chopped at the puck just in front of Mike Richter's catching
glove. Brown's timing was perfect. He had eased himself behind Rich
Pilon, right in front of the goal mouth. Brown then deflected the
puck perfectly, straight down, right through Richter's legs. The
goal withstood a video replay to see if Brown's stick had been too
high when he touched the puck.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, and Buffalo led, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   That was the score after two periods. It easily could have been
1-1. But with the teams skating 4-on-4 midway through the first
period, Alexandre Daigle missed an open net after he had pounced on
a loose puck in the offensive zone. After Daigle deked Biron out of
position, he should have had a gimme. Instead, Daigle's uncontested
backhand from low in the slot went wide left. And the Rangers had
missed out on a golden chance at a goal.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was fairly even (Buffalo 11 had shots, the
Rangers 10) but in the second Buffalo had a decided advantage. The
score would have been far worse than 1-0 if not for the play of
Richter, who had 24 saves; the right post, which stopped a Brian
Campbell shot; and Pilon, who made a head-first save of a Satan
shot at the left post with Richter on his back and out of position.

LEO P. CARLIN, A FORMER MAYOR OF NEWARK, DIES AT 91

<P>
   Leo P. Carlin, Democratic mayor of Newark, N.J., from 1953 to
1962 who was the city's first mayor in modern times to be chosen by
its electorate, died on Friday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   He died at his home in Avon-by-the-Sea, N.J., where he had lived
year-round since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin became Newark's mayor after serving as a New Jersey state
assemblyman, as president of Newark's Board of Education and as the
longtime president of Local 478 of what was then called the
Brotherhood of Teamsters and Chauffeurs.
</P>
<P>
   He originally became mayor under Newark's old city commission
government system, which was organized in 1917 under the terms of a
piece of legislation known as the Walsh Act. But he was a prominent
advocate of changing to a system with a stronger mayor and a
nine-member municipal council.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1953, he and four other candidates were elected to the
City Commission, then the city's governing body. He led a field of
26 candidates seeking the five commission posts. Then, he began
serving his second four-year term as a commissioner and was
unanimously chosen as mayor by fellow commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, he served as the board's chairman, but under the
rules of the old city commission system, his mayoral post that has
been called that of a figurehead, with no more authority than the
other members of the governing body.
</P>
<P>
   By late October 1953, he, one other city commissioner and many
business, labor and civic groups had taken stands in favor ofreplacing the old form of city government with a mayor and nine
Council members. A citizens committee on municipal government and
the Newark Charter Commission had recommended the change. But
leaders of three of Newark's strongest political machines were
arrayed against the innovation.
</P>
<P>
   By then, speakers favoring the proposed strong-mayor system had
criticized the old commission form as ``outmoded, creating five
political units and departments, which are often in conflict.''
Opponents had asserted that the proposed new system would ``expose
the city to the worst form of ward and racial politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a referendum in November 1953, Newark's voters authorized the
change in the city's form of government from the old system to the
new one. Referendum returns showed that 53,739 voters were for the
Charter amendment embodying the change, and 28,142 were against it.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1954, in a special transitional election to choose the
new system's nine City Council members and the strong mayor, Carlin
was re-elected as mayor by a majority of the votes of his fellow
Newark residents. On July 1, 1954, when Carlin and the nine newly
elected Council members took their oaths of office.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, his influence extended beyond the politics of his home
state. His son, Leo P. Jr., recalled Tuesday that during President
John F. Kennedy's inaugural festivities in 1961, Carlin was
standing by himself in a Washington hotel lobby when ``the
president, coming down a staircase, spotted my father in a crowd 6
or 10 feet deep and shook my father's hand and said, `Thank you,
mayor,''' for his political support.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin was re-elected mayor in 1958 and held office for four
more years. But in 1962, he was defeated by a vote of nearly two to
one by another Democrat, Rep. Hugh J. Addonizio.
</P>
<P>
   One of 22children whom his father had with two wives, the future
mayor was born in Newark and grew up there. He attended St.
Benedict's, a Roman Catholic preparatory school in Newark, but he
had to leave it, without graduating, to go to work to help support
his family.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 55 years, Margaret Gallagher Carlin, died earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Leo P. Jr., of Manhattan, he is survived by
another son, Clark, of Bayonne, N.J.; two daughters, Eileen Carlin
of Avon-by-the-Sea and Claire Renwick of West Deptford, N.J.; a
brother, Hugh, of Kent, Conn.; eight grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.

 EDITORIAL: VERMONT'S MOMENTOUS RULING  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's highest court has awarded the gay rights movement its
biggest victory so far in the struggle to achieve legal recognition
and acceptance for same-sex marriages. The court stopped just short
of legalizing such marriages, deferring at least for now to
Vermont's state Legislature. But even if it decides against gay
marriages, the court said, the Legislature must give same-sex
couples the same legal rights and protections enjoyed by
heterosexual married couples, covering everything from joint tax
returns to the ability to make medical decisions involving a
spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-page decision, which turns on the common-benefits clause
in Vermont's constitution, was marked by eloquence and passion _
especially the concurring opinion by Justice Denise Johnson, in
which she criticized her colleagues' unwillingness to simply
legalize same-sex marriages instead of giving the Legislature a
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the decision is a breakthrough for fairness. For
gay couples, it is also especially welcome in view of their recent
setback in Hawaii's Supreme Court. The Hawaii court dismissed a
similar lawsuit on grounds that it had been rendered moot by a
reactionary 1998 amendment to the state constitution specifically
designed to block an expected court ruling requiring Hawaii to
issue marriage licenses to gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, may
find it easier to approve an expansive domestic partnership law
rather than same-sex marriages. Many people, including the state's
Democratic governor, Howard Dean, remain uncomfortable with the
idea of calling same-sex relationships marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But other legislators may be equally uncomfortable with the idea
of creating what would amount to a ``separate but equal'' system
for same-sex partners, and will therefore support same-sex
marriages. Moreover, as a practical matter, it is hard to see how
any such domestic partnership system could deliver the exact
privileges accorded to heterosexual couples, including the
portability of marital benefits when a couple cross state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legislative outcome, Chief Justice Jeffrey
Amestoy's decision will resonate broadly this holiday season.
Extending equal rights to homosexual couples ``who seek nothing
more, nor less, than legal protection and security for their avowed
commitment to an intimate and lasting relationship,'' he wrote,
``is simply, when all is said and done, a recognition of our common
humanity.''

CARDINAL PAOLO DEZZA, JESUIT SCHOLAR AND PAPAL DELEGATE, DIES AT
98  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinal Paolo Dezza, a traditional Jesuit scholar who was
assigned by Pope John Paul II to rein in the religious order in the
early 1980s, died in Rome on Friday. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuits, formally the Society of Jesus, an order founded in
the 16th century, grew politically divided in the social unrest of
the 1960s and 70s. One of the first concerns of John Paul II's
papacy was ridding the Roman Catholic Church of Marxist-tinted
``liberation theology'' movements in Latin America, of which
Jesuits were often leading advocates. Jesuits in the United States
and Europe were also prominent in theological rifts with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 the newly elected pope warned a gathering of Jesuits
that their order was ``causing confusion among the Christian people
and anxieties to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, as the battle between conservatives and liberals in the
Jesuits intensified, the order's superior general, the Rev. Pedro
Arrupe, suffered a stroke. The Jesuits nominated the Rev. Vincent
O'Keefe, an American liberal, to run the order until a successor
could be found. The pope instead appointed Dezza, who was known as
a brilliant scholar and also a traditionalist, as a special
pontifical delegate to serve as the Jesuits' interim leader.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had attended Dezza's lectures when studying in Rome
after World War II at the Gregorian Pontifical Institute, where
Dezza was rector. Dezza was also a confessor to Pope Paul VI and
Pope John Paul I.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns of some Jesuits, his leadership proved
deft. In 1983 the Jesuits chose the Rev. Peter Hans Kolvenbach, a
Dutch academic who had mainly worked in the Middle East, to be
superior general, and tension between the Vatican and the Jesuits
abated.
</P>
<P>
   The pope elevated Dezza to cardinal in 1991, even though he was
89, nine years over the age limit to vote to elect a new pope.
</P>
<P>
   Dezza, who was born in Parma in 1901, began his training as a
Jesuit in 1918, right after finishing high school.
</P>
<P>
   Ordained in 1928, he was appointed rector of the Gregorian in
1941. During World War II, he was credited with having hidden
people wanted by the Nazis. Before the pope asked him to be
pontifical delegate to the Jesuits, Dezza had held senior
administrative positions in the order, including president of the
commission of superior studies in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the pope celebrated the cardinal's funeral Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica.

 The following story was reported by Craig Pyes, John Kifner, John
F. Burns and Sam Howe Verhovek, and was written by Burns  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When U.S. customs officials arrested Ahmed Ressam near Seattle
last week after he came off a ferry from Canada in a car they say
was loaded with jars of nitroglycerine, timing devices and other
bomb-making materials, American intelligence officials knew little
about him.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest set off alarms in France, where anti-terrorist
officials had been focusing on the 32-year-old Ressam because of
his connections to a radical Islamic group that French
investigators suspect had carried out in 1996 a series of attacks
on supermarkets, armored security vehicles and banks in northern
France.
</P>
<P>
   French officials declined to provide specifics and did not
suggest that Ressam himself was involved in those attacks, but one
senior French law enforcement official said that Ressam had links
to Fateh Kamel, an Algerian veteran of the Afghan war. The French
have implicated Kamel in the 1996 attacks, which left several
bystanders and several Islamic radicals dead and netted a cache of
high-powered weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the French identified Said Atmani, an
Algerian with a Bosnian passport who once roomed with Ressam in a
Montreal apartment, as another figure with links to Kamel. French
officials said they sent a delegation to Canada in October to
interview Atmani and Ressam, but neither man could be located.
</P>
<P>
   A French anti-terrorist official said that they briefed Canadian
and American officials about their interest in Ressam, including
his possible links to the financing of Islamic terror activities in
Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Much about Ressam remains unknown as officials in three
countries trace his movements in an effort to learn what he planned
to do with the explosives he was accused of bringing into the
United States. But from interviews and a review of public records
in Canada, a picture is emerging of a man who moved easily from
country to country with falsified passports.
</P>
<P>
   At the modest, $85 per night hotel where he lived for two weeks
in Vancouver, British Columbia, workers recalled that he was
traveling with another man, who was lighter in complexion and spoke
English with no discernible accent.
</P>
<P>
   American officials now say they have unconfirmed intelligence
reports that Ressam had been seen in training camps used in the
1980s by Islamic militants fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ressam told Canadian authorities that he had been falsely accused
in Algeria of being an Islamic radical, and tortured, according to
immigration records.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials acknowledged on Tuesday that Ressam had taken
advantage of lax procedures and loose cooperation between the
police and immigration authorities to obtain his false papers.
Reviewing the case, one Montreal police investigator, Claude
Paquette, this week said that the loose rules had turned Canada
into ``a Club Med for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's investigation into the affair has established, among
other things, that Ressam arrived in the country in 1994 with a
fake French passport in an assumed name. Later, after being ordered
arrested and deported, he went underground and obtained a Canadian
passport in a false name using only a Roman Catholic baptism
certificate, a procedure said to be common in Quebec. When arrested
in Seattle, Ressam was carrying a Canadian passport in the assumed
name of Benni Antoine Norris.
</P>
<P>
   The group to which French investigators have linked Ressam is
part of a new trend in Islamic radicalism in which small, loosely
linked bands of militants collaborate in attacks on Western
targets, often financing themselves by what the French call
``gangster-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking French official who outlined what he called
``the globalization of Islamist terror'' said there were probably
20 to 50 Islamic groups that have planned or carried out terrorist
attacks worldwide in countries like Canada, France, Belgium,
Turkey, Malaysia and Australia, as well a dozen or more other
nations. Few of these groups, he said, belonged to a coherent
terrorist network, although many maintained loose links with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   What most of these groups have in common, French and American
officials say, is a heritage from the Islamic ``holy war'' against
Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s, when thousands of young
Muslims from across Europe, the Middle East and Asia were
indoctrinated with a militant brand of Islam, and trained in
weapons techniques and bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Islamic terror groups are not centrally directed,
anti-terrorist officials in the United States and other Western
countries say they are linked by many things, including their
fiercely anti-Western system of Islamic beliefs and common
experiences and operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leaders fought, or at least were trained, in
Afghanistan. Most see the United States, with its secular political
tradition, its military and economic power, and its backing for
Israel, as the prime target for terrorist attacks. Many radicals
use false passports, and work from the same terror-training
manuals, some of them adapted from CIA-supplied training materials
used in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining whether Ressam is linked to the most
notorious figure to emerge from that war, Osama Bin Laden, the
wealthy 42-year-old Saudi Arabian exile who lives in hiding in
Afghanistan. American authorities have identified Bin Laden as the
mastermind of the August 1998 bomb attacks on American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in which 220 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One American official said there were reports that Ressam had
met with several people in Canada tied to Bin Laden. It was unclear
what significance, if any, these contacts had. French officials
have concentrated their recent investigations on Kamel, whom they
described as ``important in the world of Islamic terrorists'' and
as a frequent traveler to Bosnia, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and
Jordan among other places.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan on Tuesday, a high-ranking official of the Taliban,
the militant Islamic group that rules most of Afghanistan, scoffed
at American suggestions that Bin Laden may have continued to play a
role in terror attacks since the embassy bombings, which prompted
the FBI to place Bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list and post a
$5 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden doesn't even have access to a telephone or a fax,''
Sayed Mohammed Haqqani, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, told a
news conference.

</P>
<P>
   Rassem arrived in Canada's Mirabel Airport on February 20, 1994,
and claimed he was fleeing a government that had unjustly accused
him of arms smuggling and Islamic radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   His French passport bore the name of Tahar Medjadi, but he
readily admitted to authorities that the document and his birth
certificate were fake. He asked for refugee status and asylum.
</P>
<P>
   On his application form he stated the Algerian military
`'considered me to be nothing but an Islamic terrorist, even though
I have no connection to Islamic movements.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was tortured with rags, soap, ladders and a desk
drawer, made to sign false confessions, and held in administrative
detention for 15 months. After two years of legal wrangling,
Canadian officials rejected his claim for refugee status, and
ordered him deported.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, his lawyer Dennis Buron said, the government
had a policy of not deporting anybody to Algeria because of the
harsh battles there between Islamic insurgents and the military
rulers. So he remained in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Charbonneau, a Canadian Immigration spokeswoman, said
that there was no grounds to hold Rassem. ``At that time, we had no
proof that he was linked to any terrorist group. If we had proof,
we would have kept him in detention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rassem then slipped from official view, living under two false
names, Benni Antoine Noris, and Mario Roig.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb 8, 1998, an arrest warrant was issued for Ressam, for
allegedly stealing a computer from a parked car. He served two
weeks in jail.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a deportation order was issued for
Rassem, apparently on the basis of three outstanding criminal
arrest warrants, two for theft from cars, and one for breaking and
entering. In May 1998, a nationwide immigration warrent was issued
for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, last February Rassem sought and obtained a
government-issued Canadian passport in the false name of Benni
Antoine Noris. Even though he had been fingerprinted during his
refugee application, there was apparently no cross check with
police, immigration or intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Those fingerprints remained on file. And when Ressam was
arrested last week crossing the border into Washington, American
authorities lifted his prints and learned his true identity.
</P>
<P>
   France's interest in Ressam appears to have been prompted by the
arrest in Jordan this spring of Kamel, the Algerian-born Afghan
veteran who has been linked by French investigators to the group
that carried out a series of attacks in the Northern French city of
Roubaix.
</P>
<P>
   French anti-terrorist officials have said that they have
established that Kamel provided ``religious leadership'' to Islamic
groups, in France that carried out the robberies, which terrorized
the French city for three months in early 1996. In one attack, the
Islamic radicals shot dead a French Muslim who was slow in handing
over the keys to his Mercedes after the gang had bungled a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French investigation, the robberies netted the
gang only about 70,000 francs, a little more than $10,000, money
that the French say was used to finance the activities of the
Islamic groups Kamel is said to have led.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery spree ended with a shootout in the Roubaix suburb of
Alma in March 1996, in the course of which four gang members were
killed, two after fleeing across the border into Belgium. It is not
clear what direct evidence, if any, exists linking Kamel to the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest this year, Jordan extradited him to France and
Kamel has been held ever since under a French law providing for the
detention of suspects under investigation for alleged involvement
in a ``terrorist enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, following leads that arose from the Roubaix inquiry,
French anti-terrorist officials visited Canada, where they hoped to
question Ressam and Atmani, his former roommate in Montreal. A
French law enforcement official described both as ``lieutenants''
of Kamel in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians were unable to locate either man. Atmani had been
deported to Bosnia, where he had previously obtained his own
passport. Ressam had assumed his new identity and was living
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investigators did turn up evidence suggesting that the
Islamic groups with which Ressam and Atmani may have been
associated, in Montreal, were practicing their own, less violent
version of ``gangster-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Canadians, police in Montreal arrested 11
Muslim men this fall on suspicion of stealing laptop computers and
cellphones from parked cars, and selling them in front of the
city's mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ressam's arrest, the Canadians have said that they believe
the proceeds were funneled to Algerian-based Islamic groups,
including the Armed Islamic Group, a guerrilla organization that
has been responsible for many of the 100,000 deaths in the Algerian
civil war that began in 1992.

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - President Franklin Roosevelt once famously
proclaimed, ``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he hadn't encountered the Great Millennium Scourge.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist threats, power outages, apocalyptic cults, computer
glitches, solar sunspots - it's as if Steven King churned out a
horror novel while high on crank.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, persons unknown stole a bunch of explosives near
Flagstaff. And an Algerian man was arrested with bomb ingredients
at the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in drunken drivers and celebratory New Year's bullets
falling from Phoenix area skies, and it presages the worst
catastrophe since biblical plagues.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that common citizens have pegged this 2000 scare
as a futuristic version of the Chicken Little fable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an Internet chat room for millennium stress is
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Operators at Phoenix's Community Information &AMP; Referral Hotline
have yet to hear from any Y2K panic victims.
</P>
<P>
   And Phoenix psychotherapist Carol Bettina says she has yet to
see a patient suffering from Y2K anxiety, despite an onslaught of
media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan ``Sully'' Sullivan, a 22-year-old Mesa writer, chuckles at
the sky-is-falling scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like how some people are a little freaked out about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His emergency plans?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to store up on cigarettes and beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Macias, 36, of Phoenix, is convinced that the New Year
will bring more hysteria than havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets hyped out of proportion,'' Macias said. ``It seems
like people enjoy getting scared of things. I always wish the
doomsayers would look back on their record in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have a bunker,'' said Debbie Haggarton, 31, a
Chandler homemaker. ``I haven't given it a second thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, city Y2K guru Gordon Cresswell said folks should,
at the most, plan for inconvenience similar to that during a major
storm. Still, the city announced this week that it will have 18
emergency communications centers ``should any unforeseen problems
occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Cresswell is so confident that none will, however, that he
hasn't so much as stocked up on canned food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done anything,'' he said. ``I'm not going to do
anything, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 people interviewed, not one was planning a suicide flight
to Hale-Bopp.
</P>
<P>
   Most denied having any trepidation about Y2K. They said dire
predictions will end up like Phoenix's New Year's bash: lots of
fizzle, no bang.
</P>
<P>
   Cinque, a 22-year-old Phoenix resident who uses one name, was
the lone alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   After reading about potential calamities, he decided the
millennium might fit a historical pattern: Every great empire
collapses eventually, and it could be America's turn. So Cinque has
stocked up on bottled water and canned food, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared,'' he noted confidently.
</P>
<P>
   That also seems to be the mantra of public and private officials
responsible for averting millennial chaos: They don't think
anything really bad will happen, but they're ready.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Susan Herskovits said the bureau has ``contingencies
in place that I can't talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely feel prepared,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Mike DeBenedetto, the Phoenix Police Department's emergency
planning coordinator, said ``millennium paranoia'' has actually
been good for public and private security.
</P>
<P>
   He said leave has been canceled for peace officers from next
Monday, Dec. 27 to Jan. 7. Even if Jan. 1 meets expectations as the
``biggest 911 night in Phoenix history'' DeBenedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident, and probably have never been more
confident, in our ability to provide public safety,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At Sky Harbor International Airport, Sgt. Gerry ``Odis''
Brockman said Phoenix police already have gone on heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be foolish not to at this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That means that extra officers will patrol airport terminals
with bomb-sniffing dogs and that the ban on curbside parking will
be strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Aurelius, Phoenix's emergency operations coordinator,
said four years of preparation will be tested in the first few
hours of 2000. Contingency plans have been devised ``just in case
something goofy happens'' with water delivery systems, public
sewers, aviation equipment and emergency equipment that depend on
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities and public utilities offered similar assurances.
</P>
<P>
   At Arizona Public Service, officials said that electrical output
and the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Plant are ready for the
changeover. Company spokesman Will Diaz said APS already passed a
pair of Y2K tests, adding that up to 500 employees will be at
substations around the state on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas B. Nixon, chief deputy with the U.S. Marshal's Office in
Arizona, said he couldn't discuss heightened security around the
federal courthouse but said that it's there.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Andy Vidaure, a DPS spokesman, said his agency will run
an emergency operations center from Dec. 27 until Jan. 3 to deal
with trouble arising with the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Vidaure said the Highway Patrol will assist local police
agencies on DUI task forces and will work to keep traffic flowing
after New Year's Eve parties in Tempe and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sheriff Joe Arpaio said his deputies will pay special
attention to the Palo Verde plant while he offers free rides to New
Year's revelers who are too drunk to drive; they should call (602)
256-1661.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said his SWAT team will be on standby - with a tank.
</P>
<P>
   If such assurances don't calm millennial palpitations, help is
available on the World Wide Web (www.1-800-therapist.com/Y2K) or by
dialing 1-800-843-7274.
