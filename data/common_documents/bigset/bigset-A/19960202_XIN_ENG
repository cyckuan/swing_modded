<HEADLINE> IFRC Considers Extending Relief Operation in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is considering
extending its relief operation for at least another 7 months to
help avoid worsening food situation in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
D.P.R.K. is facing a severe food shortage as a result of the
devastating floods last August. "The entire population is at risk,
because they are not eating enough", Dr. Piero Calvi-Parisetti,
just back from a trip to pyongyang as the Head of IFRC Delegation
told a press conference on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to an IFRC press release, the Federation is
considering extending its relief operation for at least another
seven months to help ease the food crisis in the country, where
some 30 percent of the arable land was deluged and 500,000 people
were left homeless during the flooding.
</P>
<P>
IFRC said that over the past three months beginning last
October, it has been providing some 130,000 people with 450 grams
of rice each person daily that guarantees 75 percent of the
calories needed for survival.
</P>
<P>
IFRC said that its initial assessment under-estimated the food
shortages the homeless faced, adding that it had appealed for 4.9
million Swiss Francs, 70 percent of which covered, and in recent
weeks all available funds have been directed toward feeding.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Companies Invest in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish construction companies
have started contributing to the reconstruction efforts in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The companies will be involved in the reconstruction of
houses, factories, hospitals and infrastructure in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ali Dincer, the minister of state responsible for housing,
said Turkish firms will play an important role in Bosnia's
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has made enormous efforts to achieve peace in the
region and will continue its efforts to ensure peaceful
coexistence," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, nine countries, including Turkey, are
involved in the reconstruction work in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So far
six billion U.S. dollars has been spent for Bosnia's
reconstruction, and four billion dollars more is expected to be
sent to the region.
</P>
<P>
Dincer explained that some Turkish companies will open branches
in Tuzla and Mostar in order to coordinate their efforts in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Turkey opened an office of the Turkish international
Cooperation Agency in Sarajevo on November 24 to take part in the
reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina after the signing of the
Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen had said
that now it is the time of development and construction for
Bosnia. In order to make peace implemented, he said, it is
necessary for Bosnia to become a country where it is possible to
live.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we, as Turkey, attach greater importance to the
reconstruction of Bosnia," Oymen added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
studying the possibility of selling or leasing new or surplus F-16
jet fighters to former Warsaw Pact member states, the U.S. Defense
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Tom LaRock made the remarks when
commenting on a report by a Swedish newspaper. The Swedish daily
newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said that Thomas Rhame, director of
the Pentagon's Security Assistance Agence, visited Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic last month to discuss the jet deal.
</P>
<P>
LaRock confirmed the report, saying that Rhame "discussed
queries on different options they could pursue on the possible
sale or lease of F-16 and the possible provision of other
equipment".
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said that no decision had been made in the
talks and further discussions are needed for some time.
</P>
<P>
The three Central European states, all considered leading
candidates for eventual membership in the Western military
alliance, are currently equipped with Soviet-made fighter jets and
other arms from the Cold War era. They are eager to get the F-16
fighters made by U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp..
</P>
<P>
But Sweden's Saab consortium is also trying to sell the JAS-39
Gripen fighter jet to the three states.

WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher left here today on his first postwar trip to
the Balkans to promote peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's first stop is Zagreb, where he will hold talks
with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on the implementation of
the Bosnian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He will then fly to the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla to visit
the U.S. peacekeeping troops being deployed there. More than half
of the 20,000 American ground troops have been rolled into Bosnia
to enforce the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
American officials said that they are fairly satisfied with
implementation of military aspects of the Bosnian peace treaty
signed in Paris last December, but are concerned about civilian
issues including the complete exchange of prisoners.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends 6-month Renewal of UNAVEM III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended that the
mandate of the peacekeepers in Angola be extended for a further
six months until August 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Security Council released here today,
Boutros-Ghali said that the peace process in Angola has been
proceeding at a "disappointingly slow pace".
</P>
<P>
"Since August 1995, recurring impasses alternated with brief
periods of cooperation between the government and UNITA (Uniao
National para a Indepdendencia Total de Angola), and the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol is still woefully behind
schedule," he reported.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has spared no effort to create the
environment necessary for the implementation of the Protocol.
However, a deep seated mistrust and a lack of political will to
take decisive measures has prevented the parties from honoring
their commitments," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) was
established on February 8, 1995, for a period of six months by the
Security Council. Its task was to provide good offices between
Angola government and the UNITA, monitor cease-fire, coordinate
humanitarian assistance activities and supervise presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III consists of 6,384 military persons including 342
military observers and 225 police officers.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali noted that promising steps taken by the
government of Angola in the last few weeks are encouraging. He
urged UNITA to respond positively, first of all by a large-scale
and fully verifiable movement of its troops to quartering areas.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
today deported 19 Zaireans and three Burundians in a bid to curb
the influx of illegal immigrants into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean and Burundian nationals were arrested in a special
operation to round-up refugees who had absconded from refugee
camps. They were found by the Tanzanian police to be illegally
residing in the Kigoma region.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Zaireans and Burundians had no proper
documents allowing them to stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Kigoma region, which borders Zaire, Rwanda and
Burundi, has for some time accommodated illegal immigrants from
the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are attributing some criminal acts in the
region to the illegal immigrants who either abscond from refugee
camps or mix with local residents of Kigoma.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Asylum-seekers Registered in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of asylum-seekers
in the European Union (EU) continued to fall in all member-states
except the United Kingdom in 1995, according to figures released
today by the EUROSTAT.
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT, the EU's Statistical Office in Luxembourg, said there
were about 3.4 million asylum seekers during the 1985 to 1994
period in the present 15-member European Union. In 1992, a record
of 674,000 people sought asylum status in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Germany received more asylum applications than all other EU
countries as a whole, according to the EUROSTAT.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, every two in three seekers wanted to go into Germany.
In 1994, the number dropped to 127,000, which was 42 percent of
the total applicants.
</P>
<P>
Most of the asylum seekers are from former-Yugoslavia, which is
followed by the Turks, the EUROSTAT added.

<HEADLINE> Western Economy Faces Good Prospects in Next Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The up-going trend in
the European and the U.S. economy would continue in the next few
years while certain problems needed to be solved, President of the
German Central Bank Hans Tietmeyer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum,
Tietmeyer said "1996 will be highly significant. What happens in
this year will have a strong impact on the future development."
</P>
<P>
He noted the European integration, particularly the single
currency, was still possible though most of the European Union
(EU) member countries could not meet the criteria.
</P>
<P>
The German banker stressed that what was most important was not
a nominal integration, but an increase of competitiveness and
flexibility of the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
On the economic conditions in the year 2000, Tietmeyer said the
division of labor would be more sophisticated worldwide. Newly
industrialized countries would narrow their gap with developed
countries, and populous countries such as China and India would
catch up.
</P>
<P>
The financial difficulties would force many countries to reform
their taxation and welfare systems. "It is crucial to maintain the
political stability," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
President of the French Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet said
at the forum that a major challenge was to "create more jobs out
of the same growth."
</P>
<P>
Education and training were the key tools to achieve this
objective, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Summers, deputy treasury secretary of the United
States, said Europe had seen cyclical unemployment turn into
structural unemployment, suggesting that Europe needed to avoid
temporary joblessness from becoming permanent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Conducts Successful New UAV Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Aircraft
Industries (IAI) has reportedly succeeded in testing a new
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used to provide combat intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The UAV, called Eye-View, has a range of 50 kilometers and a
speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The wing span is four meters and
weighs 15 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The UAV is produced by IAI's Malat division and was tested last
month. Its maiden flight lasted 15 minutes and passed all the
tests, including for maneuverability and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Eye-View is for providing combat intelligence and
artillery fire adjustments for use by battalion or brigade
commanders. It has a special camera and sophisticated avionics, a
crew of four for operation and maintenance and can fly for up to
four hours.
</P>
<P>
IAI executives said the Eye-View will be exhibited at this
year's Singapore Air Show.
</P>
<P>
The company also announced a new advanced laser-guided bomb as
part of a new generation of laser weapons, developed by IAI's MBT
division. It said the bomb is precise, unaffected by winds and
maneuvering targets, with an accuracy of one meter.
</P>
<P>
The IAI also announced the development of new short-range air
defense system, MACHBET. It said the system combines the fire
power of Stinger missiles and Vulcan guns, capable of attacking
low-flying aerial targets, such as helicopters and aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to provide air defense for advancing
mobile forces, such as tanks.
</P>
<P>
The company also said the Chilean Air Force awarded an 11
million U.S. dollars contract to IAI's Bedek group to convert a
Boeing 707 into an air-refueler tanker aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Due to a dwindling arms market in the world in the post-cold
war era, Israel's military industry has made great efforts to
develop high-tech competitive military equipments on the one hand
and switched partially to produce civilian equipments on the
other. The IAI is Israel's largest defense industry group.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Public Workers Demand Dismissal Of  Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zambian public
service workers held a demonstration of solidarity here today
demanding dismissal of Finance Minister Ronald Penza for refusing
to pay them 45 percent salary increment.
</P>
<P>
The public service workers gathered at the headquarters of the
Ministry of Finance, chanting slogans against the finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
Some of them carried placards which read: Penza must go we
don't work for charity, we must get the 45 percent increment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, General Secretary of the Civil Servants
Union of Zambia Japhet Moonde said Penza ought to be dismissed
because his statement had broken the law.
</P>
<P>
If the government interfered with the 45 percent pay increase,
there was going to be a lot of trouble because the public service
workers had persevered with it for a long time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Wednesday, Penza described the
Industrial Relations Court's ruling on the 45 percent pay
increment for civil servants as an irresponsible judgement. The
government had no money to pay them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Court clarified on Monday that its ruling on the 45
percent salary increase for the public service workers last
November was separated from the 30 percent pay increment which
the government had awarded to civil servants in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It means that the government has to increase salary and wage
of the public service workers by 75 percent from the 1994 level.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Rebels Demand Resignation of Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Two armed rebel groups advancing
on Tajikistan's capital of Dushanbe are demanding that several
Tajik government ministers be sacked, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
One group of rebels headed by the former mayor of western
Tursun-Zade city, Ibodullo Boimatov, has demanded the removal of
First Deputy Prime Minister Makhmadsaid Obaidulayev and Chief of
the Presidential Staff Izatullo Khaeveva.
</P>
<P>
Another group, led by Mahmud Khudoiberdyev, commander of the
Defense Ministry's first brigade, wants Obaidulayev and Defense
Minister Shirali Khairullayev to step down.
</P>
<P>
Boimatov's troops occupied a hospital on January 26 and have
disarmed several checkpoints set up by the Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev's forces attacked a local police department in
the southern city of Kurgan-Tyube on January 27.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that presidential guards and troops of the Tajik
Security Ministry have been put on alert in Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliament session today, Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov described the actions in the two cities as "pre-planned"
and the lead-up to "a military coup."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the rebellion should be settled within the
framework of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to meet with the commanders of the groups at any
place and at any time to settle issues peacefully," the president
said, adding "however, I shall not accept any conditions and I
shall not make any decisions under pressure."
</P>
<P>
He said "weapons should be handed in and the mutineers should
surrender to the authorities."
</P>
<P>
He promised to guarantee the rebels' safety if they surrender
voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> British Economy to Outstrip Most of Western Countries' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain will be Europe's most
buoyant economy this year even though it is unlikely to achieve
the official 3 percent growth forecast, the London Business School
says today in its latest set of forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates and tax cuts will provide a stimulus and
produce growth of 2.6 percent this year and 2.8 percent next.
</P>
<P>
A recovery in consumer spending, which is expected to rise by
almost 3 percent, and an increase in capital spending will provide
a boost for the British economy this year, helped by a further
fall in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The school's Centre for Economic Forecasting predicts growth in
Britain will outstrip the American and Japanese economies as well
as European Union rivals.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Germany will slip to 1.8 percent this year from 2
percent last year and 2.4 percent next, according to the Centre.
The French economy is forecast to grow by 1.7 percent and 2.5
percent over the period and Italy's by 2 percent and 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister To Leave Cabinet Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Provincial
Affairs and Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer would
leave his cabinet post to become Secretary-General of a revamped
National Party (NP), Deputy President and NP leader F. W. de
Klerk said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the NP's new headquarters in Pretoria, de Klerk said
Meyer's resignation would be effective from March 1. Meyer would
however remain the NP's chief negotiator on the new constitution
until its completion.
</P>
<P>
Under the new post, Meyer would take over all functions
previously handled by the chairman of the NP's Federal Management
Committee. The post of chairman would therefore fall away.
</P>
<P>
He would also become the NP leader in the National Assembly
with immediate effect. Both positions were previously the
responsibility of Western Cape NP leader Dawie de Valliers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, de Klerk stressed the fact that Meyer was prepared
to accept this new task was an indication of the seriousness with
which the NP "is approaching its new vision and mission".
</P>
<P>
In his speech, de Klerk outlined what he described was the new
vision and mission for the party, including closer cooperation
with other political parties and unification of South Africans
around core values.
</P>
<P>
Meyer's new appointment in this regard formed part of an
initiative to strengthen the management of the NP in its pursuit
of a new vision, said de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the NP had not managed to completely shake
off its past in the eyes of many South Africans. Old perceptions
presented serious obstacles in the NP's path toward broadening
its support base, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NP, the second largest party in South Africa's current
coalition government, was the ruling party of the former
apartheid regime.

<HEADLINE> Coal Miners Continue Strike in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 500,000 coal-miners in
Russia today continued their strike, which started Thursday, to
protest months of unpaid wages and to demand trillions of roubles
for their heavily-subsidized industry.
</P>
<P>
The strike coincided with a walkout by up to one million miners
in Ukraine's Donbass region, in a day of massive industrial action
that was apparently coordinated although aimed at separate
governments, the Moscow Time newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
From the center of Russia's coal-producing Kuzbass region to
Vorkuta in the Arctic and Sakhalin in the Far East, 87 percent of
Russia's coal-extraction plants went on strike, a spokesman for
the Trade Union of Mining Industry Workers said.
</P>
<P>
"This time the whole industry is on strike," said Ivan
Mokhnachuk, deputy head of the union, which represents virtually
all of Russia's 580,000 miners. "We can't stand any more. We will
strike until the government meets all our demands."
</P>
<P>
According to government sources, 118 of the country's 182 pits
and 27 of 63 open-cast mines have joined the walkout. But
Mokhnachuk said work had stopped at a total of 161 pits and 52
open-cast mines.
</P>
<P>
"If the Finance Ministry has managed to find money for the
continuation of the war in Chechnya, let it find some for the
miners," Viktor Semyonov, head of an independent union of Vorkuta
miners, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The miners last week rejected a government offer of 600 billion
roubles (126 million U.S. dollars) in back wages, which they say
have not been paid since November. They are holding out for an
overall coal industry budget of 10.4 trillion roubles (2.26
billion dollars) against the 7.4 trillion roubles (1.6 billion
dollars) the government has so far allocated.
</P>
<P>
While the government seems ready to cave in quickly to these
demands, the process could be complicated by the fact that many of
the miners are paid by regional, and not federal, authorities, the
Moscow Time noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia's coal reserves, among the richest in the world, are
estimated at as high as 200 billion tonnes. But last year, 182
Russian mines and 63 open-cast mines produced 262 million tonnes,
10 million tonnes less than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 when the government froze prices for coal, state
subsidies have amounted to 60 percent of the total income of the
coal miners. The government has closed 37 unprofitable mines and
fired 137,000 miners since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not To Join Regional Customs Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister said
today Zimbabwe has no intention of joining the Southern African
Customs Union (SACU), but is more interested in seeing the SADC
protocol on trade cooperation and energy.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Herbert Murerwa said the draft
trade protocol should be ready for submission to the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) heads of state and
government summit, scheduled for August in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
SACU, the only customs union in the region, comprises
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The SADC protocol is "at the center of relations in the
region", Murerwa said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that more pressure should be put to get this
protocol concluded at least by June this year. Now looking at our
relations with SACU, Zimbabwe has no intention of joining SACU.
We want to go ahead with the trade protocol," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged To Promote COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) today urged Zimbabwe to continue
playing a leading role in promoting regional integration despite
its refusal to ratify the treaty establishing COMESA.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Bingu wa Mutharika said COMESA is
"still committed" to assisting Zimbabwe in achieving its regional
integration program, the Zimbabwean National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that Zimbabwe will continue to play a
leadership role in eastern and southern Africa to find an
alternative formula for attaining sustainable growth and
development, not only of Zimbabwe itself, but of the partners
within COMESA," Mutharika was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the COMESA members who have refused to
ratify the treaty establishing the organization, which intends to
create a common market in a region with an estimated population
of over 320 million.
</P>
<P>
Among other reasons, Zimbabwe, together with South Africa,
insists that the dual membership of some countries of both COMESA
and the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC)
be solved first.
</P>
<P>
Mutharika said last month a joint SADC/COMESA summit was
planned for later this year to discuss the issue.

JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
Ehud Barak said today that there has been progress in peace talks
with Syria, but it is less than the media has reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Barak said that the talks
should continue after next week's shuttle visit to the region by
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Barak revealed that the just concluded two rounds of talks
between Israel and Syria at Maryland, the United States dealt
primarily with security arrangements on the Golan Heights and the
issue of water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli negotiators today returned home from the
United States following the latest rounds of negotiations with
their Syrian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Chief negotiator Uri Savir told reporters upon his return that
delicate security issues have been discussed and Syria has made
serious attempts to understand Israel's security needs and to
bridge differences.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that obstacles remain in the negotiations, but
expressed his belief that a peace treaty with Syria could be
wrapped up this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Rate Rises to 5.8 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
U.S. rose to 5.8 percent in January, the highest level in the past
nine months, the Labour Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The labour Department said that the number of jobs declined by
210,000 last month, the first drop in 10 months and the largest in
nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the jobless rate in the U.S. was the first in
the past three months. It rose from 5.5 percent in October to 5.6
percent in November and remained unchanged in December.
</P>
<P>
The latest jobless rate which matched the 5.8 percent rate was
in last April, the highest during 1995, and the lowest rate was in
last February when it dipped to 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labour Department said that job decrease in January was
mainly due to the blizzard in the Eastern area of the country that
closed many business and a strike by New York City building
maintenance workers.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts believe the U.S. labour market has shown
signs of slowing in recent months as the economy is softening. The
economy now is growing at a barely perceptible 1 percent annual
rate, less that half what is needed to keep the unemployment rate
steady.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management also reported
yesterday that a January survey of its members suggested an
overall economic weakening for the first time in almost five
years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut two short-term interest rates on
January 31 to boost the flagging economy, acknowledging
"moderating economic expansion".

HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will this year take
measures to further liberalize the economy in order to attract

He made the remarks while meeting a business delegation from

Mugabe said Zimbabwe and the United States have over the years
enjoyed good ties.

"We want to see much more economic ties and development by way
of investment and trade and also in forms of assistance that
would enable us to take off in certain policies, like the trade
liberalization program which we are currently implementing," he
said.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Working for Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- "Saving money for a rainy day"
is a growingly popular concept among Americans who are worrying
about the demise of Social Security at the beginning of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the "American Demographics"
magazine, almost one-fourth of fully employed people think that
100,000 u.s. dollars or less in savings will see them through
their retirement years.
</P>
<P>
The yearly income of median U.S. household now tops 30,000 U.S.
dollars, finds a survey conducted by the Boston-based Keyport Life
Insurance. However, the survey indicates, income derived from this
amount of capital would not be able to support most people in the
manner to which they are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Keyport calculates that maintaining a standard of
living equivalent to a gross income of 30,000 U.S. dollars in 1995
would require 310,000 U.S. dollars in savings -- that's assuming a
generous 6 percent interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Even so, half of workers expect to maintain their standard of
living in retirement, although 13 percent are not saving anything
right now and 22 percent don't know how much they're saving.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that 46 percent of those surveyed plan to
spend at least some of their retirement time working for pay,
indicating that today's workers expect hard time ahead.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, it said, just 13 percent of current retirees say
they work. There are also a growing number of people who remain
involved in their professions long after they turn 65.

<HEADLINE> German Central Banker: Western Economy on Upbeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The economic upward
trend in Europe and the United States could continue for some time
despite of the current slowdown in Europe, German central banker
Hans Tietmeyer told leading business, government, media and
academic representatives here today at the Annual Meeting of the
World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
In his speech made to the Forum which opened on Thursday,
Tietmeyer said: "1996 will be highly significant. What happens in
this year will have a strong impact on the future development."
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer said he thought the European integration,
particularly a single currency is still possible despite the
current difficulties. But he stressed that the most significant
issue is not a nominal integration, but to increase the
competitiveness and flexibility of EU countries.
</P>
<P>
In his comments on the economies in the year 2000, Tietmeyer
said the worldwide labour division would further intensify; the
newly industrialized countries would narrow their gap with the
developed countries. And the populous countries such as China and
India are catching up too.

Moreover, the city's industry will register a year-on-year
increase in the next five years, while agriculture will see a 3.5
percent growth every year.
</P>
<P>
The mayor disclosed that the city's annual foreign trade volume
will climb to 38 billion US dollars-worth, of which 20 billion
dollars will be generated by the export sector. And the investment

Pudong New Area accounting for one third of the total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the volume of contracted foreign
investment will increase to 37.5 billion US dollars, with at least

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Guangdong, HK Police Combat Car-Theft Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong and Hong Kong
police are enhancing their cooperation in fighting against
car-stolen crimes across the border.
</P>
<P>
The new achievement made in the cooperation between the two
sides led to a stolen-car handover ceremony held today at
Huanggang Border Control Point of Shenzhen City with 14 vehicles
being returned to Hong Kong by the Guangdong Public Security
Bureau (PSB).
</P>
<P>
The batch of 14 vehicles, which were reported stolen in Hong
Kong between February 1992 and November 1995, include eight
tractors, five luxury sedans and one motor-cycle, worth more than
9 million HK dollars (115,385 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is the second batch of stolen tractors returned to Hong Kong
 following the return of 14 stolen tractors by the Guangdong
police on October 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the handover ceremony, Hong Kong's representative
Tsang Yam-pui, director of crime and security, thanked Guangdong
PSB officials for their support in both policy and operations
against the car-stealing gangs across the border between Guangdong
 and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that Guangdong PSB's efforts contributed to a
continuous drop in vehicle theft cases in Hong Kong last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the number of missing vehicles decreased by 6 percent,
 while that for luxury cars dropped significantly by 44.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
On tractor theft cases which once raised much concerns in the
territory, Tsang said that the number of stolen tractors had
dropped significantly from 162 in the third quarter to 65 in the
fourth quarter in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tsang attributed the downward trend in vehicle theft cases to
the continued commitment and cooperation by the Hong Kong and
Guangdong police in combating cross-border crime.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the Guangdong authorities have returned on 14
occasions to Hong Kong a total of 87 stolen private cars, 22
tractors, a motorcycle and seven yachts which were recovered from
different areas of Guangdong province during their anti-crime
operations.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau (OCTB) also
took over the co-ordination in combating the theft of vehicles
with the assistance of other police formations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 717 luxury vehicles and 414 tractors were
 reported stolen, of which 222 and 110 were later recovered
respectively.

<HEADLINE> HK Key Overseas Listing Base For Chinese Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to take
Hong Kong as the base market to raise funds for its state-owned
enterprises after 1997, according to a high-ranking Chinese
securities official.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiange, Vice-chairman of China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) -- the country's top watchdog on securities,
made the remarks in a luncheon speech delivered at an Investors'
Forum, sponsored by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will consistently put Hong Kong as a major
market for the overseas listing of Chinese state-owned enterprises
 beyond 1997," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the listing policy shows that the Chinese
government strongly supports Hong Kong's position as an
international hub of finance, which is essential to the long-term
prosperity and stability in the region after 1997.
</P>
<P>
"CSRC will consistently keep the good cooperative relations
with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Hong Kong, the Hong
 Kong Stock Exchange and the Futures Exchange after 1997, " Li
said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 20 Chinese state-owned enterprises had
gone public in Hong Kong and the United States, raising 3.75
billion US dollars. Three were listed in America, and 17 issued H
shares in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One more H share, issued by China's largest textile machinery
manufacturer, today had its transaction started on the Hong Kong
bourse.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that all these overseas listed companies were
selected from the top state-owned enterprises, which not only take
 big market shares in different industries, but also play
significant roles in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Li made no comment or
prediction on the current performance of H shares, which "might
not be as good as expected". But he said that in a long
perspective, the rapid growth of China's economy will be a
powerful engine to fuel H shares up.

<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Mark Foster, Britain's leading
sprint swimmer, was banned Friday for three months by the French
Swimming Federation after he was tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the ban, backdated to begin from Jan 26, only applies
to Foster competing in France, where he swims for the Cannes club,
said the federation.
</P>
<P>
Foster had tested positive for cannabis last summer. At an
appeal hearing in France last week he insisted he had never taken
the drug and must be a victim of passive smoking.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the French federation said they had no
intention of asking the International Swimming Federation (Fina)
to make the ban world wide.

HARBIN, Northeast China, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Olympic
Council (AOC) has planned to boost the size of the Asian Winter Games,
OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"That's what AOC General Assembly will work for," said the Asian
Olympic chief, who arrived here Friday afternoon to attend the Third
Asian Winter Games which opens on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long games, which features eight title events and one
performance event, has attracted about 1,000 athletes and officials

Kuwait has sent only one alpine skier to Harbin while Thailand
also has one athlete who will compete against a strong field of
women's figure skaters topped by China's world champion Chen Lu.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand and Kuwait don't have snow and ice, nor winter sports
facilities," said AOC president from Kuwait. "The presence of these

<HEADLINE> Macao Marks Anniversary of Jiang Zemin's Speech on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 celebrities in Macao
 held a seminar today to mark the speech made by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin last year on the reunification of China, saying it is
still of great importance to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lee Shing Chun, director of the Macao Daily News, praised
Jiang's eight propositions for solving the issue of Taiwan as
pragmatic and feasible.
</P>
<P>
"It has not only taken care of the overall interests of the
Chinese nation, but in particular of the interests of the 21
million Taiwan compatriots," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Taiwan authorities are seeking a real
"independence" under the "beautiful slogan" of reunification,
saying that it is very dangerous for the Taiwan authorities to do
so.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities to follow the strong desire of
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and cooperate well
 with the other side of the straits to stand the economic
challenges facing the Chinese nation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan would wake up to the danger
 at the last moment, and stop creating 'two Chinas' or 'one China,
 one Taiwan' in action rather than in words," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce in Macao, said Jiang's speech has brought a profound
influence to the promotion of relations across the Taiwan Straits
and the reunification of the motherland, and that Jiang's
propositions are still of great importance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any attempt by Taiwan separatists or foreign
anti-Chinese power to distort the history of Taiwan and split the
motherland are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"The attempts to create 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan'
 are against the will of the Chinese people, including those
living in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and other parts of the world,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities and compatriots to take
consideration of the overall interests of the Chinese nation, and
be united under the banner of patriotism so that the reunification
 of the motherland can be achieved as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> HK Experts to Study Dolphins in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The mysterious appearance of
deep-water dolphins in the shallow waters off Hong Kong has
aroused great interest among local marine experts, who are
planning a two-week sailing trip in the South China Sea in April
to find out "why".
</P>
<P>
Local media said today that the rare sighting of about 150
dolphins, in waters only 25 meters deep, was reported by
patrolling police officers on January 13.
</P>
<P>
An initial study of the tape recorded by the officers suggested
that the dolphins belonged to the common deep-sea short-beak
species, usually found in the Pacific, who have black backs and
white bellies with yellow to orange fins.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jefferson, research associate with Hong Kong's Ocean
Park Conservation Fund, said the deep-water dolphins usually live
in 200-meter waters and the cause for their appearance in shallow
waters has yet to be found out.
</P>
<P>
He said the Conservation Fund was planning a sailing trip in
the South China Sea between Hong Kong and Vietnam in April to
study the dolphins' appearance.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first study of its kind on dolphin behavior in
the South China Sea.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Aircraft
Engineering Co. (HAECO) is to start operation at its new repair
and overhaul facility in Xiamen of China's Fujian Province next
month, according to today's Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
The inland-based facility will initially serve two to three
Boeing 747 aircraft from Cathay Pacific this year, Cathay Pacific
deputy managing director David Turnbull was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two to three Boeing 747s each from Japan Airlines and Singapore
Airlines are among the first batch of aircraft scheduled for
repairs and overhaul at HAECO's wide-body, two-bay hangar
facility, which is run by its associate Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft
Engineering Co. (TAECO).
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said TAECO would likely handle more than 10 aircraft
repair and overhaul jobs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 63 million US dollar TAECO joint venture is part of Cathay
Pacific and HAECO's combined efforts to transform Xiamen into a
new aviation center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Although HAECO's performance in the first six months of 1995
was affected by depressed worldwide maintenance rates, its Xiamen
joint venture offered more competitive services, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> EC Provides 600,000 ECUs for Mine Clearance in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today decided to provide a grant of 600,000 ECUs (about 780,000
U.S. dollars) to help clear mines in the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows consultations with the World Bank and the
NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, an EC
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the EC will arrange the purchase of
mine detectors, protective suits and Global Positioning Systems,
which "will be lent to the operating agencies for a specific
period."
</P>
<P>
"The initial agency could be the peace-keeping force, but is
more likely to be teams led by engineers from the three entities"
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the equipment would later be transferred to a
national mine agency which is part of a 70-million-dollar
de-mining project under discussion between the major donors.
</P>
<P>
An estimated three million mines were laid across some 40 to 60
percent of Bosnia's land area.
</P>
<P>
Many of the major infrastructure needs of the country,
including those of energy, agriculture, transportation and
housing, are impossible to meet without a major de-mining program
undertaken over several years.
</P>
<P>
IFOR estimates that not more than 30 percent of the mines were
laid in marked and recorded mine-fields and that of these mines
probably less than 30 percent have been cleared.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Booted Out Of Two African Nations Cup  Tournaments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria would be
suspended from the next two African Nations Cup tournaments
because of its withdrawal from the 1996 tournament staged in
South Africa, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of African Football (CAF) Secretary,
Musstafa Fahmy, said the CAF Executive Committee had ruled a
number of sanctions against the national team of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Fahmy told a press conference that Nigeria had lost its entry
fee for this year's Nations Cup competition; It had been fined
15,000 U.S. dollars and would be suspended from the next two
African Nations Cup tournaments in 1998 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria would have to pay their dues and if they failed to do
so they would remain suspended "after the two editions of the
African Nations Cup competitions", Fahmy said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria withdrew its national team from the Nations Cup
competition, citing fears for the safety of its players and
saying South Africa could not guarantee the security of the
players.
</P>
<P>
The South African Football Association and the South African
government denied the charges and appealed to the Nigerian
government to reconsider their decision.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 African Nations Cup competition was finally played
among 15 instead of 16 teams.

<HEADLINE> Framework of Guangdong's Labor Market Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A framework of a labor
market, comprising introduction, work training, unemployment
insurance and labor services, has come into shape in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The number of introduction agencies had expanded to over 1,400
by the end of 1995, creating a favorable condition for the
rational flow of labor within the province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 11 million rural laborers have
transfered to non-agricultural sectors, 6.5 million workers have
migrated to Guangdong from outside the province, and more than two
million urban workers who were either unemployed or dissatisfied
with their old jobs have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's urban unemployment rate stands at less that two
percent currently, according to an official with the provincial
Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers in primary, secondary and tertiary
industries account for 43 percent, 32 percent and 25 percent of
the total, respectively, while during the Seventh Five-Year Plan
(1986-1990), the respective percentages were 53, 25 and 22.
</P>
<P>
A reemployment project, which is practised in such cities as
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, has reemployed some 80,000 workers,
effectively making up for the shortcomings of the market mechanism
and promoting the orderly operation of the labor market.

<HEADLINE> More Nigerian Troops Sent For Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The first of two battalions of
Nigerian troops has arrived in Liberia to boost the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, the local newspaper "Nigerian
Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 800 troops joined the 8,000-strong Nigerian-led ECOMOG on
Tuesday. The second of the two battalions promised by Nigeria
last year is expected to arrive "shortly", an ECOMOG source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An unspecified number of Ghanaian troops, part of a battalion
promised by the Ghanaian authorities, arrived there last December
to help augment the strength of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace accord signed last August by all parties
to the Liberian conflict, ECOMOG began a deployment throughout
Liberia on December 14 in preparation for the disarmament of some
60,000 fighters of the armed factions, which was due to begin in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
However, the exercise met a setback when militiamen of the
armed faction ULIMO-J attacked peacekeepers on December 28,
forcing ECOMOG to temporarily suspend the deployment earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations estimates, more than 150,000
people were killed in the Liberian civil war, which broke out in
December, 1989.

<HEADLINE> Ciller Abandons Attempts to Form Coalition with Motherland Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's True Path Party (DYP)
Chairperson and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said here
today that she would abandon her efforts to form a coalition
government with the Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz rejected her latest
proposals for the creation of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"He told me he rejected my proposals, without needing to take
them to his party executives," Ciller told reporters after a
40-minute meeting with Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said she had proposed to Yilmaz that they share out the
powers of leadership in a coalition or form minority government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller added Yilmaz was using their so far efforts to form a
coalition as an excuse to form an alliance with the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP),
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said she would formally return her mandate
to form a government to President Suleyman Demirel after talks
with her party deputies Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told another press conference that he turned down
Ciller's proposals because she insisted on remaining premier.
</P>
<P>
"We have not ruled out coalition partnership with RP although
it is going to be very difficult to reach common ground with it,"
Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, Yilmaz rejected Ciller's initial offer that
they rotate the premiership in a coalition, citing Ciller's
proposal that she take first shot at the top job.
</P>
<P>
Ciller received the mandate after RP leader Necmettin Erbakan
failed to form a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said it would be pointless for Yilmaz to start
negotiations with her. "Nothing is left to talk about between us,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Demirel said today he would designate Yilmaz next to
form the government if Ciller fails to achieve it. ANAP has 133
deputies in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Demirel told reporters that Turkey is not an uncertainty
country and everything could be solved within democratic rules.
</P>
<P>
The president called on the Turkish people to be patient and
wait for the establishment of the government.

SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- This economic center of China
plans to introduce foreign investment to wider fields.

ZHENGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The chemical fertilizer
output of central China's Henan Province hit 10.5 million tons

Henan turned out one tenth of the country's chemical fertilizer

By the end of last November the whole chemical fertilizer
sector generated profits of 312 million yuan, an increase of 162
percent over the corresponding period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Such a rapid growth should be attributed to the support of the

last year, according to economists here. In addition, the local
government allocated a special loan of 20 million yuan to the
sector.

<HEADLINE> Crisis In Mozambique-WFP Relations Solved, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in the relations
between the Mozambican government and the World Food Program
(WFP) resulting from misunderstanding had been solved, Mozambican
Deputy Minister of Finance Ms. Luisa Diogo said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP on February 1 suspended the distribution of relief
food to 350,000 famine-stricken Mozambicans in the south of the
country, in an angry reaction to the imposition by the Mozambican
customs of tariffs on the 4,000 tonnes of maize it imported.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was caused by customs officials' misunderstanding
of government decrees issued recently, Ms.Luisa Diogo said.
</P>
<P>
She said although the decrees stipulate that some
international organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations in
Mozambique would no longer be exempted from taxes, the goods such
organs import from outside Mozambique for relief to famine
victims could continue to be tariff-exempt.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislature to Spur Law-Making, Law-Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) will continue to enhance
law-making and the supervision of law-enforcement this year to
ensure the success of the country's reform, opening-up and
socialist modernization drive, a top legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee Vice-Chairman Wang Hanbin made the
remark at a gathering to greet the impending Spring Festival, with
the presence of more than 200 NPC delegates living in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The Standing Committee will continue to put special stress on
drawing up economic laws, and working on laws about education,
science, cultural undertakings, public health, environmental
protection, democratic and political construction, anti-corruption
and the punishment of crimes," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress was held last March the committee has deliberated 27
draft laws and draft regulations related to laws, 22 of which have
been approved.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in 1995 the committee exerted greater efforts
than previous years to strengthen law enforcement. This year it
will make more endeavors to ensure a better enforcement of the
laws.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the committee will expand exchanges and
co-operation with foreign countries, because the foreign affairs
work of the NPC is a key component of China's overall foreign
affairs endeavors, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the committee will make proper preparations for
the 96th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, to be held
in Beijing this year, Wang said.

<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's trade gap with the
rest of the world was cut by two-thirds in November, easing fears
that a slowdown in European markets might seriously damage exports.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Central Statistical Office Thursday
showed that the trade deficit narrowed dramatically to 567 million
pounds (856 million U.S. dollars) in November from 1.6 billion
pounds (2.4 billion dollars) in October.
</P>
<P>
The better-than-expected data reassured financial markets that
the UK was not heading back towards a large trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Britain's trade deficit with the European Union (EU) countries
fell sharply from 502 million pounds (758 million dollars) in
October to 131 million pounds (198 million dollars) in November,
its lowest for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit was also reduced by a fall in the deficit
with countries outside the EU in November to 436 million pounds
(501 million dollars) from 1.1 billion pounds (1.7 billion
dollars) in October.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Foreign Funds for Harnessing Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China issued a call here today
to world financial agencies to lend a hand in the massive project
to harness the severe soil erosion on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Duan Qiaofu, deputy director of the Soil and Water Conservation
Department of the Water Resources Ministry, said that there is a
total of 352,000 sq km of soil erosion area on the upper reaches
of the third-longest river in the world, while only 39,400 sq km
has been harnessed in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
"At such a speed, the whole situation could be reversed only
after 60 or 70 years," she said. "The speed is incompatible with
that of the national economic development," she added.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the official said, 1.56 billion tons of soil is
lost in the region, and over 500 million tons is washed into the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
She expressed appreciation for the World Bank's support for
China's soil conservancy work in the area of the Yellow River,
China's second-longest. The bank provided 150 million US dollars
in soft loans for the Yellow River project, which has proved
helpful in improving local farmers' financial situation and living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
For the Yangtze River, she said, China has yet to receive any
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
She believes that foreign funds can play a positive role in
alleviating the soil erosion on the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River region and bring great benefits to the local people there.
</P>
<P>
"China has 70 million people suffering from poverty, the
majority of whom live in soil-erosion regions in hilly and
mountainous areas," she said. "Soil conservation holds the key to
speeding up the economic development of these regions."
</P>
<P>
The official said that China's strenuous efforts in the region,
where more than half of the farm area is on slopes, has seen
pleasing results.
</P>
<P>
During the past seven years the farming area has increased by
more than 40,000 ha annually, and a total of 300,000 ha of
mountain slopes have been turned into terraced fields. The
farmers' per capita grain output has shot up to over 450 kg from
360 kg, despite the continued growth of population.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to bringing local farmers
material benefits while launching water and soil conservation
projects, Duan explained.
</P>
<P>
She said that China has planted 384,000 ha of fruit trees and
1.03 million ha of poplars, pines and other sorts of trees for the
purpose of soil control on the upper reaches of the Yangtze during
the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has built more than three million small-scale
water-conservancy projects and over 50,000 km of irrigation canals
there.

<P>
Uzbekistan's Rustam Akramov, who headed the Indian national

</P>
<P>
"India has the potential to be one of Asia's leading football

to the top," said the AFC's citation.
</P>
<P>
Akramov, who coached Uzbekistan to Asian Games glory in 1994,

<HEADLINE> "Better Reporting Can Improve China's International Status" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua)-- A five-day national working
conference on how to improve reporting on China to the outside
world closed here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged publicity departments all over the country to
make a thoroughgoing presentation of China in the next few years
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics to make the country better known to
the rest of the world, and to create and safeguard the image of
socialist China so as to create a favorable international
environment for its reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
It was learned from the meeting that top Chinese leaders have
attached great importance to the work of reporting about China to
the outside world. They gave detailed instructions on the
importance of this job in the new historical period, and the
guiding principles and methods governing it.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, director of the Information Office of the State
Council, said at the conference that China is at a crucial stage
of economic and social development. The domestic and international
situations have set new and higher requirements for the work of
reporting about China to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental interests of the country must be resolutely
defended in this work, and principles must be adhered to strictly
in matters concerning state sovereignty, national interests and
national prestige," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to positive reporting, and the
interests of overseas audiences should be given better
consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also called on people concerned to use easy words
and techniques for the better understanding by the audiences, and
to convince audiences with facts.
</P>
<P>
"More efforts must be put into the reporting of China's
economic progress and systematic introduction of the country's
blueprint for economic development over the next five-to-15 years,
and the reporting of the country's major sectors, key construction
projects and regional economy," he said, promising that China will
strengthen its contacts with foreign news media for more exchanges
and co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"New situations and problems should be studied in a timely
fashion, and new publicity methods should be developed to promote
the proficiency of our reporting," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Officials with publicity departments of the provinces,
autonomous regions and major cities across the country in charge
of reporting about China for the outside world, as well as leading
officials of departments under the central authorities and news
organizations, participated in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Further Ease Foreign Exchange Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today certified the urgency of a bill repealing Republic Act No.
529, to put further flesh into the foreign exchange liberalization
program of the government.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate President Neptali Gonzales, he said the
repeal of the law is needed "in order to allow the capital market
to absorb and utilize excess foreign liquidity, thereby insuring
adequate supply of long-term funds necessary to spur economic
growth."
</P>
<P>
The law was enacted and enforced in 1950 when controls over
foreign exchange and foreign trade were in place.
</P>
<P>
It required all obligations entering into the Philippines to be
denominated in the Philippine peso alone.
</P>
<P>
The repeal of the bill is being sought in Senate Bill 1081.
</P>
<P>
Under Senate Bill 1081, obligations in the country can now be
paid in any foreign currency "so long as there is mutual agreement
between the two parties," namely, the borrower and the lender.
</P>
<P>
The bill will complement the foreign currency liberalization
programs now being implemented by the central bank and further
push the liberalization of foreign trade and foreign exchange
programs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Risks WTO Sanctions on Agro Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will face
sanctions from the World Trade Organization (WTO) unless it passes
legislation scrapping quotas on selected agricultural products by
March this year.
</P>
<P>
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) being
implemented by the WTO sets January 1, 1995 as the deadline for
breaking down quantitative restrictions to free trade.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the difficulty in securing legislation and
the natural sensitivity of agricultural items, member-countries
were given until the end of 1995 to replace quotas with high
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
A WTO committee on agriculture is scheduled to meet in the
middle of March to assess how many of the 126 signatories to the
GATT have fulfilled commitments to convert agricultural
quantitative restrictions into tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Trade Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today he was confident
the proposed legislation lifting the quotas on agriculture
products would be passed before the March meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Philippines, quotas on onions, potatoes,
garlic, cabbages and coffee should have been replaced with tariffs
by now.
</P>
<P>
The WTO commitments also remove the need for prior approval for
the importation of certain agricultural products, except corn and
rice.
</P>
<P>
The high tariff walls imposed in leu of the quotas will be
gradually phased down over a 10-year period, during which local
sectors are to brace themselves for increased foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, government officials said they will try to extend the
tariff shield for rice for as long as international trading rules
will allow.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is one of the three countries exempted under
the GATT from the immediate liberalization of rice trading.

<HEADLINE> Economic, Trade Exchanges across Taiwan Straits Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, Chinese minister of
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said here today: "We
sincerely welcome the Taiwan authorities to take all measures
beneficial to economic exchanges and trade across the Taiwan
Straits and to the realization of postal, air and shipping
services."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here today in the commemoration of the
first anniversary of a speech on the reunification of the
motherland made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Wu noted that
Jiang's speech has given an impetus to the new growth of the
relations on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, their economic
relations and trade in particular.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States
last year infringed upon the whole interests of the Chinese nation
and sabotaged the advancing economic relations across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that judging from the changes of the relations on
both sides of the straits over the past year, people can see
clearly that the eight proposals put forward by Jiang Zemin are
conducive to the growth of relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"If some leaders of the Taiwan authorities go against the
historical trend and engage in activities splitting the
motherland, the relations across the Taiwan Straits will be
damaged," she said.
</P>

Wu said it is absolutely impermissible for the Taiwan
authorities to engage in activities creating "two Chinas" and "one
China, one Taiwan" in the world on the one hand, and get benefits
from economic exchanges and trade across the Taiwan Straits on the
other.
</P>
<P>
It is time for those who cherish such illusions to change over
to new ways, she added.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federations of Trade Unions, Youth and Women also
jointly held a meeting here today to commemorate the first
anniversary of Jiang's speech.
</P>
<P>
The participants voiced the hope that the Taiwan authorities
would comply with the historical trend of the times and
aspirations of the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits
to take specific steps so as to realize the postal, air and
shipping services according to the "one-China" principle.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Suspended from African Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has been suspended
from the African Nations Cup till the end of the century, the
African football confederation (CAF) announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However there was no immediate confirmation that the ban would
be upgraded worldwide as FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter
promised before the January 13 to February 3 event.
</P>
<P>
If it is, Nigeria will be barred from the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria reached the second round of the 1994 World Cup and only
inexperience prevented a famous victory over three-times world
champions Italy.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the tournament's executive committee
on Wednesday -- two days before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
CAF rules state any team which pulls out less than 20 days
before the finals, as happened with Nigeria, will be banned for
the next two tournaments.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Airlines (SIA) will
invest in fleet and infrastructure in line with its strategies for
maintaining its role as a leader in the global aviation industry,
a senior SIA official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fourth SIA world media forum, Managing Director
Cheong Choong Kong said that the airline was investing in fleet
and infrastructure to take advantage of the expected surge in air
travel especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He cited SIA's aircraft order last November for more than 60
Boeing 777s as an example in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The fleet will more than double over the next nine years from
70 aircraft at present to around 150 at the end of 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheong added that the order was a reaffirmation of the
company's faith in the steady growth in the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the SIA group would look for opportunities to diversify
its sources of revenue with its core business through joint
ventures in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The SIA intends to develop its route network and fleet
steadily, in line with the airline's projected annual average
growth rate of eight to ten percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheong also said that the SIA was looking into electronic
ticketing, ticketless travel and selling through the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Syria Blames Israel for Gap on Security Arrangements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Syria has attributed the wide
gap between it and Israel to the failure of the Israeli side to
commit itself to the principles of security arrangements on either
side of the border lines of June 4, 1967 war after its pulling out
from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Syrian Arab News Agency aired
Thursday night, Syrian Ambassador in Washington and chief
negotiator Walid al Muallim said that the Syrian and Israeli
delegations submitted their proposals respectively during their
fresh round of talks between January 29-31 in Maryland, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The gap was quite big and no tangible progress has been made on
security arrangements on the Golan Heights after the withdrawal of
Israeli troops and the related principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the fresh round of talks enabled the
two parties to thoroughly deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Israelis were rather exaggerating in
their presentation and understanding of security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official stressed that Israel did not take into
consideration that that the crux of peace is to move from the
state of belligerency into that of peace.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Muallim said, Israel's exaggeration has led to widening
the gap rather than bridging it.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. role, he said Secretary of State Warren Christopher
had twice participated in the Syrian-Israeli talks with a view to
emphasizing the U.S. role as an effective partner and
demonstrating the U.S. determination to reach agreement on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace process in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a statement issued Wednesday night by the United
States, Israel and Syria said that this week's talks at Maryland
laid solid bases for next week's shuttle diplomacy between Israel
and Syria by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel have been on and off for
more than four years. The two sides have been mainly disputing
over the security arrangements on the Golan Heights and peace terms
after an eventual Israeli withdrawal.

PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Katja Seizinger of Germany won a
women's Alpine skiing World Cup super-giant slalom in one minute
11.32 seconds in Val D'Isereon, France, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The win helped Seizinger move close to Anita Wachter of

</P>
<P>
Wachter finished 20th in the day's competition with a modest

There will be two downhills on Saturday and a super-G on Sunday

Renate Goetschl of Austria came in second with 0.26 of a second
back, while German Hilde Gerg took third 0.39 behind the winner.
</P>

Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria, who had won two of the four
super-Gs held so far, was in front in all intermediate times but
tentative skiing in the tricky lower part of the course dropped
her to eighth place.

She lost her first place in the World Cup super-G standings to

SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded American Jeff
Tarango made a surprise at the Shanghai Open tennis tournament
when he crashed to unseeded Mark Knowles of the Bahamas 5-7, 7-5,
6-2 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tarango, notorious on the circuit following his temper tantrums
and walkout at Wimbledon last year, needed little provocation to
explode after failing to close out the match against Knowles in
the second set of their match.
</P>
<P>
The American missed two match points in the ninth game, letting
Knowle back into the contest on an ice-cold unheated indoor
court. Tarango then lost serve to start the third set.
</P>
<P>
Knowles, who won only four of 11 singles matches in 1995 and
has now won his third of the week here, will be one of three
first-time semifinaists playing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bahamas player, who saved five of seven break points,
nailed a dozen aces in his comeback against only six for Tarango.
</P>
<P>
Also through to the semifinals is first-timer Michael Tebbutt
of Australia, who ousted the fifth seed Marcos Ondrusak of South
Africa 6-3, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
Playing for the other spot in the Sunday finale will be
Britain's second seed Tim Hanman and Andrei Olhovskiy. They won

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM on Asia-Europe Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHUKET, THAILAND, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the
forthcoming Asia-Europe meeting will have far-reaching
significance as it is the first time in history that leaders of
Asia and Europe sit together to discuss future cooperation between
the two continents.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is attending an informal meeting of 10 Asian foreign
ministers in preparation for the Asia-Europe meeting, scheduled
for March 1-2 in Bangkok, said in an interview with Chinese
correspondents that at a time when the world is approaching the
21st century, developing Asian-European relations is beneficial to
world peace and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Chinese Premier Li Peng will attend the meeting,
which is expected to be attended by leaders from 10 Asian and 15
European countries, namely, China, Japan, South Korea, the seven
ASEAN members, and the 15 members of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He said China will take an active part in the process of the
Asia-Europe meeting and will make efforts for the development of
the long-standing, stable and friendly relations between China and
other Asian and European countries, and for the complete success
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Asia and Europe each has its own unique
characteristics and advantages, and they are complementary in
trade and economic matters. All these offer excellent
opportunities for Asian-European cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Asian-European relations, the most important
field where direct fruit is most likely to be produced is
cooperation in the economy and trade. He expressed the hope that
the Asia-Europe meeting would do something in this respect.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, relations between China and the EU and its
members have been developing continuously: mutual high-level
visits are frequent; there has been more dialogue on political
matters and better mutual understanding; and economic and trade
ties are expanding, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
While Asian and European countries have extensive common
interests, they also have vast differences in the state of their
countries and different viewpoints, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that the meeting will display mutual
respect and the spirit of equal treatment and should not let
differences interfere with the theme of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said Asian countries have more or less the same viewpoint
regarding the orientation of cooperation and goal of the
Asia-Europe meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that politically, they hope for enhanced mutual
understanding through face-to-face talks and exchange of views by
their leaders; economically, they hope to make full use of the
complementarity and expand cooperation in such fields as trade,
investment, science and technology, human resources,
infrastructure, environmental protection and eradication of
poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- ComStream, a leading US
satellite communications corporation, has launched a major
campaign to expand its business in China, especially in the area
of satellite-based telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"With a population of 1.2 billion, China holds a very, very
important place in ComStream's global marketing strategy," said
Ronald Derry, president of the company, in a recent interview with
Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
He said that ComStream will develop satellite and cable-based
systems and products for multi-media networks, as well as other
telecommunications systems, products and networks for both
high-capacity and low-capacity telephone and data communications.
</P>
<P>
Edward Triebell, ComStream's regional director for China and
North Asia, said that his company is expected to sign a contract
with China soon for a satellite communications system in the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
ComStream is also targeting the vast rural areas, where 80
percent of China's population lives and the demand for
satellite-based telecommunications is on the rise, Triebell said.
</P>
<P>
ComStream has been doing business in China for more than 24
years. Its first venture was the installation of an international
satellite earth station in 1972, when US President Richard Nixon
paid a state visit to China. The news was aired to the world
through this gateway facility, built in conjunction with China's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
To date, the corporation has clinched contracts worth a total
of 115 million US dollars and built over 3,000 earth stations in
29 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The firm has also established offices and service centers in
China's major cities, and transferred technology. Many
broadcasting stations and television stations in China use
ComStream equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal for the China market is simple -- to be the first
thought in everyone's mind when someone says 'satellite
communications'," said Triebell.

LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African High
Commission and the Burkinese Embassy here have denied allegations
of their countries' involvement in an international plot to
destabilize the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Burkina Faso had offered one of its
military camps to the Nigerian political group, the National
Democratic Coalition (NADECO), to facilitate an anti-government
plot. NADECO is now abroad on self-exile.

It was also alleged that South Africa had donated a sum of

"The allegation is baseless, and very negative, which will not
do the relationship of both countries any good," South African
Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria Jan H. Van Jaarsveed told the
Nigerian "Guardian" newspaper yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Burkinese Embassy official dismissed the
allegations as "not only a tissue of lies but most disturbing".
</P>
<P>
"My country will not wish Nigeria bad or to destabilize it,
because we import virtually everything from Nigeria," the
official said.

<HEADLINE> No Decision Reached on Senna Case Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 2 (Xinhua) -- No decision has been reached on
the Ayrton Senna crash case, the office of the investigating
magistrate said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no decision and no statement from the
magistrate. That's the situation," an assistant to Bologna
prosecutor Maurizio Passarini said.
</P>
<P>
She was responding to a British newspaper report which said
Frank Williams and Patrick Head, the two senior officials of the
Williams Formula One team, were expected to be charged with
manslaughter following the inquiry into the death of their driver
at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The Independent report, citing Italian sources, said the
prosecutor was expected to ask for two-year sentences for
Williams and Head but that a form of plea bargaining could result
in suspended sentences.
</P>
<P>
"These are all hypotheses that are being made but on the basis
of nothing, in the sense that the magistrate has not made any
statements. They are just suppositions," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that Passarini had not set a time limit to complete
the investigation and the possibility of shelving it was not to be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
Senna was killed after smashing into a wall at Imola. Part of
the car's suspension broke off in the impact and pierced his
helmet.
</P>
<P>
Passarini is considering the findings of Enrico Lorenzini, a
professor of engineering at Bologna University who was the chief
investigator into the crash.
</P>
<P>
Passarini must decide whether to proceed with any legal
action, including against Williams officials.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Lorenzini denied that he had told a British
newspaper that a badly welded steering rod was to blame for the
Brazilian's death.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Not To Join In Regional Force For Peacekeeping In Burundi (By Pei Shanqin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is not prepared
to form a regional peacekeeping force in wartorn Burundi in place
of the proposed United Nations force.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Ugandan High Commissioner to Tanzania
Godfrey Kalimugogo in an interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough problems to keep us busy. Our priority is our
development problems," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner held that Burundis had a moral
responsibility to solve their own crisis. The task of effecting
peaceful co-existence between different ethnic groups in the
country was for the government and fighting forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kalimugogo said that Ugandans learnt to keep peace the hard
way in the Uganda War. "We are still fighting the effects of the
situation we had in the 70s and 80s," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He held that Uganda and its neighbours were not super-powers
able to maintain a peacekeeping force. He said they did not have
enough resources to carry out such an ambitious plan.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire had agreed to
form a joint force in place of the proposed United Nations force.

<HEADLINE> IOC Urges Sydney to Quicken Olympic Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) said on Friday that Sydney should accelerate its
pace in the construction of the 2000 Olympic village, media
village and technical officials' village.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by the chairman of the IOC's coordination
commission, Jacques Rogge, who is paying a visit to the Olympic
venue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the IOC was not overly concerned because "you
are so far ahead on all the other points that maybe we're getting
concerned about something that we shouldn't."
</P>
<P>
Rogge said the commission was happy with environmental and
ticketing arrangements here.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG), Gary Pemberton, said SOCOG will give the next
priority to the village.
</P>
<P>
IOC director-general Francois Carrard was also in Sydney on
Friday and denied there was any feud with local Olympics
organisers over funds to be raised from the allocation of
television rights payments.
</P>
<P>
Pemberton expressed disappointment on Wednesday at the decision
that IOC awarded the rights to the European Broadcasting Union
(EBU) instead of a News Corporation that vowed to pay more.
</P>
<P>
But Carrard said on Friday that relations between the IOC and
SOCOG were "absolutely excellent".

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Jojo Sinclair, world women
bodybuilding champion of Singapore, was banned for life by the
International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) for using
steroids.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Bodybuilders Federation (SBBF) said on Friday
that Sinclair has been ordered to return her gold medal to the
IFBB headquarters in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, the first Asian woman to win a world bodybuilding
title, has denied taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
She tested positive for Stanozolol, an anabolic steroid, after
winning the world championship in Belgium last November.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the first test were made public on January 9
but Sinclair, protesting her innocence, insisted on a second.
</P>
<P>
She went to Belgium last week to observe the second test,
which was carried out on January 23. The Singapore federation
said the results of the second sample were positive.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair has two weeks in which to appeal to the IFBB for a
final evaluation and investigation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Participate In UN Peacekeeping Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua)-- South Africa has agreed to
participate in United Nations peacekeeping activities, in return
for the cancellation of the country's multi-million-rand debt to
the world roganisation, the local daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed yesterday by Defence Minister Joe Modise at
a South African Air Force Day parade at Zwartkop air force base
near Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Assuring the air force that its future was guaranteed despite
defence budget cuts, Modise said the demands on the country's
military would be considerable in the future. Air power played an
important part in military capability, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and security in our region is obviously a very high
priority," said the minister, adding South Africa was also
committed to participating in United Nations peacekeeping
operations, especially after the debt write-off by the UN.
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly last year agreed to write off South
Africa's 360 million rand (about 98.6 million US dollar) debt,
which accumulated over the years when the country was suspended
from the membership because of its apartheid policies.
</P>
<P>
However, no timetable has been set for when the South African
forces would begin assisting the world body in peace-keeping
activities, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It said the governments of the countries concerned would first
have to be consulted, but it was believed that South Africa would
help with UN peace-enforcing operations on the African continent
in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had already assisted with humanitarian aid to
Angola, Rwanda and Mozambique. enditem

<HEADLINE> Seles Suffers Earliest Exit Since her Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles of the United States
suffered the earliest exit since her comeback last year when she
crashed to Iva Majoli in the quarter-finals of the Toray Pan
Pacific Open tennis tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The world co-number one, who captured her fourth Australian
Open victory last week, staved off two match points before going
down 6-1, 6-7 (5/7), 4-6 to the 18-year-old Croatian.
</P>
<P>
Seles had lost only seven games in the previous two
encounters. She stood firm in her service games to take the first
set with ease. But the remainder of the 118-minute match appeared
to be a power-packed confrontation between the two hard-hitters
with the momentum turning round a few times.
</P>
<P>
Seles broke Majoli in the seventh game of the second set to get
ahead 4-3. But Majoli never hesitated to attack, relying on her
dangerous forehand to break back for 4-4 before going into a
tie-breaker, which she won to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
Seles, then, recovered from two breaks down at 0-3 in the
decider to get ahead 4-3, but Majoli scored a crucial break in
the ninth for 5-4, putting an end to a fifth deuce with a
forehand winner, and served out for the match.
</P>
<P>
It was the first defeat for Seles this season after winning in
Sydney and Melbourne and second after her comeback following the
runner-up finish behind Steffi Graf of Germany in the U.S. Open in
September.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-final Saturday, Majoli will take on rising
15-year-old Swiss star Martina Hingis, who eliminated the last
local hope, Naoko Sawamatsu, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final match became an all-Spanish affair between
1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez and former world number
one Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Martinez was an easy 6-2, 6-3 winner over Lindsay Davenport of
the United States, while Sanchez Vicario fought off Magdalena
Maleeva of Bulgaria 7-5, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> UK Oil, Gas Output Reaches 10-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's oil and gas production
last year reached its highest level in a decade, according to a
latest report by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Average daily oil output reached 2.54 million barrels, just
below the record of 2.59 million barrels set in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Britain's North Sea oil-fields produced 927 million barrels in
the year, which amounts to 360 gallons per capita, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Gas output rose even faster, increasing by 8 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in output was spurred by the growth in demand from
new gas-fired power stations and because of the unusually cold
weather in December. Gas production during the month was 34
percent higher than the same period in 1994, according to the
report.

NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government has sent
the Permanent Secretary in the Transport Ministry, Sospeter
Arasa, on compulsory leave in connection with a corruption probe
at the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA).
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Thursday, the Head of the Civil Service,

effect.
</P>

The move was taken "as the government probe on the Kenya Ports
Authority and customs department continues," the statement said.
</P>

Arasa is the most senior government official to be sent on
forced leave following what investigators say may be the most
far-reaching corruption scandal yet uncovered in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
About 20 other officials have been suspended in the past two
weeks. The scandal involves disappearance of 1,200 cars and the
port is described as "rotten".

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Hospitals Tend to Do Unnecessary Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian doctors in private
hospitals tend to compel patients to undergo unnecessary
examinations or treatments,
leading to high cost medication in the country.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Azrul Azwar, chairman of the
Indonesian Medical Association, at a hearing here today with the
House of Representatives Commission VIII on Health.
</P>
<P>
He explained that many private hospitals give patients
complicated treatments, instead of the standard ones. As a
result, patients have to pay a lot more than they should, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Azrul's criticism is by no means new. For the past several
years, health workers and consumer organizations have been
protesting the practice of forcing patients to do various
unnecessary tests and treatments.
</P>
<P>
The association asked the government to grant it the authority
to revoke the license of profiteering doctors who subject their
patients to unnecessary tests.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that a threat of license revocation might prove to
be a more effective means to check such doctors than the current
punishment of expulsion from the association.
</P>
<P>
If the association has the authority to revoke licenses,
doctors will be reluctant to compel patients to undergo
unnecessary examinations or treatments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Manpower Ministry to Drop Levies on Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Ministry of
Manpower plans to phase out various levies it has been imposing on
companies.
</P>
<P>
Yudo Swasono, head of the ministry's Planning and Development
Agency, explained to the local press here today that the plan will
enable the companies to pay their workers more and make them more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The ministry currently charges no less than 37 different levies
in connection with workers' safety and health.
</P>
<P>
These levies prevent companies from paying their employees
better wages.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's survey of companies, some 5 to 30
percent of their production costs are used to pay official levies
and bribes.
</P>
<P>
Many companies have complained in recent years about their
difficulties in keeping up with the hikes in the officially-set
minimum wages chiefly because of various levies, both official and
illegal.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to raise workers' productivity to make
the country competitive in the region as well as in world markets.

<HEADLINE> Record Chemical Fertilizer Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical fertilizer
output last year hit a record high, up 12.9 percent from the
previous year, at 114 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, minister of the chemical industry, told a recent
national working conference on chemical fertilizer production here
that the quality of fertilizers has also improved, and material
and energy consumption has fallen.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the country's 16 large fertilizer
plants, some of whose products are under state monopoly in sales
and marketing, had sold 6.73 million tons of chemical fertilizer
to the state, and achieved their output goal a month earlier than
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized plants still maintained 100 percent of
standard production rate in urea, ammonia and fine methanol, and
that of small enterprises was above 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year,the government granted favorable status to the
fertilizer producers in taxes, electric power, materials,
transportation and loan-granting. A total of three billion yuan in
government loans was put into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Many of the large and mid-sized enterprises have recovered from
their former status as money-losing companies and begun to make
profits.

<HEADLINE> China Losing No Time in Three Gorges Project Resettlement Work (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest government body, has
formulated regulations on the project's construction and
resettlement work.
</P>
<P>
The official went on to say that central China's Hubei
Province, where the dam site is located, has completed drawing up
the resettlement plan, which has been evaluated by experts and is
waiting for provincial government approval.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province, which neighbors Hubei, is also taking active
steps to work out a plan for resettlement work, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to help boost economy in the reservoir area, the
country has given open-city status to the ports of Chongqing,
Fuling, Wanxian and Yichang, along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
In addition, after the project's power station begins to
generate electricity, the country will use part of the fees
collected to set up a foundation for developing the reservoir
area, and it has arranged a number of projects to provide jobs for
people to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government has also eased restrictions on
giving priority solely to grain growing, and is allowing farmers
to diversify economy, such as planting citrus trees, medicinal
herbs, tea, and developing animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the reservoir area are also encouraged to open
terraced fields and go in for water-control projects, on the
condition that water and soil be conserved, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement work has won the support of the whole
country. By last December, different areas had provided 450
million yuan in assistance. In most central government
departments, offices have been set up to help with the work.
</P>
<P>
"China will spare no effort in doing a good job in the
resettlement work and in making living conditions of the people
resettled even better than they were before," the official said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China is scheduled to hold a
national conference on coordinating efforts to spread scientific
knowledge among its 1.2 billion people and to fight "superstition
and pseudoscience" during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan, general secretary of the State Science and Technology
Commission (SSTC), said the conference's purpose is to raise the
scientific level of the Chinese people and promoting rapid
scientific, economic, and social development.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to be held by SSTC, the Propaganda Department
of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, and the China
Association for Science and Technology February 7-9 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"An outline for spreading scientific knowledge for 1996-2000,
including goals and tasks, will be finalized at the meeting," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 180 million people above the age of 15, out of the
country's 1.2 billion population, are illiterate or semiliterate
and many others know little about science, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is only by raising the scientific level of the Chinese
people during a rather short period of time that China can survive
in a world of intense economic competition, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology is characterised not only by its
development but also by the extent to which scientific knowledge
is spread, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Losing No Time in Three Gorges Project Resettlement Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China has lost no time in
carrying out resettlement work in the Three Gorges Project so that
damming of the Yangtze River can be successfully completed by 1997.
</P>
<P>
"China has put three billion yuan (about 361 million US
dollars) into this work since 1993," said a senior official in
charge of the work in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The official said China has lost no time in putting up new
residences and infrastructure in preparation for resettling those
people displaced by the project.
</P>
<P>
This year, China will focus on resettling the areas of Yichang,
Zigui, Badong and Xingshan in Hubei, and Sichuan's Wushan, Fengjie
and Yunyang that will be affected by the damming of the Yangtze
next year.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement of other districts in the reservoir area will also
keep in pace with the development of the project.
</P>
<P>
Damming the river in 1997 is the first stage of the project,
which is divided into three stages and is expected to be completed
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, according to satistics, more than 840,000 people were
to be resettled, but the number of people that need to be
relocated is growing at an annual rate of 1.2 percent due to the
fact that the local birth rate is exceeding mortality rate and
because of other factors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government plans to allocate 40 billion yuan (based
on May 1993 prices) for the resettlement. To manage that sizable
sum well, the State Auditing Administration and the Ministry of
Finance have checked use of the money at periodical intervals, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng is paying close attention to the resettlement
work, and has said that "success of the Three Gorges Project
hinges on its resettlement work."
</P>
<P>
China has set up organizations at various levels to take charge
of the resettlement work. In the reservoir area, each county, city
or province has a deputy chief who is held responsible for the
resettlement work.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has seen a steady
decrease in the incidence of such infectious diseases as dysentery
and hepatitis, according to the Municipal Public Health Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of contagious diseases dropped to 0.32 percent in
1995 from 2.2 percent in 1981, an official of the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of dysentery dropped 7.8 percent from the
previous year and that of hepatitis 28.5 percent, though the city
saw a high incidence of dysentery in the first half of the year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the decrease to stricter food
inspection last year.
</P>
<P>
Among 15 major kinds of food, 11 met the standard of quality
set by the local health bureau, according to a survey, he
explained, and noted that 90 percent of aquatic products, cereals,

<HEADLINE> China Sees Trade Surplus in Computer Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Customs statistics show that
foreign trade in computer products has been on the plus side over
the past three years, at 1.85 billion US dollars' worth by the end
of last November.
</P>
<P>
Total export value of computer products before last December was
4.05 billion dollars, with import value topping 2.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China started to export computer products in the late 1980s,
but export value of products had never exceeded import value
before 1993.
</P>
<P>
Of the enterprises involved in foreign trade in computers,
state-owned ones rank second, after the solely foreign-funded
enterprises, in terms of total export value.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect China's export value of computer products to
reach 10 billion dollars by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
However, computer smuggling still constitutes a big threat to
the healthy development of the country's computer industry.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Chilean Leaders Discuss Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji and Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza held talks
Tuesday to discuss bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said the Chilean government and its people warmly
welcome and attach much importance to Zhu's visit.
</P>
<P>
He showed his admiration for China's achievements in economic
development and expressed the hope that bilateral ties will be
further pushed forward.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago,
the two countries, proceeding from the fundamental interests of
the two peoples and world peace and adhering to the basic
principles governing international relations, have worked to
develop their relations, Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed confidence that Such relations will
be further strengthened with the expansion of economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the two sides enjoyed successful cooperation in
various fields in the past 25 years and the scope of cooperation
is expanding.
</P>
<P>
President Eduardo Frei's visit to China in November helped
strengthen the Sino-Chilean relations, Zhu noted. And his visit to
Chile is aimed at the same goal.
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Alvaro Garcia said his country offers to be
a window through which China can export commodities to Latin
America and hoped that Chile at the same time may increase exports
to China.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed interest in exploring ways with China of
expanding cooperation in the field of investment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Chile has always been China's major trade partner in
Latin America and the two sides saw rapid growth in bilateral
trade in recent years. However, he added, the present trade volume
is still not commensurate with their economic strength and there
are great potentials.
</P>
<P>
He said China hopes to expand economic and trade cooperation
with Latin America through Chile. The Chinese government
encourages Chinese enterprises to invest in Chile and welcomes
Chilean businessmen to expand economic and trade cooperation with
China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also proposed that more Chilean officials and businessmen
visit China to enhance understanding.
</P>
<P>
President Frei met with the chinese vice premier earlier
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here Monday from Argentina and left here Thursday
evening for Uruguay. He will also visit Germany.

break the psychological stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Local currency traders said that the Australian dollar passed a
major milestone today as it broke through the 80 yen level.
</P>
<P>
They expected the Australian dollar to rise to 83.5 yen in the
next three months and to 84.5 yen in a longer term.
</P>
<P>
If the Australian dollar reaches 84.5 yen, it will be a 43.7
percent rise over its low of 58.8 yen on May 29, 1995.
</P>
<P>
A firmer US dollar against the Japanese yen and surging gold
prices were major factors for the rise of the Australian dollar.

The local currency ended at 75.23 US cents from 74.57 US cents
Thursday.

<P>
It was also firmer against the German mark, ending at 1.1203

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Production Shows Rapid Increase in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Offshore oil production in
China is entering a new phase with crude output growing at an
annual rate of 30 percent, or one million tons.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative estimates put offshore oil and gas output this
year at 13 million tons and 3.15 billion cu m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bigger achievements are expected in the next five years, which
are expected to be a "golden period" for the country's offshore
oil production. Predictions are that 54 million tons of crude and
26 billion cu m of gas will be produced during that period.
</P>
<P>
According to an executive with the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC), China has 17 offshore oil and gas fields
operating in the waters of the Bohai Sea, Yingge Sea and Beibu
Gulf, five of which started in the past few months, which produced
9 million tons of crude and 400 million cu m of gas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
After trial production period, the oil and gas fields began a
massive production campaign, the CNOOC executive told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
To boost oil production, he said, China will make another 10
offshore oil and gas fields operational during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), in the Bohai Sea and South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, China will invest 26 billion yuan in the
next five years in 23 offshore oil platforms, 500-km-long
submarine pipelines, five onshore oil terminals, and 240 offshore
oil wells.
</P>
<P>
Utilization of offshore oil and gas will also be increased,
with construction work on an 8-million-ton refinery project, a
450,000-ton ethylene project, and a 2.5-million-ton urea project
that will use the gas resources.
</P>
<P>
According to authoritative sources here, China's offshore oil
production has benefitted both the Chinese and foreign sides, and
the sector is rapidly developing into a comprehensive industry
that involves exploration, drilling, production, processing, and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the 13 years since its inauguration,
the CNOOC has increased total asset value from 1.7 billion yuan in
1983 to a noteworthy 32.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The reliable sources said that by the year 2000, China will be
able to pay off all its loans, and, even after production costs
are deducted and creditors paid, its offshore oil sector is
expected to have a net income of 4.5 billion U.S. dollars by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that the country's offshore oil production
has been benefitted greatly from Sino-foreign cooperation. Almost
all of the world-famous multinational oil companies, such as
Exxon, Shell, BP, Amoco, Chevron, Arco, and those from Italy,
Canada, Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have taken
part in the country's offshore oil exploration. A large group of
medium- and small-sized oil companies are coming in as well to
join the effort.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, China had 110 offshore oil contracts
with 62 oil companies from 16 countries and regions, drawing a
total foreign investment of 5.12 billion U.S. dollars, or 58
percent of the total input in the offshore oil sector of 8 billion
U.S. dollars from both Chinese and foreign sides.
</P>
<P>
Through Sino-foreign cooperation, China has found a total of
1.25 billion tons and 235 billion cu m of proven offshore oil and
gas reserves, and has sunk 363 wells and discovered 88 oil-and
gas-bearing structures in those areas.

<HEADLINE> River Basin Development Paid Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The eight-year comprehensive
agricultural development on the plain between Yellow, Huaihe and
Haihe rivers has achieved remarkable economic results.
</P>
<P>
The plain, with 20 millin ha of arable farmland, or 18 percent
of China's total, is one of the country's major suppliers of farm
and animal husbandry products. Nevertheless, 80 percent of its
farmland is low or relatively-low yielding because of floods and
poor soil and irrigation conditions.
</P>
<P>
Anhui, one of the five provinces on the plain, has thrown in
200 million workdays and invested 2.13 billion yuan in improving
600,000 ha of low-yielding farmland and bringing water to 390,000
ha of arid land, Deputy Governor Wang Zhaoyao said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province's annual grain output rose by more
than 500 million kg last year over the previous year despite a
prolonged drought in the winter-spring period.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the first two-phase construction helped to raise
its grain output by 1.25 million tons, cotton by 22,300 tons,
edible vegetable oil by 42,000 tons and meat by 69,700 tons.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output value of the plain area totaled 2.8
billion yuan, representing a 16.3-percent increase. And local
farmers' annual net income averaged 1,000 yuan per capita, one
fifth more than the figure for other areas in the province.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor revealed that his province is to invest 3.6
billion yuan in the plain's agricultural development in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 ha of medium or low-yield farmland are expected to
be improved in the 1996-98 period and the figure will rise
hopefully to 1.5 million ha by the year 2000. Grain output
harvested from the plain will reach 1.25 billion kg by then.

<HEADLINE> China, Chile to Further Economic Cooperation: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji said Wednesday that China and Chile should work hard to
develop their cooperation in trade, economy and technology so as
to bring about a constant development in their over-all relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the statement in an address here before more than 100
people including senior government officials and people from the
business sector at the invitation of the Pacific Foundation of
Chile.
</P>
<P>
The speech dealt with China's economic and trade relations with
Latin America, and Chile in particular. Zhu said the economies of
China and Chile are mutually complementary, and economic and
technological cooperation between them has already had a good
start.
</P>
<P>
While China needs products such as copper, fish meal, timber
and paper pulp from Chile, China's textile products, home
appliances and other consumer goods are welcomed in Chile, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Chile have experienced similar
situations in developing economy in recent years despite their
different national conditions.
</P>
<P>
While Chile successfully achieved sustained and stable economic
growth over the past 10 years and more, China has also succeeded
in maintaining a sustained, stable and speedy growth in its
productive forces, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
When Chile increased its export worth about half of its gross
national product through reform and opening policies, China's
foreign trade volume reached 280 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 as a
result of major reforms in finance, banking, foreign trade and
foreign exchange market, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China had absorbed some 130
billion dollars of foreign investment by the end of 1995 since it
adopted open policy for the outside world in 1979. China's foreign
reserves in 1995 amounted to 75 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
China and Chile have much experience to share in reform,
economic construction and macro-control, Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
On China's relations with Latin American countries, Zhu said
promoting China's friendly cooperation with these countries is an
important part of south-south cooperation and a historical mission
as well.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and his delegation left here for Uruguay this evening.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit in Chile, Zhu visited a sea port, a
wine brewery and a copper mine.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang, northeast China's
agricultural giant, reported a sharp increase in grain production
with output climbing to 25 million tons by 1995.
</P>
<P>
A local agricultural official said the success is due mostly to
investment in agriculture and the popularization of modern
agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
He said that the amount of funds used in agriculture increased
by 31 percent, reaching 10.5 billion yuan last year. Over 85
percent of the funds were raised by farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Investment in major production materials such as chemical
fertilizer and plastic sheet has increased with each passing year.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor was a widespread campaign to increase
knowledge of new techniques which has helped to raise per hectare
output of maize to six tons, double 1990's figure.

<HEADLINE> Manila Withstands Impact of Mexican Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy withstood
the impact of the Mexican financial crisis and the Barings fiasco
that shook the world in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite the super typhoons, the droughts and the rice crisis,
the country's gross national product (GNP) rose to 5.7 percent
last year from the previous year's 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA), the year 1995 was a triumph of correct politics and
political will over diversities and natural phenomena.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percent growth in the total national spending on goods
and series indicated a growing confidence on the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the NEDA noted that the economy would have done better
had it not been for various factors.
</P>
<P>
Due to dry spells in Mindanao and the Visayas and the
destructive typhoons that hit the country, the agriculture,
fishery and forestry sectors grew by only 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
But industrial production registered a 7.3 percent increase in
1995 from 5.8 percent in 1994, owing to strong domestic demand and
impressive export performance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GNP went up to 4.8 percent in 1995 as against
4.4 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The NEDA said that the structural reform measures so far
implemented by the government has translated into strong domestic
production in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The remittances of Filipinos abroad worth 22.7 billion pesos
(908 million US dollars), an increase of 40.1 percent over the
previous year, contributed much to last year's growth.
</P>
<P>
The government is projecting a 6.5 percent to seven percent GNP
growth in 1996.

<HEADLINE> HK to Introduce Dangerous Dogs Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will introduce a
new regulation to impose greater controls on dangerous and
potentially dangerous dogs.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department said
that the objective of introducing the Dangerous Dogs Regulation
was to safeguard the general community from being attacked by
dogs.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been a public appeal for strengthening
control over dangerous or bigger breeds of dogs following a number
of serious dog bites in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the existing provisions are considered to be
inadequate to regulate the breeding, sale, keeping and control of
fighting and other dangerous dogs.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the proposed major provisions in
the regulation include:
</P>
<P>
-- Classify dangerous dogs into three categories: "fighting
breeds", "known dangerous dogs" and "potentially dangerous dogs";
</P>
<P>
-- Prohibit the importation and breeding of dogs belonging to
the "fighting breeds";
</P>
<P>
-- Require the keepers of "fighting breeds" and "known
dangerous dogs" to have those animals neutered, to be covered by
indemnity insurance and to ensure that the animals are identified
by a distinctive collar and on a leash and muzzled whenever they
are taken into a public place;
</P>
<P>
-- Require "potentially dangerous dogs" to be kept on a leash
and muzzled whenever they are taken into a public place;
</P>
<P>
-- Provide power for the director of Agriculture and Fisheries
to detain any dog that is dangerous until completion of procedures
and to issue written instructions.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Vows Again Not to Hold Talks With S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea(DPRK) has vowed not to hold talks with South
Korea again, the newspaper Rodong Sinmun reports today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Rodong Sinmun accused the joint communique issued
by the United States, Japan and South Korea of interfering with
the internal affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, issued at a tri-partite meeting in Hawaii
in January, requires Pyongyang to open talks with the outside
world and to resume its disrupted talks with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also noted that the DPRK, not intending to refuse
any chance of talks thoughtlessly, is willing to hold talks with
the outside world, carry out open-door policies and develop
relations with foreign countries, but only on condition that its
national interest is protected.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Seoul for plotting with foreign forces to choke the
DPRK to death, the paper ruled out the possibility of the country
opening talks with Kim Young-Sam's administration and called on
the United States and Japan to abandon their hostile attitude to
DPRK and retreat from alliance with Seoul.

<P>
TOKYO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- World co-number one Monica Seles
suffered a surprise defeat by Iva Majoli of Croatia in the
quarter-finals of the Pan Pacific Open women's tennis tourney here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The American, who had just won the Australian Open, saved two
match points before bowing to her 18-year-old opponent 6-1, 6-7
(5-7) and 4-6.
</P>
<P>
This was Seles' earliest exit in a tournament since April 1993,
when she was stabbed in the back by a fervent fan of Steffi Graf
in the quarter-final of a Hamburg meet.
</P>
<P>
She was out of professional circuit for 28 months before
returning to the major tournaments late last year.
</P>
<P>
Majoli's victory was her first ever against Seles. The
Croatian had won only seven games in their previous two clashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, Feruary 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese food company in the
capital of Liaoning Province has been found guilty of illegally
using the trademark and package design of a foreign-funded company.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Yangguang (sunlight) Food Co. Ltd. has, since
1994, intentionally used a name and package similar to that of the
Beltek (Huizhou) Food Co. Ltd., established by Beltek of the
United States via its Hong Kong subsidiary, for its noodle
packages.
</P>
<P>
Beltek (Huizhou) has become the largest American-funded food
company in Guangdong Province. Its parent company, Beltek (Hong
Kong), filed a complaint with the Shenyang City Administration for
Commerce and Industry in the second half of last year, saying that
many customers could not recognize the difference between its
products from those of Shenyang Yangguang.
</P>
<P>
After a three-month investigation, the administration ruled
that Shenyang Yangguang had violated the Unfair Competition Law,
and ruled that Yangguang must stop using the name US California
Nutritious Noodles and packaging similar to Beltek's.
</P>
<P>
It also ordered the company to destroy any remaining packages.
</P>
<P>
Yangguang Company has promised to stop its property rights
infringement and to publish a notice of apology in the local media.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Gets Good Results In Grain Marketing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
saving at least 500 million Zimbabwe dollars (55 million US
dollars) annually thanks to a major grain marketing reform.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that urban-based hammer millers had increased
by 50 percent in number during the period of between 1993 and
June 1994, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is also 30 percent cheaper for people to go to hammer
millers than buy roller meal from supermarkets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official as saying that in addition to
money savings, the reform had also created job opportunities and
confidence in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In the reform, which started in 1991, state-owned Grain
Marketing Board's marketing monopoly has been scrapped. The
government has lifted restrictions on the movement of grain
between communal and commercial areas. Small-scale traders can
now buy and sell grain freely without being forced to do all
transactions through the Grain Marketing Board. enditem

CHANGCHUN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin
Province plans to invest 11 billion yuan (about 1.3 billion US

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Thanks PNG for Helping Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
thanked the Papua New Guinean government for helping secure the
release of two Indonesian high school students who had been taken
across the border to Papua New Guinea and held hostages there.
</P>
<P>
The students were held hostages from November 22, 1995 to
January 29, 1996 in the Papua New Guinea province of Sandaun near
the two countries' border, according to a press statement received
here today issued by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two Indonesian students had been abducted by the Free Papua
Movement (OPM) in Irian Jaya on their way home after school and
then were taken across the border to Papua New Guinea. The OPM
abductors demanded ransom for their release from the Indonesian
government which flatly refused the OPM's demand.
</P>
<P>
Then the Indonesian government asked the help of PNG for the
release of the two students.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government would like to express its gratitude
and highest respect to the PNG government which has handed over
the two hostages to the Indonesian Consulate in Vanimo on January
31," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia appealed to PNG to help free more
Indonesians and foreigners still abducted by OPM. It is believed
that the 13 hostages of Indonesians and foreigners may be hiding
somewhere near the two countries' common border and that their
fate is unknown since their abduction by OPM on January 8.
</P>
<P>
The OPM members have been waging low-level warfare since Irian
Jaya became part of Indonesia in 1963. The OPM demanded a
Jakarta-recognition of a West Papua state in the present Irian
Jaya province, something the Indonesian authorities have firmly
rejected.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic development can never
be allowed to be achieved at the cost of the environment, Chen
Mingyi, governor of east China's Fujian Province has told local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection must always be taken into
consideration in the overall work, the governor said at a recent
provincial conference, noting that a local administrator should be
responsible not only for local economic development but also for
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that equal importance must be given to economic
development and environmental protection, and stressed that
enterprises and projects which cause pollution cannot be placed
upwind from cities, or on the upper reaches of rivers, in densely
populated areas, in nature reserves, or in environment-sensitive
areas.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to technology-intensive industries
with high economic returns, which have little industrial waste and
save energy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded projects must be in strict accordance with state
industrial policies and environmental laws and rules.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mingyi emphasized the symmetry of urban construction and
environmental construction. Construction projects must pass
environmental department inspections and environmental facilities
must be considered an important part of the urban
infrastructure. Industries causing heavy pollution must be
gradually relocated and noise, gas, and sewage treatment
facilities must be improved, he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Train Crash in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A freight train carrying
hazardous chemicals jumped tracks and exploded in western U.S.
today, killing two crew members and injuring 20 others.
</P>
<P>
The train's four locomotives and 46 of its 49 cars, including
five tankers containing hazardous chemicals, derailed on the steep
hill of Cajon Pass in a sparsely populated area in California
shortly after 4 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three crew members were killed, but the engineer was
pulled out alive from the window of an overturned locomotive by a
witness living nearby. The engineer suffered back injury.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other injured were police officers and officials
who inhaled the fumes spewed by the burning chemicals. They,
complaining of chest pains, shortness of breath and skin rashes,
were sent to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crew identified the hazardous chemicals as trimethyl
phosphite, methyl ethyl ketone and butyl acrylite, all highly
flammable and their fumes can burn skin or irritate eyes, noses
and throats if inhaled.
</P>

<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A key suspect in the bomb
blast in Sri Lanka's Central Bank on Wednesday was arrested at a
check point in Vavuniya as he was trying to escape to the rebels'
hideout in the north, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The suspect is reported to have helped the suicide bomber squad
in making arrangements in Colombo two days before the blast.
</P>
<P>
He had introduced them to the manager of a Colombo vehicle park
which enabled them to park the vehicle loaded with explosives and
bags of rice.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police were able to arrest two others as they fled from
the scene of the incident for two days.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Food Summit to Be Held to Solve Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Around 750 million people
worldwide will suffer from hunger and malnutrition by the year
2010 if governments and the international community do not pay
enough attention to the problem of food insecurity, a U.N.
official warned today.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Diouf, secretary-general of the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), told a news conference that a World Food
Summit will be held on November 13-17 in Rome at the FAO
headquarters to find ways to eradicate world hunger.
</P>
<P>
Diouf pointed out that the goals of hunger eradication, food
insecurity and malnutrition within a decade, which was set out in
the 1974 World Food Conference in Rome, were not achieved,
although great progress has been made in developing agriculture
and increasing grain production over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that 800 million people, or some 20 percent
of the world's total, are still threatened by hunger and
malnutrition in an era when we are going to the moon and are
sending up space shuttles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said the world grain output has to be increased by 75
percent in the coming 30 years in order to meet the demand of the
world population that is estimated to climb to 9 billion by 2030
from the current 5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the World Food Summit is to guarantee "food for all"
and call for governments' attention to food insecurity problem and
to coordinate the efforts of governments worldwide, Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO calculation, some 800 million people,
including 200 million children, are undernourished in the
world. And one-fifth of people in developing countries, and
two-fifths of people in Africa south of the Sahara Desert, are
suffering from hunger each day.
</P>
<P>
FAO statistics showed that the world grain output, which has
been declining for three years running, was estimated at 1.891
billion tons in 1995, down 3 percent from that in 1994 due to poor
crops in the United States and the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world food prices have risen as much as 30 to 50
percent in the past year, mainly because of the rising cost of
cereals.
</P>
<P>
The higher prices meant that developing countries in 1995-1996
will have to pay a total of 3 billion U.S. dollars more than in
the past to feed their growing population.
</P>
<P>
Diouf hoped the summit, to be attended by heads of state of all
174 member nations, will become a milestone in solving world food
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The summit was proposed by the FAO's secretary-general in 1994
and approved at a World Food Security Ministerial Session in
October, 1995 in Rome.

<P>
Colombo, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Rescue operations continued
for the third day in Sri Lanka's central bank bomb blast site and
12 more mutilated bodies were unearthed from the debris, official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The official tally of the dead is now 72 while those injured
stands at 1,272. However, unofficial figures go much higher to
over 100 dead and nearly 2,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of many persons still lying under the debris is
not ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Additionally several injured persons sought and obtained
medical assistance at several private hospitals in preference to
the overcrowded government hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The blast, conducted by Tamil rebels fighting a 13 year war for
a separate state, has disrupted banking and financial operations
in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank at which the bomb was directed has announced
the suspension of banking operations till February 6. It has also
requested banks to restrict operations till things return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Stock Exchange whose building was also affected by
the blast has resumed operations but reported a marked decline in
business.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today welcomed French President Jacques Chirac's proposals for a
new and stronger partnership between the United States and
European allies as well as for reforming the Western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his talks with Chirac at the White
House, Clinton said that this is the time for the world's great
powers to "reach out, not retreat" to fight against problems
like "terrorism, international organized crime, and drugs."
</P>
<P>
"The extraordinary opportunities we enjoy to shape a safer and
more prosperous future for our people can be realized only if we
stay engaged and if we work together," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO is a cornerstone "to meet the challenges
of this new era," and appreciated "the French effort to bring a
stronger European defense identity within NATO.
</P>
<P>
"This will allow our European allies to deal more effectively
with further security problems and spread the costs and risks of
our leadership for peace while preserving the basic structure of
NATO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a two-day state
visit, the first by a French president in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had "a very good discussion" with Chirac
on a number of international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said, "The Franco-American partnership
extends well beyond NATO and indeed well beyond Europe."
</P>
<P>
Clinton especially thanked France's "long and consistent
leadership" in seeking a peaceful settlement to the 43-month
bloody conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States and France are determined to
carry through the peace mission in the former Yugoslav republic
although the U.S.-led NATO peace implementation force (IFOR) are
facing many tough problems there.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali tourism industry
welcomed the recent agreement between Nepal and India to allow
private airlines of both countries to operate in each other's
territory.
</P>
<P>
An hotel industry organization said in a press release today
that the agreement reached last week during Indian Minister for
External Affairs Prank Mukerjee's visit to Nepal would contribute
to boosting tourism especially in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
1995 statistics show that Indian tourists constitute around 36
percent of the total tourists entering Nepal by air.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of the increase in the number of Indian
tourists is quite bright provided that the air seat capacity
between Nepal and India is also increased, the press release of
the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier statistics revealed that nearly 57 percent of the
tourists came to Nepal via India and the initiation of private
air services between the two countries would immensely benefit the
tourism industry in Nepal, the HAN said.

BONN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said today he was satisfied with the operation of the
NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia so far.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking alongside German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
at the start of a three-day visit to Germany to discuss NATO's
peace operation in Bosnia, the organization's expansion eastward
and its relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Solana said he was very impressed with what has been achieved
so far in Bosnia since the NATO operation there was very
complicated.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief stressed the fact that Saturday, the 45th day of
the deployment of troops in the war-torn country, would see the
implementation as scheduled of the 51-49 percent territorial
division of Bosnia-Hercegovina between the Croat-Moslem federation
and the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Greece and Turkey, who are in dispute over an
Aegean islet, for giving the impression of a quarrel within NATO
when the organization was engaged in the biggest ever peace
operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During talks with German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, Solana
expressed thanks for Germany's role in the NATO operation.
</P>

HELSINKI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Finland is launching a drive
to reduce white-collar crime which is costing the country billions
of dollars, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under a new program adopted by the Finnish government today,
the country will provide more funds to beef up police, tax and
customs offices to fight such crime, particularly misappropriation
of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relevant departments have been told to handle as
soon as possible the 2,000 unsolved cases relating to
white-collar, or economic, crimes.
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations concerning criminal offenses, bankruptcy
and holding companies are to be amended. Financial administration
rules will be strengthened and extended to allow stricter
supervision and control over bankruptcy and distribution of public
subsides.
</P>
<P>
The government said white-collar crime and economic
mal-practice not only cost the country an annual 27 billion
Finnish marks (about 6.4 billion U.S. dollars) but also increase
unemployment, damage market stability, distort competition and
corrupt moral values.

<HEADLINE> Australian Retail Sales Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia's retail trade sales
rose by 0.8 percent in December last year over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of retail trade sales surged to 10.089 billion
Australian dollars (7.567 billion US dollars) in December after
increasing 1.2 percent in November, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicated that the Australian economy is less
sluggish than local economists expected and the country is having
a revived chance of cutting interest rates before the March 2
federal election as domestic consumption kept growing strongly in
the past two months
</P>
<P>
Economists had predicted that retail trade growth would drop to
a modest 0.2 percent in December after the big surge in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
But today's retail trade figures exceeded the expectations of
most forecasters, even after taking into consideration of the
Christmas holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
It is a good news for the Labor Government who is keen to cut
interest rates before the election.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paul Keating has hinted in the election campaign
that the government might persuade the Reserve Bank to cut
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
A cut of interest rates has become more likely as the United
States eased its monetary policy this week.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, higher consumer demand may feed into
inflation pressures and make the Reserve Bank of Australia
unwilling to cut interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Host Seminar on Intellectual Property  Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will host the first
workshop on intellectual property rights for government officials
from the 18 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will focus all issues related to intellectual
property including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets
and unfair trade practices, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been a prime mover in encouraging Thailand to host
the seminar, Weerawit Weeraworawit, director of the Technical and
Planning Division of the Intellectual Property Department, was
quoted as saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Weerawit said, because Japan demands higher standards of
protection, initiatives taken in Thailand will benefit Japanese
investors, who will be assured of protection for their products.
</P>
<P>
The training program to be held in the second half of the year
will reduce the gap between developed and developing member
countries of APEC, he said.
</P>
<P>
All developed members of APEC must implement the Trade Related
to Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, but standards of
protection may vary in interpretation, given the wide scope of the
agreement, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members plan to discuss the agreement with European Union
officials, particularly with regard to industrial design which
involves both copyrights and patents.
</P>
<P>
Some countries feel industrial design should be protected under
copyright law, which would give the originator of a design 50
years of protection. Others argue for protection under the patent
law, which provides protection for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In either case officials say it is important to prevent
distorted interpretations of rights, otherwise owners of the
rights may unfairly monopolize benefits.

Some of the province's eight richest cities are being required

The wealthier cities began to aid poor areas early in 1990.
Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, provided 170
million yuan to Meizhou, one of the impoverished counties, and
launched 57 projects over the past five years. Zhuhai city, a
special economic zone that borders Macao, invested 120 million

<HEADLINE> Power Construction in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The upper reaches of the
Yellow River in northwest China saw an increase of more than 5.9
million kw in power generating capacity during the 1991-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
A large group of hydropower and thermal power stations, such as
Longyangxia and Dawukou, have been built there in the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
The energy development plan there called for more than 20 power
stations with generating capacity of over 300,000 kw each to be
built there in next few years.
</P>
<P>
This represents a power construction boom in five provinces and
autonomous regions in northwest China, and a huge power base is
taking shape in the area, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, for instance, increased its
total power generating capacity from 508,000 kw in 1984 to 1.63
million kw in 1995, a three-fold rise.
</P>
<P>
The Lijiaxia Power Station on the upper reaches of the Yellow
River, one of the state's key projects, has drawn a total
investment of five billion yuan and is expected to have a total
power generating capacity of two million kw.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that, after more than 30 years of
development, five major power stations with total installed
generating capacity of three million kw have appeared on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River, in the provinces of Qinghai and
Gansu, and in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, by the early years of next century,
the total hydropower generating capacity of the area is expected
to hit 15.2 million kw with annual electricity output reaching
55.7 billion kwh.

<HEADLINE> First Anniversary of Jiang's Speech on Taiwan Marked in  France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese community in France
held a meeting here today to mark the first anniversary of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's speech on the promotion of China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese people hope to see an early unification of China,
the attendants, who took the floor, said that in light of the
present conditions the best way to achieve this goal is to adhere
to the principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one country,
two systems."
</P>
<P>
They criticized the Taiwan authorities headed by Lee Teng-hui
for failing to respond positively to Jiang's speech and advocating
for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
They said Lee Teng-hui has been trying to draw foreign support
for his attempt to block China's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The participants emphasized that any attempt for Taiwan's
independence runs counter to the will of all the Chinese nation
and is firmly opposed by the Chinese community in France.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross: Tension Reduces in Chiapas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Red Cross
has scaled down its operations in the southeastern state of
Chiapas, Mexico, as tension in the area between peasants and the
government has diminished, a Red Cross official said today.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Zahand said that because of the improvement in the
situation, the Red Cross closed its office in the San Cristobal de
las Casas municipality last September.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the organization in Chiapas now is to help
victims of the earthquake that shook the region last October,
Zahand said.
</P>
<P>
But the Red Cross will maintain its presence through the
formation of safety belts during the peace negotiations between
the federal government and the National Liberation Zapatista Army
(EZLN).
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross entered Chiapas after an armed
uprising by peasants demanding democracy and lands in January
1994. More than 100 people were killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zahand said the International Red Cross will continue its
humanitarian assistance throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Zoologist Reveals Coral Reef Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- An Australian zoologist has
discovered a new way to understand the formation and destruction
of coral reefs around the world.
</P>
<P>
Alan Marshall of the School of Zoology of La Trobe University
in Melbourne said that there might be an unknown force behind the
formation of coral reefs, other than the widely believed effect of
coral-algae interactions.
</P>
<P>
It is traditionally believed that algae living in coral cells
help to accelerate the calcification process of polyps in the
formation of coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
But experiments carried out by Marshall showed that coral
polyps without algae in their cells calcify at the same rate as
those with algae.
</P>
<P>
This proved that coral is not relying on the algae to carry out
its calcification, instead, it is helping the algae by producing
the carbon dioxide it needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
His discovery has turned the traditional explanation of the
formation of coral reefs upside down.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are two types of coral in the world. One
has algae in it and the other does not. The traditional theory
was only based on the observation that calcification rate of the
first type of coral was faster during day time, when the algae
carried out photosynthesis. The process was much slower at night
when the algae's photosynthesis was not active.
</P>
<P>
The algae might be able to switch off the calcification process
of coral polyps at night, because it does not need much carbon
dioxide when its photosynthesis stops, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the traditional theory ignore what was going on in coral
cells without algae, he said.
</P>
<P>
"My speculation is that there must be other unknown factors
that controls the formation of coral reefs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have yet to explain why polyps, which are only four
cell layers thick, spend hundred of years to develop such a large
lime-stone skeleton. Coral reefs cover two million sq km of the
global surface. The biggest one, the Great Barrier Reef in
Australia, extends 2,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Another mystery is "coral bleaching," which is widespread in
equatorial tropics. Coral bleaching happens when sea temperature
rises, with coral expelling the algae from its body. After the
algae is driven off, the coral dies.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that global warming may be responsible
for coral bleaching.
</P>
<P>
Marshall's discovery will help to explain these mysteries by
looking the process of coral reef development in a different way.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Asks U.S. To Deliver Paramilitary Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Haitian President Jean
Bertrand Aristide today demanded the U.S. government hand over
all the documents it seized from a Haitian paramilitary group
accused of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing president rejected a "partial" return of the
archives of the Front for Haiti's Advancement and Progress
(FRAPH), now held in the U.S. Embassy in the capital of
this Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
The Haitian president said his government "will not accept the
absence of documents. Total restitution of the paramilitary
group's archives is necessary."
</P>
<P>
Haiti wants the documents because they could provide evidence
of abuses committed by the FRAPH and help prosecute suspected
human rights violators.
</P>
<P>
In September 1994, U.S. military forces confiscated the
archives of the FRAPH, which maintained close contacts with the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), according to Haitian and
U.S. reports.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary group allegedly carried out serious
human rights violations during the military regime of former
general Raoul Cedras who was ousted by U.S. troops in 1994 after
three years in power.
</P>
<P>
But, sources here say, the U.S. government will return only
about half of the documents in the FRAPH archives to withhold
evidence linking the CIA with the Duvalierist paramilitary,
supporters of former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.
</P>
<P>
The archives confiscated by the U.S. government include
photographs, audio and video tapes and papers.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Leader Resignation Case Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The controversy over the
withdrawal of the resignation of Nicaragua's top magistrate is
over, National Assembly President Cairo Manuel Lopez said today.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers protested that Fiallos' withdrawal of his
January 26 resignation four days later was unconstitutional,
saying a replacement should have been appointed immediately after
he stepped down.
</P>
<P>
But on television today, Lopez said, "Supreme Electoral
Council President Mariano Fiallos never ceased to be a magistrate
and the president of the council."
</P>
<P>
The assembly president said the problem was solved on January
30 with Fiallos' withdrawal "because the resignation was never
considered" by the Supreme Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
Fiallos offered his resignation to the assembly on January 26,
because of disagreement over the contents of a new electoral law.
</P>
<P>
After several days of negotiations and at the request of the
Supreme Electoral Council, Fiallos delivered another
letter to the assembly on Tuesday withdrawing his resignation,
arousing the criticism of several deputies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Adolfo Garcia Esquivel said the matter had exposed
parliament to derision. According to assembly regulations, in the
case of the irrevocable resignation of the president of the
Supreme Electoral Council, the Supreme Court, or the comptroller
of the Republic, a replacement must be appointed immediately.
</P>
<P>
He accused Fiallos of breaking several rules of the Penal Code
- usurping his functions, abuse of authority, disobedience and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Edmundo Castillo said it was a dereliction of duty for
the National Assembly Directive Board not to appoint a new Supreme
Electoral Council president and to return the resignation letter
to Fiallos.
</P>
<P>
The action had set a bad precedent, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Assembly President Lopez rebuked Castillo, saying that if a
person resigns and then withdraws his resignation, "we cannot
force that person to abide by his first decision."
</P>
<P>
"It is the free will of a person and the independence of his
will to present a resignation and to recall it later, and in this
case this situation is over for us," said Lopez.

<HEADLINE> Maccanico Asked to Form New Italian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro this afternoon asked Antonio Maccanico, a veteran
politician and constitutional expert, to form the nation's 55th
post-war government.
</P>
<P>
Maccanico, 71, agreed to try to form the new government and
pledged to work to create a government that enjoys the "solid,
serious, (and) broad" support of parliamentary parties to pass
various political reforms.
</P>
<P>
If Maccanico manages to put together a government to replace
that of Lamberto Dini, who resigned on January 11, Italy will
avoid -- at least for now -- elections three years ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The president made the decision following three rounds
of talks with major political leaders in a bid to end the three
weeks of inter-party wrangling over reforms. Scalfaro described
his decision as an important step in solving the nation's pressing
political problems.
</P>
<P>
The main issue to be worked out is how to strengthen Italy's
leadership and bring stability to the political system and the
government of Italy, which currently holds the rotating presidency
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Maccanico, who was born in Avellino near Naples, had served as
the top bureaucrat in the offices of the president and premier and
also as chairman of the powerful Mediobanca investment bank.
</P>
<P>
He was also minister of regional affairs and institutional
reform from 1988-1991, and served briefly in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Maccanico's predecessor, Dini, has been serving as caretaker
premier since stepping aside on January 11 as head of a
"technocrat" government.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Mixture Leaks From Russian Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A small amount of radioactive
steam mixed with gas leaked from a nuclear reactor in the central
Russian city of Dmitrovgrad Wednesday, causing little damage and
constituting no threat to the environment, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
About one tonne of the mixture spurted out from the BK-50
reactor at a scientific institute when a safety valve on the
reactor blew to release the high pressure caused by the sudden
failure of the turbine, experts close to the incident said.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the accident is classed as the lowest-degree
leakage and the contamination is confined only to a small area of
200 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The leakage was quickly stopped and the research work had
already returned to normal, they added.
</P>
<P>
The BK-reactor, built in 1965, is the only one of its kind in
Russia although it is also used in other countries.

<HEADLINE> EC not to Strike Gentleman's Agreement with UEFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Thursday that it will not ink any gentleman's agreement with
Europe's soccer govering body UEFA on the free transfer of players.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, European Union employment commissioner, said he
had informed UEFA that the latter must abide by the ruling of the
European Court of Justice for total freedom of movement for
European nationals.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, the Court of Justice ruled in the case of
Belgian footer Jean-Marc Bosman that European clubs must allow
free transfer of players and not to charge fees for
out-of-contract players.
</P>
<P>
However, UEFA was not eager to change its current "3+2" rule
which limits teams to field a maximum of three foreign players and
two "assimilated" players" in European competitions until the end
of the season.
</P>
<P>
On January 19, EC gave a deadline of six weeks for UEFA to
either comply with the transfer ruling or to face punishment.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Financial Institutions Thriving in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1995 a total of
38 foreign-funded financial institutions had been set up in this
financial hub of China, according to statistics released by the
Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Their assets surged by 93 percent to 9.032 billion US dollars,
and their loans in foreign exchange doubled to 6.011 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year their deposits and loans in foreign
exchange accounted for 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively, of
the total in Shanghai, and they handled more than 30 percent of
local foreign trade settlements.
</P>
<P>
These institutions dramatically expanded their loan offerings,
which carry higher risks, while steadily handling settlements with
fewer risks, experts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that they have stronger confidence in developing
their businesses in Shanghai," said one expert.
</P>
<P>
A positive attitude and a favorable investment environment have
helped 74.3 percent of the institutions to make profits.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai saw the opening of 33 more representative
offices of foreign financial institutions, the most for any single
year, bringing the total to 119.
</P>
<P>
The operational foreign financial institutions in Shanghai
represent 27.7 percent of the total in China, and the number of
representative offices of foreign financial institutions in
Shanghai account for 23 percent of the total in the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November Shanghai had 43 percent of the assets,
45 percent of the loans in foreign exchange, 40 percent of the
deposits in foreign exchange and 24 percent of the profits of the
foreign financial institutions in China.
</P>
<P>
More foreign financial institutions are showing interest in
Shanghai. The central bank is now handling applications to set up
branches in Shanghai from two banks from the Republic of Korea and
Italy, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that foreign financial institutions will
play a more important role in Shanghai, which is building itself
into an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has allowed foreign financial institutions to
operate in 24 coastal and hinterland cities.

spots en route.
</P>
<P>
Hyllner said she came across the idea in a night in March, and
has prepared for the journey both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
"It can be pretty rough. Big temperature changes, bicycle
problems, illnesses and even attacks. A lot depends on how you
behave. You have to remember that you are a guest in a foreign
country, and to respect that country's customs," she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stresses Need for Rapid Progress in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today stressed the need for "rapid progress" toward all-party
political talks for an earlier settlement in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his national security adviser Anthony Lake met with
visiting Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams at the White House and
discussed the latest proposal by British Prime Minister John Major
for elections ahead of the talks, a spokesman for the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
"The president underscored the need for rapid progress to
all-party talks," spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters after the
meeting. "He encouraged all parties to remain committed to the
search for peace and determined in its pursuit."
</P>
<P>
But Adams, whose group represents the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, told the reporters that he was "not at all"
pressured by the White House to accept Major's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Major put forward his proposal after an international
commission led by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell recommended
that all political parties in the region renounce violence and
disarm in stages once the political talks for lasting peace have
embarked on its way.
</P>
<P>
Adams immediately issued a statement, welcoming the
international body's proposal. But the British government has been
insisting that Sinn Fein could not be allowed to take part in the
all-party talks unless IRA first give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Adams said, "Everyone has to be flexible in terms of moving the
situation forward, but John Major is the person who still hods the
key, and he had to be encouraged, persuaded, to turn that key."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which helped broker the peace
process in Northern Ireland in 1994, has called the Major's
elections proposal a possible way to get to all-party talks. But
it says U.S. officials would not instruct the parties in the
region how they should proceed.

BONN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Frans Botha, IBF heavyweight
champion of South Africa, may be suspended from bouts in Germany
after his positive test for steriods, German boxing official said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Botha was tested positive after his IBF fight with German Axel
Schulz on December 9 in Cologne, and a second sample also came
back positive from Los Angeles last week.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the German boxing federation (BDB) will prevent the South
African from the bouts in the country, said BDB president Alois
Teuber.
</P>
<P>
However, Teuber said his organization will give one more chance
for Botha to prove his innocence at an International Boxing
Federation hearing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Olympic rule, Botha may be punished for a
maximum ban of four years, Teuber said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Prince Supports Oil-for-food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest oil producer, said on Thursday it supports
Resolution 986 of the U.N. Security Council which allows Iraq to
sell a limited amount of oil for food.
</P>
<P>
Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the
United States announced his country's support during his meeting
with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
He said Saudi Arabia was in favor of its implementation with a
view to alleviating the increasing suffering of the Iraqi peoples.
</P>
<P>
But the prince cautioned that the plan was implemented strictly
and that any oil sold would be at fair market prices.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that oil prices had been stumbling on prospects
that Iraq might once again begin selling oil on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was banned from selling oil on international markets after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A meeting will be held next week to discuss implementing U.N.
council Resolution 986, which would allow Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars of oil over six months under strict U.N. monitoring
to pay for food and medical supplies.

<HEADLINE> New York Police to Clear Drug Business in 2 Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- New York City police will put
1,000 cops to Brooklyn and Queens boroughs beginning from April 1
to drive drug business out of the regions.
</P>
<P>
The operation will flood the hard-hit areas with 750 narcotics
investigators, 300 undercover cops and a strong contingent of
patrol officers, a local media report revealed.
</P>
<P>
Northern Brooklyn accounts for about 25 percent of violent
crimes citywide, making neighborhoods a battleground of natural
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Commanders promised the six-month operation can expand beyond
the initial target areas to prevent drug dealers from simply
taking their business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, a pilot operation started in the
heroin-saturated areas of Manhattan's lower east side.

representative and coordinator of United Nations operations in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. He will leave for Sarajevo over the

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher, Dollar Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average, the major indicator of blue chips on the New York Stock
Exchange, climbed over 5,400 mark to finish at 5,404.30 today, as
investors continued to react to Wednesday's cut in short-term
interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9 points at the close.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weakening in blue chips for most of the session,
advancing issues led decliners by about 6 to 5. Volume was
moderately heavy at more than 400 million shares, but down from
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
Broad indexes rose, largely because of strength in the
technology issues.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve trimmed short-term rates by
0.25 percentage point. Bond investors took the easing as a signal
that inflation is not a problem. Stocks rose, especially in the
cyclical sectors, as investors assumed that rate cuts would
continue, and that they would restimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
At the New York Foreign Exchange today, the U.S. dollar fell
against leading currencies after slumping Treasury bond prices.
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m. the dollar was trading at 1.4875 German marks,
compared with 1.4891 on Wednesday. It finished at 106.75 Japanese
yen, compared with 107.04 the day before.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has marched steadily higher against the mark, yen
and other currencies over the past several months on the strength
of the U.S. economy compared with those of other nations.
</P>
<P>
That initially helped push the dollar higher, as did early
gains in bond prices.

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Rewrite of Telecommunications Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House today
approved the rewrite of telecommunications law by a vote of
414-16, which was expected to break up monopolies in local
telephone and cable television service.
</P>
<P>
The bill was also being debated simultaneously in the Senate,
and President Clinton was expected to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have broken up two of the biggest government
monopolies," said the bill's primary author in the House, Thomas
Bliley. "For the first time ever, Americans will be given choices.
Besides lower rates and better service, the result will be
innovative new products and services that will create thousands of
new American jobs."
</P>
<P>
If the Senate and President Clinton endorsed the bill, the
biggest rewrite of the 1935 Communications Act would let local and
long-distance telephone companies and cable companies into each
others' businesses, deregulate cable rates and restrict erotic
materials on computer networks and on television.
</P>
<P>
Supporters also said that the measure would expand consumer
choices and lower prices for cable, telephone, computer networks
and other communications services.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Denies Crimes Committed by Serb Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic said today he was absolutely sure that his policy did not
lead to war crimes and the Serb army did not commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I am completely certain that no crime whatsoever has been
committed on orders by any of the military commanders," Tanjug
news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, if some individuals did perform crimes, we are
prepared to investigate every such charge and bring the accused to
our national courts," the Serb leader said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "we have cooperate and will cooperate with
the Hague tribunal," and "even if crimes were committed during the
war, they had not been an expression of our policy, but they were
performed in a civil war, in the fighting of civilians, just as
vengeance taken for events in the Second World War."
</P>
<P>
The Hague international tribunal has suspected there were mass
graves in Serb-held territories near Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.
The Bosnian government has claimed 7,000 Muslim men were missing
when the Serb army occupied the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in
July, 1995. The Serb leadership has recently agreed to allow the
investigation of the suspected mass graves by international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic also said more than 50 mass graves were discovered
near Srebrenica in which many Serbs were killed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader said the Hague tribunal, although not being a
political body, is under pressure of the anti-Serb hysteria being
generated by western media. The hysteria should be stopped at
once, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Serbs were not satisfied with the Bosnia peace
agreement, "because our natural aspiration is to remain in
Yugoslavia, to join Yugoslavia, to join Serbia."
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, Bosnia is preserved as a single
state with two equal entities -- the Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation with almost equal division of the
territories between the two sides. The peace deal also calls for a
unified Sarajevo, which demands the Serbs hand over five Sarajevo
districts to government control, which is strongly against by the
Serb leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The Dayton agreement is a half-way solution for us, but we
hope that this will be solved peacefully in time and we shall
certainly be the side that cooperates. At all events, we shall not
use force," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Delegation Urges US to Reduce Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese delegation from
Okinawa has urged the United States to reduce the number and size
of its bases in the island, a U.S. newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Japan security agreements are making life "unbearable"
for citizens in Okinawa, the Washington Times quoted Chiken
Kakazu, head of the delegation of 14 legislators, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which began its tour in the United States
yesterday, is to lobby the administration and Congress for changes
in those agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We are making an appeal directly to the American people,"
Kakazu told reporters Wednesday, "please realign, reduce, relocate
or even close some of the bases not needed in the post-Cold War
era."
</P>
<P>
Kakazu also said his delegation's ultimate goal is to close all
U.S. bases in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 30,000 American troops are stationed in Okinawa
and seventy-five percent of all bases in Japan are in the island.
</P>
<P>
Japanese police said American servicemen have committed more
than 4,700 crimes on Okinawa since 1973 when the U.S. forces
relinquished authority over the island.
</P>
<P>
On September 4, 1995, three American servicemen in Okinawa
brutally beat and raped a 12-year-old Japanese school girl.
</P>
<P>
Kakazu said that Okinawan women and children are living in
fear.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Asks Turkey's Cooperation to Soften Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
Ibn Talal urged Turkey to join his country in launching a
two-fold initiative to lobby their Western allies for a relaxation
of sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his brief working visit to Ankara Wednesday, Prince
Hassan held talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
conveyed a message from King Hussein of Jordan to him.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials, who attended the meeting between President
Demirel and Prince Hassan, said today the crown prince told the
Turkish president that the attention of the world public opinion
should be drawn to the suffering of the Iraqi people under the
sanctions imposed on Iraq by the U.N. following its invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council in last April allowed Baghdad to sell
two billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to pay for
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claims that it loses one million dollars a day in
revenues since the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline, the main outlet for
the Iraqi oil, was closed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolution, a major part of the allowed Iraqi
oil should be exported through this pipeline, which would enable
Ankara to flush and save the pipeline as well.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Turkish official, Turkey and Jordan
agreed that the Western countries, particularly the United
States, should try to make a deal acceptable to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq opposed the allocation of part of the proposed oil
revenue to northern Iraqi Kurds. Neither does Baghdad accept any
U.N. interference on the route to export oil.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Jordan also took the opportunity to assure each
other on the importance they placed on the territorial integrity
of Iraq, the officials said.

UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged Niger to return to

</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general was aware of the appointment of a
civilian cabinet in Niger. However, he believes that such a
measure was not sufficient," Foa said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general expressed the hope that the
authorities in Niamey will spare no effort to restore the image
of a democratic Niger," she added.

LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria says that it will
protest the four-year ban imposed on her by the Confederation of
African Football (CAF) for Nigeria's pulling out of the on-going
African nations' cup in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Nigeria football association Emeka Omeruah
today gave this indication in a telephone conversation with the

</P>
<P>
CAF announced in Johannesburg today that Nigeria was banned
from participating in the next two African nations' cup
competitions scheduled for 1998 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, winner of the cup in 1980 and 1994, was also fined
54,750 rands (about 15,000 dollars) for withdrawing from the
biennial 16-nation tournament and would be required to pay
damages, consequent upon its withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
CAF, however, did not specify the amount that the damages
would attract.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian federal government, citing security concerns,
pulled the national football team Super Eagles out of the current

<HEADLINE> Funds Urged to Support Humanitarian Programs in Iraq </HEADLINE>

GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) Friday urged donor governments to
provide funding for continued humanitarian activities in Iraq,
where humanitarian conditions is further deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
According to a DHA press release issued today, DHA was joined
in its appeal by UN agencies including the UN Development Program
(UNDP), the office of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
the World Health Organization (WHO) and International
Organization for Migration (IOM).
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made during an informal consultation held here
last Thursday, which was attended by more than 10 UN agencies and
international humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
A report on the latest situation in Iraq submitted to the
meeting said that humanitarian conditions are worsening in Iraq,
especially in the central and southern regions where food aid and
health related requirements are rapidly increasing.
</P>
<P>
To the grave concern of the participants at the meeting last
Thursday, gap between the increased humanitarian needs among the
most vulnerable groups of the Iraqi population and the
international community's shrinking financial contributions is
increasingly widening.
</P>
<P>
DHA said in the press release that response has been limited to
a revised appeal requirement of 169.3 million U.S. dollars for the
humanitarian programs in Iraq. So far, only 72 million dollars,
less than half of the appeal are met.
